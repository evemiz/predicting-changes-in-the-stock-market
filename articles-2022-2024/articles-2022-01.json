            "content": "When Americans go to the polls in the 2022 midterms, the most important elections won\u2019t be for office in Washington. The most high-stakes races will be statewide contests, in some cases for long overlooked offices, that have profound consequences for the future of free and fair elections in America. The races for governor and secretary of state, the chief election official in many places, will determine which officials have control over setting election rules and the post-election certification process. Allies of Donald Trump and others who have spread baseless conspiracy theories about the election have launched campaigns for several of those offices, both at the statewide and local level, in an effort to take control of election machinery. Trump is expected to run for president in 2024, and if his allies are successful, there are fears they could use their positions to block Trump\u2019s opponent from taking office should Trump lose. Democrats are seeking to hold on to governor\u2019s offices in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, three crucial swing states. The Democratic incumbents in all three states have blocked efforts by GOP-led legislatures to enact voting restrictions so far. There will also be hotly contested elections in Arizona and Georgia, where Republican candidates who have spread lies about the results of the 2020 election are running for governor. Republicans who have embraced lies about the election are also running for secretary of state offices in Michigan, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Overlooked for years, there is now a broader awareness of the enormous power these secretaries of state wield over how elections are run and ballots are counted. That power was on unprecedented display in 2020, when secretaries of state made decisions about things like how to establish ballot drop boxes and whether to automatically send out mail-in ballot applications to voters. Secretaries of state wield enormous unilateral power and, if they were elected, election deniers could do extensive damage in future elections. \u201cIt feels like the future of democracy depends on our wins,\u201d said Jena Griswold, Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, who is chair of the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State. Few states better encapsulate the stakes for 2022 than Wisconsin. Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat seeking re-election, vetoed a suite of new voting restrictions in August, but Republicans are still chomping at the bit to overhaul the state\u2019s election system. Republicans have launched their own, widely criticized review of the 2020 election and are pushing to get rid of the bipartisan election commission that runs elections in the state. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican US senator, has called for the legislature to unilaterally take control of federal elections. Rebecca Kleefisch, a leading Republican candidate for governor, has said she would eliminate the agency if elected. She has also refused to say whether she supports legislation that would allow the Wisconsin legislature, where Republicans essentially hold a permanent majority because of gerrymandering, to overturn election results. Kleefisch\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. There\u2019s a similar dynamic in Michigan. After Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat seeking re-election, vetoed a package of new voting restrictions, Republicans moved aggressively to try to enact them around her veto. There\u2019s also a push to unseat Jocelyn Benson, Michigan\u2019s top election official, who became one of the most visible secretaries of state in 2020 when she took steps to make it easier to vote by mail. One of the leading candidates in the GOP field vying to replace Benson is Kristina Karamo, endorsed by Trump, who has claimed Antifa was responsible for the 6 January attack, accused Democrats and Republicans of being \u201ctraitors\u201d, and falsely said there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Karamo\u2019s campaign did not respond to an interview request. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not by accident that we\u2019re seeing individuals who don\u2019t believe in democracy aspire to be our state\u2019s\u2019 chief election officers, particularly in the states that were under the greatest spotlight in 2020,\u201d Benson said in an interview. \u201cObservers of democracy should be very concerned about what appears to be a coordinated effort to place people in positions of authority over elections who do not believe in elections and would have willingly overturned election results.\u201d Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf, a term-limited Democrat, also vetoed GOP-backed voting restrictions earlier this year. The GOP candidates running to replace him include Lou Barletta, a former congressman and close Trump ally who has supported the false claim that the election was stolen. Doug Mastriano, a state senator and Trump ally who is one of the most prominent advocates of the election fraud narrative, is also weighing a campaign. Mastriano was at the US capitol on 6 January, pushed baseless voter fraud claims to the justice department, and championed an unusual post-election review in Pennsylvania. In Arizona, Trump has endorsed Kari Lake, a former news anchor seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination who has called for \u201cdecertifying\u201d the 2020 election results, something that is not legally possible. Mark Finchem, a Republican state representative who attended the 6 January rally has called for \u201cdecertification\u201d of the election results as well. And in Georgia, Trump has endorsed former GOP senator David Perdue in a primary challenge to Republican governor Brian Kemp. Trump has fumed at Kemp, blaming him for not doing enough to overturn the election results last year. Perdue has said he would not have certified the 2020 election results, even after several recounts and audits showed no widespread fraud. The winner will face Stacey Abrams, who made defending voting rights a core issue in her 2018 gubernatorial campaign and has focused on it since. Republicans are also seeking to oust Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state who refused to find enough votes to overturn the election for Trump. Trump\u2019s pick to replace Raffensperger is Jody Hice, a GOP congressman who supported Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election. Griswold, who is also running for re-election in 2022, said that putting someone who doesn\u2019t believe in elections in charge of running them was akin to \u201cputting an arsonist in charge of the fire department\u201d. While she said she has been encouraged by a surge in interest among grassroots activists and some donors in secretary of state races, \u201cit is not enough\u201d. \u201cImagine on January 6 if you had secretaries of state, disregarding all fact, disregarding all law, saying the election was stolen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what may be coming.\u201d"

Chad Stark, a 54-year-old resident of Texas, was arrested by law enforcement after officials alleged he posted a message on Craigslist on 5 January 2021 saying that he wanted \u201cGeorgia Patriots\u201d to kill several election officials. \u201cGeorgia Patriots it\u2019s time for us to take back our state from these Lawless treasonous traitors.

He is expected to make his first appearance in an Austin, Texas, court on Friday afternoon. Stark\u2019s arrest marks the first criminal case brought by the interagency election threats taskforce. The unit was created in June 2021 under the Biden administration to help address a rise in threats to election workers following the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThe justice department has a responsibility not only to protect the right to vote, but also to protect those who administer our voting systems from violence and illegal threats of violence,\u201d said the attorney general, Merrick Garland."

            "title": "More than 1,000 US public figures aided Trump\u2019s effort to overturn election",
            "date": "2022-01-05T07:00:35Z",
            "content": "More than 1,000 Americans in positions of public trust acted as accomplices in Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election result, participating in the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January or spreading the \u201cbig lie\u201d that the vote count had been rigged. The startling figure underlines the extent to which Trump\u2019s attempt to undermine the foundations of presidential legitimacy has metastasized across the US. Individuals who engaged in arguably the most serious attempt to subvert democracy since the civil war are now inveigling themselves into all levels of government, from Congress and state legislatures down to school boards and other local public bodies. The finding that 1,011 individuals in the public realm played a role in election subversion around the 2020 presidential race comes from a new pro-democracy initiative that launched on Wednesday. The Insurrection Index seeks to identify all those who supported Trump in his bid to hold on to power despite losing the election, in the hope that they can be held accountable and prevented from inflicting further damage to the democratic infrastructure of the country. All of the more than 1,000 people recorded on the index have been invested with the public\u2019s trust, having been entrusted with official positions and funded with taxpayer dollars. Many are current or former government employees at federal, state or local levels. Among them are 213 incumbents in elected office and 29 who are running as candidates for positions of power in upcoming elections. There are also 59 military veterans, 31 current or former law enforcement officials, and seven who sit on local school boards. When the index goes live on Thursday, it will contain a total of 1,404 records of those who played a role in trying to overturn the 2020 election. In addition to the 1,011 individuals, it lists 393 organizations deemed to have played a part in subverting democracy. The index is the brainchild of Public Wise, a voting rights group whose mission is to fight for government that reflects the will and the rights of voters. Christina Baal-Owens, the group\u2019s executive director, said that the index was conceived as an ongoing campaign designed to keep insurrectionists out of office. \u201cThese are folks who silenced the voices of American voters, who took a validly held election and created fraudulent information to try to silence voters. They have no business being near legislation or being able to affect the lives of American people,\u201d she said. The project has been set up with legal advice from Marc Elias, one of the most influential election lawyers in the US who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s top counsel in the 2016 presidential campaign and who successfully led Joe Biden\u2019s resistance to Trump\u2019s blitzkrieg of lawsuits contesting the 2020 results. Elias told the Guardian that the index was needed urgently to avoid history repeating itself in 2024 or beyond. \u201cWe are one, maybe two elections away from a constitutional crisis over election subversion,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t recognize who was behind the attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power, then next time we will be less prepared and it may succeed.\u201d Elias said he saw the index as an example of the kinds of robust action progressives need to take to combat an unprecedented wave of anti-democratic legislation emanating from Republicans in the past 12 months. While Trump had reshaped the right to be laser-focused on elections and winning at all costs, Democrats are spreading their energies thinly between a number of causes of which protecting democracy was just one, he said. \u201cThe central theme of the Republican party today is undermining free and fair elections. Under Trump that has become a credential within the party, and we can\u2019t let those folks win without a fight because if we do we lose our democracy.\u201d The individuals recorded on the index who are already in public office include the 147 members of Congress who objected to the certification of the 2020 election result. The list also names many elected officials in state legislatures across the nation, including states like Arizona that were ground zero for Trump\u2019s efforts to steal the election from Biden. Jake Hoffman, a lawmaker who represents Arizona\u2019s 12th district, wrote to fellow Republicans a day before the Capitol insurrection urging them to pressure then vice-president Mike Pence into blocking Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cVice-President Pence has the power to delay congressional certification and seek clarification from state legislatures in contested states as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,\u201d Hoffman wrote, reflecting a theory embraced by Trump that has been thoroughly rebutted. The week before the insurrection, 17 Arizona state lawmakers wrote to Pence urging him to \u201cblock the use of any Electors from Arizona\u201d despite multiple counts by then establishing that Biden had won the state by more than 10,000 votes. Among the signatories was Mark Finchem, a member of the Arizona House of representatives who was present at Trump\u2019s \u201cstop the steal\u201d rally in Washington on 6 January and who is now vying to become Arizona secretary of state \u2013 the top election official who oversees the presidential count. Among the 59 individuals on the index with military backgrounds is Christopher Warnagiris, who in June became the first active-duty member of the armed forces to be charged in relation with the Capitol assault. Despite facing nine counts of assault and violent entry, he has been permitted to continue serving within the training and education section at the Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia. Public Wise has drawn on a number of public information sources to compile the index, working in partnership with other pro-democracy groups who have added specialist skills. The partners include American Oversight, a non-partisan organisation that has used freedom of information laws to extract information from government agencies that exposes participants in the big lie. \u201cThe goal is to build up a holistic picture so that nothing can fall through the cracks and no one can slip away,\u201d said Austin Evers, the executive director of American Oversight. \u201cWe ask: who is this cc\u2019d on this email? What handle is this on a social media account? If we can connect the dots we can ensure accountability can be brought to bear.\u201d Evers said that the most chilling revelation of the research was that the 6 January insurrection was inspired by an ideology that was supported by people in power. \u201cState legislators in Arizona were involved in the run-up to January 6 and after January 6 used their positions to drive the big lie. That feels cancerous \u2013 the attack on democracy has the backing of political, and even governmental, infrastructure.\u201d One likely charge leveled at the new index by rightwing individuals and groups is that it is a form of \u201ccancel culture\u201d, designed to silence anyone airing uncomfortable views. Baal-Owens dismisses any such criticism. \u201cOur call to action is about voting, not doxing,\u201d she said, pointing out that no private information is included on the index. \u201cThe call to action is not to show up at this person\u2019s house or chase their child to school, but to allow every registered voter to have an educated way to cast their vote.\u201d The groups behind the index hope that it will alert voters to the anti-democratic actions of people running for elected office. The value of such a record, they believe, would increase exponentially were the Republicans to take back control of Congress in this year\u2019s midterm elections, leading almost certainly to an abrupt halt in congressional investigations into the events of 6 January."

            "title": "More than 40% in US do not believe Biden legitimately won election \u2013 poll",
            "date": "2022-01-05T18:16:08Z",
            "content": "More than 40% of Americans still do not believe that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud, according to a new Axios-Momentive poll. The poll, released on the eve of the first anniversary of the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, found that 55% of those surveyed believe Biden won the election. That figure has barely changed since Axios\u2019s poll from 2020, published shortly before the insurrection. That poll, published in 2020, found 58% said that they accepted Biden as the legitimate winner of the presidential election. Despite Biden\u2019s inauguration, the attack on the Capitol and the multiple investigations that have debunked the lies pushed by the former president that the election was stolen, the poll suggests that the same level of doubt persists. \u201cIt\u2019s dispiriting to see that this shocking thing we all witnessed last year hasn\u2019t changed people\u2019s perceptions,\u201d Laura Wronski, senior manager for research science at Momentive, told Axios. A majority of Americans also said they are expecting a repeat of the deadly 6 January attack in the next few years. The polls, conducted from 1 to 5 January of this year, surveyed nearly 2,700 adults, and found nearly 57% \u2013 about half of Republicans and seven in 10 Democrats \u2013 believe that events similar to the attack are likely to occur again. In addition, nearly two-thirds or 63% said that the 6 January attack has at least temporarily changed the way they think about their democratic government. A third said that those changes are temporary. Nearly as many, 31%, said that those changes are permanent. About 37% of those surveyed said they had lost faith in American democracy (48% of Republicans and 28% of Democrats), while 10% said they had never had faith in the system. Forty-nine percent said they did have faith. Fifty-eight per cent of Americans said they supported the investigative work of the House select committee investigating the riot. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats support the inquiry, compared with 58% of independents and 32% of Republicans. Just slightly more than half of American adults, 51%, said individuals associated with the insurrection should face criminal penalties if they refuse to comply with subpoenas. Republicans have also been revealed to be three or four more times as likely as Democrats to say voter fraud is a problem in their state, despite such claims being thoroughly debunked. Wronski said she believes the results of the poll shows either \u201cBiden hasn\u2019t done enough\u201d to push back against disinformation, or \u201cit shows that he never had a chance\u201d. She added: \u201cThe partisan division is still the story.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2022 to correct the breakdown by party of responses related to support for the House select committee investigation, and faith in American democracy."

            "title": "Arizona Republicans introduce election subversion bill",
            "date": "2022-01-29T11:00:03Z",
            "content": "Arizona Republicans have introduced a bill that would impose significant new voting restrictions and allow the state legislature to reject election results. The measure would require the state legislature to convene after primary and general elections to review the ballot counting process and \u201cshall accept or reject the election results\u201d. The proposal does not require lawmakers to find evidence of fraud or lay out any factors they would have to consider in order to overturn an election. If the lawmakers were to reject the results, any voter in Arizona would be allowed to petition a local judge to hold a new election. The same measure would also require Arizona voters to give an excuse if they want to vote by mail, even though mail-in voting has long been used by the vast majority of voters in the state. It also would restrict voting to election day and prevent the use of vote centers, essentially mega voting precincts where anyone in a county can vote, regardless of where they live. One of the co-sponsors of the bill is Mark Finchem, a state representative who believes the 2020 election was stolen, has ties to the Oath Keepers, and was at the Capitol on 6 January. Finchem is running to be Arizona\u2019s chief election official and Donald Trump has endorsed him. \u201cWe need to get back to 1958-style voting,\u201d John Fillmore, another Republican state representative who introduced the bill said on Wednesday, according to the Arizona Republic. Arizona had a racist literacy test in place in 1958, the Republic noted. The Voting Rights Act, which wiped out many blatant efforts to keep Black people from the polls, passed in 1965. Fillmore did not respond to an interview request from the Guardian. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear from this bill is that there are some members of the Arizona legislature who are prepared to replace the judgment of Arizona voters with their own,\u201d said David Becker, an election administration expert who leads the Center for Election Innovation and Research. It\u2019s unclear if the measure will ultimately pass. Republicans hold a 16-14 majority in the state senate, which means, if Democrats unanimously oppose it, any Republican could kill the bill by voting against it. A Republican bill last year that would have allowed the legislature to override the results of a presidential election stalled. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that they will move forward with that idea because I think the outrage from the community would be pretty big,\u201d said Martin Quezada, a Democrat in the state senate. \u201cBut the fact that they\u2019re even talking about this issue just shows what kind of a space that we are in right now.\u201d Even if Republicans drop the provision allowing the legislature to overturn elections, Quezada said, the measures that roll back vote-by-mail access in Arizona would still be extreme. \u201cThe impact would be tremendous. It would drastically change the way elections work in the state of Arizona. I mean right now the overwhelming majority of voters vote by mail,\u201d he said. \u201cThe turnout overall would be suppressed tremendously \u2026 The process of actually showing up at the polls to vote would be so frustrating and time-consuming that many people would feel even if they did want to vote, it\u2019s just not worth it to deal with that type of problem.\u201d The proposal comes as there is increased alarm over Republican efforts across the country to make it possible for partisan actors to overturn election results, something scholars have begun calling election subversion. \u201cThis bill follows a worrisome anti-democratic trend of legislation introduced in statehouses across the country that would make it possible for legislatures to overturn election results they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Jessica Marsden, a lawyer at the watchdog Protect Democracy who is tracking election subversion bills across the country. \u201cThis brazen power grab reveals the cynical strategy behind the deceptive big lie movement: to create a pretext for interfering in election outcomes by undermining confidence in elections.\u201d The bill also underscores how Arizona, where Joe Biden narrowly defeated Donald Trump in 2020, has become a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the election. The state senate authorized an unprecedented months-long post-election review of 2.1m ballots in the state\u2019s most populous county that fanned lies about the 2020 race but ultimately affirmed Biden\u2019s win. Some provisions in the legislation appear to be connected to conspiracy theories that flourished during that review, including the debunked belief that voting equipment was tampered with and ballots had bamboo fibers in them. The bill would require a hand count of ballots within 24 hours of an election and require the use of a hologram or other unique mark to verify the authenticity of ballots. \u201cThey keep inventing solutions where there are no problems,\u201d said Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the Democracy Fund and a former election official in Arizona. Changing the paper used for ballots would probably make it more costly for counties to run elections and more difficult to reprint ballots if there is an error in the printing process, she said. And requiring election officials to complete a hand count of ballots within 24 hours just isn\u2019t feasible in Arizona, where the ballot can be extremely long, with dozens of races. \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible, it\u2019s not accurate, and it\u2019s cost prohibitive \u2026 To think that you can do a full ballot hand count within 24 hours is ridiculous,\u201d she said. Humans are also prone to make counting errors. \u201cEveryone who has done a hand count will tell you that machine counts are more accurate,\u201d Patrick said. Jennifer Morrell, a former election official who now works as a consultant and election administration noted that Cyber Ninjas, the firm that conducted the unusual election review in Arizona, took months to count ballots by hand. \u201cThe idea of hand counting all ballots within 24 hours of election day is completely unrealistic and shows how little the bill\u2019s sponsors understand about the mechanics of counting ballots,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides the time frame being unrealistic, the process of counting by hand is prone to error. That\u2019s part of why it takes so long. You have to go at it in a way that is slow and methodical to get it right and include enough time to verify the counting was done correctly.\u201d \u201cHand counting ballots is problematic to begin with. The time frame they\u2019re suggesting is completely unrealistic,\u201d said Jennifer Morrell, a former election official who now works as a consultant on election administration. Earlier this week, Republicans in the state legislature advanced several other bills that would change election processes in the state. One bill would expand the threshold for an automatic recount from 0.1 percentage point to 0.5 (Biden defeated Trump by 0.3 points). Other bills would require the state to make ballot images public after an election while another would end all mail-in elections for school boards and cities."

The deer was an axis deer from India, which had been donated to the presidential residence, the director of wildlife at the ministry of the environment, Frederick Bauer, told media. An infantry spokesman, V\u00edctor Urdapilleta, said that closed circuit cameras captured the moment when the soldier approached the deer and he was attacked. \u201cFor unknown reasons he approached the area where the animals live and that\u2019s where he was attacked.

He was declared dead in a military hospital. Urdapilleta said there was no history of a similar attack by animals routinely kept in the presidential residence, which have included ostriches and ponies in previous administrations. The animals are kept in a restricted area and are not in routine contact with visitors to the residence, which is located in a residential area of the capital city."

            "date": "2022-01-13T19:36:13Z",
            "content": "The Republican party has signaled plans to withdraw from traditional US presidential debates, which it claims are biased against it. The New York Times first reported the move, citing a letter sent on Thursday by the Republican National Committee (RNC) to the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). The commission was set up in 1987, as a non-partisan body \u201cto ensure, for the benefit of the American electorate, that general election debates between or among the leading candidates for the offices of president and vice-president \u2026 are a permanent part of the electoral process\u201d. In the most recent election, in 2020, Donald Trump made headlines with an aggressive performance in the first debate, in Cleveland, Ohio. The second debate was cancelled after Trump was hospitalized with Covid-19 and the CPD sought to move the event online. Trump and Republicans protested that doing so would help Joe Biden. The final debate took place in Nashville, Tennessee as planned, with Biden widely adjudged the winner. A vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris also went ahead, in Salt Lake City. In December this year, the Guardian first revealed the stunning news that Trump tested positive for Covid before the first debate but concealed the result, potentially putting Biden\u2019s life in danger. Trump said that was fake news. So did his former chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 who wrote the book which contained the bombshell. The Times said the Republican move against the CPD was born of longstanding complaints that it favors Democrats, \u201cmirroring increasing rancor from conservatives toward Washington-based institutions\u201d. Among Republican complaints in 2020 was that the first debate took place on 29 September, more than a month before election day but after nearly a million votes had been cast. Trump and Republicans also complained about supposed bias among debate moderators \u2013 even from Chris Wallace, then of the conservative Fox News network, in the first debate. Trump remains favorite to be the Republican nominee in 2024. The threatened withdrawal from CPD debates, the Times said, followed \u201cmonths of discussions between the commission and party officials\u201d. David Bossie, a longtime rightwing operative with strong links to Trump, was reported to be leading the RNC on the issue, seeking among other aims to insert political representatives in meetings of the CPD board. Withdrawal will have to be approved at the RNC\u2019s winter meetings in Utah in February, the Times said. In her letter, according to the Times, the RNC chair, Ronna McDaniel, said: \u201cSo long as the CPD appears intent on stonewalling the meaningful reforms necessary to restore its credibility with the Republican party as a fair and nonpartisan actor, the RNC will take every step to ensure that future Republican presidential nominees are given that opportunity elsewhere.\u201d In a statement, the CPD said it \u201cdeals directly with candidates for president and vice-president who qualify for participation\u201d, and said \u201cplans for 2024 will be based on fairness, neutrality and a firm commitment to help the American public learn about the candidates and the issues\u201d."

            "content": "In better times, the French left used to draw inspiration from the old Popular Front phrase, \u201cles lendemains qui chantent\u201d (the tomorrows that sing). These days that kind of optimism \u2013 along with any sense of unity among progressives \u2013 is just a poignant memory. With less than 100 days to go before the first round of the French presidential election, the jockeying for position among the flatlining candidates of the left has become a fractious sideshow, as the campaign continues to be dominated by the right. At the weekend, the Socialist former justice minister, Christiane Taubira, became the latest hopeful to formally throw her hat into the ring. She joins the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo \u2013 also a Socialist \u2013 France Unbowed\u2019s veteran hard-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the Green candidate, Yannick Jadot, and an assortment of fringe figures. None of the candidates has managed to break through the 10% barrier in polls and none has a chance of making it through to the second round of voting; yet all remain in the race, vying to take votes from each other. \u201cSinging tomorrows\u201d have given way to a cacophonous clashing of stubborn egos. The result is that the 30% or so of voters who identify as being on the broad left are being effectively disfranchised. Ms Taubira is associated with one of the most notable progressive victories in recent times, having pushed through same-sex marriage in 2013. Charismatic and popular with grassroots activists, she will hope that her radical pedigree can transcend the factional warfare. But there is also a risk that she simply divides this divided field still further. Ms Hidalgo recently warned that the choice for the left was to either unite or risk eventual extinction as a political force in France. But Mr Jadot and Mr M\u00e9lenchon, whose poll ratings have more than halved since the election of 2017, have both refused to recognise the validity of an unofficial \u201cpeople\u2019s primary\u201d at the end of the month. It is a sorry spectacle. In 2012, following the election of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande as president, the Parti Socialiste controlled the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, both houses of parliament and most regional administrations. It then paid a heavy price for enacting post-crash austerity measures and haemorrhaged working-class support during the growing backlash against globalisation. In 2017, the party was out-manoeuvred by Emmanuel Macron, who left it to set up the centrist En Marche movement and successfully brought about a realignment in which he became the presidential bulwark against the threat of the far right. Faced with these formidable structural challenges, the French left cannot afford the luxury of endless infighting and self-indulgent campaigns leading to mutually assured destruction at the polls. The people\u2019s primary was set up by progressive activists in a last-ditch attempt to achieve a united front. It seems destined to fail in that aim \u2013 though it may serve as a kind of launchpad for Ms Taubira, who has said she will not run unless she wins. The near-certain humiliation that awaits the left in April should be the catalyst for a radical reboot of how progressive politics is done in France."

            "title": "Election battle lines set as Macron pits himself against France\u2019s unvaccinated",
            "date": "2022-01-14T14:38:12Z",
            "content": "Emmanuel Macron is facing growing political divisions over Covid rules in the run-up to the spring presidential election, after his proposed vaccine pass was delayed and teachers took strike action, amid ongoing street demonstrations and a rise in violent threats against politicians. With an increasing mood of fatigue among French voters after two years of the pandemic and a significant mistrust of the political class, the president \u2013\u2013 who is likely to hold off declaring his re-election bid for several weeks as the coronavirus health crisis continues \u2013\u2013 wants to be seen as reliable but firm. France has been hit by a fifth wave of Covid infections, with more than 305,000 daily cases reported on Thursday, just as campaigning for the April presidential election was due to begin in earnest. Macron has ramped up his rhetoric against France\u2019s minority of non-vaccinated people \u2013\u2013 less than 10% of the eligible population \u2013\u2013 in part as a way of setting the political battle lines for the election. Coronavirus rules are becoming a significant issue for the campaign. The vaccine pass would harden Covid-19 restrictions, making proof of vaccination mandatory to enter certain public places including cafes, restaurants, cinemas and long-distance trains. Macron had hoped to introduce it this weekend. But the bill has been forced to a second round of parliamentary debate after lawmakers and senators failed to reach agreement. Macron\u2019s recent, deliberately radical statement that he really wanted to dump non-vaccinated people \u201cin the shit\u201d by making their daily lives as difficult as possible was aimed to appeal to his own centrist electorate, which is overwhelmingly vaccinated and exasperated at the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Although France had a slow start on vaccines, it now has one of the highest rates of vaccination in Europe \u2013 at more than 90% of those eligible \u2013 and a majority of people support the vaccine pass. The president is seeking to portray himself as the centrist voice of reason and science \u2013\u2013 as previously defined by his Europe minister, Cl\u00e9ment Beaune, who will play a leading role in his campaign \u2013\u2013 against what he deems the dangers of populism among other candidates: Marine Le Pen and the former TV pundit \u00c9ric Zemmour on the far right, and the left\u2019s Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. None of those candidates oppose vaccination, but they have been critical of the vaccine pass. Macron\u2019s main challenger, Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse of Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s right-wing party, Les R\u00e9publicains, supports the vaccine pass but her party\u2019s amendments and challenges in parliament and the senate have stalled it coming into force. Macron\u2019s party blamed Les R\u00e9publicains on Friday for delaying Covid protections. But Damien Abad, the head of the party in the parliament\u2019s lower house and an advisor to P\u00e9cresse, described Macron\u2019s comments about dumping people \u201cin the shit\u201d as \u201ccold and calculating populism\u201d aimed at \u201cdividing the French people\u201d for electoral purposes. There is a mood of mistrust of the political class and institutions in France, which has simmered since the gilets jaunes anti-government protests before the pandemic. Elected politicians, particularly from Macron\u2019s party, have made more than 300 complaints to police of death threats against them since the introduction of Macron\u2019s health pass in July 2021, which required either vaccination, recovery from coronavirus or a negative test for access to public places such as restaurants and libraries. There have been more than 60 complaints of violence against elected officials so far this month, including over the vaccine issue, the interior minister said this week. Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet, a lawmaker from Macron\u2019s party, received a message saying if she didn\u2019t vote against the vaccine pass there would be a \u201cgigantic bloodbath\u201d in parliament. Pascal Bois, another lawmaker from Macron\u2019s party, who had already received a bullet in the post, had his garage and car torched two weeks ago with graffiti on the walls about \u201cvoting no\u201d. Within the minority of the roughly 5 million unvaccinated people in France, not all are anti-vaccine by principle, according to research by France\u2019s national institute of health and medical research, Inserm. Some have fears over side-effects and four out of 10 may have difficulties accessing the relevant health services for free vaccines, including elderly people isolated in rural communities. Nevertheless, divisions in society are becoming clear. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet of the pollsters Ifop said 51% of French people felt they were in danger when in contact with a non-vaccinated person and 51% felt non-vaccinated people should pay all or part of the cost of their treatment in intensive care. These views are higher among over-65s, who are being courted by both Macron and P\u00e9cresse. More than 100,000 people protested against the vaccine pass across France last weekend, saying it curbed their liberties. More demonstrations are expected on Saturday. \u201cNon-vaccinated people are being held responsible for the latest Covid wave in France, but it\u2019s lack of government hospital-funding that created the problems,\u201d said a 27-year-old woman from Paris who works in the public sector for a government ministry and has not been vaccinated because she fears unknown side-effects. She had voted for M\u00e9lenchon in the past, but might now vote far right. \u201cStrangely, it\u2019s the right which now seems more likely to defend our liberties as non-vaccinated people.\u201d Polls show Macron is the favourite to top the first round of the presidential election and could beat a far-right candidate in the final contest, but would face a challenge from P\u00e9cresse if she makes the second round. Antoine Bristielle, the director of opinion at the Fondation Jean Jaur\u00e8s thinktank, said the current priority for French voters was purchasing power and making ends meet. \u201cBut in second place is Covid, which has made a spectacular return as an election concern in recent months,\u201d he said. He felt that Macron could benefit from the fact that voters often looked for stability and known leaders in a crisis. But he said: \u201cThere is currently an extreme mistrust among French people towards politics and institutions \u2026 Only six out of 10 French people are certain they will turn out to vote in the presidential election \u2013\u2013 10 points lower than the same period for the last election.\u201d Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant at the pollsters Viavoice, said 57% of French people defined their current state of mind as \u201cfatigued\u201d, worsened by the pandemic. He said that although there was broad approval of Macron\u2019s handling of the economy during the pandemic, there is a limit to politicians\u2019 ability to capitalise on Covid \u201cbecause French people clearly want to move on to something else\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 January 2022 to clarify that the vaccination rate given of \u201cmore than 90%\u201d relates to the eligible French population, not the whole population."

            "date": "2022-01-11T15:29:36Z",
            "content": "Silvio Berlusconi has reportedly threatened to withdraw his Forza Italia party from Italy\u2019s governing majority if the current prime minister, Mario Draghi, is elected president later this month. The scandal-tainted media tycoon, who served four times as prime minister, is in Rome from Tuesday on the hunt for votes as he ramps up his own presidential campaign. The secret ballot by more than 1,000 parliamentarians and regional representatives begins on 24 January and is expected to go through several rounds before a successor to Sergio Mattarella, who steps down on 3 February, is elected. There are no official candidates in Italy\u2019s presidential elections, although party leaders usually try to agree on a candidate. Berlusconi, 85, is a favourite among the rightwing parties for the seven-year-mandate. However, Draghi, who is credited with restoring stability in Italy, as well as keeping the broad coalition in line, is tipped as the frontrunner. According to reports in the Italian press, Berlusconi said that without Draghi as prime minister, \u201cForza Italia would leave the majority\u201d. Draghi\u2019s potential promotion risks bringing general elections forward by a year. In a poll released on Tuesday, more than 50% of Italians said Draghi was the person most fit for the job, while 39% supported Berlusconi. Berlusconi, who was temporarily banned from public office after a tax fraud conviction in 2013 and is still being tried for allegedly bribing witnesses in an underage prostitution case connected to his notorious \u201cbunga bunga\u201d sex parties, has reportedly been bombarding parliamentarians in the lead-up to the ballot in what the Italian press has described as his \u201cOperation Squirrel campaign\u201d. Antonio Tajani, the deputy Forza Italia leader, said Draghi needed to remain prime minister and that with Berlusconi as president, \u201cthe government would be solid\u201d. Draghi hinted in December he would be prepared to accept the role if elected. However, he began a press conference on Monday night by vetoing questions about the presidential race. \u201cOnly Draghi can do this [prime minister] job,\u201d Tajani told La Stampa. \u201cWithout Draghi it\u2019s impossible to have a unity government \u2026 we\u2019re participating in this government because of Draghi.\u201d Tajani said Forza Italia\u2019s withdrawal from government would be inevitable if Draghi moved to the presidential palace. \u201cThe majority would implode,\u201d he said. Italy\u2019s president has a largely ceremonial role, albeit with the power to resolve political crises, pick prime ministers and call early elections. Mattarella was forced to step several times to resolve crises, including calling on Draghi to form a unity government last February after the administration led by Giuseppe Conte collapsed. Analysts believe Berlusconi will struggle to garner enough support for his bid, even if he is noted for his shrewd \u201cvote-buying skills\u201d. On the eve of his campaign, he posted a photo of himself and his girlfriend, Marta Fascina, a Forza Italia politician, on Instagram, alongside the message: \u201cHappy birthday.\u201d Fascina turned 32 on Sunday."

            "content": "The chief executive of Countryside Properties has left the company after it failed to cash in on the UK property boom that has fuelled the huge profits at its housebuilding peers. Shares in Countryside were down by a quarter on Thursday, making it the biggest FTSE 250 faller by some distance and wiping \u00a3700m off its value, after the company revealed the extent of its poor performance. Adjusted operating profits more than halved year on year to \u00a316.5m and housing completions fell by more than a third in the three months to the end of December. In contrast, Persimmon on Thursday reported bumper house sales, up a fifth on pre-pandemic levels in the second half of last year. Countryside announced the immediate departure of its chief executive, Iain McPherson, with its chair, John Martin, standing in until a permanent replacement is appointed. Martin said: \u201cTrading in the first quarter of our new financial year has been below the board\u2019s expectations.\u201d He said he would conduct a review process of all of Countryside\u2019s developments to ensure that each site was being developed \u201cin accordance with the plans set out during the investment process\u201d. As part of the boardroom reshuffle the company has appointed Peter Lee, a partner at Browning West \u2013 a US-based activist investor that has built up an almost 10% stake to become one of the company\u2019s biggest shareholders \u2013 as a non-executive director. Countryside also responded on Thursday to government plans to protect leaseholders from the costs of all post-Grenfell building safety defects, not just combustible cladding. \u201c[We are] fully supportive of finding an industry-wide solution for the benefit of leaseholders,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe are currently working with landlords to expedite remediation in cases where the historic work on Countryside developments did not meet building standards.\u201d The departure of McPherson and poor results cap a torrid year for Countryside. In September, the competition regulator forced the company to give formal commitments to free thousands of people who bought leasehold homes from costly contract terms resulting in the doubling of ground rent fees every 10 to 15 years. Countryside has confirmed it no longer sells leasehold properties with doubling-ground rent clauses, following the investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority."

            "date": "2022-01-29T11:00:03Z",
            "content": "Arizona Republicans have introduced a bill that would impose significant new voting restrictions and allow the state legislature to reject election results. The measure would require the state legislature to convene after primary and general elections to review the ballot counting process and \u201cshall accept or reject the election results\u201d. The proposal does not require lawmakers to find evidence of fraud or lay out any factors they would have to consider in order to overturn an election. If the lawmakers were to reject the results, any voter in Arizona would be allowed to petition a local judge to hold a new election. The same measure would also require Arizona voters to give an excuse if they want to vote by mail, even though mail-in voting has long been used by the vast majority of voters in the state. It also would restrict voting to election day and prevent the use of vote centers, essentially mega voting precincts where anyone in a county can vote, regardless of where they live. One of the co-sponsors of the bill is Mark Finchem, a state representative who believes the 2020 election was stolen, has ties to the Oath Keepers, and was at the Capitol on 6 January. Finchem is running to be Arizona\u2019s chief election official and Donald Trump has endorsed him. \u201cWe need to get back to 1958-style voting,\u201d John Fillmore, another Republican state representative who introduced the bill said on Wednesday, according to the Arizona Republic. Arizona had a racist literacy test in place in 1958, the Republic noted. The Voting Rights Act, which wiped out many blatant efforts to keep Black people from the polls, passed in 1965. Fillmore did not respond to an interview request from the Guardian. \u201cWhat\u2019s clear from this bill is that there are some members of the Arizona legislature who are prepared to replace the judgment of Arizona voters with their own,\u201d said David Becker, an election administration expert who leads the Center for Election Innovation and Research. It\u2019s unclear if the measure will ultimately pass. Republicans hold a 16-14 majority in the state senate, which means, if Democrats unanimously oppose it, any Republican could kill the bill by voting against it. A Republican bill last year that would have allowed the legislature to override the results of a presidential election stalled. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that they will move forward with that idea because I think the outrage from the community would be pretty big,\u201d said Martin Quezada, a Democrat in the state senate. \u201cBut the fact that they\u2019re even talking about this issue just shows what kind of a space that we are in right now.\u201d Even if Republicans drop the provision allowing the legislature to overturn elections, Quezada said, the measures that roll back vote-by-mail access in Arizona would still be extreme. \u201cThe impact would be tremendous. It would drastically change the way elections work in the state of Arizona. I mean right now the overwhelming majority of voters vote by mail,\u201d he said. \u201cThe turnout overall would be suppressed tremendously \u2026 The process of actually showing up at the polls to vote would be so frustrating and time-consuming that many people would feel even if they did want to vote, it\u2019s just not worth it to deal with that type of problem.\u201d The proposal comes as there is increased alarm over Republican efforts across the country to make it possible for partisan actors to overturn election results, something scholars have begun calling election subversion. \u201cThis bill follows a worrisome anti-democratic trend of legislation introduced in statehouses across the country that would make it possible for legislatures to overturn election results they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Jessica Marsden, a lawyer at the watchdog Protect Democracy who is tracking election subversion bills across the country. \u201cThis brazen power grab reveals the cynical strategy behind the deceptive big lie movement: to create a pretext for interfering in election outcomes by undermining confidence in elections.\u201d The bill also underscores how Arizona, where Joe Biden narrowly defeated Donald Trump in 2020, has become a hotbed of conspiracy theories about the election. The state senate authorized an unprecedented months-long post-election review of 2.1m ballots in the state\u2019s most populous county that fanned lies about the 2020 race but ultimately affirmed Biden\u2019s win. Some provisions in the legislation appear to be connected to conspiracy theories that flourished during that review, including the debunked belief that voting equipment was tampered with and ballots had bamboo fibers in them. The bill would require a hand count of ballots within 24 hours of an election and require the use of a hologram or other unique mark to verify the authenticity of ballots. \u201cThey keep inventing solutions where there are no problems,\u201d said Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser at the Democracy Fund and a former election official in Arizona. Changing the paper used for ballots would probably make it more costly for counties to run elections and more difficult to reprint ballots if there is an error in the printing process, she said. And requiring election officials to complete a hand count of ballots within 24 hours just isn\u2019t feasible in Arizona, where the ballot can be extremely long, with dozens of races. \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible, it\u2019s not accurate, and it\u2019s cost prohibitive \u2026 To think that you can do a full ballot hand count within 24 hours is ridiculous,\u201d she said. Humans are also prone to make counting errors. \u201cEveryone who has done a hand count will tell you that machine counts are more accurate,\u201d Patrick said. Jennifer Morrell, a former election official who now works as a consultant and election administration noted that Cyber Ninjas, the firm that conducted the unusual election review in Arizona, took months to count ballots by hand. \u201cThe idea of hand counting all ballots within 24 hours of election day is completely unrealistic and shows how little the bill\u2019s sponsors understand about the mechanics of counting ballots,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides the time frame being unrealistic, the process of counting by hand is prone to error. That\u2019s part of why it takes so long. You have to go at it in a way that is slow and methodical to get it right and include enough time to verify the counting was done correctly.\u201d \u201cHand counting ballots is problematic to begin with. The time frame they\u2019re suggesting is completely unrealistic,\u201d said Jennifer Morrell, a former election official who now works as a consultant on election administration. Earlier this week, Republicans in the state legislature advanced several other bills that would change election processes in the state. One bill would expand the threshold for an automatic recount from 0.1 percentage point to 0.5 (Biden defeated Trump by 0.3 points). Other bills would require the state to make ballot images public after an election while another would end all mail-in elections for school boards and cities."

            "date": "2022-01-17T17:20:09Z",
            "content": "When the former Downing Street pollster James Johnson ran a focus group on \u201cpartygate\u201d in the red wall seat of Bolton North East, the feedback wasn\u2019t exactly encouraging for No 10. Some of the disparaging comments from those voters who backed the Tories for the first time in 2019 included: \u201cI think he\u2019s completely lost everyone\u2019s trust\u201d, \u201che needs to resign\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t really see how he can carry on\u201d. When people were asked whether they would vote for Boris Johnson now, not a single person put their hand up. That reaction won\u2019t come as much of a surprise to Tory MPs in Westminster after a weekend in their constituencies. While the prime minister and his team have tried to win over the parliamentary party with regular trips to the tearoom and \u201cOperation Red Meat\u201d, which aims to please the base with rightwing policies, the charm offensive is yet to work on the grassroots. \u201cIt\u2019s bleak,\u201d says one loyalist MP. The problem is it is not the usual suspects. Instead, \u201cit\u2019s our core base\u201d, according to someone on the government payroll. New revelations on Friday that No 10 staff were partying on the eve of Prince Philip\u2019s funeral have driven many MPs to distraction. As one points out, members of their associations often belong to other community organisations and take an extremely dim view of lax attitudes to the rules. \u201cThere is something almost impressive about managing to piss off absolutely every group of society,\u201d observes a former adviser. In the face of criticism from even usually supportive newspapers, MPs are discovering new coping mechanisms. One senior Tory had a media blackout at the weekend \u2013 the complaints from his constituents were enough. Yet for all the anger, it\u2019s still unclear how Johnson would actually go. MPs fall roughly into two camps: those who want him out before the local elections and those who think he ought to be given until then to turn things around. The group most eager to see the back of the prime minister is made up of those who have council seats up for grabs in May. Candidates are talking of dropping out and are warning of electoral oblivion. In order to avoid this fate, they argue that a new leader is required at the national level. They are backed by longtime Johnson critics, Scottish Tories and increasingly MPs in Liberal Democrat/Tory marginals. Given the Liberal Democrats managed to overturn chunky Conservative majorities in the Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire byelections, this group don\u2019t feel as though they need to wait until May. However, many MPs believe Johnson will cling on until then \u2013 bar no new damaging disclosures. First, the next Tory leadership contest will not be a tidy affair; there is no unity candidate. The two frontrunners, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, have their supporters \u2013 but also ample critics. Already a \u201cStop Truss\u201d contingent is forming \u2013 MPs keen to either keep Johnson in place to avoid this fate or to work to stop the foreign secretary reaching the membership in any contest. Given she is a grassroots favourite, they view it as too risky to have her in the final two. With potential candidates being tipped to run including the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, former defence minister Penny Mordaunt, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt, the contest is already looking rather crowded. \u201cTo get to 54 letters and then start and complete a leadership contest between now and April is overly ambitious,\u201d says a member of the government. There are also self-serving reasons ministers are keen to put off a contest. The mantra \u201che who wields the knife never wears the crown\u201d is weighing heavily on contenders. Such a move could lead to a backlash among Johnson loyalists and make an entry in a leadership contest more difficult. \u201cA lot of colleagues want him to take us into the local elections and let the public vote on him,\u201d says someone on the payroll. \u201cIt\u2019s a neater way of doing things.\u201d Another MP argues that those activists who support Johnson need to see proof that he is no longer an electoral asset. But that calculation could change. While the fact there is no obvious successor is helping Johnson stay in position, things could get so bad that MPs ultimately decide it\u2019s best to get rid of the problem then work on the solution afterwards. While Downing Street aides are optimistic he will survive Sue Gray\u2019s report, MPs will be carefully studying his reaction. Johnson\u2019s falling poll ratings suggest many voters have already made up their minds \u2013 any more denying reality or making excuses will feed into the very complaints that were raised in that Bolton focus group. The issue for the prime minister is that the partygate crisis is not yet a Conservative-wide scandal, it\u2019s a Boris Johnson scandal. If MPs conclude they need to move fast in order to stop it contaminating the whole Tory brand permanently, he will be out sooner rather than later \u2013 even if the question of who will succeed him remains up in the air.

He refused the pressures of the former president, he did his duty and the nation should be very grateful for the actions he took that day.\u201d The panel is chaired by the Democratic congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who told CNN: \u201cWe came perilously close to losing our democracy\u201d when thousands of supporters of Trump, egged on by the then-president in the dying days of his one-term presidency, charged the US Capitol on 6 January last year trying to stop members of Congress, who had to flee, from officially certifying Biden\u2019s election victory in November 2020. The election result was certified hours later after the Capitol had been cleared, with the official act being presided over by Pence, in the vice-president\u2019s role as president of the Senate. Cheney, the Republican congresswoman representing Wyoming, and the daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney, who served in the George W Bush administration, spoke of Trump putting Pence under pressure to refuse to certify Biden\u2019s victory and of the then-president\u2019s failure to demand that the mob leave the Capitol even as he watched the violent insurrection on live television at the White House. Asked if the panel was considering recommending criminal charges against Trump, Cheney said: \u201cCertainly we will be looking at that, there are important questions in front of the committee such as whether the action or inaction of former president Trump attempted to obstruct an official proceeding of Congress, attempted to delay the count of electoral votes.\u201d She added: \u201cWe also know that it was a supreme dereliction of duty, the president of the US refuses to take action to stop a violent assault on the Congress, to stop a violent assault on any of the co-equal branches of government, that\u2019s clearly a dereliction of duty.\u201d Trump has asked the US supreme court to block the release by the National Archives to the committee of relevant materials relating to his conduct on 6 January last year and in the run-up to that event, the most serious assault on the US Capitol since the war of 1812. Trump claims he is protected by executive privilege because he was president at the time, a claim rejected by the Biden White House and lower courts. Cheney said: \u201cWe will not let the former president hide behind these phony claims of privilege and we will get to the bottom of \u2026 everything that was going on that day.\u201d Asked if the US came close to the results of the valid presidential election being overthrown, Cheney said the country \u201ccame very close\u201d. \u201cOur institutions held but they only held because of people who were willing to stand up against the pressure from former president Trump, people in his own Department of Justice \u2026 elected officials at the state level who stood up to him and the law enforcement officers here at the Capitol. We need to recognize how important it is \u2026 that it never happens again.\u201d She warned that the \u201cthreat continues\u201d. \u201cToo many in my own party are embracing that former president, are looking the other way, are minimizing the danger \u2026 That\u2019s how democracies die. We simply cannot let that happen,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, in an interview for the New York Times podcast, Cheney confirmed an anecdote from January 6 last year, when she encountered congressman Jim Jordan, a fellow Republican but a far-right loyalist of Trump who had been pushing the lie that Biden did not win the election, on the House floor. Jordan had been standing in the aisle as lawmakers were being escorted away from the encroaching mob, and he said to Cheney, while reaching out to her, the Times relayed: \u201cWe need to get the ladies away from the aisle. Let me help you.\u201d To which she sharply replied, having pushed his proffered hand away, the Times reported and Cheney affirmed: \u201cGet away from me. You fucking did this.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-19T16:30:11Z",
            "content": "Though their relationship on the international calendar means the two have always had a connection, the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup looms particularly large over this year\u2019s AFC Women\u2019s Asian Cup, which kicksoff on Thursday evening when China take on Taiwan at the Mumbai Football Arena. The tournament serves both as the forum to crown a continental champion and for World Cup qualification. Expansion from 24 to 32 nations at next year\u2019s global showpiece event means that five of the 12 competitors in India this month will secure direct qualification, while another two will be able to book places in a 10-team intercontinental play-off for one of three more berths. While the likes of Japan or South Korea are virtually assured of qualification under the new format, the expansion \u2013 along with the withdrawal of North Korea from this year\u2019s cycle \u2013 serves to open the door to others. Nations such as Taiwan can dream of a first World Cup appearance since the inaugural event in 1991 or young stars such as Indonesia\u2019s 20-year-old attacker Zahra Muzdalifah targeting a grander stage. Automatic qualification for 2023 as one of its two co-hosts means Australian stakes in the coming tournament, superficially, have been removed; the Matildas have effectively been given a free hit at continental success. Yet in place of this short-term jeopardy looms a need to address a growing sense of unease surrounding the trajectory of the squad. \u201cOff the back of our Olympic campaign, coming fourth, I think there\u2019s a little bit of expectation for us to win this Asian Cup,\u201d said Matildas defender Ellie Carpenter. \u201cWe should win this Asian Cup. That expectation is there and it\u2019s good for us, we want to win tournaments, we want to win trophies.\u201d After earning some respite from the cynicism that had marked the early stages of Tony Gustavsson\u2019s tenure thanks to their Olympic run, a lack of progress in addressing the side\u2019s ongoing issues in subsequent friendlies has prompted fresh concern. The US\u2019s visit to Australia in November for a series Gustavsson labelled a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the 2023 World Cup final was, off the field, a fine showcase of the excitement surrounding the Matildas and a demonstration of why international women\u2019s football is the hottest ticket in town; the 36,109 fans that packed into a sodden Stadium Australia for the first game of the series set a new standalone record in Australia. Yet on the pitch, the reigning world champions \u2013 despite fielding an understrength side itself undergoing a generational transition \u2013 underlined that the defensive and midfield problems first exposed by Germany and the Netherlands in April remained frustratingly present at year\u2019s end. A 3-0 defeat and 1-1 draw in the two games marked the conclusion of a 2021 calendar in which the Matildas won just three of their 16 games and had shipped 37 goals, at 2.31 a game. It must be acknowledged that 24 of those 37 goals were conceded in friendlies in which the coaching staff expressly prioritised the pursuit of experimentation in approach, the blooding of young talent and the development of a mindset that comes with regularly taking one\u2019s lumps against the world\u2019s best sides. Gustavsson reiterated that, though his sides would always play to win, results were a secondary consideration during this nuanced period and that, while not ideal, the short-term pain would pay off in the long run. Moves such as the deployment of 17-year-old Jessika Nash in the centre of defence against the US in the absence of first-choices Alanna Kennedy and Clare Polkinghorne were deemed necessary in the face of a potentially catastrophic lack of depth in youth exposed by a Football Australia study delivered just before Gustavsson\u2019s tenure commenced. This approach lessened the stakes associated with poor friendly performances, but it also significantly raised them for the Asian Cup. When results are placed low on a side\u2019s hierarchy of needs, it can become difficult to determine if a side is going through the necessary pain of finding a bedrock of future success or attempting to erect a foundation on shifting sands of mistaken assumptions and misplaced confidence. To glean reassurances that it\u2019s the former, a noticeable uptick needs to be demonstrated when, to adopt the parlance of the Swedish coach, the side flicks the switch to transition from \u201cpreparation mode\u201d to \u201cperformance mode\u201d. \u201cWhen we\u2019re in preparation mode I want to make sure that as many players as possible get the opportunity to experience the Matildas\u2019 environment,\u201d Gustavsson said in announcing his squad for the tournament. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 58 players and 13 debutants and that\u2019s what we need to do when we\u2019re in preparation mode. When we go into performance mode it\u2019s all about what\u2019s the best team possible to go and create results in a tournament.\u201d In a practical sense, the indication of this ideological transition has no better example than the return of Aivi Luik to the 23-player squad. The ever-dependable 36-year-old, who had previously retired from international football, is not a pick for the future but should help deliver results now. Gustavsson hinted when announcing his squad that India 2022 has transitioned from being a part of a broader strategy to something approaching a must-win for Football Australia. The Matildas begin their campaign on Friday evening against Indonesia, before facing off against the Philippines on Monday and concluding group play against Thailand late on Thursday. The presence of former coach Alen Staj\u010di\u0107 at the helm of the Philippines will add a layer of intrigue, but comfortable progression to the knockout stages should be straightforward. From there, the spotlight will intensify as the Matildas seek to prove they are on a path that can deliver on the grandest stage."

            "date": "2022-01-26T17:45:45Z",
            "content": "France\u2019s Socialist party presidential candidate, Anne Hidalgo, has vowed to continue her campaign despite indications she has no chance of getting through to the second round of the contest in April. While political analysts and opinion pollsters have written her off, Hidalgo, who is mayor of Paris, said she remained the left\u2019s best hope of leading France. She said it was too late to heal bitter divisions in the left, accusing rivals, including the Greens, of missing an historic chance to join forces. Another five years of Emmanuel Macron would leave France in a dangerously \u201cdeplorable\u201d state, she said. \u201cIt will be ungovernable. It will be unmanageable. He has not understood the French. He has not understood the country. He sees the French as infants: there\u2019s him and a country of children who are waiting for the divine word.\u201d In an exclusive interview with the Guardian and two European newspapers, Hidalgo also questioned the validity of the much-publicised \u201cpeople\u2019s primary\u201d, an unofficial popular vote to designate a preferred left-wing presidential candidate that opens on 27 January and runs until Sunday. Almost 467,000 people have signed up to take part but the main left-wing candidates, Hidalgo, the Green party\u2019s Yannick Jadot, and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon of the hard-left La France Insoumise, refused to take part. Only the former Socialist justice minister Christiane Taubira, who threw her hat into the presidential election ring 11 days ago, has said she will respect the result. \u201cWhatever the result of the vote, M\u00e9lenchon will say, I continue; Jadot will say, I continue; I will say, I continue. The primaire populaire will follow its course but it will have no consequence on my candidacy,\u201d Hidalgo said. Opinion polls have Hidalgo trailing badly with about 3% of intentions to vote, a disastrous score that would leave the Socialist party (PS) in an existential crisis. Any candidates scoring less than 5% of the polled vote in the first round will not have their campaign expenses reimbursed by the taxpayer, making it even more difficult for the party to fund candidates in the general election that follows. In an editorial, Le Monde described the PS as a \u201cdead star\u201d. \u201cThe presidential candidate [Hidalgo] is paying the price for the slow decay of a Socialist party that is now a shadow of its former self with barely 22,000 members,\u201d it wrote. \u201cAnne Hidalgo is not entirely to blame for her underperformance in the presidential election polls, which put her under the 5% required for the campaign expenses to be reimbursed.\u201d Polls currently show Macron likely to be re-elected after facing Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement Nationale (National rally) or the mainstream right Les R\u00e9publicains\u2019 candidate Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse in the second round in April. The hard-right candidate \u00c9ric Zemmour is in fourth place followed by M\u00e9lenchon, Jadot and Hidalgo. Hidalgo hit back at the polling indications. \u201cI am not at 3%,\u201d she said, although she could not give a figure for her support. \u201cI am confident the dynamic can be changed because the actual campaign hasn\u2019t yet started. Emmanuel Macron has not yet declared he is standing and we don\u2019t yet have all the candidates at the starting line. When it kicks off a lot of things will happen very quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s wait for the result of the election in April. Don\u2019t tell me what the result will be today because the opinion polls say this or that. \u201cI\u2019ve been invited on to television programmes and wondered what the hell I was doing there. All they wanted to talk about was the polls, the polls, the polls, while at the same time there were articles explaining how polls were done and how opinion was being largely fabricated by those polls. \u201cPeople told me the problem with the polls was that I wasn\u2019t talking about what really interests the French like immigration and integration, but the French tell me their real concerns are about their spending power, their children\u2019s future, their worries about health \u2026 while all they hear in the media is about Zemmour.\u201d \u00c9meric Br\u00e9hier, director of the Observatoire de la vie politique of the left-leaning Jean-Jaur\u00e8s foundation and a lecturer at the Bordeaux Institute of Political Studies, said he believed the 2022 election was lost for the Socialist party. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for the party to make a mark on this election. Each candidate on the left is swimming in their own lane and none of them wants to budge an inch. The Socialist party is in trouble and has been for several years. I can\u2019t see at this stage how we can get out of that,\u201d he said. Hidalgo agreed the French left had lost its \u201ccompass\u201d and needed to reunite voters behind her 70-point social democrat programme. She said the PS had performed strongly in local elections in 2020 and 2021, and had a reservoir of loyal grassroots support across France. Her biggest regret she said, was Jadot\u2019s refusal to take part in a leftwing primary to select a candidate at the end of 2021. \u201cA primary would have allowed us to put the debate back on to our subjects \u2013 the ecological, social and democratic crisis \u2013 and address the French, especially those of the left, about the subjects that interest them and show that no, the left is not dead,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could have shown what we stand for, what are our differences and what brings us together. It was a big personal risk for me but I said I would accept the result of that vote. It was a historic chance for the left to do this, but they refused. Now it\u2019s not possible.\u201d She added: \u201cNever, never can M\u00e9lenchon or Jadot win the second round. If the left has any chance of winning it\u2019s with me \u2026 only I am capable of reuniting from the centre left to the centre right.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-05T18:16:08Z",
            "content": "More than 40% of Americans still do not believe that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud, according to a new Axios-Momentive poll. The poll, released on the eve of the first anniversary of the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, found that 55% of those surveyed believe Biden won the election. That figure has barely changed since Axios\u2019s poll from 2020, published shortly before the insurrection. That poll, published in 2020, found 58% said that they accepted Biden as the legitimate winner of the presidential election. Despite Biden\u2019s inauguration, the attack on the Capitol and the multiple investigations that have debunked the lies pushed by the former president that the election was stolen, the poll suggests that the same level of doubt persists. \u201cIt\u2019s dispiriting to see that this shocking thing we all witnessed last year hasn\u2019t changed people\u2019s perceptions,\u201d Laura Wronski, senior manager for research science at Momentive, told Axios. A majority of Americans also said they are expecting a repeat of the deadly 6 January attack in the next few years. The polls, conducted from 1 to 5 January of this year, surveyed nearly 2,700 adults, and found nearly 57% \u2013 about half of Republicans and seven in 10 Democrats \u2013 believe that events similar to the attack are likely to occur again. In addition, nearly two-thirds or 63% said that the 6 January attack has at least temporarily changed the way they think about their democratic government. A third said that those changes are temporary. Nearly as many, 31%, said that those changes are permanent. About 37% of those surveyed said they had lost faith in American democracy (48% of Republicans and 28% of Democrats), while 10% said they had never had faith in the system. Forty-nine percent said they did have faith. Fifty-eight per cent of Americans said they supported the investigative work of the House select committee investigating the riot. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats support the inquiry, compared with 58% of independents and 32% of Republicans. Just slightly more than half of American adults, 51%, said individuals associated with the insurrection should face criminal penalties if they refuse to comply with subpoenas. Republicans have also been revealed to be three or four more times as likely as Democrats to say voter fraud is a problem in their state, despite such claims being thoroughly debunked. Wronski said she believes the results of the poll shows either \u201cBiden hasn\u2019t done enough\u201d to push back against disinformation, or \u201cit shows that he never had a chance\u201d. She added: \u201cThe partisan division is still the story.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2022 to correct the breakdown by party of responses related to support for the House select committee investigation, and faith in American democracy."

            "date": "2022-01-15T21:31:03Z",
            "content": "Today\u2019s Opinium poll for the Observer is grim reading for Boris Johnson and his party. Johnson\u2019s personal approvals fall below the worst figures ever recorded by Theresa May; and his party sinks to its worst vote share since the general election, 10 points behind Labour. Majorities of practically every political and demographic group believe Johnson and his colleagues have broken the rules and lied about it, and say Johnson should resign. Until recently, the wobbly wing of the Conservative coalition looked to be better off Remainers in the South of England. Yet today\u2019s poll adds to growing evidence that the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal is jeopardising the party\u2019s support from \u201cred wall\u201d Leavers too. Such voters have long felt disaffected from and distrustful of a political class they felt ignored their concerns and lived by its own rules. The resentments once mobilised against the EU by the promise to \u201cTake Back Control\u201d now have a new target \u2013 an out of touch Downing Street team who partied while the Queen mourned. Johnson himself has shifted from the party\u2019s biggest asset, with a Brexit-fuelled appeal separate to the Conservative brand to its biggest liability, as the revelations of Downing Street revelry in lockdown render him personally toxic with the same voters. The Conservatives may now be damned if they do and damned if they don\u2019t. Sticking with Johnson risks further contaminating the party brand if the scandals continue and voter fury intensifies. Party veterans with memories of the 1990s will recall how hard renewal can become once their party is toxic. Yet replacing Johnson brings its own risks, as none of the front runners for the succession looks likely to replicate his unique appeal with voters otherwise suspicious of the Conservatives. The geography of the electoral battlefield intensifies this dilemma. The voters who switched to the Conservatives in 2019 were clustered in the crucial swing seats, while Labour\u2019s post-Brexit base of young graduates and ethnic minorities was concentrated in seats the party already held. The current scandal-driven collapse could throw the same dynamic into reverse as the voters most angered by shameless rule breaking and barely credible excuse-making flock together in the battleground seats likely to decide the next election. Yet there is little comfort for Johnson\u2019s party in the more traditional Tory strongholds either. The Conservatives are losing even more ground among the better-off, Remain-leaning voters who formed the pre-Brexit base of the party, and whose suspicions of Johnson were only over-ridden in 2019 by fear of a Corbyn government. A slump in both new and old heartlands would be a dire scenario indeed, but one which must be taken seriously in an era where partisan loyalties are weak and voters more volatile than ever. Mid-term blues are common. The Conservatives have trailed Labour badly before only to rebound at election time. But the comeback wins in 2015 and 2019 were both fuelled by recruiting nationalist Eurosceptics from Nigel Farage, and by exploiting voter distrust of unpopular Labour opponents. There is no Farage party to squeeze today, and Keir Starmer\u2019s personal ratings, though mediocre, are better than his predecessor and improving. The Conservatives\u2019 hopes may now rest on whether voters\u2019 longstanding reservations about Labour outweigh their growing anger at a prime minister now widely seen as a liar and a law-breaker unfit for office. A slender reed indeed. Robert Ford is professor of political science at Manchester University."

            "date": "2022-01-24T16:30:20Z",
            "content": "Scott Morrison enters a federal election year with his approval languishing at levels not seen since March 2020, and the Coalition\u2019s handling of the Omicron wave has prompted some voters to signal they are now less likely to back the government on polling day. The first Guardian Essential poll of 2022 confirms the prime minister\u2019s approval rating (46%) hasn\u2019t budged since last December, and disapproval of Morrison is up two points to 46%. The Morrison government had hoped to recover standing with voters over the summer break, but the desired political fillip hasn\u2019t eventuated. The prime minister needs to recover lost ground \u2013 voter approval of Morrison dived 19 points during the controversies and missteps of 2020. While the uptick in voter disapproval of the prime minister during January falls inside the survey\u2019s margin of error, more emphatic is voter disillusionment over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Last December, 41% of respondents rated the federal response to Covid as good. After the challenging summer of Omicron \u2013 with surging case numbers, increased numbers of deaths, and rolling controversy over shortages of rapid antigen tests \u2013 only 35% of respondents think the Morrison government is doing a good job, while 38% (up from 32%) of the sample describes the response as poor. Ominously for the government, Morrison\u2019s performance over the summer has also prompted 37% of respondents to say they are now less likely to vote for the Coalition at the federal election expected in May \u2013 although 19% say events have made it more likely they will stick with the incumbents. The latest data suggests voters are concerned about the surge in cases, and a shortage of rapid antigen tests remains a hot button issue \u2013 38% of respondents say they are less likely to vote for the government based on their handling of that issue. There is significant lived experience in the community \u2013 26% of respondents say they have have tried but have been unable to procure a RAT test in the last month. If the current negative sentiment holds or accelerates, the latest Guardian Essential data suggests the Coalition would go backwards on polling day. Also challenging electorally for Morrison is a plunge in voter approval of the New South Wales government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Only 37% of respondents now rate the Perrottet government\u2019s management of the pandemic as good \u2013 down from 54% in December. Morrison needs the Coalition to poll strongly in New South Wales to secure a fourth term. While the mood has soured in New South Wales, public sentiment appears to have rebounded marginally in Victoria, with 47% saying the Andrews government is doing a good job (up from 43% in December). Voter support for the state responses to the pandemic in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia also went backwards in January as case numbers surged after restrictions lifted. While the new poll shows Morrison and some of his state counterparts have endured a difficult summer, the deportation of tennis star Novak Djokovic was a winner with the Coalition\u2019s base, with 43% of self-identified Liberal and National supporters nominating that controversy as a reason to vote for the Coalition at the looming election. Looking at Labor, Anthony Albanese\u2019s approval and disapproval metrics have not shifted decisively over the summer break. On the latest numbers, 39% of respondents approve of the opposition leader\u2019s performance and 39% disapprove (23% of the sample say they don\u2019t have a view). But Albanese has closed the gap between himself and Morrison in the poll\u2019s better prime minister measure (42% say Morrison is the better prime minister, while 34% say Albanese, which is up three points since December). Voters were also asked about their priorities for government in 2022. Additional health investments topped the list, with 54% of respondents putting that issue in their top three. Nearly half the sample want more investments in systems like aged care and childcare. Next on the list is action to combat global heating, and reducing cost of living pressures."

Volatility soared, as investors also feared the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, would raise interest rates several times this year, starting in March, after US inflation hit a 40-year high of 7% in December. In the City of London, the FTSE 100 index fell 2.6% to a one-month low, its biggest fall in two months, as Boris Johnson warned that a \u201clightning war\u201d in Ukraine was possible but not inevitable. The blue-chip index lost 197 points, falling to 7,297. The educational publisher Pearson led the FTSE 100 fallers, down 9%, with the Russian steelmaker Evraz dropping 8%. Miners, energy producers, travel firms and housebuilders also slid. In Frankfurt, the Dax index of leading German companies lost 3.8%, while France\u2019s Cac shed 4%. The New York stock market saw wild swings. Heavy selling pushed the S&amp;P 500 index down over 3% at one stage, more than 10% below its record high, before a late rally pushed the major US indices higher at the end of the day. Investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as the US dollar, and also the Swiss franc, which hit a six-year high against the euro. The sell-off in risk assets hit cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin falling to a six-month low of about $33,000 (\u00a324,500), less than half its all-time high of $69,000 reached last November. The Fed, which will meet this week, could also start to run down its balance sheet this year, removing some of the stimulus introduced since the Covid pandemic began. \u201cTraders continue to be in selling mode as fears mount surrounding the Russia-Ukraine situation,\u201d said David Madden, a market analyst at Equiti Capital. \u201cAlso playing into the mix are the concerns the Federal Reserve will issue a hawkish update on Wednesday.\u201d The prospect of tighter monetary policy has driven technology stocks lower, with the Nasdaq Composite index dropping into correction territory earlier this month.. \u201cThe double-whammy of risk events is proving too much for Wall Street to handle, with the Nasdaq once again leading the charge lower as the tech rout deepens,\u201d said Fiona Cincotta, a senior financial markets analyst at City Index. \u201cMeanwhile, embassy staff are being pulled out of Kyiv amid growing fears that Russia could send troops into Ukraine imminently. Talks last week between the US and Russia failed to pave the way to a solution. Fears of war are driving the risk-off trade with bonds rising.\u201d There was heavy selling on Moscow\u2019s stock market, with the Moex index of Russian companies tumbling almost 6% to its lowest level since December 2020, taking its losses in 2022 to almost 15%. The rouble hit a one-year low, dropping 2.5% to more than 79 roubles to the US dollar. The Bank of Russia said it was halting purchases of foreign currency in an attempt to ease pressure on the rouble, which has slumped amid tensions over Ukraine. The UK\u2019s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies tumbled by 3.6%, hitting its lowest level since March 2021. The cybersecurity firm Darktrace was down 14.6%, the newspaper publisher Reach fell 11%, while the cinema chain Cineworld and the luxury carmaker Aston Martin dropped 8.7%. Gas prices soared, with the wholesale day-ahead price of UK gas jumping 17%, on concerns that Russian supplies of energy to Europe could be disrupted. There were also signs that the Omicron variant had slowed the global recovery. Private sector growth in the UK and eurozone hit its lowest in 11 months, while US business activity grew at its slowest pace in 18 months in January, according to the latest surveys of purchasing managers."

            "date": "2022-01-10T16:44:34Z",
            "content": "A full invasion of Ukraine, with the aim of pacifying the capital, Kyiv, would result in Vladimir Putin starting a war on a scale not seen since Iraq in 2003 \u2013 prompting western experts to question whether a lasting Russian victory could be achieved. Estimates suggest about 100,000 Russian troops are massing near Ukraine\u2019s borders. Yet, experts following the crisis closely say that for an invasion of the whole country that number would need to nearly double again, and would almost certainly involve forces passing through Belarus. Dr Fred Kagan, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said: \u201cThis will likely require an invasion on a scale not dissimilar to 2003, somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 troops.\u201d He predicted that a force that size could be in position by the end of January. About 175,000 US and other allied troops were involved in the invasion of Iraq. Is occupation possible? Kagan, who co-authored a series of reports that led to the 2007 US troop surge in Iraq, said the real challenge for Putin was how an almost certainly hostile Ukraine may be held by the Russians if there was an insurgency after the capture of Kyiv. A determined operation would require one counter-insurgent per 20 inhabitants, said Kagan in a paper he co-wrote with other experts from the Institute for the Study of War. That \u201cwould suggest a counter-insurgency force requirement on the order of 325,000 personnel\u201d would be needed to hold Kyiv and Ukraine\u2019s major cities in the south and east, they added. Ukraine has an army of 145,000, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS),, but there are also an estimated 300,000 veterans of the low-intensity conflict in the Donbas region of the country that started in 2014. Polling says a third of Ukraine\u2019s citizens would be willing to take up \u201carmed resistance\u201d. Burnt by the Soviet experience in Afghanistan, Russia generally viewed US attempts to hold countries against insurgents as a mistake. \u201cPutin will have studied what happened to the US in Iraq after 2003. The difficulties of dealing with partisan activity keeps my mind open to the possibility that the Russian president does not intend to invade and conquer Ukraine,\u201d Kagan told the Guardian. Russia\u2019s advantages Nevertheless, Moscow has overwhelming advantages in terms of an initial invasion, most notably in terms of rocketry and airpower. Ukraine faces potentially terrifying consequences, in an all-out assault, which could shatter a country\u2019s morale and prompt millions to flee west, rather than fight. Rob Lee, a former US marine and fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: \u201cRussia has the capacity to devastate Ukraine\u2019s military units from afar with weapons such as Iskander ballistic missiles. We almost never see modern weaponry like this unleashed; it gives Russia the capability to inflict thousands of casualties a day.\u201d A military assault will also have a transformational effect on international opinion. Civilian casualties in considerable numbers are almost certain, amounting to an operation unlike almost any Putin has conducted before, including the war with Ukraine in 2014, where responsibility for military action was denied. Dr Samir Puri, a senior fellow at the IISS, who has previously spent a year as a conflict monitor in Ukraine, said: \u201cIt is hard to imagine a full invasion without the use of airpower, but that is such a huge threshold for Russia to cross.\u201d Much has been made about Ukraine\u2019s recent purchase of weapons from the west, but the Javelin antitank missiles have a range of about 1.5 miles (2.5km) and can only delay an mechanised advance. The country has a relatively modest number of Turkish TB2 drones for now, half a dozen or a dozen, tiny compared with Russia\u2019s thousands of tanks, the core of any ground force. Capturing Kyiv Russia also has to decide how to deal with Ukraine\u2019s cities, principally Kyiv, with a population of 3 million, but also Kharkiv in the north-east, with a population of almost 1.5 million. \u201cUrban warfare is hard, it does fearful damage and Russia struggled with it in Aleppo,\u201d Kagan said, citing Putin\u2019s intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war. Speculation about Russia\u2019s plans \u2013 based in part on apparent leaks published in the German newspaper Bild \u2013 suggests the Kremlin would surround Kharkiv and ultimately Kyiv, cutting off supplies, hoping in a medieval fashion they will surrender. That may be less violent but would still undercut the idea of Russia acting as a unifying force. Nor is encircling Kyiv easy, western analysts say. The key points of the city, including the presidential palace, are to the west of the readily defensible Dneiper River. The first bridges south of the city are 60 miles away; a dam four miles north has turned the stretch of the river that runs to the border with Belarus into a lake. Exploiting Belarus The simplest way across the river is to cross in a safe territory \u2013 Belarus to the north. That would require Minsk\u2019s support, which would be highly probable given its recent rapprochement with Moscow. In a speech to mark Orthodox Christmas on 7 January, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said his country would \u201cdo everything\u201d to take back Ukraine. Russian mechanised forces would aim to encircle Kyiv from the west. One route is to cross the Pripet marshes, which freeze in winter, and the Chernobyl area (not deemed a great complication for a modern military able to operate in a radiation zone). An alternative would be to strike from further west in Belarus, such as the Baranovichy training area. A key sign that Russia is ready to act, Kagan said, will be if \u201cRussian mechanised forces deploy to Belarus\u201d. Even if Putin does not invade, a permanent Russian military garrison in Belarus would have advantages to the Kremlin, as an potential threat not just to Ukraine but to the Baltic states to the north. It would \u201ccreate a large military base that would give Russia air dominance over Nato\u2019s eastern flank\u201d, said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow at foreign policy thinktank Chatham House. Putin\u2019s military alternatives The risks inherent in invasion and occupation leave experts such as Dr Taras Kuzio, an associate fellow with the Henry Jackson Society,arguing in a newly released paper that an all-out attack \u201cthe least likely\u201d of the military scenarios available to Putin. Instead, the Ukraine expert sees three other options. In the first, Russia simply occupies and annexes the part of the Donbas controlled by separatists, a partial invasion mirroring the 2008 Georgia crisis. That began, Kuzio wrote, after \u201crepeated military provocations\u201d by proxies \u201cled to intervention by Georgian troops\u201d, giving Putin a pretext to respond. A second is to enlarge the occupied territory with a land corridor to previously annexed Crimea, capturing the coastal city of Mariupol. Russia could also seize other key industrial sites and try to degrade Ukraine\u2019s nearby military. \u201cThey could take out Turkish TB2 drones and artillery in the Donbas\u201d in an overt, limited campaign designed to weaken Ukraine, said Lee. A final option, said Kuzio, is the \u201crevival of the 2014 \u2018New Russia\u2019 project\u201d that would try \u201cto cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea\u201d. This would amount to seizing the south, capturing the port of Odessa and perhaps the industrial city of Dnipro. Taking Odessa, population 1 million, would probably require a dramatic air and naval operation, using paratroopers from Crimea followed by marines landing on nearby beaches. Of those options, annexing occupied Donbas would almost certainly be popular in Russia, However, it would be an extremely limited response given the Kremlin\u2019s insistence that its chief goal, as most recently repeated by Sergei Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, is \u201cthe non-expansion of Nato, the non-accession of Ukraine, Georgia and other countries to the alliance\u201d \u2013 raising concerns that a military campaign is probable. \u201cYou have to take a step back and ask what Russia\u2019s political goals are,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIf Russia wants to force a change in Ukraine\u2019s political orientation, you can see why the Kremlin might look at military options.\u201d"

            "content": "Choral music wafted through the nave of the Cathedral of the Russian Armed Forces as Alexei Rozhkov, a visiting priest, considered the question: was Russia standing on the precipice of a new great conflict in Ukraine? \u201cThere won\u2019t be a war \u2013 there can\u2019t,\u201d he said quickly, glancing up at the skylights of stained glass depicting Soviet medals and religious symbols on the ceiling. The cathedral was built recently as a testament to Russia\u2019s pride in its military glory, ranging from the victory in the second world war to more recent conflicts. A mosaic on one wall glorifies the Russian soldiers who fought in Georgia in 2008 and Syria in 2015, as well as the \u201clittle green men\u201d who annexed Crimea in 2014. But like others there, Rozhkov said he could not see what could motivate Russia to launch an attack on Ukraine today \u2013 despite Vladimir Putin\u2019s public ultimatums to the west and the tanks, missiles and other weapons continuing to make their way to the Ukrainian border. \u201cWhen Russia has gone to war, it\u2019s gone to war for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there is no reason for this bloodshed, there\u2019s nothing worth it in today\u2019s world. What would [people] be fighting for? \u2026 And how can you fight a war without people?\u201d Despite warnings from the US that an attack could be imminent, one would have been hard pressed walking around Moscow to guess that something extraordinary was afoot. \u201cLeaders need to talk tough, this is just hysteria,\u201d said Konstantin Danilin, 36, who had brought his two daughters to go tubing at Park Patriot, an amusement park just outside Moscow opened by the Russian military. \u201cPutin is aggressive: he takes risks, it\u2019s possible he makes mistakes. But this is all just a negotiation.\u201d Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for the subsequent war in Donbas led to a mass mobilisation of Russian society. Pro-government and anti-war marches were held, and families and friends fell into bitter disputes about the conflict. Putin\u2019s popularity rating rode the wave of patriotism to an all-time high. Russian volunteers, mercenaries and soldiers fought and died in the ensuing conflict. Now, as Russia approaches a perhaps even more fateful war, it feels as though the public has barely taken note, despite the warning signs coming from both sides. Denis Volkov, of the Levada Centre, an independent polling agency, said: \u201cWhen this topic comes up in groups in the last two or three months, people say: \u2018Oy, as soon as I hear the word [Ukraine], I just change the channel. I don\u2019t even want to know what\u2019s going on there. Ukraine again, war again, I don\u2019t even want to get into it.\u2019\u201d Levada found in December that a majority of Russians did not believe there would be a larger war in Ukraine. In the same poll, two-thirds of respondents blamed the US, Nato or Ukraine for the escalating tensions. \u201cNobody wants [war] but they\u2019re internally they\u2019ve been prepared for this situation,\u201d Volkov said. Some pundits have pointed towards the lack of a public frenzy in Russia as a sign that the government is not preparing people for a war, although Russia\u2019s continued involvement in the Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts has also taken place with little fanfare. Volkov said the lack of enthusiasm for and attention paid to the conflict might also present the Kremlin with an opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s far more important that people are ready to accept whatever happens,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority will not protest. And that means the government\u2019s hands are free \u2026 It\u2019s apathy and how people will view Russia\u2019s place in this conflict as justified that are important.\u201d Tikhon Dzyadko, the editor-in-chief of the independent TV Rain channel, said he had noticed heightened concern among his circle of friends, many of whom had protested against the outbreak of war in 2014, that a new conflict was coming. But it was understandable why the public reaction could be muted, he said. First, the war has been going on in Ukraine for eight years and Russians have slowly grown used to it. And second, Russian society is so beaten down by the government\u2019s repressive atmosphere that it is hard to imagine any protest taking place right now. On the other side, there is little in the Kremlin\u2019s motivations to galvanise public opinion about the conflict. \u201cNobody understands why there\u2019s been an escalation. And nobody understands who needs this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe absolute majority of people I know don\u2019t want this. It\u2019s not some kind of sacred war against an aggressor that has attacked your country. It\u2019s the realisation of some indescribable geopolitical interests, which may lead to the deaths of people.\u201d There are signs too that even in elite business circles, which have benefited from access to the Kremlin, many people have grown unhappy with the situation. \u201cWhile nobody wants war, don\u2019t expect big business to stand up and voice their opposition,\u201d an investment banker told the Moscow Times this week, speaking anonymously. \u201cWe have become passengers. The business community will only discuss war in their kitchens. Everybody will stay quiet in public.\u201d Perhaps most surprising is the relative silence of Putin, who has largely vanished from the airwaves at a moment when so much depends on his coming decision. The Russian leader has barely addressed the Ukraine crisis since the new year, leaving TV anchors, pundits and Russian diplomats involved in negotiations to lead the nightly newscasts that inform the majority of the public. These shows have had a clear message, noted Volkov, by increasingly portraying the west as unhinged and Russia as the voice of reason. In a monologue this week on state television, the leading pro-Kremlin host Dmitry Kiselyov said: \u201cThey keep harping at us \u2013 you\u2019re about to attack Ukraine. This isn\u2019t about Ukraine. It\u2019s about something much larger.\u201d"

            "content": "The US has warned a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be \u201chorrific\u201d for both sides, while calling for a diplomatic solution as tensions over Moscow\u2019s military buildup on the border of the country continued to simmer. Speaking at the Pentagon on Friday, top US officials urged a focus on diplomacy while saying that Russia now had enough troops and equipment in place to threaten the whole of Ukraine. Any such conflict, warned the top US general, Mark Milley, would be \u201chorrific\u201d for both sides. \u201cIf that was unleashed on Ukraine, it would be significant, very significant, and it would result in a significant amount of casualties,\u201d Milley said. \u201cIt would be horrific, it will be terrible,\u201d the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff added. Speaking alongside Milley, US defense secretary Lloyd Austin said the buildup of Russian forces along Ukraine\u2019s border has reached the point where Putin now has a complete range of military options, including actions short of a full-scale invasion. But Austin said war in Ukraine could still be avoided. \u201cConflict is not inevitable. There is still time and space for diplomacy,\u201d said Austin. \u201cMr Putin can do the right thing as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no reason that this situation has to devolve into conflict. He can choose to de-escalate. He can order his troops away.\u201d On Friday, US president Joe Biden said he would send a small number of US troops to eastern European and Nato countries \u201cin the near term\u201d. The Pentagon has already placed about 8,500 US troops on stand-by for possible deployment to Europe amid Russia\u2019s military build-up near Ukraine\u2019s border. \u201cI\u2019ll be moving troops to eastern Europe and the Nato countries in the near term. Not too many,\u201d Biden told reporters on return to Washington from a speech in Philadelphia. It comes as Vladimir Putin gave his first public comments on US and Nato responses to Russian proposals to rewrite the post-cold war security architecture. Putin said the US and its Nato allies had ignored Russia\u2019s main security concerns, but promised to continue talks with the west, in a call with Emmanuel Macron. The Russian leader said Moscow\u2019s concerns about the expansion of Nato and the deployment of strike weapons near its borders had not been taken into account, according to a Kremlin readout of the phone call with his French counterpart. Macron told Putin that Russia had to respect the sovereignty of states, according to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e. Putin agreed to continue talks, so there was a feeling that \u201cthings have moved\u201d, a French presidency official said. More than 100,000 Russian troops have massed at the border with Ukraine, prompting Biden to tell Zelenskiy on Thursday there was \u201ca distinct possibility that the Russians could invade Ukraine in February\u201d. Asked about the call, Zelenskiy said he did not consider the situation more tense than before. \u201cThere is a feeling abroad that there is war here. That\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not saying an escalation is not possible \u2026 [but] we don\u2019t need this panic.\u201d Europeans have taken a more cautious approach to predictions of a Russian attack than Washington. The head of Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service said on Friday that Russia was not yet fixed on an invasion, although it was prepared. \u201cI believe that the decision to attack has not yet been made,\u201d Bruno Kahl told Reuters. In a call with Macron lasting longer than an hour, Putin said the US and Nato had not taken into account Moscow\u2019s \u201cfundamental concerns\u201d about the expansion of Nato and deployment of strike missiles near the Russian border. Washington and European capitals rejected Russia\u2019s demands to veto Ukraine\u2019s Nato membership, but set out proposals on other ways to improve security on the continent in the unpublished documents. \u201cThe key question was ignored,\u201d Putin was reported to have said, according to the Kremlin statement. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Russia\u2019s relationship with Nato, the Russian president went on to say, were based on the principle that \u201cno one should strengthen their security at the expense of other countries\u201d. The Russian leader also promised to \u201ccarefully study\u201d the US and Nato written responses and continue a \u201cRussian-French dialogue on the entire range of European security questions\u201d. Putin told the French leader Russia would continue talks in the so-called Normandy format that brings together representatives from France, Germany, Ukraine and Russia, following talks earlier this week between the quartet of countries. Putin told Macron that the French president was \u201cthe only one who he could have such serious discussions with\u201d, according to the French presidency source. There was \u201cdisagreement, but agreement in the necessity for dialogue and that the Europeans and France are part of the ongoing dialogue\u201d, said the French official. \u201cDialogue is difficult and there were no solutions from this call.\u201d The French president has long called for dialogue with Russia, sometimes angering other EU member states that have preferred a more distanced approach. Late Friday, British prime minister Boris Johnson said he was planning to visit the Ukraine region and hold crisis talks with Putin next week.

            "date": "2022-01-07T00:01:24Z",
            "content": "The armed forces are being deployed to help hospitals in London deal with a surge in Covid patients because the Omicron variant is leaving so many staff sick and unable to work. Of the 200 military personnel involved, 40 are doctors who will help NHS staff look after patients. The other 160 personnel, who have no medical training, will check in patients, ensure stocks are maintained and would also be \u201cconducting basic checks\u201d, the Ministry of Defence said. Some have already started work and they are expected to support the NHS in the capital until the end of the month. The announcement comes two days after Boris Johnson said he hopes England can \u201cride out\u201d the current wave of Covid-19 without further restrictions, but did acknowledge parts of the NHS would feel \u201ctemporarily overwhelmed\u201d by Omicron. Health union leaders, although grateful for the help, have said this latest move means the government can no longer be \u201cdismissive\u201d of concerns about \u201cdelivering safe care\u201d. Thousands of NHS staff have been off work each week in London, which last month became the first part of the country to see a huge wave of Covid cases caused by the new strain, leaving hospitals struggling to cope with unprecedented levels of staff absence. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of hospitals group NHS Providers, welcomed the assistance from personnel from what is thought to be all three armed forces. But he said that their arrival underlined the extent of NHS understaffing. \u201cTrust leaders will welcome the support of colleagues from the armed forces during what continues to be an incredibly challenging time for the NHS in London. \u201cThe fact that we need to call upon army medics and general duty personnel at all underlines the sheer scale of the workforce challenges the NHS is facing. \u201cThe experience of the pandemic makes plain underlying issues which need resolution \u2013 the need for a national long-term plan for the health and care workforce, ongoing challenges with vacancies and recruitment pre-dating the pandemic by a number of years.\u201d Hospitals elsewhere in England, which are seeing dramatic increases in Covid admissions, may also seek military aid, Hopson added. The news came as the UK reported a further 179,756 Covid cases on Thursday, with the number of people infected with the Omicron variant continuing to increase rapidly. The latest figures \u2013 which reflect infections picked up by testing \u2013 bring the UK total for the past seven days to 1,272,131, up 29% on the week before. The true number of infections is estimated to be substantially higher as not all infections are captured by the testing programme. The data also showed that in England there are 17,988 Covid patients in hospital, up from 15,659 the day before, with a further 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test reported in the UK on Thursday. Military personnel have helped out in hospitals in previous waves of the pandemic and continue to assist the ambulance services in Wales and Scotland and have also been helping the booster programme. The Royal College of Nursing said the deployment proved that the NHS is critically short of staff and asked for assurances that those involved have the skills to help look after patients. \u201cThe government can no longer deny the staffing crisis in the NHS. The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care,\u201d said Patricia Marquis, its nursing director for England. \u201cOnce the military has been brought in, where does the government turn next in a bid to \u2018ride out\u2019 the wave rather than deal with it? \u201cNursing staff might welcome any extra help at work right now, but we need to know that the government isn\u2019t compromising patient and professional standards in any way.\u201d Hopson earlier said soaring infection rates in the north of England mean that one NHS trust expects to have 30% more Covid cases next week than it had at the last peak. He fears that hospitals outside the capital will not be as able to cope with the new wave of admissions as those in London. He said this was because they had deeper staffing problems, higher levels of sickness and absence, older populations and in some cases worse social care provision. Some trusts outside London have as many as 19% of their staff absent because of Covid, much higher than the 10% off sick or isolating that other NHS organisations have been reporting, he added."

            "content": "In the heady days between Donald Trump\u2019s defeat in November 2020 and the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, an executive order was prepared. It commanded the defense secretary to seize voting machines in battleground states, as part of Trump\u2019s \u201cbig lie\u201d that the vote was rigged. The draft executive order, obtained and published by Politico, was never sent and its author is unknown. It was part of a cache of documents handed over to the House committee investigating the January 6 violence, after the supreme court ruled this week that Trump could not shield himself from oversight on grounds of executive privilege. The disclosure of the draft order adds to evidence of the lengths to which Trump and his close advisers were prepared to go to keep him in the White House, against the will of the American people. Under the draft order, the defense secretary would have been required to carry out an assessment of the voting machines \u201cno later than 60 days from commencement of operations\u201d. That would have pushed the chaos that Trump assiduously attempted to sow around Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate victory well beyond the handover of power at the inauguration on 20 January. The publication of the document will provoke intense speculation as to who wrote it. Politico pointed out that at the time the draft order was dated, 16 December 2020, the idea of seizing voting machines in key states was being vigorously promoted by Sidney Powell, a controversial lawyer who had Trump\u2019s ear at the time. The document outlines the seizure of voting machines by the Pentagon under federal emergency powers. That would in itself have been incendiary, as it would have amounted to a dramatic display of federal over state power of the sort normally fiercely resisted by Republicans. The author of the draft order seeks to justify such a contentious move by regurgitating conspiracy theories. For example, pointing to voting machines, the document says there is \u201cevidence of international and foreign interference in the November 3, 2020, election\u201d. It names Dominion Voting Systems, a leading provider of voting machines that has become the target of rightwing conspiracy theorists and big lie merchants. Dominion has sued several purveyors of false claims that its products were used to swing the election from Trump to Biden. \u201cDominion Voting Systems and related companies are owned or heavily controlled and influenced by foreign agents, countries, and interests,\u201d the draft order falsely claims. The draft also singles out Antrim county, Michigan. Claims that voting machines in that county were compromised have been thoroughly rebutted, including by state election authorities. A second document was also leaked to Politico from the new mountain of paperwork received by the January 6 committee. Titled Remarks on National Healing, it appears to be the text of a speech Trump never delivered. The tone of the speech is striking because it stands in stark contrast to the approach Trump actually adopted in the wake of the Capitol violence. Still president for two weeks, he attempted to belittle the significance of the day. Had this alternative speech been given, Trump would have sent out a very different message. It describes January 6 as a \u201cheinous attack\u201d that left him \u201coutraged and sickened by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem\u201d. The text added: \u201cThe Demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy.\u201d"

            "content": "MPs have expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the leaking of price-sensitive information before Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget last year and warned the chancellor his package of measures risked adding to Britain\u2019s already surging inflation rate. The influential all-party Treasury committee called for Sunak to investigate how details of a planned increase in the national living wage to \u00a39.50 an hour were disclosed in the runup to the budget in late October. \u201cWe are deeply concerned that the rate of the national living wage was disclosed to ITV in an unauthorised fashion prior to the budget, and we agree with the Treasury that this could have caused confusion in the market as to whether the information was accurate,\u201d the MPs said. \u201cGiven the potential opportunity for disruption that this unauthorised leak could have caused, the government should investigate how this policy came to be leaked prior to the budget and should publicise its findings.\u201d Tom Scholar, the permanent secretary to the Treasury, wrote to the committee saying he did not believe the wage hike announcement for workers aged over 25 constituted market-sensitive information because it was an \u201ceconomy-wide measure\u201d. However, the committee said it believed the announcement could be seen as market sensitive because it affected certain companies with high numbers of low-paid workers compared with other businesses. Publishing its report on Sunak\u2019s combined budget and spending review, the MPs said the chancellor\u2019s decisions \u2013 including the planned increase in national insurance contributions \u2013 would add to inflationary pressure and make it harder to cut taxes before the next election. Mel Stride, the committee\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cWith inflation rising significantly, concerns about pressure on the cost of living are growing. While the prime minister\u2019s ambition to promote high wage growth is worthy, focusing on increasing wages without improving productivity is likely to be inflationary, and risks contributing to a wage price spiral.\u201d Increases in NI and corporation tax, together with the freezing of income tax personal allowances, will leave taxes as a share of national income at their highest in 70 years, but Stride said the scope for reducing them might be limited. \u201cThe chancellor has stated his ambition to cut taxes before the end of the parliament. In October, there was little room for manoeuvre, but there has been positive news from the public finances since then. While further good news may help him achieve this ambition, significant risks remain, most notably from the impact of inflation.\u201d The MPs also questioned Sunak\u2019s decision to offer less generous post-Brexit support to the UK\u2019s struggling regions than had been provided by the EU. Noting the government\u2019s shared prosperity fund would provide 60% of the funding from EU structural investment funds, the report said: \u201cIf the new fund is intended to be one of \u201cthe centrepieces\u201d of the government\u2019s ambition, it is surprising that the size of the fund is being reduced to such an extent. The government will need to demonstrate how these reduced funds will achieve their defined metrics for levelling up.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said:\u201cThe budget and spending review set out a plan to create a stronger economy for the British people. \u201cIt balanced delivering on the people\u2019s priorities with keeping the public finances on a sustainable path, ensuring future generations aren\u2019t burdened by even higher debt.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-24T07:00:44Z",
            "content": "Q I am a single first-time buyer in Wales and am struggling to get my foot on the housing ladder. I am currently 29, have saved up \u00a350,000 and think the maximum mortgage I could get by myself is \u00a3140,000. I currently rent a house from friends, so have been able to save a bit each month, but I am very aware that my savings are not keeping up with house prices or inflation. As in many places, the property market has ballooned here and there are very few houses for sale within my price range. The ones that are in my price range aren\u2019t where I want to live long term and don\u2019t look particularly easy to sell on, which concerns me. I am now considering whether I should borrow more money from my parents to bolster my deposit and stretch for a \u00a3210,000 property so I can buy something that gives me more options such as renting out a room or Airbnb. However, I am concerned that with wages stagnating and interest rates and the cost of living set to rise that things could get financially sticky. There\u2019s also the property price bubble. I appreciate that you need a crystal ball to answer these with certainty but my questions are: am I better off buying something within budget or stretching myself for something that I want to live in longer term? Or am I better off waiting, continuing to rent and investing my money elsewhere? AN A There is one thing I can say with total certainty: you shouldn\u2019t buy in an area where you don\u2019t want to live long term and where you think properties don\u2019t look easy to sell on. If you did, you would regret it. I can also be certain that in purely financial terms you are better off upfront buying something within your original budget. If you stay within budget and buy a property costing \u00a3190,000 (your deposit of \u00a350,000 plus a mortgage of \u00a3140,000) you will pay \u00a3350 in land transaction tax (LTT) \u2013 the equivalent of stamp duty land tax in Wales. If you buy a \u00a3210,000 property, your LTT bill will be \u00a31,050. Note that Wales doesn\u2019t have first-time buyer relief from LTT whereas first-time buyers in England do get SDLT relief on the first \u00a3300,000 of the price of a property costing up to \u00a3500,000. However, if stretching your budget would mean that you could buy somewhere where you would be happy to live for several years \u2013 especially if it meant that you could have a lodger, for example, who could help with the extra cost \u2013 it could make more financial sense in the long term. While I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to compromise on buying in an area you would be happy to live, you may need to make compromises in other aspects. Would you be prepared to buy a flat rather than a house, for example? If you would be happy in a new-build property, would you consider stretching your budget by making use of the Help to Buy Wales scheme which runs until March 2023 (but doesn\u2019t let you sublet any part of the property)? Finally, it might cheer you up to know that the mortgage lender Halifax\u2019s crystal ball suggests that house prices may rise by only 2% in 2022 or even not rise at all. So waiting before you buy shouldn\u2019t be too detrimental if an afternoon with your calculator shows that stretching your budget isn\u2019t an option. \u2022 Want expert help finding your new mortgage?

            "date": "2022-01-23T16:30:26Z",
            "content": "The New South Wales government could be forced to spend another $4.1bn over the next decade to address \u201csignificant uncertainties\u201d surrounding a controversial $40bn rail corporation it set up to inflate the state\u2019s budget bottom line. The auditor general, Margaret Crawford, has given the long-awaited signoff on the state\u2019s finances after a three-month delay caused by concerns surrounding the establishment of the Transport Asset Holding Entity, or Tahe, which holds $40bn in NSW rail assets. Crawford in 2021 delayed the release of the state\u2019s audited finances as a result of \u201csignificant accounting issues\u201d with Tahe \u2013 a move that forced the state to inject $1.1bn into the transport system to meet the auditor\u2019s concerns. While she has now signed off on the state\u2019s finances, the auditor has flagged that significant uncertainties remain surrounding the financial assumptions underpinning Tahe. In comments attached to the state\u2019s finances, Crawford noted that predictions outlined by NSW Treasury remained \u201chighly dependent\u201d on revenue which \u201cmay not eventuate\u201d, and revealed taxpayers would need to contribute another $4.1bn over the next decade to satisfy accounting standards associated with Tahe. The NSW government established Tahe in 2015 as a way of transferring the state\u2019s $40bn rail assets out of the hands of the transport department and into a state-owned corporation. The decision had significant benefits for the government\u2019s bottom line. Because Tahe could lease the state\u2019s rail assets back to service operators such as Sydney Trains, the government could classify funding to the corporation as \u201cequity injections\u201d which did not have a negative impact on the budget. But under accounting rules, Tahe was required to show both that the entity remained entirely independent of the government and that it would turn a profit. In November, the auditor said \u201csignificant accounting issues\u201d remained with the body, and delayed signing off on the state\u2019s finances. \u201cWe are not in a position to sign the audit,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cThe matters are very complex and there are a lot of discussions going on around these matters.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The auditor\u2019s concerns meant that in December the NSW government was forced to provide $1.1bn in additional funding to the state\u2019s transport department to pay for a huge increase in fees paid to Tahe for access to the state\u2019s rail assets. The increase was confirmed in a heads of agreement deal signed on 18 December 2021 between Tahe and its \u201ccustomers\u201d, the state\u2019s rail networks. \u201cThe heads of agreement reflects Tahe\u2019s intention to negotiate higher access and licence fees to deliver on shareholder\u2019s expectation of a return of 2.5% and includes proposed indicative future access and licence fees,\u201d the auditor noted in her report. In the report, the auditor general revealed the $1.1bn in extra funding only extended to the 2024-25 financial year and that another $4.1bn would be required over the life of the 10-year agreement. That additional funding had been \u201cbroadly communicated\u201d to the government\u2019s expenditure review committee \u201cbut is yet to be provided for in government budget figures\u201d, she wrote. \u201cAs described in the 2020-21 half year review, for the period to 2024-25 an additional $1.1bn has been allocated to Transport for NSW to be provided to rail operators consistent with the updated shareholder expectations for Tahe,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile the half year review does not embed approved funding beyond 2024-25, the heads of agreement attaches an indicative financial profile which indicates access and licence fees increase by an additional $4.1 billion over the following six years.\u201d She also wrote that a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of the revenue required to meet accounting standards was outside the 10-year contact \u201cand there is a risk that Tahe will not be able to re-contract for access and licence fees at a level that is consistent with current projections\u201d. \u201cThere is also a risk that funding for Tahe\u2019s key customers will not be sufficient to fund payment of access and licence fees at a level that is consistent with current projections,\u201d Crawford wrote. On Sunday, the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, trumpeted the release of the \u201cunqualified audit opinion\u201d as evidence the government had provided \u201ca true and accurate reflection of the financial position of the state\u201d. \u201cWhat this shows is that, despite claims to the contrary, the NSW finances are now validated and verified as accurate by the NSW auditor general based on her unqualified opinion,\u201d Kean said. But Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, said the auditor general\u2019s comments showed taxpayers would be forced to \u201cplunge even further into debt to stop Tahe from unravelling the state\u2019s finances\u201d. Labor claims the cost to the budget is likely to be nearer to $7bn over the life of the agreement with the state\u2019s rail operators based on projected access fees included in the finances. \u201cTahe was always a budget con. But now it\u2019s become a full-blown budget disaster,\u201d Mookhey said. \u201cEvery dollar spent on Tahe is a dollar denied to the tens of thousands of small businesses fighting to survive the Omicron lockdown. Those businesses deserve the extra $4.1bn Mr Perrottet is paying Tahe \u2013 especially since Tahe is nothing more than an accounting sham.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-10T14:06:51Z",
            "content": "Fears are growing among experts, politicians, and former generals about the rise of rightwing extremism in the US military and the potential threat it could pose to American democracy. Even as the US Department of Defense issues new policies to root out extremism in its ranks, some experts caution that the safeguards don\u2019t go far enough, leaving the next election vulnerable to attack as well as fears about a broader violent \u201cinsurgency\u201d by rightwing radicals. \u201cWe\u2019re behind the ball on what we know about domestic terrorists in the United States,\u201d Paul Eaton, a retired US army major general and senior adviser to the non-profit VoteVets, said. Eaton and two other retired army generals recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post last month warning of the threat of a coup in the 2024 election. The generals warned that it could succeed with the aid of rogue military elements. They contemplated the possibility of a breakdown of the chain of command, along partisan lines, in the aftermath of a contested election with \u201crogue units organizing among themselves to support the \u2018rightful\u2019 commander in chief\u201d. Eaton said in an interview that the American military and law enforcement have a history of underestimating the threat from the far right. \u201cIt\u2019s the Timothy McVeigh problem: what did we know about McVeigh and what were we doing about it?\u201d said Eaton. The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people and injured over 650 when one morning ex-army soldiers Timothy McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry Nichols parked a rental truck filled with homemade explosives outside a federal building and detonated it. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The two men harbored anti-government and racist beliefs. \u201cThe McVeighs of the world are still there, we had about 4,500 of them crawling all over the nation\u2019s Capitol [during the 6 January attack],\u201d said Eaton, who added that the increased power of the internet and rise of social media had boosted the threat massively since McVeigh\u2019s attack. \u201cThe infection of extremism into our state and local police and our armed forces is a very serious concern that needs to be monitored,\u201d said Eaton. Eaton added: \u201cThere\u2019s a recruiting effort going on locally, they\u2019re going to school boards, like missionaries sent to the islands to convert people. The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are definitely recruiting.\u201d In many ways the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol in Washington DC laid bare the vulnerability of US service members to extremism. The 727 defendants charged in the 6 January Capitol riot include 81 with ties to the military, while five were active-duty service members. A 35-year-old woman, air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, was fatally shot while attempting to break the doors into the House chamber. The appeal of extremism among active duty and veterans is a longstanding issue with a track record of violent incidents. Last year army private Ethan Phelan Melzer confessed to prosecutors in the southern district of New York to plotting an attack on fellow soldiers in his unit. The federal indictment states that Melzer confessed to sharing sensitive information about his soon-to-deploy unit with members of a neo-Nazi group in order to facilitate an attack that would \u201cresult in the deaths of as many of his fellow service members as possible\u201d. In 2018 marine lance corporal Vasillios Pistolis was imprisoned after assaulting people at the 2017 Charlottesville \u201cUnite The Right\u201d rally. Pistolis was discovered to belong the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen after bragging about violence in chats with other Atomwaffen members, which were eventually leaked. From 1990 to July 2021 there have been at least 354 people with military backgrounds that have committed criminal acts motivated by \u201cpolitical, economic, social, or religious goals\u201d according to data collected by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. The data suggest the problem is growing in the US as from 1990-2010 there was an average of six cases a year, but over the last decade \u201cthat number has more than tripled to nearly 21 subjects per year\u201d. The generals\u2019 public call for elections safeguards in the military comes as the Pentagon issued new guidelines aimed at rooting out extremism in its ranks. The defense chief, Lloyd Austin, ordered a 60-day \u201cstand down\u201d early last year to come up with rules to stomp out extremism among the military\u2019s various branches. The new rules adopted by the Pentagon last month specify that service members are prohibited from engaging in extremist activities and could face disciplinary action for even \u201cliking\u201d extremist content on social media. The new guidance specifies that commanders must not be \u201cindifferent\u201d and hold service members who participate in extremist activity accountable. The Pentagon defines extremism as advocacy for violence to achieve goals that are \u201cpolitical, religious, discriminatory, or ideological in nature\u201d. It includes efforts to overthrow the government and advocating widespread unlawful discrimination \u201cbased on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender identity, or sexual orientation\u201d. But the Pentagon\u2019s effort towards stomping out extremism in the military may not go far enough. An Associated Press investigation found the new guidelines fail to account for racism among the ranks, membership in groups such as the KKK, and longstanding racial disparities in military justice. The new guidelines don\u2019t prohibit membership in extremist groups like the KKK as long as they are not \u201cactively participating\u201d. The new rules attempt to police acts rather than associations or beliefs. Some former military figures say it\u2019s absurd to allow service members to also be members of violent extremist groups. \u201cSeriously? You want to be in a foxhole with a guy who\u2019s a member of the KKK? Is that really what we want to do here?\u201d said Eaton. \u201cThe idea of service members having to be in close proximity to card-carrying members of the Proud Boys, as long as they don\u2019t \u2018march\u2019, that just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d he added. Some experts also criticize the approach as ignoring the very real threat of white supremacists. \u201cIt reflects the institutional bias that permeates all of our government, that even calling out white supremacy is politically fraught,\u201d said Mike German, a former FBI special agent and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. German is concerned the classification has the potential for unintended consequences. \u201cIt opens the door to a strange political \u2018both sides-ism\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequence is that somebody expressing anti-racism can be seen as an extremist under that description.\u201d Experts see the far right and other extremists as actively trying to recruit members of the military, including foreign agents seeking to promote disruption within the US. \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of an insurgency in the Untied States,\u201d said Kristofer Goldsmith, an Iraq war veteran and researcher. In a 200-page report published by Vietnam Veterans of America, Goldsmith found that between 2017 and 2019 foreign entities, such as Russian hackers, \u201ccoordinated online targeting of American service members, veterans, and their families\u201d in an effort to disrupt American democracy. \u201cWe found 10 different ways foreign entities were targeting veterans online,\u201d said Goldsmith, including through ads, fake veteran accounts that sent friend request to other veterans in order to penetrate the \u201crelatively small community of veteran advocates, and found large social media pages run by foreign admins that spread disinformation tailored to veterans in a effort to influence the election\u201d. Goldsmith sees anti-democratic, white supremacist and fascist movements targeting veterans for the same reason as foreign adversaries. \u201cVeterans are an economically efficient target for campaigns, because if you get one, they often bring their immediate social circle with them,\u201d said Goldsmith. Goldsmith warns that the coming election is vulnerable to a rising insurgency. \u201cWe saw a violent insurrection, we did not experience a peaceful transfer of power. It was an attempted coup. Every failed coup is just practice for the next one,\u201d said Goldsmith."

            "content": "\u201cThis [fuel facility] is not the eighth wonder of the world. It is Frankenstein\u2019s monster. And we have to kill it before it kills us.\u201d This is the plea from Marti Townsend, one of more than 1,000 Hawai\u2019i residents urging the Honolulu City Council to take action to protect our island\u2019s most important resource: fresh, clean water. Frankenstein\u2019s monster is the US Navy\u2019s Red Hill Fuel Storage Facility: a massive underground \u201cfarm\u201d of 18-million liter fuel tanks and pipes just 100 feet above metropolitan O\u2019ahu. Its construction began before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Since then, it has leaked over 180,000 gallons of petroleum into the groundwater aquifer that provides drinking water for over 400,000 residents and visitors from H\u0101lawa to Hawai\u02bbi Kai. Despite its longstanding threat to water systems, this decrepit facility has been in use until operations were \u201cpaused\u201d in late November, after hundreds of military families reported rashes, headaches, nausea, vomiting \u2013 symptoms of petroleum poisoning. The Navy denied these facts for days. \u201cWe have no immediate indication that the water is unsafe to drink,\u201d their representatives said, even after the Navy had quietly shut down its own drinking water well. Pearl Harbor\u2019s commander even told our community \u2013 of sick families, pregnant women and nursing moms \u2013 that \u201cmy staff and I are drinking the water on base.\u201d Hawai\u2018i\u2019s Health Department finally stepped in, advising Navy water system users not to drink their tap water. Navy officials still refuse to acknowledge that this is a crisis. It views the Governor\u2019s emergency order to de-fuel the Red Hill Facility as a mere \u201crequest,\u201d and has enlisted top Navy lawyers to make sure its 600m liters of petroleum stay perched above our water supply. A military spouse in our legal proceedings this week sobbed as she described the family dog rejecting its water dish for days. Another mother teared up as she remembered her infant child vomiting constantly after the Navy advised that her water was safe (it wasn\u2019t); their own beloved and once-healthy dog had to be put down, after thousands of dollars could not diagnose its sudden debilitating illness. The Navy\u2019s Assistant Secretary, in his subsequent remote testimony from the nation\u2019s capital, even had the gall to complain that he had missed that night\u2019s weekly American football game. The injustice of the Red Hill tragedy reflects the impunity of the US military \u2013 not only in its endless wars in the Middle East, but right here in Hawai\u2019i. A fraction of the US\u2019s $768bn defense budget could help boost our ailing and inequitable healthcare system, provide free college for all, or make the investments needed to halve our carbon emissions and help keep entire countries from heartbreaking devastation. Yet every year our politicians pour ever more taxpayer dollars into the planet\u2019s most expensive, and deadly, machine. Not even Hawai\u2018i\u2019s federal delegation has been to stand up to this mighty power. Their long-due request to the US federal government has been milquetoast: we need more studies, and we need to fix some pipes. Only Representative Kai Kahele, the only Hawai\u2018i delegate with military experience, has acknowledged that the facility must be defueled. The US commander-in-chief, President Joe Biden, has yet to even acknowledge the situation. Frankenstein\u2019s monster is not just the facility: it is the larger US military machine. America\u2019s elected leaders are unable and unwilling to rein in this monster that consumes ever more of the country\u2019s resources as it poisons our atmosphere and now, our island\u2019s water. These leaders dare to call themselves representatives of the people while allegedly lying under oath, letting military families be poisoned, and sacrificing entire islands of US citizens. While America\u2019s Frankenstein may consume its creator, the people of Hawai\u2018i will resist it. We think about the ones we love, our children and grandchildren, and what we would do to protect them from harm. Our weapons are not guns and ships but words, signs, songs, and aloha \u02bb\u0101ina, love for our home, for each other. Native Hawaiians, whose ancestors have always understood the importance of wai, of water, who have fought and died and won against the US Navy before, are now leading the fight to fix a mess they had no hand in making. \u201cHistory will remember the people that stood up,\u201d Dr Kamanamaikalani Beamer recently told a crowd of several hundred at the steps of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s capitol, by the statue of Hawai\u2018i\u2019s last queen, herself unlawfully deposed by the US Navy. \u201cWe will regain control and authority over our resources to do what is pono (just) because we must preserve them for the generations to come. There are more battles on this issue. We\u2019re not making suggestions to the military. We are making demands.\u201d Wayna Tanaka is Director for the Sierra Club of Hawai\u2019i"

Even as the US Department of Defense issues new policies to root out extremism in its ranks, some experts caution that the safeguards don\u2019t go far enough, leaving the next election vulnerable to attack as well as fears about a broader violent \u201cinsurgency\u201d by rightwing radicals. \u201cWe\u2019re behind the ball on what we know about domestic terrorists in the United States,\u201d Paul Eaton, a retired US army major general and senior adviser to the non-profit VoteVets, said. Eaton and two other retired army generals recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post last month warning of the threat of a coup in the 2024 election. The generals warned that it could succeed with the aid of rogue military elements. They contemplated the possibility of a breakdown of the chain of command, along partisan lines, in the aftermath of a contested election with \u201crogue units organizing among themselves to support the \u2018rightful\u2019 commander in chief\u201d. Eaton said in an interview that the American military and law enforcement have a history of underestimating the threat from the far right. \u201cIt\u2019s the Timothy McVeigh problem: what did we know about McVeigh and what were we doing about it?\u201d said Eaton. The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people and injured over 650 when one morning ex-army soldiers Timothy McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry Nichols parked a rental truck filled with homemade explosives outside a federal building and detonated it. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The two men harbored anti-government and racist beliefs. \u201cThe McVeighs of the world are still there, we had about 4,500 of them crawling all over the nation\u2019s Capitol [during the 6 January attack],\u201d said Eaton, who added that the increased power of the internet and rise of social media had boosted the threat massively since McVeigh\u2019s attack. \u201cThe infection of extremism into our state and local police and our armed forces is a very serious concern that needs to be monitored,\u201d said Eaton. Eaton added: \u201cThere\u2019s a recruiting effort going on locally, they\u2019re going to school boards, like missionaries sent to the islands to convert people. The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are definitely recruiting.\u201d In many ways the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol in Washington DC laid bare the vulnerability of US service members to extremism. The 727 defendants charged in the 6 January Capitol riot include 81 with ties to the military, while five were active-duty service members. A 35-year-old woman, air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, was fatally shot while attempting to break the doors into the House chamber. The appeal of extremism among active duty and veterans is a longstanding issue with a track record of violent incidents. Last year army private Ethan Phelan Melzer confessed to prosecutors in the southern district of New York to plotting an attack on fellow soldiers in his unit. The federal indictment states that Melzer confessed to sharing sensitive information about his soon-to-deploy unit with members of a neo-Nazi group in order to facilitate an attack that would \u201cresult in the deaths of as many of his fellow service members as possible\u201d. In 2018 marine lance corporal Vasillios Pistolis was imprisoned after assaulting people at the 2017 Charlottesville \u201cUnite The Right\u201d rally. Pistolis was discovered to belong the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen after bragging about violence in chats with other Atomwaffen members, which were eventually leaked. From 1990 to July 2021 there have been at least 354 people with military backgrounds that have committed criminal acts motivated by \u201cpolitical, economic, social, or religious goals\u201d according to data collected by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. The data suggest the problem is growing in the US as from 1990-2010 there was an average of six cases a year, but over the last decade \u201cthat number has more than tripled to nearly 21 subjects per year\u201d. The generals\u2019 public call for elections safeguards in the military comes as the Pentagon issued new guidelines aimed at rooting out extremism in its ranks. The defense chief, Lloyd Austin, ordered a 60-day \u201cstand down\u201d early last year to come up with rules to stomp out extremism among the military\u2019s various branches. The new rules adopted by the Pentagon last month specify that service members are prohibited from engaging in extremist activities and could face disciplinary action for even \u201cliking\u201d extremist content on social media. The new guidance specifies that commanders must not be \u201cindifferent\u201d and hold service members who participate in extremist activity accountable. The Pentagon defines extremism as advocacy for violence to achieve goals that are \u201cpolitical, religious, discriminatory, or ideological in nature\u201d. It includes efforts to overthrow the government and advocating widespread unlawful discrimination \u201cbased on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender identity, or sexual orientation\u201d. But the Pentagon\u2019s effort towards stomping out extremism in the military may not go far enough. An Associated Press investigation found the new guidelines fail to account for racism among the ranks, membership in groups such as the KKK, and longstanding racial disparities in military justice. The new guidelines don\u2019t prohibit membership in extremist groups like the KKK as long as they are not \u201cactively participating\u201d. The new rules attempt to police acts rather than associations or beliefs. Some former military figures say it\u2019s absurd to allow service members to also be members of violent extremist groups. \u201cSeriously? You want to be in a foxhole with a guy who\u2019s a member of the KKK? Is that really what we want to do here?\u201d said Eaton. \u201cThe idea of service members having to be in close proximity to card-carrying members of the Proud Boys, as long as they don\u2019t \u2018march\u2019, that just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d he added. Some experts also criticize the approach as ignoring the very real threat of white supremacists. \u201cIt reflects the institutional bias that permeates all of our government, that even calling out white supremacy is politically fraught,\u201d said Mike German, a former FBI special agent and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice. German is concerned the classification has the potential for unintended consequences. \u201cIt opens the door to a strange political \u2018both sides-ism\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequence is that somebody expressing anti-racism can be seen as an extremist under that description.\u201d Experts see the far right and other extremists as actively trying to recruit members of the military, including foreign agents seeking to promote disruption within the US. \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of an insurgency in the Untied States,\u201d said Kristofer Goldsmith, an Iraq war veteran and researcher. In a 200-page report published by Vietnam Veterans of America, Goldsmith found that between 2017 and 2019 foreign entities, such as Russian hackers, \u201ccoordinated online targeting of American service members, veterans, and their families\u201d in an effort to disrupt American democracy. \u201cWe found 10 different ways foreign entities were targeting veterans online,\u201d said Goldsmith, including through ads, fake veteran accounts that sent friend request to other veterans in order to penetrate the \u201crelatively small community of veteran advocates, and found large social media pages run by foreign admins that spread disinformation tailored to veterans in a effort to influence the election\u201d. Goldsmith sees anti-democratic, white supremacist and fascist movements targeting veterans for the same reason as foreign adversaries. \u201cVeterans are an economically efficient target for campaigns, because if you get one, they often bring their immediate social circle with them,\u201d said Goldsmith. Goldsmith warns that the coming election is vulnerable to a rising insurgency. \u201cWe saw a violent insurrection, we did not experience a peaceful transfer of power. It was an attempted coup. Every failed coup is just practice for the next one,\u201d said Goldsmith."

            "date": "2022-01-07T16:09:14Z",
            "content": "Japan is to introduce limits on bar and restaurant opening times in three areas in an attempt to stem a surge in coronavirus cases that has been linked to US military bases. The measures \u2013 officially described as a quasi-state of emergency \u2013 will go into effect from Sunday until the end of the month in Okinawa, home to more than half of the US service personnel based in Japan, and parts of the western prefectures of Hiroshima and Yamaguchi, which also host American troops. The prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has come under increasing pressure this week to address outbreaks that began at US military facilities last month and have since spread to the local civilian population. US military authorities on Thursday announced stricter Covid-19 measures, including mandatory mask wearing off base and stronger testing regimes. New cases have surged in Okinawa, Japan\u2019s southernmost prefecture, since the start of the year, rising from 51 last Saturday to a record 1,414 on Friday. Those numbers do not include new infections found among US military personnel and their families. \u201cThis number will likely stay high and steadily increase,\u201d said the governor of Okinawa, Denny Tamaki, who has publicly criticised the US military over its response to outbreaks at local bases. Tamaki now has the power to ask restaurants and bars in Okinawa to reduce their opening hours. While the measures are voluntary, establishments that refuse to comply can face fines. The measures approved on Friday will be the first in Japan since last September, when a dramatic fall in cases prompted the government to end months of restrictions in many parts of the country. Infections have also been on the rise in the larger cities. Tokyo reported 922 new cases on Friday, the most since 15 September, prompting officials to direct restaurants to reduce the number of people in groups of diners from eight to four. While Japan\u2019s coronavirus caseload is much smaller than the US, the UK and other comparable countries, experts said people should expect a steady rise in infections, including those of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. \u201cGiven the sudden surge in infections, the medical system runs the risk of suffering a heavy burden in the near future,\u201d Daishiro Yamagiwa, the minister in charge of Japan\u2019s Covid-19 responses, said at a government panel meeting. New infections exceeded 4,000 across Japan on Thursday, compared with an average of about 200 a day last month. The Omicron variant has been identified in 80% of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures, weeks after the country imposed a ban on all overseas arrivals except Japanese citizens and returning foreign residents. \u201cThere are cases where there is no history of overseas travel and the route of infection is unknown, while the Delta strain also continues to spread,\u201d said Shigeyuki Goto, the health minister. \u201cWe must be prepared for the rapid spread of infections in the future.\u201d"

            "title": "What would be Russia\u2019s military options in Ukraine?",
            "date": "2022-01-10T16:44:34Z",
            "content": "A full invasion of Ukraine, with the aim of pacifying the capital, Kyiv, would result in Vladimir Putin starting a war on a scale not seen since Iraq in 2003 \u2013 prompting western experts to question whether a lasting Russian victory could be achieved. Estimates suggest about 100,000 Russian troops are massing near Ukraine\u2019s borders. Yet, experts following the crisis closely say that for an invasion of the whole country that number would need to nearly double again, and would almost certainly involve forces passing through Belarus. Dr Fred Kagan, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said: \u201cThis will likely require an invasion on a scale not dissimilar to 2003, somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 troops.\u201d He predicted that a force that size could be in position by the end of January. About 175,000 US and other allied troops were involved in the invasion of Iraq. Is occupation possible? Kagan, who co-authored a series of reports that led to the 2007 US troop surge in Iraq, said the real challenge for Putin was how an almost certainly hostile Ukraine may be held by the Russians if there was an insurgency after the capture of Kyiv. A determined operation would require one counter-insurgent per 20 inhabitants, said Kagan in a paper he co-wrote with other experts from the Institute for the Study of War. That \u201cwould suggest a counter-insurgency force requirement on the order of 325,000 personnel\u201d would be needed to hold Kyiv and Ukraine\u2019s major cities in the south and east, they added. Ukraine has an army of 145,000, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS),, but there are also an estimated 300,000 veterans of the low-intensity conflict in the Donbas region of the country that started in 2014. Polling says a third of Ukraine\u2019s citizens would be willing to take up \u201carmed resistance\u201d. Burnt by the Soviet experience in Afghanistan, Russia generally viewed US attempts to hold countries against insurgents as a mistake. \u201cPutin will have studied what happened to the US in Iraq after 2003. The difficulties of dealing with partisan activity keeps my mind open to the possibility that the Russian president does not intend to invade and conquer Ukraine,\u201d Kagan told the Guardian. Russia\u2019s advantages Nevertheless, Moscow has overwhelming advantages in terms of an initial invasion, most notably in terms of rocketry and airpower. Ukraine faces potentially terrifying consequences, in an all-out assault, which could shatter a country\u2019s morale and prompt millions to flee west, rather than fight. Rob Lee, a former US marine and fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said: \u201cRussia has the capacity to devastate Ukraine\u2019s military units from afar with weapons such as Iskander ballistic missiles. We almost never see modern weaponry like this unleashed; it gives Russia the capability to inflict thousands of casualties a day.\u201d A military assault will also have a transformational effect on international opinion. Civilian casualties in considerable numbers are almost certain, amounting to an operation unlike almost any Putin has conducted before, including the war with Ukraine in 2014, where responsibility for military action was denied. Dr Samir Puri, a senior fellow at the IISS, who has previously spent a year as a conflict monitor in Ukraine, said: \u201cIt is hard to imagine a full invasion without the use of airpower, but that is such a huge threshold for Russia to cross.\u201d Much has been made about Ukraine\u2019s recent purchase of weapons from the west, but the Javelin antitank missiles have a range of about 1.5 miles (2.5km) and can only delay an mechanised advance. The country has a relatively modest number of Turkish TB2 drones for now, half a dozen or a dozen, tiny compared with Russia\u2019s thousands of tanks, the core of any ground force. Capturing Kyiv Russia also has to decide how to deal with Ukraine\u2019s cities, principally Kyiv, with a population of 3 million, but also Kharkiv in the north-east, with a population of almost 1.5 million. \u201cUrban warfare is hard, it does fearful damage and Russia struggled with it in Aleppo,\u201d Kagan said, citing Putin\u2019s intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war. Speculation about Russia\u2019s plans \u2013 based in part on apparent leaks published in the German newspaper Bild \u2013 suggests the Kremlin would surround Kharkiv and ultimately Kyiv, cutting off supplies, hoping in a medieval fashion they will surrender. That may be less violent but would still undercut the idea of Russia acting as a unifying force. Nor is encircling Kyiv easy, western analysts say. The key points of the city, including the presidential palace, are to the west of the readily defensible Dneiper River. The first bridges south of the city are 60 miles away; a dam four miles north has turned the stretch of the river that runs to the border with Belarus into a lake. Exploiting Belarus The simplest way across the river is to cross in a safe territory \u2013 Belarus to the north. That would require Minsk\u2019s support, which would be highly probable given its recent rapprochement with Moscow. In a speech to mark Orthodox Christmas on 7 January, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said his country would \u201cdo everything\u201d to take back Ukraine. Russian mechanised forces would aim to encircle Kyiv from the west. One route is to cross the Pripet marshes, which freeze in winter, and the Chernobyl area (not deemed a great complication for a modern military able to operate in a radiation zone). An alternative would be to strike from further west in Belarus, such as the Baranovichy training area. A key sign that Russia is ready to act, Kagan said, will be if \u201cRussian mechanised forces deploy to Belarus\u201d. Even if Putin does not invade, a permanent Russian military garrison in Belarus would have advantages to the Kremlin, as an potential threat not just to Ukraine but to the Baltic states to the north. It would \u201ccreate a large military base that would give Russia air dominance over Nato\u2019s eastern flank\u201d, said Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow at foreign policy thinktank Chatham House. Putin\u2019s military alternatives The risks inherent in invasion and occupation leave experts such as Dr Taras Kuzio, an associate fellow with the Henry Jackson Society,arguing in a newly released paper that an all-out attack \u201cthe least likely\u201d of the military scenarios available to Putin. Instead, the Ukraine expert sees three other options. In the first, Russia simply occupies and annexes the part of the Donbas controlled by separatists, a partial invasion mirroring the 2008 Georgia crisis. That began, Kuzio wrote, after \u201crepeated military provocations\u201d by proxies \u201cled to intervention by Georgian troops\u201d, giving Putin a pretext to respond. A second is to enlarge the occupied territory with a land corridor to previously annexed Crimea, capturing the coastal city of Mariupol. Russia could also seize other key industrial sites and try to degrade Ukraine\u2019s nearby military. \u201cThey could take out Turkish TB2 drones and artillery in the Donbas\u201d in an overt, limited campaign designed to weaken Ukraine, said Lee. A final option, said Kuzio, is the \u201crevival of the 2014 \u2018New Russia\u2019 project\u201d that would try \u201cto cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea\u201d. This would amount to seizing the south, capturing the port of Odessa and perhaps the industrial city of Dnipro. Taking Odessa, population 1 million, would probably require a dramatic air and naval operation, using paratroopers from Crimea followed by marines landing on nearby beaches. Of those options, annexing occupied Donbas would almost certainly be popular in Russia, However, it would be an extremely limited response given the Kremlin\u2019s insistence that its chief goal, as most recently repeated by Sergei Ryabkov, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, is \u201cthe non-expansion of Nato, the non-accession of Ukraine, Georgia and other countries to the alliance\u201d \u2013 raising concerns that a military campaign is probable. \u201cYou have to take a step back and ask what Russia\u2019s political goals are,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIf Russia wants to force a change in Ukraine\u2019s political orientation, you can see why the Kremlin might look at military options.\u201d"

            "title": "Military deployed at London hospitals due to Omicron staff shortages",
            "date": "2022-01-07T00:01:24Z",
            "content": "The armed forces are being deployed to help hospitals in London deal with a surge in Covid patients because the Omicron variant is leaving so many staff sick and unable to work. Of the 200 military personnel involved, 40 are doctors who will help NHS staff look after patients. The other 160 personnel, who have no medical training, will check in patients, ensure stocks are maintained and would also be \u201cconducting basic checks\u201d, the Ministry of Defence said. Some have already started work and they are expected to support the NHS in the capital until the end of the month. The announcement comes two days after Boris Johnson said he hopes England can \u201cride out\u201d the current wave of Covid-19 without further restrictions, but did acknowledge parts of the NHS would feel \u201ctemporarily overwhelmed\u201d by Omicron. Health union leaders, although grateful for the help, have said this latest move means the government can no longer be \u201cdismissive\u201d of concerns about \u201cdelivering safe care\u201d. Thousands of NHS staff have been off work each week in London, which last month became the first part of the country to see a huge wave of Covid cases caused by the new strain, leaving hospitals struggling to cope with unprecedented levels of staff absence. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of hospitals group NHS Providers, welcomed the assistance from personnel from what is thought to be all three armed forces. But he said that their arrival underlined the extent of NHS understaffing. \u201cTrust leaders will welcome the support of colleagues from the armed forces during what continues to be an incredibly challenging time for the NHS in London. \u201cThe fact that we need to call upon army medics and general duty personnel at all underlines the sheer scale of the workforce challenges the NHS is facing. \u201cThe experience of the pandemic makes plain underlying issues which need resolution \u2013 the need for a national long-term plan for the health and care workforce, ongoing challenges with vacancies and recruitment pre-dating the pandemic by a number of years.\u201d Hospitals elsewhere in England, which are seeing dramatic increases in Covid admissions, may also seek military aid, Hopson added. The news came as the UK reported a further 179,756 Covid cases on Thursday, with the number of people infected with the Omicron variant continuing to increase rapidly. The latest figures \u2013 which reflect infections picked up by testing \u2013 bring the UK total for the past seven days to 1,272,131, up 29% on the week before. The true number of infections is estimated to be substantially higher as not all infections are captured by the testing programme. The data also showed that in England there are 17,988 Covid patients in hospital, up from 15,659 the day before, with a further 231 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test reported in the UK on Thursday. Military personnel have helped out in hospitals in previous waves of the pandemic and continue to assist the ambulance services in Wales and Scotland and have also been helping the booster programme. The Royal College of Nursing said the deployment proved that the NHS is critically short of staff and asked for assurances that those involved have the skills to help look after patients. \u201cThe government can no longer deny the staffing crisis in the NHS. The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care,\u201d said Patricia Marquis, its nursing director for England. \u201cOnce the military has been brought in, where does the government turn next in a bid to \u2018ride out\u2019 the wave rather than deal with it? \u201cNursing staff might welcome any extra help at work right now, but we need to know that the government isn\u2019t compromising patient and professional standards in any way.\u201d Hopson earlier said soaring infection rates in the north of England mean that one NHS trust expects to have 30% more Covid cases next week than it had at the last peak. He fears that hospitals outside the capital will not be as able to cope with the new wave of admissions as those in London. He said this was because they had deeper staffing problems, higher levels of sickness and absence, older populations and in some cases worse social care provision. Some trusts outside London have as many as 19% of their staff absent because of Covid, much higher than the 10% off sick or isolating that other NHS organisations have been reporting, he added."

            "date": "2022-01-17T05:00:10Z",
            "content": "The countdown to the end of the six-month-long talks in Vienna on the future of the Iran nuclear deal has begun. No deadline has been formally set, but if there is no progress in less than two weeks the process will come to an end leaving a dangerous vacuum. The White House has already been rolling the pitch preparing its political lines for a breakdown by saying the US withdrawal from the agreement by Donald Trump in 2018 has proved to be a disaster. If there is no agreement, the Biden team intend Trump will take the blame. Ned Price, the US state department spokesperson, warned: \u201cThe runway is very, very short \u2013 weeks not months.\u201d Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, has given the same time frame but said such are the advances in Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, including levels of uranium enrichment at 60%, faster progress is needed. Those close to the talks say they think there can be an agreement, but that from a western perspective it will possibly be so limited in scope it is will be seen as temporary. If so, as Enrique Mora, the chief EU negotiator has said, it will not be for lack of trying. Surrounded by the gilt of the Palais Coborg hotel in Vienna, the large and expert teams of negotiators meet daily in different permutations delivering non-papers to one another. The one thing that is constant is that Iran refuses to meet the US negotiators, so discussions are carried out indirectly via the European, Chinese and Russian delegations. Full-scale talks will resume on Monday, with both the UK and Germany represented by new chief negotiators, Stephanie Al-Qaq and Tjorven Bellmann respectively. Detail on progress is being kept to a minimum. Mikhail Ulyanov, the Twitter-happy Russian ambassador to the talks and a key interlocutor, occasionally sends out cryptic tweets designed to give a sense of momentum. There are occasional noises off, quite literally. Explosions across western Iran on Saturday night, the Iranian government assured a jumpy nation, were explained by lightning, not an Israeli attack. But the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, has warned his country will not be bound by any agreement. Others are also seeking to influence the balance of forces in Vienna. A cast list of sceptical Gulf ambassadors have shown up to be briefed by the US special envoy, Robert Malley. The Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, travelled to China to secure a 25-year partnership agreement, a move designed to show the inflation-wracked Iranian economy can if necessary survive without the west. Ebrahim Raisi, the Iranian president, will travel to Moscow this week with the same purpose. Meanwhile, Evin prison\u2019s terrifying revolving door keeps turning, with Iranians linked to the west being either reprieved or punished. One morning last week, Aras Amiri, a British Council employee, was released to return to the UK \u2013 the final hiccup was a Home Office demand she pay \u00a31,000 to renew her expired indefinite leave to remain visa. But later that afternoon it was announced the French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah had her furlough withdrawn and was ordered to return to Evin, a possible punishment for the French being deemed by Iran to be the bad boys of the E3 talks in Vienna. From interviews and briefings Iranian officials have given at home, the sticking points are clear. On lifting sanctions differences remain on how to classify whether a sanction relates to the nuclear deal, and so now should be lifted, or is related to other issues, such as Iranian terrorism or human rights abuses that the US and others say must remain in place. A second issue surrounds the guarantees Iran is seeking that the US will not repeat Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the deal in May 2018. The US cannot offer a legally binding treaty since the Senate would never agree to one. Price said: \u201cThere is no such thing as a guarantee in diplomacy and international affairs. We can speak for this administration, but this administration has been very clear that we are prepared to return to full compliance with the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] and to stay in full compliance with the JCPOA as long as Iran does the same.\u201d A UN security council resolution might be a bare minimum of comfort for Iran, but is hardly binding on the parties. Tehran wants binding commitments that if the US quits the deal, the EU will do more to defy secondary US sanctions by injecting real cash into the abortive trading mechanism Instex set up by the EU to bypass US sanctions. A third issue is verification. What are the metrics by which Iran can verify that sanctions have been lifted in reality and not just on paper, and consequently that it must stop enriching uranium at levels of purity not allowed under the agreement? There has been loose talk that the US believes the lifting of sanctions could be verified in 48 hours, but Iran wants a longer process with benchmarks. The final issue is how to handle both the technical knowledge, including advanced centrifuges and large amounts of enriched uranium that Iran has acquired during the period it has ended its commitments to the JCPOA."

            "date": "2022-01-26T17:53:36Z",
            "content": "Leading Democrats have written to Joe Biden appealing to him to stick to his promise to reduce the US reliance on nuclear weapons for its defence and to revive arms control. The letter, signed by 55 senators and representatives, was sent on Wednesday while the White House was making final decisions on the US nuclear posture review (NPR), amid reports that Biden will make only minor adjustments to the vast nuclear modernisation plans inherited from his predecessors. \u201cYour NPR represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ensure that US nuclear doctrine reflects your recognition that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,\u201d the letter said. During the election campaign, Biden said the US \u201cdoes not need new nuclear weapons\u201d and pledged that his administration would \u201cwork to maintain a strong, credible deterrent while reducing our reliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons\u201d. The campaign also said it would make deterring and responding to a nuclear attack the sole purpose of the US nuclear arsenal. The current nuclear posture envisages its potential use against a range of threats, including an overwhelming cyber-attack. Despite Biden\u2019s campaign rhetoric, an advocate for restraint in nuclear weapon modernisation and arms control was removed last year from her Pentagon post overseeing the drafting of the NPR, after a campaign against her by hawks in the defence department and in Congress. The draft NPR produced by the Pentagon is believed to be a conservative document, endorsing the existing modernisation plans, expected to cost well over $1tn. Meanwhile, allies led by France have lobbied the Biden administration not to introduce a \u201csole purpose\u201d policy, concerned about the global pressure it would bring on them to change their own doctrines. The White House insists that the president will have the last word in shaping the policy. The Democrats behind the letter urged Biden to make the \u201csole purpose\u201d policy part of the NPR and to scrap two new weapon variants introduced by Trump: a low-yield warhead for Trident missiles, and a planned nuclear sea-launched cruise missile, saying the moves \u201cwould further signal that the United States believes that deterrence, not war-fighting, is the sole purpose of nuclear weapons\u201d. \u201cYour forthcoming NPR should reflect your administration\u2019s views, not embrace President Trump\u2019s nuclear weapons programs,\u201d the letter said. It was written by the two leading voices in the Senate for arms control, Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley, and their co-chairs of the Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group from the House, Donald Beyer and John Garamendi. Failure to change the status quo would fuel a cold war-style arms race with Russia and China, the letter warned, arguing: \u201cA clean break with President Trump\u2019s policies can send a strong signal to Russia and China that the United States believes restraint and nuclear arms reduction are measures of a country\u2019s great power status, not nuclear weapons overkill.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-24T09:44:27Z",
            "content": "Some British staff and dependants are being withdrawn from the embassy in Ukraine in response to a growing military threat from Russia, the Foreign Office has said. Officials said there were no specific threats to British diplomats, with about half of the staff in Kyiv reportedly scheduled to come home to the UK. The move follows US officials ordering relatives of embassy staff to leave Ukraine as a Russian invasion could come \u201cat any time\u201d. Russia has repeatedly denied having any plans for military action in Ukraine. The Foreign Office said: \u201cSome embassy staff and dependants are being withdrawn from Kyiv in response to the growing threat from Russia. The British embassy remains open and will continue to carry out essential work.\u201d Britain came under criticism over its failure to withdraw some staff from Afghanistan before the Taliban seizure of Kabul in August. It is likely that British diplomats in Ukraine would be exposed since the UK has taken one of the most prominent roles in sending military equipment including anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. But officials in Kyiv believe the move is too circumspect. A spokesman for the Ukrainian foreign ministry said: \u201cWe have taken note of the state department\u2019s decision re departure of family members of US embassy staff. While we respect the right of foreign nations to ensure the safety and security of their diplomatic missions, we believe such a step to be a premature one and an instance of excessive caution.\u201d The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said he did not know of plans for EU states to withdraw staff from their embassies, adding there was no need to dramatise the situation. \u201cWe are not going to do the same thing because we don\u2019t know any specific reasons. But [the US] secretary [of state, Antony] Blinken will inform us,\u201d Borrell told reporters as he arrived for a meeting with his EU counterparts. Blinken is expected to join the meeting by video link in the afternoon to continue his consultations with his European partners, and report back on the meeting he had with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in Geneva on Friday. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said it was important not to \u201ccontribute to further uncertainty in the situation, but it is important to continue to support the Ukrainian government and, above all, to maintain the stability of the country\u201d. But Germany later reversed its position, saying it was allowing diplomats\u2019 family members in Ukraine to leave if they so wished on a voluntary basis. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied planning to invade, but former UK national security adviser Mark Lyall Grant, speaking on BBC radio, said he feared an invasion was imminent because of the build-up of Russian troops in Belarus making an attack on Kyiv more likely. Explaining his belief that diplomatic staff could remain in place in Ukraine, Borrell said: \u201cNegotiations are going on,\u201d adding he thought staff should not leave \u201cunless secretary Blinken gives us an information that justifies a move\u201d. The EU\u2019s foreign ministers are expected to issue a warning to Russia over its troop buildup at Ukraine\u2019s border. They will also discuss the formal written proposals to be sent by Nato to Russia on its proposed agenda for talks. The Foreign Office took the unusual step on Saturday night of naming former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Murayev as a potential Kremlin candidate to take over in Kyiv \u2013 a claim dismissed as provocative \u201cnonsense\u201d by Moscow. Dominic Raab, the UK deputy prime minister, said on Sunday there was a very significant risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is due to travel to Moscow to hold talks with his Russian counterpart. No 10 also issued a warning at the weekend that without a successful combination of deterrence and diplomacy thousands of lives could be lost in a war that would not be confined to conventional arms, but also cyber-attacks. The US embassy in Ukraine is one of the larger American missions in Europe. It has about 900 employees the vast majority of them Ukrainians, some of whom have been with the mission since it opened three decades ago."

            "date": "2022-01-27T00:01:16Z",
            "content": "Ministers have thrown further support behind EDF Energy\u2019s \u00a320bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk with a \u00a3100m investment to help develop the project while the company courts private investors. The government\u2019s cash injection is designed to \u201cmaximise investor confidence\u201d in the project while French state-owned EDF works towards setting out a funding plan which satisfies investors and UK ministers. In return the government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project and over the land on which EDF plans to build it. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final investment decision on Sizewell it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. The UK government reignited talks with EDF over the nuclear project in late 2020, focusing on whether the company could prove it had learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. EDF has since embarked on a hunt for investors to help to drive down the cost for bill-payers. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake in the critical national infrastructure project. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China\u2019s involvement. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government\u2019s funding would add support to the development of Sizewell C \u201cduring this important phase of negotiations as we seek to maximise investor confidence in this nationally significant project\u201d. \u201cIn light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain\u2019s future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cNew nuclear is not only an important part of our plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.\u201d The fresh support has emerged months after the government put forward legislation to create a new funding model to help the project attract investment at a lower cost than the Hinkley Point C project which could add between \u00a310 and \u00a315 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, described the funding as \u201canother big step forward for Sizewell C and a big vote of confidence\u201d which \u201csends a clear signal from government to investors that it sees projects like Sizewell C as essential to our clean energy transition\u201d. Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said the company is pleased that the government is \u201cshowing its confidence in Sizewell C\u201d which would \u201callow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision\u201d. Rossi claimed that Sizewell C, if approved, would lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices while providing a \u201chuge economic boost to east Suffolk\u201d and \u201cbring new opportunities for thousands of nuclear supply chain companies up and down the country\u201d. Alison Downes, from Suffolk campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: \u201cWe fail to understand why the UK is bailing out crisis-hit EDF, and why the government is so committed to poor value large scale nuclear when there are other, better options.\u201d EDF\u2019s share price has slumped by almost half in the last three years to about \u20ac8.28 a share as technical trouble within its global nuclear fleet has caused its costs to spiral. It warned investors earlier this month that its French nuclear reactors would produce 10% less electricity than expected this year. Separately, the French government expects the company to take an \u20ac8.4bn (\u00a37bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year."

            "content": "The US president\u2019s need to state on Monday that there is \u201ctotal unanimity\u201d over how to deal with the Ukraine crisis, like the video call with European leaders which preceded it, was itself evidence of ongoing differences among western allies. There is no dispute about the threat: more than 100,000 Russian troops are now massed near Ukraine\u2019s borders. The US has put 8,500 troops on standby to deploy to Europe to reinforce allies there, while Nato has reinforced its eastern borders with warships and fighter jets. A senior US official briefed on Tuesday that in the event of an invasion, sanctions will \u201cstart at the top of the escalation ladder and stay there\u201d. In addition to the clear deterrent message, talks continue: Dmitry Kozak, the Kremlin\u2019s deputy chief of staff, will meet French, German and Ukrainian officials in Paris on Wednesday, in the \u201cNormandy format\u201d. Set against that, Russia paid little price for the annexation of Crimea and fomenting the separatist uprising in the Donbas region in 2014. There is a credible case that Russia is set on a major military offensive \u2013 not merely pursuing coercive diplomacy \u2013 and that it is in Moscow\u2019s interests to act before Kyiv receives further arms shipments. Above all, there is at present no visible off-ramp for Vladimir Putin. The very thing he says Russia must counter \u2013 Nato\u2019s presence in eastern Europe \u2013 is growing because of his own actions. He might take an exit; it\u2019s harder to see him beating a retreat. So the risks are high and rising. But an attack on Ukraine is not inevitable. French officials have indicated that they regard recent US and UK briefing as alarmist; Kyiv itself is notably more cautious. An analysis by the Centre for Defence Strategies, a Ukrainian thinktank, says a full-scale invasion capturing most of the country in the next few months seems unlikely, given current Russian troop formations. But it also suggests that \u201chybrid invasion\u201d is already being implemented, citing the recent cyber-attack. Moscow may believe that such methods, along with cross-border missile strikes, sabotage and political meddling, might be enough to effect a change of government. (The EU offer of \u20ac1.2bn in emergency financial assistance is designed to reduce pressure on Kyiv.) What price would Russia pay? Its markets have already tanked; and it appears to have amassed a cash stockpile in preparation for sanctions. It believes its control of gas supplies give it asymmetric leverage, especially given Europe\u2019s cost of living crisis. And it may count on distraction and disunity in the west. The stepping up of US rhetoric is in part an attempt to compensate for Joe Biden\u2019s gaffe suggesting Nato division over how to respond to a \u201cminor incursion\u201d. Excitable UK briefing over the weekend comes as the prime minister hopes for people to look beyond his domestic woes. Germany, from history, principle (established policy against arms sales to war zones) and pragmatism (it gets more than half of its gas from Russia), is strikingly more muted; uncertainty persists over how far it would go, especially over the NordStream 2 gas pipeline. Nonetheless, there are signs that the allies are moving closer after Monday\u2019s call \u2013 US coordination with Qatar and other suppliers to address the energy shortfall is helpful \u2013 and are certainly more united than in 2014. The drumbeat of war is concentrating minds and encouraging solidarity. That must now be maintained and built upon."

            "date": "2022-01-11T21:13:43Z",
            "content": "California is considering creating the first government-funded, universal healthcare system in the US for state residents. The proposal, which lawmakers will begin debating on Tuesday, would adopt a single-payer healthcare system that would replace the need for private insurance plans. Lawmakers are debating two bills \u2013 one would create the universal healthcare system, another would outline plans to fund it by increasing taxes, especially for wealthy individuals and businesses. The sweeping healthcare reform faces significant hurdles, including opposition from powerful lobbies for doctors and insurance companies. If the bills are approved by the legislature, voters would ultimately have to approve the taxes to fund the new system in an amendment to the California constitution. California has tried and failed to replace private health insurance with a universal, state-funded program for years. Voters rejected such a proposal in 1994 and state lawmakers failed to find a way to fund a single-payer health system in 2017. Attempts to create universal healthcare nationally have failed to gain traction despite being promoted by prominent progressive lawmakers, including 2020 presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders. State legislatures in Vermont and New York have also tried and failed to create universal healthcare plans. \u201cThere are countless studies that tell us a single-payer healthcare system is the fiscally sound thing to do, the smarter healthcare policy to follow, and a moral imperative if we care about human life,\u201d said the California assemblyman Ash Kalra, who authored the proposal. California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, campaigned for office in 2018 with the promise of helping usher in a single-payer health system but is facing re-election this year without making clear whether universal healthcare is still a priority. \u201cI think that the ideal system is a single-payer system. I\u2019ve been consistent with that for well over a decade,\u201d he said on Monday at a news conference. But he said he had not \u201chad the opportunity to review\u201d the plan being debated by legislature. In the meantime, Newsom on Monday unveiled his own proposal to expand access to Medi-Cal, a state-run healthcare program for low-income Californians, to extend eligibility to all residents regardless of immigration status. Newsom\u2019s plan proposes spending $2.2bn a year to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for all low-income residents, after years of incrementally including first undocumented children and then seniors in the program. The proposal, if approved by California\u2019s legislature, would expand health coverage for about 700,000 additional people. If it gets final approval this summer, it could take effect by 2024. Although inequities in healthcare access exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic have intensified calls for healthcare reform, efforts to institute a universal health system, or even a public healthcare option, have historically faced implacable opposition from powerful private healthcare lobbies. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded healthcare in the US, created insurance market exchanges where people without employer-sponsored insurance could shop for coverage and subsidies to help Americans afford insurance. The legislation dramatically expanded healthcare access, but stopped short of creating a public, government-run healthcare option. Despite reforms enacted by the ACA, medical bills remain the leading cause of debt for Americans. Were California to adopt a universal healthcare system, the state would funnel state and federal dollars allocated for healthcare into a single, government-run program. The insurance industry and business groups are rallying against the proposal, which would be paid for with higher taxes mostly on the wealthiest individuals and businesses, but would increase taxes for all but the lowest-earning Californians. Supporters of the plan say that despite the taxes, employers and individuals would pay less for health coverage overall. A state-run system would also include more benefits, more cheaply, by eliminating the need to account for insurance company profits. The California Nurses association over the weekend held demonstrations in favor of the universal healthcare proposal. \u201cAs nurses, we\u2019ve seen patients get care delayed or denied because they could not afford it,\u201d said Cathy Kennedy, president of the California Nurses Association. \u201cThis for-profit healthcare system has cost lives, all so that a few health insurance executives can line their pockets.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-21T14:11:07Z",
            "content": "London NHS hospitals struggling to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic bought \u00a336m of cancer care, cardiology and other services directly from the UK\u2019s largest private healthcare group, HCA, last year. Analysis of monthly public data from NHS trusts, published by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest (CHPI), reveals the extent to which London hospitals have become reliant on private providers, prompting concerns about creeping backdoor privatisation of the health service. \u201cCovid has been very much used as a cover for shrinking NHS care and expanding private healthcare provision,\u201d said Allyson Pollock, a clinical professor of public health at Newcastle University and an honorary professor at University College London. She said the money would be better used to invest in NHS staffing, equipment and expansion. This level of spending by individual NHS trusts was unprecedented for cancer care and cardiology, said CHPI. The spending is over and above the \u00a32bn so far handed over from central NHS budgets to private hospitals during the pandemic. In recent years NHS hospitals have bought extra capacity from private providers for simple procedures such as hip and knee operations, but they have not previously spent large sums outsourcing more complex treatments. HCA said its support had allowed 14,000 complex cardiac and cancer NHS patients to receive the care they needed. Many of them were casualties of the widespread suspension of normal care during the pandemic, as resources were diverted away from many specialisms, including cancer, to treat Covid-19 patients. By outsourcing some of the most pressing cases on their backlog to HCA, trusts ensured that those most in need were cared for. Prior to the pandemic, HCA carried out virtually no work for the NHS. Founded in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1968, and listed on the New York stock exchange, HCA is the largest healthcare company in the world and has more than 30 hospitals and clinics in London and Manchester, with another one due to open in Birmingham this year. CHPI\u2019s research shows the company was the biggest private beneficiary of funds spent on cancer care and cardiology direct from NHS hospital trusts in London between December 2020 and December 2021. The biggest spender was Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust, which bought more than \u00a320m of services from HCA. Barts was the second largest spender, with \u00a310m. University College London hospital (UCLH), Imperial College, Chelsea and Westminster, and the Royal Free also paid for HCA services. \u201cThe extent to which the private sector is now being used to deliver NHS cancer care services is unprecedented,\u201d said David Rowland, the director of the CHPI. \u201cWe estimate it is only likely to grow as the NHS comes under more pressure over the next few months.\u201d HCA said it had chosen not to take part in a deal struck between NHS England and private hospitals this month for up to \u00a3525m for reserve beds and staff in case of an Omicron admissions surge. A spokesperson for the firm\u2019s UK arm said: \u201cWe can safely provide this level of complex care because of the deep clinical infrastructure we have in our hospitals, which includes the highest levels of intensive care and trained staffing support. We work with NHS trusts on an individual basis and in response to their requests for support.\u201d The fees the London NHS trusts paid to HCA were covered either by NHS England, which has agreed to pay private hospitals \u00a310bn over four years to help tackle its backlog, or from the Treasury-funded elective recovery fund, created last summer to help hospitals recover their levels of activity post pandemic. Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 said the money had been mainly spent on oncology and cardiology, as waiting lists had risen during the pandemic. A record 6 million people are on NHS waiting lists for routine hospital care in England. A trust spokesperson said: \u201cWe have worked with HCA to provide complex elective care from admission to discharge, including surgery and supporting diagnostic services, such as scans, while continuing to maintain urgent and emergency care to Covid and non-Covid patients on our NHS sites.\u201d Barts Health NHS trust mainly bought cardiology and breast cancer surgery services from HCA. A Barts spokesperson said: \u201cThe trust has used HCA to enable staff to continue to provide planned care in a separate Covid-free environment while hospitals prioritised urgent and emergency care and Covid-19 patients.\u201d He added that as the pandemic eased, it was likely that Barts would continue to use the private sector to assist with reducing waiting times. UCLH spent almost \u00a33m with HCA last year, buying more than 500 procedures, most of them surgery for breast, head, neck, bladder and stomach cancers. Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust spent \u00a32.6m. Chelsea and Westminster hospital bought nearly \u00a3900,000 of services from the company, while the Royal free hospital spent \u00a32,000. Chelsea and Westminster said it used HCA mainly to provide colorectal and gynaecology cancer treatment to patients, primarily between December 2020 and March 2021. \u201cThis short-term measure must not become a long-term expediency to running down the NHS in favour of the private sector,\u201d said Colin Hutchinson, the chair of the campaign group Doctors for the NHS. \u201cThe principal reason the NHS now needs to make use of the private sector is because of long-term underinvestment.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-16T17:17:10Z",
            "content": "With typical bravado, GlaxoSmithKline has, we learned on Saturday, dismissed three takeover bids from Unilever for its consumer healthcare venture with Pfizer, including one worth \u00a350bn received just before Christmas. The drugmaker, run by Dame Emma Walmsley, has decided to push on with plan A, namely the demerger and stock market flotation this summer of the consumer health business, known for brands such as Aquafresh and Sensodyne toothpaste, along with Panadol and Voltaren for pain relief. GSK\u2019s confidence that the bids from consumer goods company Unilever, which makes Dove soap and Sunsilk shampoo, \u201cfundamentally undervalued\u201d the venture and its future prospects is based on three pillars. First, the drugmaker has released new forecasts showing it is now projecting annual sales growth of 4%-6% for the consumer venture, which made sales of \u00a39.6bn last year \u2013 higher than the 3%-3.5% analysts have factored in, it says. It believes Unilever\u2019s offer, which is made up of \u00a341.7bn in cash and \u00a38.3bn in Unilever shares, fails to capture this sales potential. It will explain the potential for the consumer brands more fully at an investor day on 28 February, with fourth-quarter results on 9 February also providing an opportunity to justify the strategy. Second, GSK reckons the Unilever offer does not fully take into account the synergies the deal would create. And third, it argues that any takeover bid needs to come with a higher premium. Many analysts have estimated the value of consumer healthcare at \u00a345bn, with some estimates as high as \u00a348bn. The New York hedge fund Elliott Management, the activist shareholder that has been pushing for a sale of the consumer health business and a change of leadership, declined to comment, but the much smaller London-based investor Bluebell Capital Partners, which has echoed Elliott\u2019s demands, said Unilever\u2019s bid was \u201cproof that such a high-quality business has the potential to attract interest by strategic and financial buyers\u201d. GSK has argued that there is no need to hold a formal auction as it has been clear since 2018, when plans for a split were announced, that consumer healthcare was up for grabs. It would be one of the largest ever deals in London. There are a small number of potential acquirers \u2013 only the likes of Reckitt Benckiser, Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestl\u00e9 would be big enough to stomach such a purchase. Private equity groups are thought to have looked at it too, but it would require a large consortium to pull off a bid. The consumer business\u2019s chair-designate is the former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis, who is also a Unilever veteran and has worked with Unilever\u2019s chief executive, Alan Jope, in the past. Unilever, for its part, is coming under pressure from previously loyal shareholders as it has missed sales and profit margin targets, and its shares have lagged behind those of its global peers. Terry Smith, founder of the investment manager Fundsmith and a top-10 Unilever shareholder, last week used his annual letter to investors to hit out at Unilever management, saying they had \u201clost the plot\u201d. Russ Mould, investment research director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: \u201cJope seems to think he needs to do something and while he may have felt he was pushing on an open door, given GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer\u2019s spin-off plan, they perhaps believe his need to act is greater than theirs. It\u2019s an interesting dynamic.\u201d In a brief statement on Saturday, Unilever said the consumer business would be \u201ca strong strategic fit as Unilever continues to reshape its portfolio\u201d. Its statement did not suggest that it was abandoning its pursuit. \u201cThe statements suggest price is the issue, not the lack of desire to sell or lack of desire to buy. A further attempt at a higher price is therefore possible,\u201d said Mould."

            "content": "\u201cOur healthcare system remains strong,\u201d says our premier. It\u2019s hard to explain that to the 91-year-old woman who slept in a chair last night in the emergency department I work at. Or the patient with cancer, receiving chemo, stuck at the cancer treatment centre for more than 24 hours, her journey delayed because she had became a close contact while waiting for a bed. Or the patient with suicidal ideation, who has been scheduled under the Mental Health Act, was told they have Covid-19, and is being forced to wait indefinitely for days as there are no beds at the specialised mental health facility. Or the ever-growing number of Covid-positive and suspected Covid-positive patients we are treating in a makeshift tent \u2013 literally a tent that has been set up outside the front of the department, as there is no room inside. No, Mr Premier. As a nurse working in an New South Wales emergency department, I can tell you our healthcare system no longer remains strong. After two years of fighting the pandemic, the foundations of our healthcare system have been washed away. We do not have the capacity to treat the influx of Covid-positive patients. In addition to the Covid patients who require hospitalisation due to the virus, the usual presentations to ED haven\u2019t stopped \u2013 there are still all the patients suffering strokes, heart attacks, lacerated hands from broken beer bottles, broken legs from motor vehicle accidents, pregnant women with abdominal pain, children with burns from scalding water \u2013 and they all happen to have Covid-19. These patients require treatment in a separated area from the rest of the ED patients to avoid a situation where patients come to hospital and catch Covid-19. This area is over capacity. At times, we have to add additional chairs in the corridor to keep up with the demand. Ambulances have had to wait over an hour to offload their Covid-positive patients as there is simply no room. Despite the influx of patients the nursing ratio does not change, creating an unsafe working environment. We are working with skeleton staff as so many senior colleagues have called it quits after having been worked into the ground over the past 24 months. It has become the norm for us to be asked every shift to do overtime or to come in on our days off. We do it, not for the extra money, but out of guilt and solidarity for our colleagues so they are not left to work a shift with deadly nurse-to-patient ratios. It is not uncommon for shifts to be so short-staffed that they have only one third of the nurses required rostered on. It is not a sustainable work model. Compounding the issue now is the growing number of staff members who themselves are testing positive. Adding to the situation is the issue of the staffing skill mix, which has become dangerous. To scrape through each shift, we are reliant on agency staff or staff being sent from other areas of the hospital to work in areas where they lack the specialised training. It is just not safe. The working conditions in hospitals has deteriorated throughout the pandemic. Beds replaced with chairs to make way for the growing number of patients. Tents erected outside, exposed to the elements, to make additional space to treat the ever-growing number of Covid-confirmed and suspected patients. Nurses having to work outdoors, in over 30-degree heat, in direct sunlight, in blue plastic gowns, gloves, goggles, N95 masks and a face shield. Simple procedures take twice as long and are twice as difficult to complete due to infection control procedures. We feel defeated: we are not able to provide the level of care we could pre-pandemic. What is most wearing, though, is the lack of recognition from our leaders about how hard this pandemic is for the nursing workforce. Every day of this pandemic, we have been expected to come to work without any additional hazard pay for putting ourselves on the front line of this deadly virus. With this latest wave, we have been begged to cancel our leave and extorted to dig deeper as our \u201ccommunity has needed us now more than ever\u201d. Now we are told that we are exempt from isolating when we become a close contact. Yet when will our politicians care for us? When will our politicians stop calling us \u201chealthcare heroes\u201d, as if we are superheroes able to work through any catastrophe, and stop ignoring our pleas for mandated nurse-to-patient ratios to ensure patient safety, and listen to our request for a fair pay rise following the wage freeze imposed on us in 2020? I worry for my colleagues and the profession that I have grown to love. We have already lost so many of our best senior nurses and paramedics over the past few months due to the fatigue of this pandemic. I just know that with this fourth wave of infections, we are going to lose many, many more. My colleagues and I are beyond fatigued. We feel hopeless, we feel scared. There is nothing left for us to give. The author is a nurse in an emergency department in Sydney"

            "date": "2022-01-11T06:00:08Z",
            "content": "The pandemic has been awash with slogans, but in recent weeks, two have been repeated with increasing frequency: \u201cVariants will evolve to be milder\u201d and \u201cCovid will become endemic\u201d. Yet experts warn that neither of these things can be taken for granted. Those stating that viruses become less deadly over time often cite influenza. Both of the flu viruses responsible for the 1918 Spanish flu and 2009 swine flu pandemics eventually evolved to become less dangerous. However, the 1918 virus is thought to have become more deadly before it became milder. And other viruses, such as Ebola, have become more dangerous over time. \u201cIt\u2019s a fallacy that viruses or pathogens become milder. If a virus can continue to be transmitted and cause lots of disease, it will,\u201d said Prof David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow\u2019s Centre for Virus Research. Viruses aim to create as many copies of themselves and spread as widely as possible. Although it is not always in their best interests to kill their hosts, so long as they are transmitted before this happens, it doesn\u2019t matter. Sars-CoV-2 doesn\u2019t kill people during the period when it is most infectious; people tend to die two to three weeks after becoming ill. Provided it does not evolve to make people so ill that they do not, or cannot, mix with other people while they are infectious, the virus doesn\u2019t care if there are some casualties along the way. Neither is it clear that Sars-CoV-2 is becoming progressively milder. Omicron appears to be less severe than the Alpha or Delta variants \u2013 but both of these variants caused more severe illness than the original Wuhan strain. Importantly, viral evolution is not a one-way street: Omicron did not evolve from Delta, and Delta didn\u2019t evolve from Alpha \u2013 it is more random and unpredictable than that. \u201cThese [variants of concern] are not going one from the other, and so if that pattern continues, and another variant pops out in six months, it could be worse,\u201d said Robertson. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to assume that there\u2019s some inevitability for Omicron to be the end of Sars-CoV-2\u2019s evolution.\u201d There is a possibility that Omicron is so transmissible that it has hit a ceiling whereby future variants will struggle to outcompete it. But just a few months ago, people were saying the same thing about Delta. Also, Omicron is likely to keep evolving. \u201cWhat might play out is that as Omicron infects so many people, it\u2019s harder for that first Omicron [variant] to continue to be as successful, and so that creates a space for a virus that\u2019s better at evading the immune response,\u201d Robertson said. What about the idea that Sars-CoV-2 could become endemic? Politicians tend to use this as a proxy for getting on with our lives and forgetting that Covid-19 exists. What endemic actually means is a disease that\u2019s consistently present, but where rates of infection are predictable and not spiralling out of control \u201cSmallpox was endemic, polio is endemic, Lassa fever is endemic, and malaria is endemic,\u201d said Stephen Griffin, associate professor of virology at the University of Leeds. \u201cMeasles and mumps are endemic, but dependent on vaccination. Endemic does not mean that something loses its teeth at all.\u201d As more and more people develop immunity to Sars-CoV-2, or recover from infection, the virus may become less likely to trigger severe disease. But it could then evolve again. The good news is that this becomes less likely the more of the world\u2019s population is vaccinated \u2013 because the fewer people who are infected, the fewer chances the virus has to evolve \u2013 but we\u2019re not close to that yet. Even in the UK, there are large numbers of unvaccinated individuals, and it\u2019s unclear how long the protection from boosters will last. \u201cThe idea that we will achieve endemicity anytime soon also seems a little bit counter to the fact that we\u2019ve just had several weeks of massively explosive exponential growth, and prior to that, we were still seeing exponential growth of Delta,\u201d Griffin said. Transforming Covid into a disease that we can truly live with requires more than a national vaccination campaign and wishful thinking; it requires a global effort to improve surveillance for new variants, and supporting countries to tackle outbreaks at source when they emerge. It also requires greater investment in air purification and ventilation to reduce transmission within our own borders, if we\u2019re mixing indoors. Everyone hopes that the coronavirus will evolve to become milder, and that Covid becomes endemic \u2013 or rather, manageable enough not to blight our daily lives. But these are hopes, not facts, and repeating these mantras won\u2019t make them happen any faster."

            "content": "A snow leopard at a zoo in Bloomington, Illinois, has died after contracting Covid-19. Miller Park Zoo announced the death of Rilu, 11, which the zoo previously said \u201cbegan coughing and had a raspy respiration beginning on 20 November\u201d, in an Instagram post on Thursday. Noting the animal\u2019s spectacular tail, which was almost as long as its body, the zoo said Rilu produced seven offspring which are now part of its Species Survival Plan. \u201cRilu\u2019s personality and beauty will be missed by guests and staff but he will not be forgotten,\u201d said superintendent Jay Tetzloff, adding that masks are required in all indoor spaces at the Bloomington zoo. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most animal Covid infections come from contact with humans \u201cincluding owners, caretakers or others in close contact\u201d. Among animals vulnerable to Covid, the CDC lists companion animals including cats, dogs and ferrets; several types of big cats; otters; non-human primates; binturong; coati-mundi; fishing cats; hyenas; mink; and wild white-tailed deer. The photographer Joel Sartore, whose image of Rilu accompanied the announcement of the animal\u2019s death, paid tribute in his own post. \u201cSnow leopards are proving extremely susceptible to the disease and it\u2019s often fatal,\u201d Sartore said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t received a vaccination and booster yet, please do so. It\u2019s more than just human lives that are at stake. Thank you.\u201d In December, three snow leopards at the Lincoln Children\u2019s Zoo in Nebraska died of complications from Covid-19. Two Sumatran tigers recovered. In July, zoos in Oakland and Denver announced they would start vaccinating tigers, bears and other mammals with a two-dose vaccine first administered in March to gorillas in San Diego. Zoetis, a New Jersey animal health company, has said it has donated more than 11,000 vaccine doses to almost 70 zoos and wildlife sanctuaries, as part of an effort authorised by the US Department of Agriculture. In December, two hippos at a zoo in Antwerp, Belgium, tested positive for Covid-19. Imani, 14, and Hermien, 41, showed no symptoms \u201cother than runny noses\u201d, the zoo said. Francis Vercammen, a zoo vet, told CNN: \u201cTo my knowledge, this is the first known contamination in this species.\u201d"

DJ Ferguson, 31, was previously prioritized for a heart transplant at Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital, but is no longer eligible as he refuses to get vaccinated, said Ferguson\u2019s family, according to a report by CBS Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of against his basic principles \u2013 he doesn\u2019t believe in it,\u201d said David Ferguson, his father. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy they are enforcing and so, because he won\u2019t get the shot, they took him off the list [for] a heart transplant.\u201d Brigham and Women\u2019s explained its reasoning in a statement: \u201cLike many other transplant programs in the United States \u2013 the Covid-19 vaccine is one of several vaccines and lifestyle behaviors required for transplant candidates in the Mass General Brigham system in order to create both the best chance for a successful operation and also the patient\u2019s survival after transplantation.\u201d Other medical experts have declared their support of the hospital\u2019s policy, noting that the immune system is extremely weak after a transplant, making vaccinations all the more important. \u201cPost any transplant, kidney, heart whatever, your immune system is shut off. The flu could kill you, a cold could kill you, Covid could kill you,\u201d said Dr Arthur Caplan, the head of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told CBS Boston. \u201cThe organs are scarce: we are not going to distribute them to someone who has a poor chance of living when others who are vaccinated have a better chance post-surgery of surviving.\u201d Ferguson\u2019s family have said they are unsure of what to do next given his refusal to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. They have considered transferring him to a different facility but acknowledge he might not survive the trip. \u201cWe are aggressively pursuing all options, but we are running out of time,\u201d said David Ferguson. The family said that while had received excellent care at Brigham and Women\u2019s, they do not agree with the policy. \u201cI think my boy is fighting pretty damn courageously, and he has integrity and principles he really believes in, and that makes me respect him all the more,\u201d said Ferguson of his son, who is a father of two children with another one on the way. \u201cIt\u2019s his body.

            "date": "2022-01-04T14:57:21Z",
            "content": "One often overlooked aspect of the current pandemic is the effect that it has had on brands. The poor brands, who long ago settled on a cool-sounding name only to have it coopted by a deadly once-a-century health crisis. Remember Corona, the beer that people used to drink before the association with illness and death became too much to take? Remember Delta, the airline that people used to use before it reminded everyone that new Covid mutations are destined to consign humanity to a quivering wreck for decades to come? These are the real victims. Until now, the Omicron variant has escaped such a fate. This is because Omicron is such a stupid word that the only people who had ever adopted it as a name are an imposing German electrical diagnostic corporation and a Belgian death metal band, and neither one seems particularly bothered by the association. However, if you squint hard enough and pretend that you don\u2019t know how to read, the word \u201cOmicron\u201d sort of looks a bit like \u2018Omarion\u2019. And that\u2019s bad news for the R&amp;B singer of the same name who was once part of the band B2K. Because, for almost a full month now, Omarion has found himself on the receiving end of Twitter\u2019s firehose. For a whole swathe of people online, Omicron is now \u201cthe Omarion variant\u201d. If you catch it by surprise, you tweet a gif of Omarion on The Masked Singer. If you want to show how the virus spreads, you tweet a video of Omarion dancing through the streets after a woman. If you\u2019re forced into self-isolation, you make a TikTok of Omarion dancing on the end of a lateral flow swab like an especially perky bogey. Through the thick of the outbreak, Omarion himself has apparently remained oblivious to this association. However, he has finally issued an official response. On New Year\u2019s Day, Omarion uploaded three TikTok videos to help clear up any misunderstanding. \u201cHi, this is Omarion. I am an artist, not a variant\u201d he explained. \u201cSo please be aware that, if you just so happen to run into me on the street, you don\u2019t have to isolate for five days\u201d. \u201cWhile it\u2019s important not to touch me and keep your distance, cause you know that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be, you don\u2019t need a negative test to dance to my music,\u201d Omarion continued. On another video referencing his old boyband, he added that \u201cThe last time I had to do this was in 2000 when everyone confused Y2K with B2K\u201d. Perhaps this is Omarion\u2019s lot. Perhaps every 20 years, some awful catastrophe will befall humanity, and it\u2019ll sound a bit like something vaguely related to something Omarion has done. Maybe in 2040 we\u2019ll be crushed by an asteroid that will come to be colloquially known as Fat Albert, referencing Omarion\u2019s 2004 movie. Or maybe aliens will arrive from the planet Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami, named after the reality show that Omarion appeared on for a single episode in 2019. Perhaps, even, we will be hit by a second pandemic, and science will inexplicably choose to name each new variant after a different disappointing R&amp;B album, and the most deadly wave will carry the title of Omarion\u2019s 2014 record, Sex Playlist. What a way to go. Still, you have to imagine that, deep down, Omarion must be quite pleased that his name is now synonymous with an unimaginably virulent strain of Covid. Because now, when you Google the word Omarion, you get swamped by results about his jokey clarification. And that means that all other news about Omarion has suddenly become much harder to find. That time Reuters ran a news story about Omarion asking his fans to pray for him because he happened to be in London \u2013 uninjured and inconvenienced \u2013 during the 2005 terrorist attacks? Very difficult to find now. Not impossible, but very hard."

            "content": "It\u2019s someone\u2019s nightmare job: Amazon boss Jeff Bezos\u2019s newspaper, the Washington Post, is seeking a special correspondent just to cover the billionaire\u2019s online shopping and web services titan. Having your own chronicler could be seen as the ultimate in billionaire egotism, but we are all close Amazon watchers now. The group\u2019s tentacles have spread into so many areas of our lives that it is almost impossible to escape \u2013 from its cloud storage technology that supports government services and numerous businesses, to its Prime subscription service tying clients into an \u201cecosystem\u201d that ranges from film and music to shopping deliveries, to the Alexa-driven smart speakers that turn on lights and radios in many homes and search the internet while logging intimate user data. Covid-19 may have knocked the sales and profits of many businesses, but Amazon was a standout pandemic winner, notching up millions of new recruits who turned to online streaming and shopping while shielding at home. In Britain, 56% of households are now thought to have had access to Prime Video after almost 700,000 more people signed up in the final quarter of last year, according to analysts at Kantar. On Thursday, Amazon will reveal the extent to which it has been able to hold on to those new customers as high streets reopened while the costs and complexities of serving shoppers increased. Widespread supply chain hold-ups, with some factories shut during Covid scares and shipping routes disrupted, are expected to have affected its ability to obtain and deliver products. The cost of delivering has also gone up, as Amazon has had to battle for staff and invest in additional logistical kit amid a global surge in demand for home deliveries. In the UK, it increased pay for warehouse workers and offered signing-on bonuses of up to \u00a33,000 before Christmas to attract staff, as well as offering more than \u00a311 an hour in some parts of the country \u2013 three pounds more than the current minimum wage. Meanwhile, shoppers now have more chance to try clothes on in boutiques, go on holiday or venture out to bars and clubs \u2013 meaning less cash to splash on Amazon. Such problems have already hit the share prices of tech companies, from online fashion sellers Asos and Boohoo to streaming service Netflix. At Amazon, difficulties prompted a disappointing performance in the three months to the end of September when the company reported its biggest year-on-year profits decline since 2017. Another fall is expected for the Christmas quarter. Overall, analysts expect fourth-quarter revenues of $137.7bn (\u00a3102.8bn) and operating profits of $2.6bn: a 9%-plus increase in revenues on the same period a year before, but a chunky 60% fall in quarterly profit. Costly investments in chartering cargo ships and leasing planes are expected to have given Amazon a degree of protection from the global supply chain issues. However, almost a third of its packages are delivered by partner companies. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, says: \u201cIndustry-wide shortages in shipping containers, truck drivers, and readily available ports likely impacted delivery times and caused strain for many orders as shipping container [rates] surged from under $2,000 before the pandemic to over $20,000 with multi-week delays.\u201d On the demand side, it is not plain sailing either. In groceries, for example, Natalie Berg, a retail analyst and co-author of a book on Amazon, says: \u201cAll the things that made Amazon unique, such as same-day delivery and checkout-free stores, are quite quickly becoming the norm.\u201d In the booming world of fast-track groceries, the likes of Getir, Gopuff and Gorillas promise to deliver in less than 15 minutes, and are battling with Amazon partner Deliveroo and its rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats, as well as Tesco\u2019s own Whoosh and Sainsbury\u2019s Chop Chop in the UK. Meanwhile, Amazon has opened about 15 of its \u201cjust walk out\u201d till-less grocery stores in the UK, but it is already facing a challenge in this area from Tesco and Aldi \u2013 and plenty of competition from regular local convenience stores. A tie-up with Sainsbury\u2019s, which is using Amazon technology to power its just-walk-out store, may suggest a more lucrative way forward. Don\u2019t be surprised if Amazon brings hi-tech physical fashion stores to the UK before long too. If shoppers are keen, the tech giant\u2019s real assault on the high street will be via partnering with more familiar brands with better fashion credentials. All of this will fuel the appetite to take on the dominance of big tech firms. In the US, a change of regime is being led by Lina Khan, the new boss of the Federal Trade Commission, who made her name helping guide investigations into monopoly tech power, particularly Amazon. Historically, taking on monopoly businesses has been a slow and arduous process. But Khan showed her ambition in the first meeting she chaired last summer, saying the US needed \u201ca different set of rules\u201d to control big tech."

            "title": "How to book a holiday during the Covid pandemic",
            "date": "2022-01-17T07:00:14Z",
            "content": "Check cancellation policies It is essential to check what will happen if you need to cancel transport or accommodation, whether you are booking the different elements yourself or opting for a package. Many may offer free cancellation but read the small print carefully \u2013 there will be a deadline for this, and it could be several weeks before your holiday is set to start. Read flexible policies carefully. Qin Xie from Hey Money Talk says flexible booking should mean not paying an admin fee or losing your deposit if plans change. \u201cWhat\u2019s included in flexible booking obviously depends on who you book with but amends are usually for travel dates and/or destinations.\u201d If you are booking a holiday let only, book through a third-party site that has has a clear refund policy and which takes secure payments by credit card. Your contract is always with the company or person to which you paid the money. For example, if you book through Airbnb you need to contact the company for a refund, whereas with Vrbo you would need to contact the property owner. Tracey McLaughlin, a blogger at Mind Over Money Matters, is a member of the Air Miles scheme and has beenusing it to book her holidays \u2013 it offers more flexibility than paying for the flights with a credit card, she says. \u201cAir Miles gives us the option to cancel our booking 24 hours before travel for only a \u00a335 charge,\u201d she says. \u201cAll accommodation, etc is also booked with free cancellation up to 24 hours before.\u201d Protect your payments Put your holiday on a credit card, if possible \u2013 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act this gives you protection on purchases of more than \u00a3100, and will cover your costs if a holiday firm you have booked with goes bust. To benefit from the cover make sure that you book and pay directly with the holiday company, rather than using a third-party payment company such as PayPal. The Atol (Air Travel Organisers\u2019 Licence) financial protection scheme covers flight-based holidays and is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Under the scheme, if your travel company fails you will be entitled to a refund or replacement holiday if you are yet to travel, or provided with accommodation and flights home if you are abroad. Flights booked directly with airlines are not protected under the Atol scheme. Keep the certificate you are given when booking safe. If you buy a coach, rail or cruise holiday from an Abta member your money will be protected by the association\u2019s financial protection scheme. If your travel company fails and your holiday can no longer go ahead, you will be entitled to a refund if you are yet to travel or hotel costs and transport home if you are abroad. Consider a package holiday Travel agents have access to the latest up-to-date information, airline and holiday offers and are very knowledgable about amending holidays and alternative destinations, giving you extra peace of mind. It can be cheaper to buy a flight and accommodation separately. However, if you book a package you have more protection from the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018. The travel organiser or operator must inform you of any alterations to the package clearly and without undue delay. You then have the option to cancel with no penalty if the holiday changes significantly. Linda Reynolds of Personal Travel Agent says: \u201cDIY holidays can be problematic at this time. I\u2019ve heard of people turning up at hotels in Canada and the hotel was shut and locally there were no alternatives in their price range. Check your hotel is open. A quick look on their website or email to confirm your arrival should help.\u201d Buy insurance You should always take out insurance at the time of making your booking. Check with the supplier that it covers your needs \u2013 if you know you want to go jetskiing, for example, does it include it? Make sure you look for details of Covid cancellation, medical fees and repatriation. Check the quarantine rules for the country you are travelling to \u2013 some, for example, will make you move hotel if you test positive. Ask your insurer what it will pay for if you have to extend your stay because you are quarantined and unable to travel hoe. If you are due to travel after your annual insurance expires, make sure you renew it before you travel. If the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) puts a warning in place for your destination during any gap in your policy, you won\u2019t be covered. Keep up to date with latest news Regularly check the FCDO website for entry requirements to the country you plan to visit, and keep an eye on the UK entry requirements. The government website will state which Covid test is required and the timescales before leaving and returning. Emma Savage of Travel Counsellors emphasises the importance of complying with the entry requirements of your destination. \u201cThey all vary, so make sure you/your agent is fully briefed on what you need to do\u201d The FCDO continuously reviews its travel advice for each country or territory to ensure it includes up-to-date information and advice on the most relevant issues for British people visiting or living there. You can also sign up for email alerts to get updates as they happen. Have all your paperwork ready When the time comes round for your break, make sure you have booked any Covid tests that you need \u2013 and shop around before you do. Rory Boland, the travel editor of Which?, said \u201cThe Covid testing system for travel has been operating for a year now, and travellers are still being exposed to providers that fail to deliver tests on time or advertise prices that are not available.\u201d Check reviews on sites such as Trustpilot, or try the comparison website Covid19-testing.org. Reynolds advises that you make physical copies of everything. \u201cAs well as your booking documents, print a copy of health forms, attestation if applicable, passenger locator form and confirmed test results,\u201d she says. Don\u2019t rely on the airport\u2019s wifi to download your vital documents."

While urban centres play with streetscapes and how to maximise space in terrace-lined streets, bush architecture is embracing the land, and booming. Two years into the pandemic, people around the world have been forced to reassess their way of life and the importance of the space they inhabit. Covid-19 has also placed limits on people\u2019s ability to travel, reset and come back refreshed and ready for a sleep in their own bed. Instead we have sought refuge in our homes and set new sights on comfortable, adaptable ways of living.

They are doing more full-time living in the country and realising they can work from home remotely from anywhere.\u201d With this new chapter, the perception of rural architecture is moving beyond shed makeovers and converted shipping containers. Kerridge says the enjoyment of getting to know rural destinations around Australia intimately in her work helps tailor each building to their unique location. Her designs, including Escarpment House, nested among subtropical rainforest, Contemplation House, with views of Byron Bay, and 2010 Australian House of the Year, House in Country New South Wales, all pay tribute to their sites and are geared towards maximising outlook, light, fresh air and access to the landscape. Be it a grand homestead or a humble country house built to cater to sustainable living, for architects, rural architecture and the influence of country surroundings comes with unrivalled opportunities for creativity and freedom. \u201cWhat I love about working in rural areas is architecture\u2019s relationship to built form,\u201d says Kerridge. \u201cIt takes you out of the urban context and into the rural context, and you can be a bit looser and more open to play with materials.\u201d The architect Fergus Scott also embraces the cues of Australia\u2019s raw elements and diverse environment. \u201cI like the challenge of getting to know a landscape site and gaining a better understanding of its patterns \u2013 the flora and fauna, the geology, previous inhabitation and the climate,\u201d says Scott. \u201cThose things help you as an architect and inform your design decisions, allowing you to produce a building that is tailored as a response to the environment.\u201d Scott\u2019s buildings in NSW include Quorrobolong House, Southern House and Jilliby House, with their elongated structures, \u201coperable\u201d facades and central atriums. He sees architecture as a response to the land increasingly coming to the fore. \u201cClients now have a great appreciation for the land they have acquired out of the city and are eager to create a building that connects to and feels part of the place they\u2019re living in,\u201d says Scott. \u201cI think people realise that Australia has a lot more to offer than the vibrancy of life in the city.\u201d One prime example of how the bush architecture movement comes back to the simplest of things is Box House, by the architect Nicholas Murcutt. On a one-and-a- half-acre block on the south coast of NSW, surrounded by gum trees, Box House is contained in four walls. Its owner, Elizabeth Charles, has always lived regionally and is happiest in the country. She and her partner, Martin, both artists, commissioned Box House principally for their family of three as a humble holiday retreat, but it changed the way they wanted to live. \u201cWhen you bring nature and beauty into your life, you are so enriched by it,\u201d says Charles. \u201cNot only that, it is the modesty of your living. When things do become simpler, it frees you up for other interests and pursuits.\u201d Built from solid hardwood, the craftsmanship of the six-metre cube has attracted national and international attention, as both a structure of power and beauty, and a simple reimagining of a tent. \u201cWe wanted a house that was modest, that had a light footprint and met our most basic needs. We had been camping and enjoyed the land through that process, so we were keen to have a house in that spirit.\u201d Box House, which runs on solar and a small amount of gas, is mostly self-sustainable. Conceived almost 25 years ago on a shoestring budget, it is easily liveable and has little ongoing cost. It also has an enduring legacy as a sculptural piece of architecture and one that treats its inhabitants to a well-designed space flooded with light. \u201cIf there is a storm outside, to witness that from the comfort and security of the house, gives us such perspective,\u201d says Charles. \u201cThat is what I love most about Box House, that connection. It is uplifting, and in that respect the legacy of the house is a real gift from the architect.\u201d That gift is set to live on, with Box House to open to the public as a short stay, in the hope that more people can experience the house and the value of its design. Such minimalism, like in Box House, is continuing to be embraced, even as bush architecture moves away from the knocked-up tin shed. \u201cWhat is interesting about building in the bush is that, if it was the perfect climate, you\u2019d hardly need a building at all,\u201d Fergus Scott says. \u201cYou\u2019d just be making a garden.\u201d An analysis of what the land can offer is important as modern bush architecture moves to embrace the practical and the aesthetic, in a bid to create buildings with a light footprint. \u201cI have seen clients take positive steps to rehabilitate the land and understand previous vegetation patterns, which is great to see,\u201d says Scott. \u201cPeople are thinking about it not just as, \u2018What can we take from the land?\u2019 but \u2018What can we give and when we leave it, how can we leave it in a better place?\u2019\u201d This is reflected in the trend of prefabricated houses too, where there is good and bad to be had in fusing design and utility. \u201cThe advantage is that the house can be brought in with minimal impact on the land on which it is placed,\u201d says Scott. \u201cBut the disadvantage is that sometimes prefab houses don\u2019t open up to the outside that well, and feel internalised.\u201d Long after seminal buildings such as Richard Leplastrier\u2019s Palm Garden House and Gabriel Poole\u2019s Lake Weyba House started to define bush architecture, a treechange is leading modern rural buildings to prominence. \u201cNow it is more than a romantic idea of living in a little shed for a while when life gets too busy,\u201d says Scott, who admits he would like to have his own house in the country.

            "title": "UK economy back to pre-pandemic levels in November ",
            "date": "2022-01-14T16:16:44Z",
            "content": "The UK economy surpassed its pre-pandemic level for the first time in November ahead of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and the government\u2019s warnings about workplace and social gatherings. Official figures showed GDP grew by 0.9% in the penultimate month of 2021, making the UK economy 0.7% larger than it was before March 2020 and the first lockdown. The US, France, Denmark and Sweden are among the other rich countries to have recovered all the lost ground during the pandemic while Germany, Italy and Spain have yet to pass the pandemic milestone. City economists had expected an expansion of only 0.4% and said November was likely to prove a high point in 2021, with the figures collected by the Office for National Statistics coming shortly before the Omicron variant took hold, exacerbating worker shortages as thousands were off sick. It followed growth of 0.2% in October. A surge in early Christmas shopping provided one of the biggest boosts to activity in November, though all sectors, including manufacturing and services, reported expanding output. With the HS2 high-speed rail line starting to make some headway and housebuilding able to benefit from a mild November, the construction industry increased by 3.5%, reversing a trend of contraction dating back to May. The continuing increase in health services as a proportion of economic activity was another factor supporting the rise in GDP, the ONS said. Against a backdrop of rising inflation and the expectation of further interest rate rises by the Bank of England, business groups warned the economy remained weak. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cStronger growth in November is likely to be followed by a modest fall in output in December and January, as consumer caution to socialise and spend, and mounting staff absences sparked by Omicron and plan B limit activity. \u201cWhile the UK economy should rebound once plan B measures are lifted, surging inflation and persistent supply chain disruption may mean that the UK\u2019s economic growth prospects remain under pressure for much of 2022.\u201d Analysts said that while the economy had struggled to grow since the summer, there was the prospect of a return to stronger growth in 2022, albeit with consumer spending constrained by the rising cost of living. ONS officials said there was little evidence from early indicators that many shops and restaurants were forced close in December, though business lobby groups suffered a collapse in bookings that prompted the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to offer \u00a31bn in extra support. Ana Boata, the head of economic research at the credit insurer Euler Hermes, said the consumer had come to the rescue of an economy still suffering the effects of Covid-19 \u201cWe expect GDP growth to hit 4.4% this year, followed by a further 2.6% increase in 2023. It\u2019s not all plain sailing, though. Wages will go up about 3.5% above the pre-crisis average in 2022, in reaction to price rises across the full economy. \u201cDespite the Bank of England expected to raise rates at least twice this year to keep inflation in check, households\u2019 real purchasing power will suffer, leaving excess savings to prop up consumer spending levels.\u201d Sunak welcomed the news that Britain\u2019s economy was larger than before the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see the size of the economy back to pre-pandemic levels in November \u2013 a testament to the grit and determination of the British people,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-01-12T06:00:38Z",
            "content": "When Covid hit in 2020, it was a nerve-racking time for many urban developers. As gardens \u2013 or the countryside \u2013 seemed ever more important for locked-down house hunters, some wondered if their half-finished city apartment blocks would ever find residents. But almost two years into the pandemic, the speculation about \u201cthe death of the city\u201d have been proven wrong. Exclusive figures gathered by the Guardian suggest thousands more people are now living in the biggest English city centres since Covid first hit the UK \u2013 mostly in flats, often without balconies or outdoor space. In Liverpool, the city centre population increased by almost 6% in 2020 to 48,594, up 2,754 on 2019, according to the local authority. Leeds city council estimates that 5,000 more people are living in its centre now than in 2019, among them staff at Channel 4, which opened its \u201cnational headquarters\u201d in the city earlier this year. \u201cWe estimate the total population to now be around 38,000,\u201d said a spokesperson. Demand is rising in central London as renters return to the city centre, according to the Greater London Authority\u2019s December 2021 housing report. Data from Rightmove shows a rent price increase of 11.1% since November 2019 and an annual increase in house prices of 2.7%. In Manchester, the city centre population is now 69,835, up 4.9% on 2021, according to estimates from the council. \u201cDespite Covid-19, Manchester remains the fastest growing city in England \u2013 and the population of the city centre is expected to be close to 100,000 by 2025,\u201d said Gavin White, the council\u2019s executive member for housing and employment. \u201cThe pandemic has not deterred people wishing to live in the city and this is because of a combination of factors. The number of jobs being created (including specialist sectors like advance manufacturing, digital and tech), culture, sport \u2013 and not just football \u2013 along with a rate of graduate retention not seen previously; these are all reasons why Manchester continues to enjoy enviable city growth.\u201d Others point out that a city centre exodus may not have come to pass because some flat owners are stuck, unable to sell up because of issues with cladding and fire safety. In Manchester city centre there were only 870 properties sold in 2020-21, a 75% reduction on 2019-20. In its annual State of the City report, the council blames the drop on \u201csignificant constraints on the supply of suitable accommodation to buy (linked primarily to cladding and fire-safety concerns)\u201d. On Monday the government unveiled a \u00a34bn package designed to let more leaseholders escape costs for replacing combustible cladding and pledged new laws to protect them from other safety defect costs. Many of the new city centre residents are renters rather than buyers, often living in luxury blocks with gyms and paying \u00a32,000 a month for a two-bed flat. A lot of these flats are bought \u201coff-plan\u201d by investors. Off-plan purchases (before construction) are particularly booming outside London. Figures from Hamptons estate agents showed 40% of new homes were sold off-plan in the capital in 2021, compared with 61% in Birmingham, 58% in Manchester, 60% in Liverpool and 45% in Leeds. The rapid rate of development in Manchester\u2019s centre led to fears of \u201czombie blocks\u201d left unoccupied. But according to the State of the City report, only 1% of properties there have remained empty for more than six months. A growing number of family homes have also been constructed in Manchester, prompting the council to build its first city centre primary school for generations. The 210-place school and 26-place nursery will be located at Crown Street, a new development in the Deansgate ward, and is expected to open in September 2023. Leeds is also planning major city centre expansion over the next decade. A council spokesperson said: \u201cUp to 2033, the local plan has capacity for a further 18,000 new homes in the city centre and its fringe across 110 sites, which is consistent with the council\u2019s strategy to maximise the capacity of sustainable locations and the re-use of brownfield sites for residential use. \u201cOver half of these homes already either have detailed planning consent or are under construction. Based on current occupancy assumptions, this would see growth of 27,000 additional city centre residents.\u201d"

We have known about the dangers of misinformation for years, and these are now being felt keenly by the huge numbers choosing not to be vaccinated. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s approach of making life more difficult for the unvaccinated (Report, 4 January) makes my heart sink. Surely that will only feed the misinformation beast and validate the screams of \u201cdon\u2019t trust the government\u201d. There is great power in hindsight, of course, but it is apparent that governments had ample warning that misinformation would be a problem for vaccine uptake. It seems that misinformation has been dumped in the \u201ctoo difficult, with insufficient political gain\u201d box, and we are reaping the consequences. My father-in-law is unvaccinated by choice. I do not think he should be punished, nor do I think he deserves much sympathy. I simply wish that governments would offer a sensible and coherent strategy for tackling misinformation and mitigating its effects. Name and address supplied \u2022 Comparisons between Covid and health conditions due to poor lifestyle choices are flawed. Poor lifestyle choices do not, in the main, carry the risk of infecting and possibly killing others. It is this that makes vaccine opposition dangerous and why anti-vaxxers (except those with valid medical reasons) should face restrictions with regard to social and work situations while the pandemic continues.

He died very frightened and asking his family to come and be with him, and we couldn\u2019t. The experience traumatised my sister so badly that she was hospitalised with psychosis three days after his passing. The reason he wasn\u2019t vaccinated is because his mind was poisoned with conspiracy theories and misinformation exacerbated by two years of lockdown and reduced social contact. While I am angry that he would not get vaccinated, I don\u2019t think any good would ever come from criminalising his choice. Is it not anti-vaxxers who should be demonised and prosecuted.

            "date": "2022-01-11T16:30:23Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s promised supplies of 51m doses of the Novavax vaccine, which failed to arrive in 2021 as planned, may be approved within months after the company finally completed its approval applications with the health department. The protein-based vaccine, which was initially intended to be available as a primary vaccine for the entire Australian population last year, has earned the nickname \u201cNever-vax\u201d within the health department because of the ongoing setbacks. After providing initial data to the Therapeutic Goods Administration in January 2021, the company provided the government with its \u201ccomplete submission of data and responses\u201d last week. The Advisory Committee on Vaccines (ACV), which advises the TGA and the health minister, met to review the Novavax vaccine on Friday. The TGA is now preparing to review the committee\u2019s final report. \u201cOnce the ACV\u2019s final report is received and reviewed by relevant parties, the TGA will be in a position to make a decision,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Health said. \u201cThe Novavax vaccine candidate will not be rolled out to the Australian public until the TGA has completed a full and thorough assessment. No part of this process has been rushed, and the TGA will not approve a vaccine unless it is found to be safe and effective.\u201d The department noted that the supply of Novavax vaccine after approval would still be dependent on products arriving in Australia and meeting laboratory batch release requirements, noting problems faced by the company last year. \u201cThroughout 2021, Novavax publicly indicated that there were delays in their regulatory submissions due to a series of vaccine manufacturing and supply issues,\u201d the spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Speaking after Novavax sent its first shipment of its vaccine into the European market this week, the company\u2019s chief executive, Stanley Erck, said the company had marked a significant milestone and was expecting Australian government approval within the next three months. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for our vaccine,\u201d Erck told Bloomberg TV on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for \u2026 approvals within the next 30, 60, 90 days from places like Australia, Canada, UK, and hopefully the US in that time period. So it\u2019s a big transition for the company.\u201d In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Novavax said the TGA was now \u201cactively evaluating\u201d the data it had submitted in January, and said the company had made \u201cremarkable progress\u201d developing and securing approvals for its vaccine. \u201cNovavax are working closely with the TGA on the submission and are hopeful the regulatory evaluation will be completed shortly,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOnce completed we will work with the TGA and federal government on the quantities and delivery schedule for the vaccine.\u201d When asked about the reasons for the delayed supply, the company said it believed \u201cthe important thing is to look forward and focus on how quickly we have got here\u201d. \u201cWe have spent the last year and a half conducting multiple late-stage trials with over 45,000 participants, creating our supply network, conducting tech transfer, and refining and validating our analytical methods and dealing, as all manufacturers have, with global raw materials shortages.\u201d The health minister, Greg Hunt, insisted repeatedly last year that the company was still on track to deliver on the contracted supplies for Australia in 2021, dismissing reports of ongoing delays as \u201cincorrect\u201d. Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations which use mRNA technology, the Novavax vaccine is a subunit protein vaccine, which uses a harmless part of the virus to trigger an immune response. The head of the country\u2019s vaccine taskforce, Lt Gen John Frewen, said that he believed there were a number of people who had been holding out for the Novavax vaccine. \u201cThere is a group of people who are holding out for Novavax, so I think when Novavax eventually comes we will pick up maybe a couple of extra percentages there as well,\u201d he said. In November, Hunt agreed that some people were waiting for Novavax, promising Australia would be one of the first countries to start administering the drug. \u201cIt may not be a full 2% exactly, but we do know that there are some people \u2026 who are waiting. Whilst we would advocate they don\u2019t wait, I know that some will nevertheless make that decision, and I respect that,\u201d Hunt said. Latest government data from Operation Covid Shield shows Australia\u2019s vaccination rate, for those over the age of 16, is sitting at 94.7% for first dose and 92.1% who are fully vaccinated. Novavax was one of the three vaccines that the government prioritised in its initial vaccine procurement strategy, with the prime minister announcing in February last year that supplies would be \u201csufficient to vaccinate every Australian who chooses to be vaccinated in 2021\u201d. The government continued to suggest the Novavax supplies would arrive in the third quarter of last year until the vaccine was dropped from the \u201chorizon allocation\u201d vaccine rollout strategy when it was released in June."

In an email sent to employees last Friday, Mark Valade said that Covid-19 vaccinations remain mandatory. \u201cWe put workplace safety at the very top of our priority list and the supreme court\u2019s recent ruling doesn\u2019t impact that core value,\u201d Valade wrote. \u201cWe, and the medical community, continue to believe vaccines are necessary to ensure a safe working environment for every associate and even perhaps their households. While we appreciate that there may be differing views, workplace safety is an area where we and the union that represents our associates cannot compromise,\u201d Valade added. \u201cAn unvaccinated workforce is both a people and a business risk that our company is unwilling to take.\u201d Since Valade\u2019s email, conservative pundits and social media users have criticized Carhartt, prompting the #BoycottCarhartt hashtag to trend nationally on Twitter. Matthew Kolken, an immigration lawyer tweeted, \u201cIronic that Carhartt is mandating vaccination for their employees considering that the company outsources production to China. #BoycottCarhartt.\u201d Elijah Schaffer, a host on the right-wing outlet the Blaze, tweeted, \u201cWow @Carhartt is subjecting their employees to medical abuse. Very bad look. Definitely should stop buying their products if you do.\u201d \u201cNever ever buy @Carhartt products again,\u201d wrote Sebastian Gorka, a conservative and controversial former aide to president Donald Trump\u2019s deputy assistant.

Way to go Carhartt. Real men wear Carhartt and get vaccinated.\u201d Last December, the company implemented a requirement for all its US employees to be fully vaccinated by 4 January or face termination. Carhartt said it will accept medical and religious exemptions for review and has interviewed employees to gather information regarding their situation or beliefs. The decision was met with protests from a handful of employees. \u201cAll of us, you know associated, have worked completely through the Covid, you know through the pandemic. We\u2019ve been loyal, we\u2019ve been faithful and then now all of a sudden it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got to comply,\u201d Angela Faulk, a Carhartt employee in Madisonville, Kentucky, told WEVV last December. \u201cWe love, we love Carhartt, working for Carhartt but we just feel like this decision is wrong,\u201d she added. In response to the protests, Valade wrote last week that workers in two Carhartt locations, including its Madisonville branch, were given extensions and now have until 15 February to get vaccinated."

            "date": "2022-01-13T20:09:28Z",
            "content": "The supreme court on Thursday blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a requirement that employees at large businesses be vaccinated against Covid-19 or undergo weekly testing and wear a mask on the job. At the same time, the court is allowing the administration to proceed with a vaccine mandate for most healthcare workers in the US. The court\u2019s conservative majority concluded the administration overstepped its authority by seeking to impose the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (Osha) vaccine-or-test rule on US businesses with at least 100 employees. More than 80 million people would have been affected. \u201cOsha has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress. Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what Osha has promulgated here,\u201d the conservatives wrote in an unsigned opinion. In dissent, the court\u2019s three liberals argued that it was the court that was overreaching by substituting its judgment for that of health experts. \u201cActing outside of its competence and without legal basis, the court displaces the judgments of the government officials given the responsibility to respond to workplace health emergencies,\u201d Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a joint dissent. When crafting the Osha rule, White House officials always anticipated legal challenges \u2013 and privately some harbored doubts that it could withstand them. The administration nonetheless still views the rule as a success at already driving millions of people to get vaccinated and for private businesses to implement their own requirements that are unaffected by the legal challenge. Both rules had been challenged by Republican-led states. In addition, business groups attacked the Osha emergency regulation as too expensive and likely to cause workers to leave their jobs at a time when finding new employees already is difficult. The vaccine mandate that the court will allow to be enforced nationwide covers virtually all healthcare workers in the country. It applies to healthcare providers that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid funding, potentially affecting 76,000 health care facilities as well as home health care providers. The rule has medical and religious exemptions. Earlier on Thursday, Biden announced plans to send 1,000 military medical personnel to hospitals and medical facilities, the president said on Thursday, as he announced plans to purchase another 500m at-home Covid tests. The military members will begin arriving in states across the country next week, amid a surge in cases largely attributed to the Omicron variant. This week a top government official admitted it was likely that most Americans would be infected with the coronavirus. On Tuesday the US recorded a record number of hospitalisations due to Covid-19 as daily infections soared to more than 1.35m. A test kit shortage across the country continues to hamper efforts to control the Omicron variant, but a silver lining has emerged, with signs that Omicron may be peaking in parts of the north-east. In New York City the number of new cases has flattened in recent days, the New York Times reported, while New Jersey and Maryland have seen a slight decrease in the number of infections. \u201cEvery case is one too many, but if you watch the trend line, it looks like we may be cresting over that peak,\u201d Kathy Hochul, governor of New York, said in a briefing this week. \u201cWe are not at the end, but this is a glimmer of hope when we desperately need that.\u201d Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Biden said his administration would double its order of home test kits, which will be delivered free of charge to Americans, to 1bn. The White House announced it would purchase 500m tests in December, but those tests are yet to be distributed. \u201cI know we\u2019re all frustrated as we enter this new year,\u201d Biden said, as he noted that virus cases have reached new heights. But he insisted that it remains \u201ca pandemic of the unvaccinated\u201d. Biden said a website where people can request tests will launch next week. The president also announced that, for the first time, his administration was planning to make high-quality N95 masks, which are most effective at preventing transmission of the virus, available free. The 1,000 members of the military will help mitigate staffing crunches at hospitals across the country, Biden said, with many facilities struggling because their workers are in at-home quarantines due to the virus at the same time as Covid-19 cases have surged. They will supplement the more than 800 military personnel who have already been helping civilian hospitals since Thanksgiving, and the more than 14,000 national guard members who are assisting with testing and vaccinations. This week Janet Woodcock, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration, said most Americans were likely to contract coronavirus. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard to process what\u2019s actually happening right now, which is [that] most people are going to get Covid, all right?\u201d Woodcock said. Biden also announced that six additional military medical teams will be deployed to hospitals in Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Rhode Island. The US leads the world in the daily average number of new infections reported, accounting for one in every three infections reported worldwide, according to a Reuters tally."

            "content": "A new academic study has claimed that playing fantasy football can lead to a decline in mental health, that worsens significantly the more time you spend playing. In what is claimed to be the first of its kind, research conducted by Nottingham Trent University, and published in the journal Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies, looked at the mental health and wellbeing of fantasy players, an popular activity with more than seven million active players on the Premier League\u2019s fantasy game alone. A survey was taken by 1,995 individuals that recorded their engagement with the game \u2013 time spent playing, researching and thinking about fantasy football \u2013 and the effect it had on their mood, social adjustment and habits. Whereas about a quarter of respondents (24.6%) said playing caused them to experience at least a mild low mood, that number almost doubled among heavy users. A mild low mood or greater was reported by 44% of those who spent more than 45\u2009minutes playing, more than 60\u2009minutes researching and more than 120\u2009minutes thinking about fantasy football a day. Of those surveyed 20.8% spent more than 45 minutes a day playing; 34% of heavy users said the game caused them at least mild anxiety (compared with 20% of all players) and 37% said it disrupted their lives, causing what the researchers called \u201cfunctional impairment\u201d. This was considerably more than double the 14% of all players who acknowledged such an effect. Fantasy football is popular across the world, with the survey\u2019s respondents coming from 96 countries. As well as a broad number of games and leagues to choose from there is a massive ecosystem of supporting content that offers advice on how to play, from podcasts to websites and countless social media accounts. Researchers found that the involvement of social media added a \u201cmyriad of complex cognitive and social psychological processes that may negatively impact one\u2019s mental health\u201d. They also drew a comparison with video games, observing that in fantasy football there is a relative lack of control over outcomes \u2013 with points scored dictated by what occurs on a real-life pitch \u2013 something which has been identified as a risk factor in mental health. The average age of those who contributed to the study was 33 and almost 96% of respondents were male. \u201cFantasy football is unwinnable for the vast majority that play and it is possible that the more a person is invested the more negatively impacted they will be when they \u2018lose\u2019,\u201d said Dr Luke Wilkins, the lead researcher in the study and an expert in sport and exercise psychology in Nottingham Trent University\u2019s School of Science and Technology. \u201cOur study highlights the general positives that the game can bring, but also warns of the potential negatives, and provides justification for the idea that more should be done to monitor the amount of time being dedicated to playing fantasy football.\u201d Researchers are carrying out further work focusing on a group of high-engaged fantasy football players and tracking the mental health of players over the course of a Premier League season."

            "content": "The former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said she almost did not run for the position because she feared her history of mental health problems would be exposed. The life peer was diagnosed with clinical depression in her first year at university and said she was concerned that standing for the role of leader in 2011 would result in her medical history coming out. She told the Desperately Seeking Wisdom podcast, hosted by Craig Oliver, that she wanted to be able to talk about her mental health on her own terms so she could \u201cown the way in which it was presented\u201d. Davidson said: \u201cI considered not throwing my hat in the ring for leader in case my medical history \u2026 came out. \u201cI\u2019m trying to remember dates, but I became leader in 2011, so it would be after the press got hold of Gordon Brown\u2019s children\u2019s medical records, which felt like a really egregious breach. \u201cBut the idea that the papers had the power to find out and open up people\u2019s medical records \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t somebody want to find that out about the new leader of the Tories in Scotland?\u201d Davidson said that when she was diagnosed about 20 years ago, people did not talk about mental health issues as much, saying: \u201cIt was very shameful. I didn\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d During her time in politics, she has worked with the Scottish Association for Mental Health and Davidson said she was pleased that she had had the opportunity to open up about mental health issues. She expressed hope it could help other people to realise it is not career-ending, as she had feared at the time of her diagnosis. \u201cAt that time, I was just starting at uni. I had big dreams, everyone does, but the idea that you could go on and have a big job, that you could be in the public eye, you could be in politics at all, and have this big shameful secret ... It didn\u2019t occur to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that that was my ambition over.\u201d Davidson also spoke about her annoyance at being described as a lesbian kickboxer during the 2011 leadership contest while all the other candidates were referred to by their respective jobs. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why it annoyed me,\u201d she told the podcast. \u201cOne, because I\u2019d stopped kickboxing years before, so it wasn\u2019t even true.

            "content": "A British man who flew to the US, acquired a gun and took hostages at a Texas synagogue had a criminal record and an extensive history of mental health issues, the Guardian understands. Malik Faisal Akram, a 44-year-old from Blackburn, was killed after a tense 11-hour hostage standoff at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in the Dallas suburb of Colleyville on Saturday evening. All four hostages survived the siege and were unharmed. President Joe Biden on Sunday declared the incident an act of terror and the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the UK government condemned \u201cthis act of terrorism and antisemitism\u201d. In a statement to Sky news Akram\u2019s brother Gulbar asked how he had been able to acquire a visa to enter the US. \u201cHe\u2019s known to police. Got a criminal record. How was he allowed to get a visa and acquire a gun?\u201d he said. Asked by reporters on Sunday how Akram could have procured weapons in the US, Biden said: \u201cthe assertion was he got the weapons on the street. He purchased them when he landed.\u201d The Guardian understands that Akram had a criminal record in the UK but no known terrorism convictions. Investigators in the UK believe that Akram had no connection to Texas and travelled there earlier this month. Officers at MI5, the British Security Service, were on Monday examining their records to see if he had ever been known to them. Akram had been the subject of an exclusion order in 2001 banning him from Blackburn magistrates court after he made remarks about the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US, saying he wished a court usher had been on the planes flown into buildings to commit mass murder. During the synagogue siege, Akram could be heard demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist suspected of having ties to al-Qaida, who was convicted in 2010 of trying to kill US military officers while in custody in Afghanistan. Siddiqui is in federal prison in Texas serving an 86-year sentence. As the siege unfolded the FBI asked British police to get Akram\u2019s family to try to talk him into surrendering. They spoke to Akram as he held hostages, but could not convince him to give himself up. British detectives continued to question two teenagers arrested in Manchester who are both believed to be male. They are being questioned to see if they knew anything about Akram\u2019s intentions to travel to the US to stage the attack. A community source in Blackburn said Akram was known to behave unusually, including in and around mosques in the Lancashire town. Malik Faisal Akram was known as Faisal to those who knew him in Blackburn, Lancashire. A neighbour of the former family home described him as \u201ca bit hotheaded\u201d, but otherwise a generally unremarkable man who at one point had been trying to build a property business. \u201cI never thought at all in my wildest dreams that this was ever going to happen\u201d. A taxi driver, who had known Akram since childhood, said he had recently lost his business and house. \u201cHe went through some bad issues, he must have lost a lot. But his mental health issues were genuine, we\u2019ve known him for all of our life.\u201d MP Kate Hollern said the Akram\u2019s actions were \u201cnot a reflection of Blackburn or any religious community\u201d. The head of the local council, Mohammed Khan, said Blackburn and Darwen would be assisting with the investigation. \u201cIn Blackburn we firmly stand by the belief that no community should live in fear for its safety as they go about practising their religious beliefs or identity. We stand in solidarity in condemning this act of hate, violence and terror.\u201d Lancashire Council of Mosques also condemned the hostage situation in Texas and urged its members to avoid speculation and sharing unverified information. The standoff began during a Saturday morning service at the Reform synagogue in the affluent city of about 26,000 residents. The service was being live streamed on Facebook when a man with a British accent could be heard shouting off camera. The feed was eventually cut hours later and police were called at about 10.41am. One male hostage, believed to be the synagogue\u2019s rabbi, was released at around 5pm as negotiations continued throughout the day. Armed FBI officers stormed the building and rescued the three remaining hostages at around 9pm, authorities said. [See footnote.] Details of the manner of Akram\u2019s death have not been released. \u2022 Note added 18 January 2022: When the rabbi was interviewed on 17 January he confirmed that he was not the hostage who was released at around 5pm, but was one of the three hostages who escaped later."

            "date": "2022-01-05T16:30:39Z",
            "content": "Addressing children\u2019s mental health is \u201cmore complex\u201d than blaming social media and requires investment in social housing and supports through schools, the children\u2019s commissioner has said. Anne Hollonds spoke to Guardian Australia in a wide-ranging interview about Australian governments\u2019 responses to Covid-19, and a suite of new measures at the federal level to tackle bullying online. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has made the affect of social media on youth mental health a focus in the lead-up to the 2022 election, campaigning on online safety and arguing reforms are needed, particularly to prevent harassment of women and girls. Hollonds said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d supports the legislation to unmask anonymous social media trolls, the social media inquiry and regime of eSafety commissioner content takedown orders as measures that put \u201cthe best interest of children as the first priority\u201d in the \u201cunregulated\u201d digital world. But Hollonds warned that a decade-long increase in mental health problems including self-harm, which predates the Covid-19 pandemic, has other social and economic dimensions. \u201cThere are some people who might like to say \u2018oh it\u2019s all the fault of social media\u2019. \u201cThat\u2019s often the go-to answer as to why kids have mental health problems. I wouldn\u2019t deny it has an effect but it\u2019s not as simple as that, it\u2019s more complex.\u201d Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data shows in any given year 20% of Australians experience mental ill health and that, even before the pandemic, three-quarters of Australians with mental ill health were under 25. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One in four Australian teens reported experiencing psychological distress in 2020 and parents have warned that the pandemic and lockdowns have made it harder to find help. Hollonds said poor youth mental health is a \u201clong-term increasing trend\u201d which Covid has \u201copened our eyes to in a way we can\u2019t ignore\u201d due to a \u201cspike where there were extended lockdowns\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s something that obviously worries me hugely \u2026 you just have to ask how bad does it have to get before we recognise that we need to make children a national policy priority?\u201d In addition to the way living in a digital world has \u201cchanged the experience of childhood\u201d, Hollonds nominates the financial pressure from the cost of housing and inadequate support systems as causes. \u201cFor example the education system \u2026 for the kids who are struggling, perhaps the old style education system where it\u2019s just about academic learning is not really doing enough for kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Covid has shown schools are about much more than academic learning that can be replaced by zoom. \u201cBy closing schools we actually added pressure to the distress of kids.\u201d One of the main lessons from the pandemic is that schools \u201cshould be the last to close and the first to reopen, because of their importance in the overall wellbeing of children\u201d, Hollonds said. \u201cIn my view \u2026 we\u2019ve under-estimated school as a community hub of support for the wellbeing of kids and their families.\u201d Hollonds said that some other developed countries had better integrated the health and education systems making it \u201ceasier for people to get help they need\u201d. Hollonds said the cost of housing and the \u201cspike in costs during Covid\u201d was also a deeply worrying factor that emerges from her consultation with children, young people and their families. \u201cIt\u2019s those areas with low incomes, higher poverty and disadvantage \u2026 outside CBDs, in rural and outer urban areas \u2013 [they are] precisely the areas where rents have become unaffordable [during the pandemic].\u201d Hollonds called on governments to address \u201cunder-investment in social housing over decades\u201d and to look at economic drivers of housing costs. Her comments back calls from other experts for more comprehensive mental health supports and higher income supports to tackle the youth mental health crisis. In November the former Labor premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill, who\u2019s now chief executive of Minderoo Foundation\u2019s Thrive by Five initiative, accused the Morrison government of neglecting to assess the affect of the pandemic on young children, with current policies labelled \u201ca series of crisis responses\u201d. The latest Naplan data has found that Australian schoolchildren\u2019s basic literacy and numeracy skills were relatively unscathed during first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, but gaps are widening between city students and those in regional and remote areas. Guardian Australia previously reported concerns from teachers that the compounded effects of two years of intermittent learning in some areas are only just beginning to become apparent, especially for younger cohorts (up to grade 2) that are not captured by the Naplan dataset."

            "content": "Hundreds of clinical psychiatrists and psychologists have warned that the police and crime bill reaching its final stages in parliament \u201cwill have a profound negative impact on young people\u2019s mental health\u201d. \u201cWe cannot think of better measures to disempower and socially isolate young people,\u201d they say in an open letter signed by more than 350 academics and clinicians and published online. The intervention comes as the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill reaches the final stages of its journey into law. It has been widely opposed by human rights activists, racial justice groups, former home secretaries and parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights, which called the proposals \u201coppressive and wrong\u201d. Among the anti-protest measures in the bill are new powers for police to ban marches and demonstrations deemed \u201cseriously disruptive\u201d, including being too noisy; sentences of up to 51 weeks for protesters who attach themselves, or \u201clock on\u201d to, another person or to an object; and sentences of up to 10 years for anyone found guilty of the \u201cdesecration\u201d of a statue or memorial. \u201cOne result of this legislation, if passed, will be that young people face a choice between being intimidated into inaction and isolation, or possibly criminalised if they choose to act,\u201d the letter says. \u201cSome may deliberately choose to escalate their actions to be more disruptive and possibly violent, given the severe consequences for even minor nonviolent activity.\u201d Signatories include Susie Orbach, psychoanalyst and author of Fat Is a Feminist Issue, Eric Taylor, the emeritus professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King\u2019s College London, and Mike Wang, the chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists, who signed on behalf of his entire organisation. Orbach said young people, full of the \u201cgreat hope and ennui\u201d of adolescence, were keen to make a difference to the world. \u201cImagine then a bill that robs you and your friends of initiative and agency,\u201d she said. \u2018\u201cWe bring children up to act and then the government says no. This bill sews confusion. It attempts to disable engagement. It will depoliticise youth, which is maybe what is wanted, but what a tragedy personally and collectively.\u201d The letter was drafted by Lynne Jones, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, who was awarded an OBE for her work with children in conflict zones in central Europe in the late 90s. Jones said she was inspired by an Australian environmental activist, Marco Bellemo, who called on professionals to oppose restrictions on activism. She said of the bill: \u201cIt is terrifying because it is undermining one of the pillars of our democracy, and it is also attacking the young people who most need our support. \u201cPriti Patel has made no bones that she\u2019s targeting eco-protesters, that means she\u2019s targeting young people.\u201d The Guardian has contacted the Home Office for comment."

            "date": "2022-01-31T10:00:46Z",
            "content": "Plenty of people \u2013 on the left as well as the right \u2013 believed George Osborne when he conjured up a dystopian vision of Britain after a vote for Brexit during the final weeks of the referendum campaign. The then chancellor said victory for leave would result in a \u201cDIY recession\u201d, the loss of 800,000 jobs, a weaker housing market and a stock market crash. Two years on from our date of departure from the EU, none of it has happened. Unemployment is lower than it was in 2016 and, although this is very much a mixed blessing, house prices are higher. Share prices have risen and until Covid-19 arrived there was no recession. That hasn\u2019t halted the flow of gloomy predictions: Nissan would quit the UK, tens of thousands of City jobs would be lost to Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. More recently, Brexit supply chain problems would mean a turkey-less Christmas and empty high street shelves in December. None of that happened either, and the wait for economic meltdown goes on. Far from quitting the UK, Nissan last year announced it was investing \u00a31bn in electric vehicle production at its Sunderland plant. Children didn\u2019t wake up to empty Christmas stockings. A study by the consultancy EY found almost nine out of 10 global financial services firms plan to establish or expand operations in the UK this year. Confirmation bias is where people latch on to evidence that suits their argument while zoning out things that don\u2019t. Opponents of Brexit, for example, filter out the success of the UK\u2019s go-it-alone vaccine procurement strategy and the freedom the government now has to cut VAT on domestic energy bills. Brexit supporters, by contrast, point out that UK exports to the EU in the second half of 2021 varied little from their level in the same period of 2020 when trade was still frictionless, but ignore the fact that other countries performed more strongly last year as lockdown restrictions were eased. Likewise, they downplay the loss of share trading to Amsterdam and the UK\u2019s poor investment performance after the Brexit vote. Stripped of the social media spats, the reality is that Brexit has not magically transformed Britain\u2019s economic prospects, but nor has it been calamitous. From a big-picture perspective, Britain\u2019s economy will exit Covid-19 looking pretty much the same as when the virus first arrived two years ago, even though the UK left the single market and the customs union in the meantime. Unemployment is little different, interest rates are a little lower, the housing market is hot. The big difference is that inflation is a lot higher, as it is in every developed country. That\u2019s not to say the transition from EU membership has been seamless or cost free. It has been a burden that small exporting businesses could have done without at any time, let alone when seeking to cope with the impact of a global pandemic. But the response to Covid-19 has proved two things: businesses adapt to changed circumstances pretty quickly, and that process can be accelerated by supportive government policy. The models suggesting the damage from Brexit will be permanent rather than transitional are flawed for two reasons: they are based on a number of questionable \u2013 and often neoliberal \u2013 assumptions; and they envisage life goes on as before, with no change in behaviour either by the private sector or the state. There is a parallel here with the aim of \u201cgreening\u201d the economy. Clearly, there will be costs from decarbonising the economy, but supporters of the net zero target think these can be mitigated by activist government, and see the opportunity to break with a broken model. There are those for whom this represents a false parallel because there can be no possible benefits from leaving the EU. For them it is only a matter of time before the doomsday scenario comes about, and therefore the only way ahead is for Britain to rejoin. But this strategy would only work if one of the two main parties supported it, and neither of them do. The most significant Brexit development of the past two years has not been economic but political: the decision by Keir Starmer to accept that the left needed to come up with its own plan for a post-EU Britain. Interviewed by my colleague Simon Hattenstone, Starmer could not have been clearer: \u201cLook, we\u2019ve left the EU. There\u2019s no case for rejoining so we have to make it work. We are out, and we\u2019re staying out.\u201d Asked whether that ruled out a return to the single market or customs union under a Labour government he went on: \u201cYes, it does. We\u2019ve got to make Brexit work from the outside and not reopen old wounds.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the same when she recently outlined her five-point plan for the economy. For Labour, Brexit is a done deal, and accepting that has meant it has been Reeves, who supported remain in 2016, rather than Rishi Sunak, who backed leave, who has been making the case to cut VAT on energy bills. Labour\u2019s new stance makes sense, and not just because it gives the party a chance of winning the next election. Until recently there were only two options: a wasted-opportunity Brexit where nothing much happens and the economy trundles along much as before; and a rightwing free-market Brexit. Now there\u2019s a third: a Labour Brexit in which the state uses its new powers to build a greener, fairer, levelled-up Britain. Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor"

            "content": "Sam Bowman (The big idea: could fixing housing fix everything else, too?, 17 January) is quite right in pointing out that one social problem \u2013 the housing shortage \u2013 lies at the root of many other problems, and he provides a pretty full list of what those problems are. As he says, it is not the cost of bricks and mortar that has sky-rocketed, but the cost of land. We face not a housing crisis, but a land crisis. It is clearly wrong that when the state \u2013 in the guise of the local planning authority \u2013 grants permission for development on an area of land, the enormous increase in its value is largely pocketed as unearned income by the landowner, rather than going to the community whose needs and whose taxes that have paid for local infrastructure give value to land in the first place. Bowman blames the shortage on the scarcity of permissions to build, but Julia Kollewe (Report, 8 May 2021) told us that since 2010-11, permission for 2.78m houses has been given but only 1.6m have been built in the same period, prompting the suspicion that developers are holding land unused while speculating on further increase in its value, and therefore in their profits. Bowman considers various ways to fix this modern ill, but fails to mention the best one: a revenue-neutral reform of the tax system so that tax is increased on the unearned income from land, ignoring improvements, and reduced on earned income and consumption. Such a land value tax would be levied on unused land as well as other land and so would put a stop to land speculation. There would be a strong incentive to develop, the cost of land and therefore of houses would reduce, leading to real affordability, as well as to solutions of all the problems he identifies as stemming from our housing crisis.

For example, Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio posted on Twitter that there \u201cis no Omicron hospital \u2018surge\u2019 in Florida. People admitted for non-Covid reasons get tested. If they test positive they get counted as a \u2018Covid patient.\u2019\u201d Infectious disease experts and Florida hospital leaders say that \u2013 while there is some validity to the assessment that data showing an increase in Covid hospitalizations and cases can in part be attributed to increased testing \u2013 the state\u2019s hospitals still face potentially serious staffing shortages. One hospital in the state had to close its maternity ward because of a Covid outbreak among staff. But in short, Florida has become a focal point of the often politicized debate over whether the Omicron variant is dangerous enough to overwhelm hospital systems and requires precautions taken earlier in the pandemic. \u201cI think there are certainly pressure points because of staffing challenges,\u201d said Dr Joshua Lenchus, chief medical officer of Broward Health. \u201cThere has been a tremendous shift with nurses and respiratory therapists that have migrated to areas in greatest need and some areas that may compensate them better than other areas.\u201d Florida, which its rightwing Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, touts as a place free of federal and other states\u2019 draconian Covid-related restrictions, has seen a 566% increase in Covid cases over the past two weeks and a 246% increase in Covid hospitalizations during that time, according to data from the New York Times. Sixty-four percent of the state has been vaccinated against the virus, which is slightly higher than the country\u2019s vaccination rate. DeSantis on Monday at a press conference described other states as \u201cletting hysteria drive them to doing really damaging things\u201d. While acknowledging a shortage in Covid tests, the governor and Florida\u2019s surgeon general also said that people were testing themselves for the virus too much and that the state would issue new guidance on testing. \u201cWithout it, we\u2019re going to be sort of stuck in the same cycle. So, it\u2019s really time for people to be living, to make the decisions they want regarding vaccination, to enjoy the fact that many people have natural immunity,\u201d said the state surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo. Florida Democrats blamed DeSantis for the fact that state residents have recently waited hours in line to get a Covid test. \u201cWe have not received any assistance from the state of Florida at our testing sites,\u201d Mayor Jerry Demings of Orange county, a Democrat, said, according to NBC News. \u201cLocal governments have been left to figure it out and respond on our own. We are doing our best.\u201d The testing shortage has also prompted some Florida residents to visit emergency rooms in search of tests. The Florida Hospital Association last week on Twitter urged people with mild or no symptoms not to visit emergency rooms for tests and instead find a testing site. \u201cWhile facing the strain of workforce challenges, ERs are being put under increased pressure to provide care,\u201d the organization stated. Lenchus, of Broward Health, attributes the demand for tests in emergency rooms to the long wait at testing sites and the fact that people don\u2019t first turn to their primary care provider. \u201cThey show up at the emergency rooms thinking they are going to get a test,\u201d said Lenchus. \u201cOur hospital, as well as other hospitals, are not community testing sites. We have a limited supply of tests \u2026 like others do, and those tests should be reserved for people who are symptomatic and admitted to the hospital.\u201d Still, Broward Health tests all patients who are admitted. While Rubio described some of the Covid hospitalization data as misleading, those tests are still important because not everyone presents with classic Covid symptoms \u2013 even though the virus could be the reason for the hospitalization \u2013 and the virus can complicate other diseases, said Dr Aileen Marty, an infectious disease expert at Florida International University. Even if a patient comes to the hospital for a different issue, a positive Covid test is important because \u201cwe have to treat that patient differently\u201d, said Marty. The personal protective equipment \u201cwe use is different even if that person\u2019s symptoms are not directly related to Covid\u201d. Regardless of how representative the Covid infection and hospitalization numbers are of the scale of the problem in Florida, the virus continues to upend normal care and staffing. On 2 January, Holy Cross Health in Broward county had to shut down its labor and delivery unit because of staffing shortages due to people who became sick with the virus. Five patients have been transferred to Broward Health, and a number of other patients proactively changed their plans to physicians at the hospital, according to a Broward Health spokesperson. \u201cThere are still staffing challenges, and I think we as a healthcare community work together to ensure that the care of the community is still addressed,\u201d said Lenchus. He and Marty both said they expected the wave to peak in the coming weeks. They are also waiting on state or federal government to provide additional monoclonal antibody treatments and Pfizer\u2019s new antiviral pill. \u201cI would imagine things perhaps could be better if the governor and the president played nicer together, but I would hope that as two professionals, they understand that protection of the public \u2013 which is in the oath that they swore when they took office \u2013 should take precedence over everything else,\u201d said Lenchus. \u201cAnd to their credit, when push comes to shove, when we do get into a crisis, perhaps there is some politicking, but they do come to the table and do what is right.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-21T10:07:46Z",
            "content": "Scott Morrison has taken aim at China for \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d, foreign interference and cyber attacks in a speech to the Davos World Economic Forum. Without naming the source of \u201csharper geopolitical competition\u201d, the Australian prime minister warned of increasing territorial disputes in the Indo-Pacific region and urged an end to protectionist measures directed at Australia. Australia has been the target of Chinese tariffs on key agricultural exports, such as barley and wheat, due to a long series of grievances including \u201cinterference in China\u2019s Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs\u201d and \u201cspearheading the crusade against China in certain multilateral forums\u201d. Morrison told the forum that the global strategic environment had \u201cdeteriorated\u201d with the world becoming more \u201cfragmented and contested particularly here in the Indo-Pacific, which has become the world\u2019s strategic centre of gravity\u201d. Morrison said the region had become \u201chighly contested\u201d due to increased use of \u201cgrey-zone tactics\u201d seeking to \u201ccoerce and intimidate\u201d. \u201cThere are tensions over territorial claims, there is rapid military modernisation, there is foreign interference occurring in nations right across the Pacific and here in Australia. \u201cThere\u2019s malicious cyber threats and attacks that are taking place, disinformation, economic coercion.\u201d In response, Morrison said Australia had sought a \u201cweb of alignment\u201d with nations that wanted to cooperate to \u201cfavour freedom and the rule of law\u201d, including Pacific nations, Asean and the Quad group with Japan, India and the US. \u201cAustralia\u2019s interests are inextricably linked to an open inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific, one where the rights of all nations are protected \u2026 as well as aspirations as sovereign nations.\u201d Morrison argued that Australia had sought to \u201chold firm to its values\u201d despite experiencing economic protectionist and coercive measures that were \u201cnot without costs\u201d. \u201cBut I also believe it\u2019s come at a significant cost to the countries which implement such measures \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see how anyone wins from such tactics. \u201cThe world can\u2019t afford to march in that direction.\u201d Morrison also noted increased tension with Russia over Ukraine and between the G2 of US and China. \u201cThe idea that we would be in a hemisphere of influence with one power in the region, is not something that is consistent with global stability and regional stability.\u201d Australia has sought to fight off Chinese tariffs at the World Trade Organization, while some National party members in the ruling Coalition suggesting countering with protectionist measures. The US has vowed to help Australia resist Chinese protectionism. Morrison also used the Davos speech to boast of Australia\u2019s economic recovery from the pandemic, with unemployment down to 4.2%, and its health outcomes, with the second-lowest death rate in the OECD from Covid and eighth-highest vaccination rate. Morrison said there had been no \u201cgreat resignation\u201d in Australia, crediting its success to a \u201cbusiness-led recovery\u201d and not pursuing \u201cfunky experiments\u201d with a permanently enlarged role for government in the economy. On climate, Morrison said Australia had cut its emissions by 20% on 2005 levels and now aims to achieve net zero by 2050. But when asked if Australia would sign up to the ICAO protocol for net zero emissions in the aviation sector, Morrison dead-batted by saying Australia \u201cdoesn\u2019t make commitments without fully considering what the impacts are\u201d."

            "date": "2022-01-26T19:21:57Z",
            "content": "The government was forced to deny claims that it had scrapped a crucial economic crime bill on Wednesday, as MPs from across the house rounded on ministers for failing to tackle the UK capital\u2019s \u201cLondongrad\u201d reputation as a money-laundering hub used by Russian oligarchs, criminals and kleptocrats. The scathing comments in the House of Commons follow the shock resignation of junior minster Lord Agnew on Monday, who revealed in his departing letter that the government had only last week made a \u201cfoolish\u201d decision to kill off the bill during the next parliamentary year. As recently as December, prime minister Boris Johnson promised a \u201cyear of action\u201d on fraud at a summit organised by US president Joe Biden, saying the government would target \u201cthe illicit finance that undermines democracy everywhere, strengthening our law enforcement powers to go after the criminals who abuse our corporate structures\u201d. Agnew had also hit out at the government for failing to take action against Covid loan fraud, which critics have said could cost the taxpayer billions of pounds. The damning accusations pushed Rishi Sunak to assure that the government would \u201cdo everything we can\u201d to recover stolen funds. \u201cI\u2019m not ignoring it, and I\u2019m definitely not \u2018writing it off,\u2019\u201d the chancellor said on Twitter on Wednesday. Figures from HMRC show an estimated \u00a35.8bn has been lost due to fraudulent claims for furlough and other business relief schemes. Reports suggest HMRC has off \u00a34.3bn stolen of that sum as unrecoverable. However, the government has refused to confirm the figure. MPs said the economic crime bill was needed to tackle the Covid loan fraud issues raised by Agnew, and the use of London as a money laundering destination by kleptocrats from Russia and other regimes. Campaigners had been pushing for the bill to be included in the next parliamentary session, which run s from later this year into 2023, and will be announced at the next Queen\u2019s speech. It was expected to include reforms of Companies House, the loosely policed UK company registry, and rules requiring those holding property through offshore shell companies to declare their identities. Paul Scully, the parliamentary undersecretary for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, was called to the Commons to answer an urgent question on the status of the bill. He said: \u201cThere has been nothing pulled at all.\u201d But Scully said no legislation would be put forward before the yet-unscheduled Queen\u2019s speech, which opens a new parliamentary year. The government has not yet set a date for the speech, but last year held the state opening in May. It comes as Downing Street considers sanctions against Russia if Moscow follows through on an invasion of Ukraine. \u201cUp to 50% of money flowing through Russian laundromats \u2013 often used for tax avoidance stolen public funds and to launder moneys derived from organised crime \u2013 flow through UK shell companies,\u201d said Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake, who initiated the debate by tabling the urgent question. \u201cThis is not a notional white collar offence,\u201d he said added. \u201cIt affects real people in very tangible ways. Terrorists and drug dealers depend on it to launder and legitimise their money through UK banks, companies and properties.\u201d SNP MP Alison Thewliss urged the government to set a date for the introduction of the economic crime bill, saying the lack of action suggested complacency on behalf of prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Cabinet. \u201cWhy is it that this government is so unconcerned that the UK is being deemed \u201cLondongrad\u201d, notorious for laundering of dirty money?\u201d John Penrose, the Conservative MP for Weston-super-Mare also accused the government of moving too slowly. \u201cThe well of excuses after three or four years of promising this piece of legislation, or its related pieces, has now run dry. And it is absolutely essential for the credibility of his country and of this government, particularly the time when we have a crisis in Ukraine, and all sorts of Russian oligarchs waiting to move money into this country if they possibly can \u2026 that we do not back away from the central piece of legislation,\u201d he added. Labour MP Chris Bryant said the UK\u2019s rules, as they currently stand, are too \u201csoft touch\u201d and that \u201cif we want to give a strong message to Russia in particular at this moment we\u2019ve got to move swiftly not say \u2018oh, I can\u2019t possibly come into what legislation we might be thinking of in the future.\u2019\u201d But Scully refused to be pulled into speculation about the timing of the bill\u2019s introduction. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t do is pre-empt what Her Majesty will say in the Queen\u2019s speech,\u201d he said, adding that she would \u201cset out the government\u2019s programming in due course,.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-04T08:10:40Z",
            "content": "London\u2019s stock market is facing a barrage of criticism, with global investors likening it to a \u201cglobal backwater\u201d struggling to attract and retain growth companies that excite investors and are building the 21st-century economy. However, after a surge of stock flotations in 2021, including cutting-edge firms such as Oxford Nanopore, and new listing rules, London\u2019s status as a global financial centre could brighten in 2022. Currently, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies looks dated. Technology only makes up about 2% of the London market, compared with 20% across global markets. \u201cThat means London is tenfold underweight in the part of the economy growing faster, and which is attracting high valuations,\u201d says Simon French, the chief economist of Panmure Gordon. \u201cIf you\u2019re an investor looking to invest in growth, you haven\u2019t got a lot of options on the UK public market, with the greatest respect to Sage and Micro Focus.\u201d Paul Marshall, the boss of the \u00a340m ($55bn) hedge fund Marshall Wace, wrote in the Financial Times that the City of London risked becoming \u201ca sort of Jurassic Park\u201d, and that fund managers were content to collect dividends from ponderous old economy players rather than encouraging and rewarding innovation. French points out that in the US market, liquidity has doubled since the financial crisis, but on the FTSE All-Share it has more than halved, putting some fund managers off investing in London. \u201cPerformance begets liquidity begets performance, so London\u2019s underperformance can lead to a vicious circle,\u201d French explains. He fears that recent reviews of the UK\u2019s listing regime have failed to tackle this liquidity issue. James Anderson, the joint manager of Baillie Gifford\u2019s Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust and an early investor in major US tech stocks such as Tesla, has compared the FTSE 100 to a 19th-century stock market \u2013 heavy with banks and oil stocks, but sadly lacking in real innovation. It will take time for London to shake off this image, French says. \u201cYou don\u2019t go from a 19th-century stock exchange, or a Jurassic Park one, to a Star Trek exchange overnight.\u201d There are signs that London is beaming up some fast-growing companies, with Oxford Nanopore, Deliveroo and Darktrace coming to market. In total, 122 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange last year, raising more than \u00a316.8bn \u2013 the biggest initial public offering pot since 2007. But the journey has been shaky: Deliveroo tumbled by 30% on its debut in March, and is languishing at record lows, while Darktrace was ejected from the FTSE 100 after its initial share surge faded. Others have done better, such as the consumer review site Trustpilot, which has gained 25% since floating. \u201cFor every Deliveroo or Darktrace, there is a Trustpilot or Auction Technologies out there,\u201d says French. High valuations on the other side of the Atlantic also hurt London \u2013 they mean firms don\u2019t have to sell as much of their company on the Nasdaq, tor example, to raise the same money. London\u2019s new listing rules mean private firms needn\u2019t sell as much stock to go public. They also allow firms with dual-class share structures popular with entrepreneurs and founders on to the FTSE 100 and the 250 index of smaller firms. Marshall, though, says London needs to move \u201cfaster and harder still\u201d to lure growth companies, close the gap with New York and become a more attractive place to list and raise capital than the EU and Asia. \u201cLondon is also the natural home for ESG [environmental, social and governance] winners, emerging market winners and digital assets. To capitalise on these advantages, we need to encourage asset managers to invest in these assets and develop a wider culture of growth-oriented investing,\u201d he insists. The move towards ESG investing had counted against London, with fund managers shunning polluting industries such as fossil fuel producers and mining companies. London\u2019s problem in 2021 was retaining companies as much as attracting new ones. A string of listed companies became takeover targets,, such as the defence firm Meggitt and UK tech firm Blue Prism, with speculation BT could be next. The weaker pound also left some growth companies as sitting ducks \u2013 chip designer ARM, the crown jewel of UK tech, was snaffled by SoftBank just after the Brexit vote in 2016. US private equity firms have also taken advantage of depressed valuations. This hoovering up of British tech firms by US investors is worrying MPs, with 130 UK tech firms reportedly acquired by American companies between January and mid-December 2021. \u201cWe need to recognise the impact this is having on our own capabilities and sovereign strength,\u201d Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the parliamentary defence select committee, told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cIt goes against the grain of the government\u2019s wise long-term ambition of becoming a high-tech superpower.\u201d David Miller, an executive director of Quilter Cheviot, pushes back on the idea that the City of London itself risks becoming a backwater. \u201cIn many ways it remains an ideal location for investment managers, with its time zone, language, huge infrastructure and the right attitude. London has always been good at global investment, it\u2019s always looked out, not in, and that makes London the best place for global investment,\u201d says Miller. The UK broker AJ Bell estimates that the FTSE 100 will pay out \u00a381.8bn in dividends in 2021, a 32% increase compared with 2020 when the pandemic forced firms to cut or suspend payments. The mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP Group, oil firm Shell and tobacco company BAT will dole out the most, highlighting the City\u2019s dilemma \u2013 owning these \u201csin stocks\u201d can generate a healthy income, vital for pension funds and income funds. Miller can\u2019t see a world in which a balanced portfolio doesn\u2019t have dividend payers as part of the mix; not paying a dividend shouldn\u2019t see a company excluded if its prospects are good. The balance between growth and value stocks today is different than before the dotcom crash two decades ago. \u201cIn 1999, people sold dividend-paying firms to buy firms that just evaporated,\u201d Miller says. There\u2019s also a different mindset to investing across the Atlantic. \u201cInvestors in the US want the companies they invest in to grow market share \u2013 market share really excites US fund managers,\u201d Miller says. In the UK and Europe there\u2019s much more focus on profitability. \u201cIf a company isn\u2019t profitable now, we want to know when it will be profitable.\u201d In the short term, the FTSE 100 could benefit if the pandemic eases in 2022, lifting banks, mining firms, oil companies, travel and hospitality firms. JPMorgan recently upgraded its rating on UK stocks to \u201coverweight\u201d, pointing out that British equity markets are now trading at a \u201crecord discount\u201d. Matt Weller, the global head of research at Forex.com and City Index, agrees that much of the FTSE\u2019s underperformance comes down to sector weightings. \u201cThe FTSE\u2019s heavy allocation to the underperforming consumer staple and financial sectors (both near 20% weighting) dwarf the index\u2019s minuscule (under 2%) exposure to technology stocks, exactly the inverse of the allocation that you\u2019d create with the benefit of hindsight,\u201d says Weller. \u201cOf course, markets are highly cyclical, and the recent uptick in inflation and interest rates could be the catalyst to shift sector performance in favor of the FTSE\u2019s weights in the coming quarters.\u201d London has also lost out to Amsterdam in the race to attract \u201cblank-cheque\u201d companies, big on Wall Street, which seek out a fledgling business to acquire. London\u2019s first special purpose acquisition company (Spac) launched at the end of November, by which time Amsterdam had already racked up 13. In the long run, local exchanges could be pushed further to the margins. 24 Exchange, a Bermuda-based crypto and foreign exchange trading platform, is planning to bring in around-the-clock stock trading, which is already possible with cryptocurrencies. Miller says the general idea of 24-hour trading is not a \u201ctotally ridiculous\u201d one. \u201cThe transition from floor trading to where we are now isn\u2019t going to stop where it is now.\u201d To an extent there is already 24-hour trading through the working week, with bourses in Asia-Pacific markets, Europe and New York together covering most time zones. But many stocks are only listed on one exchange, and liquidity in individual companies is better when their local exchange is open. Non-stop trading could be gruelling for equities traders, although nothing that other industries don\u2019t handle. \u201cIf the car industry can work on three shifts per day, why can\u2019t traders?\u201d Miller points out."

            "content": "The tech sector led US stock markets on a pandemic boom last year. Now markets are whipsawing on fears that the Federal Reserve will end the era of easy money, all while a potential war in Ukraine looms. Some warn of a bigger correction to come on a scale not seen since the dotcom collapse of the late 1990s. On Monday, US stock markets crashed then rallied. The Dow Jones at one point lost more than 1,000 points before ending up just over 100. Tuesday was more of the same with the Dow losing 800 points only to gain most of it back. Analysts expect more volatile days ahead. The Fed on Wednesday issued its latest update on its plans to raise rates in order to curb inflation, and the world\u2019s largest tech firms are preparing to issue their latest results to investors, who appear to have grown more skeptical about their prospects. Jeremy Grantham, the British co-founder of Boston-based investment manager GMO, believes the US is now in a \u201csuper-bubble\u201d comparable to the dotcom era, the Wall Street crash of 1929, and the housing market madness of 2006. It is not just tech that has blown up, but housing prices, commodities and bond prices. The \u201cwild rumpus\u201d has begun, according to Grantham. It is unlikely to end soon. The latest test of investor resolve came on Tuesday when Microsoft released its quarterly results. The Seattle-based tech giant announced sales topping half a billion a day and a profit of more than $18bn. Huge numbers, and better than expected. Its shares initially fell 5% in after-hours trading. Microsoft will be followed by Apple, Tesla, Intel and Samsung this week, with more to come from Alphabet, Amazon and Meta next month \u2013 a litmus test for a newly acid view on a sector that now dominates the stock markets and much of daily life. Already one of the pandemic\u2019s winners has shown how much the mood has changed. Netflix, which boomed during the pandemic lockdowns, saw its share price collapse after a disappointing earnings result last week that predicted a slowdown in subscribers. For Brian Wieser, president of business intelligence at GroupM Global, Netflix\u2019s woes may have been the catalyst that changed investor confidence in the sector. \u201cInvestors generally need a catalyst for an action,\u201d he said. The rising cost of capital has worried investors that the days of heady growth are over. But this isn\u2019t a repeat of the dotcom bubble, he said. Today\u2019s tech titans are sitting on huge piles of cash and are still making big profits. \u201cNetflix is still going to spend $20bn on content this year,\u201d he said. Apple has more than $195bn in cash, and Microsoft has another $130bn. The vertiginous swings markets are experiencing are partly down to today\u2019s \u201chyper-connected\u201d world, according to Michael Antonelli, managing director at Robert W Baird. \u201cMarkets, data, sentiment, trading, podcasts, blogs: everybody knows everything instantly and they can act on any emotion with the push of a button.\u201d Today\u2019s losses are somebody\u2019s future gains, he noted in a blogpost. But added: \u201cHumans are irrational creatures; they aren\u2019t going to take the time to think about their actions when they can push a button and quiet the pain receptor in their brain.\u201d"

            "content": "Global stock markets have fallen sharply as fears of military conflict in Ukraine spooked investors, wiping \u00a353bn off the value of the UK\u2019s blue-chip share index. European markets tumbled by 3.8% to their lowest levels since October, their biggest one-day fall in more than 18 months, after Nato said it was reinforcing its eastern borders with land, sea and air forces as a Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared increasingly likely. Volatility soared, as investors also feared the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, would raise interest rates several times this year, starting in March, after US inflation hit a 40-year high of 7% in December. In the City of London, the FTSE 100 index fell 2.6% to a one-month low, its biggest fall in two months, as Boris Johnson warned that a \u201clightning war\u201d in Ukraine was possible but not inevitable. The blue-chip index lost 197 points, falling to 7,297. The educational publisher Pearson led the FTSE 100 fallers, down 9%, with the Russian steelmaker Evraz dropping 8%. Miners, energy producers, travel firms and housebuilders also slid. In Frankfurt, the Dax index of leading German companies lost 3.8%, while France\u2019s Cac shed 4%. The New York stock market saw wild swings. Heavy selling pushed the S&amp;P 500 index down over 3% at one stage, more than 10% below its record high, before a late rally pushed the major US indices higher at the end of the day. Investors rushed to safe-haven assets such as the US dollar, and also the Swiss franc, which hit a six-year high against the euro. The sell-off in risk assets hit cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin falling to a six-month low of about $33,000 (\u00a324,500), less than half its all-time high of $69,000 reached last November. The Fed, which will meet this week, could also start to run down its balance sheet this year, removing some of the stimulus introduced since the Covid pandemic began. \u201cTraders continue to be in selling mode as fears mount surrounding the Russia-Ukraine situation,\u201d said David Madden, a market analyst at Equiti Capital. \u201cAlso playing into the mix are the concerns the Federal Reserve will issue a hawkish update on Wednesday.\u201d The prospect of tighter monetary policy has driven technology stocks lower, with the Nasdaq Composite index dropping into correction territory earlier this month.. \u201cThe double-whammy of risk events is proving too much for Wall Street to handle, with the Nasdaq once again leading the charge lower as the tech rout deepens,\u201d said Fiona Cincotta, a senior financial markets analyst at City Index. \u201cMeanwhile, embassy staff are being pulled out of Kyiv amid growing fears that Russia could send troops into Ukraine imminently. Talks last week between the US and Russia failed to pave the way to a solution. Fears of war are driving the risk-off trade with bonds rising.\u201d There was heavy selling on Moscow\u2019s stock market, with the Moex index of Russian companies tumbling almost 6% to its lowest level since December 2020, taking its losses in 2022 to almost 15%. The rouble hit a one-year low, dropping 2.5% to more than 79 roubles to the US dollar. The Bank of Russia said it was halting purchases of foreign currency in an attempt to ease pressure on the rouble, which has slumped amid tensions over Ukraine. The UK\u2019s FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies tumbled by 3.6%, hitting its lowest level since March 2021. The cybersecurity firm Darktrace was down 14.6%, the newspaper publisher Reach fell 11%, while the cinema chain Cineworld and the luxury carmaker Aston Martin dropped 8.7%. Gas prices soared, with the wholesale day-ahead price of UK gas jumping 17%, on concerns that Russian supplies of energy to Europe could be disrupted. There were also signs that the Omicron variant had slowed the global recovery. Private sector growth in the UK and eurozone hit its lowest in 11 months, while US business activity grew at its slowest pace in 18 months in January, according to the latest surveys of purchasing managers."

            "date": "2022-01-24T16:30:20Z",
            "content": "Financial news has started to turn negative, both at home and abroad. Is the debt-fuelled party that has provided solace amid the pandemic as well as jobs and rising asset prices for millions if not billions about to end? There are certainly some near-term nasties but the larger and more serious threats are geopolitical and difficult to predict \u2013 including the next stage of the Covid pandemic \u2013 or of our own making. Here\u2019s a non-exhaustive list of the economic challenges we face. Gathering storms First up, Omicron has been around for more than a month but the more infectious Covid variant hasn\u2019t \u2013 so far \u2013 derailed financial markets. Sure, there\u2019s mass absenteeism of infected or close-contacted staff, upsetting supply chains in Australia where many businesses have started to disclose fears of running out of cash. And, globally, firms are scrambling to secure inputs for everything from cars to fertilisers. Monday\u2019s financial media warned of brewing market turbulence, as the binary world of punters are apparently shifting from \u201crisk on\u201d to \u201crisk off\u201d. US stocks dropped more than 5% last week, reportedly the worst return since Covid got serious in March 2020. The famously tech-heavy Nasdaq was about 14% lighter since the start of this year. But a bigger plonk, though, is coming from the cryptic world of crypto-currency. The Washington Post over the weekend estimated digital tokens had \u201cvaporised\u201d $US1.4tn (almost A$2tn) in just two months as the ethereal market halved in value. When Australia\u2019s sharemarket opened on Monday, stocks duly dived about 1%. By close of play, though, losses were a more modest 0.5% \u2013 not a savaging by any measure. Another tumultuous day beckons, though, with Australian stock futures projected to open lower on Tuesday after wild swings of sentiment on Wall Street. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 index earlier fell by 3.8% \u2011 its worst day since June 2020. Inflationary threat Investors have reason to brace for a big week in financial markets. The big bugbear is inflation with nations such as Britain and the US recording their fastest price spurt in decades, and the US Federal Reserve meeting for two days this week to signal if higher interest rates are coming sooner than flagged. Those with variable-rate mortgages know having to repay more on a loan typically discourages purchases of everything else. One\u2019s sense of wealth, too, takes a hit if others become less willing to borrow as much for property, nixing the chances of repeating last year\u2019s 25% run-up in average Australian \u201chome values\u201d, for instance. For Australia, the next glimpse of inflationary pressures lands on Tuesday, when the ABS releases December-quarter consumer price figures. The headline figure of 3% or so will largely be ignored, with attention focusing on the trimmed mean \u2013 a gauge that strips out the more transient spiky movements. The expected 2.4% rate will be the highest in more than seven years, and will renew fears Australia\u2019s Reserve Bank will move earlier than its 2023-24 projected first rise in official rates. Westpac last week brought forward its tip for the first RBA move to this August, a shift that gained more credence after another strong job recruitment month \u2013 at least before the Omicron disruptions kicked in. Weathering the supply storm Analysts like Nathan Roost, a logistics expert at consultancy Ernst and Young, reckons we have about six weeks or so of supply shortages to get through. One lesson learned, he says, is we need investment not just in highly efficient, just-in-time supply networks, but also a more resilient workforce. Even so, \u201cthere\u2019s this pent-up demand for lots of things, services, goods, travel\u201d which will remain as an underlying driver of the Australian economy for the next six to nine months. \u201cThere\u2019s a shock clearly in the short term, but I think longer term, the economic momentum will remain somewhat positive,\u201d Roost says. The OECD, too, expects growth this year to be a robust 4.5%, down from 5.6% in 2021, but rosier than the 3.2% predicted for 2023 as Covid-related stimulus packages peter out. \u2018Roach motel\u2019 Other economists, though, offer a less sanguine view. Stephen Anthony, a former Australian Treasury official, and now chief economist with consultancy Macroeconomics Advisory, argues the central banks have shed credibility and distorted economies as they have become massive investors in economies. The RBA, for instance, has been buying up Australian debt, mostly federal, at the rate of $4bn a week to push down bond prices and so, lower the cost of borrowing to stoke economic activity. Debt holdings exceed $330bn, and amount to the bank \u201cowning a third of the yield curve\u201d, Anthony says. In a recent paper released through the Australian National University\u2019s Agenda journal, Anthony argued the RBA was a latecomer to so-called quantitative easing but had done much to close the gap with counterparts in the US, Japan, Europe and elsewhere. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning All that easy money has had a \u201cpretty profound effect\u201d in inflating house, share and other asset prices here and all around the globe, he said \u201cMarkets are getting nervous because they know that there is a contradiction in those policies,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happens in the next market rout if a major central bank such as the Fed has to choose between supporting financial markets and/or maintaining lower inflation?\u201d As the Hotel California song goes, central banks are finding \u201cyou can check in but you can never leave,\u201d Anthony says. \u201cAnd once you do, you got a roach motel. It\u2019s something you just can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d In other words, withdrawing support would probably trigger a market selldown by investors that would bring back that same central bank binge to avoid an economic collapse. Debt trap, geopolitics and climate Satyajit Das, another independent economist, warns of similar excesses and the limited options for Australia\u2019s leaders in his latest book, Fortune\u2019s Fool, scheduled to be published by Monash University in March. \u201cPolicymakers are skint,\u201d Das says, adding that the trust of governments and central banks, dimmed by the global financial crisis and subsequent super-bubbles, has been further diminished in the current Covid crisis. \u201cIf they had retooled their economies, if they\u2019d invested massively where there\u2019s a stream of income that\u2019s going to amortise the debt on the other side, I\u2019m very relaxed\u201d about the debt build up, he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t get funding consumption from borrowing\u201d as they have done for 30 years, Das says. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem that they\u2019ve created and now they are kind of trapped.\u201d Das says investors are poor at picking geopolitical issues, although he doesn\u2019t think a Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to be a big threat. For one, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin will not be keen to disrupt China\u2019s Winter Olympics run by his mate Xi Jinping. Another is the Pinsk Marshes, a giant bog covering much of Ukraine\u2019s border that has stalled other armies in the past, will soon start to thaw as spring approaches, Das says. Other surprises though could include China clamping down on its supply chains to eliminate Covid. Another threat is also not going away: climate change. \u201cThe other risk \u2026 is extreme weather events,\u201d Das says. \u201cThey have massive costs, and they have massive disruptive values, and nobody seems to even be talking about those any more.\u201d"

            "content": "US stock markets were hit by another wave of wild trading on Monday as investors worried that the Federal Reserve would wind down its support for the economy faster than expected and fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine intensified. Last week\u2019s sharp selloffs were repeated in early trading on Monday but by the end of the day, the S&amp;P 500 stock index regained its losses, ending up 0.29%, the Dow Jones rose 99 points, or 0.29%, after dropping 1,115 points at its low, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.5%. Stock markets hit record highs after highs last year. But so far this year the S&amp;P 500 has fallen at its fastest rate on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and on Monday it briefly fell 10% from its most recent high on 3 January before regaining ground. The Fed meets this week and on Wednesday will give a clearer picture of how quickly it will raise interest rates in order to tackle soaring inflation. European and UK markets racked up heavy losses earlier in the day. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 2.6% to a one-month low. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index closed 3.8% lower, its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. In Germany the Dax fell by 3.8%, and France\u2019s CAC index lost 4%. The selloff swept across other assets, driving down the price of oil as well as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin too regained ground but has now shed half its value since hitting record highs around $69,000 in November. Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cressett Capital, said that, with some provisos, the worst of the falls might be over. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will go for much longer,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of the damage has been done.\u201d Ablin said he expected more problems ahead for some tech companies, which enjoyed a boom period during the pandemic. Some of the companies that grew exponentially during lockdowns, including Netflix and Peloton, were already suffering sharp share price falls and there would be more to come, he said. \u201cTech got way ahead of itself,\u201d he said. He added that if the situation in Ukraine deteriorated or China saw Russia\u2019s move as an opportunity to push its claims on Taiwan, markets were likely to fall again. \u201cDealers are worried about the prospect of a war in eastern Europe, as the human and economic cost would be huge. Some central European economies, like Germany, are heavily dependent on energy from Russia, and should a war break out, it\u2019s a possibility those energy supply lines would be cut, which would cripple economic output in the EU,\u201d David Madden, a market analyst at Equiti Capital, told Reuters."

            "date": "2022-01-05T22:30:45Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economic recovery stalled before the arrival of the Omicron variant of Covid and the dampening effect of the government\u2019s plan B restrictions on consumer spending in the Christmas shopping period, a wide-ranging company survey has found. Businesses blamed spiralling inflation and shortages of imported goods for a decline in sales in the fourth quarter, which meant that an expansion during the spring and summer ground to a halt. In a message that will concern the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the British Chambers of Commerce added that many respondents to its quarterly survey of almost 5,500 firms revealed that they were running low on cash and had ditched investment plans to stay afloat into the new year. Suren Thiru, the BCC\u2019s head of economics, said sales growth stalled as firms struggled with the \u201cmounting headwinds\u201d of inflation, a scarcity of skilled workers, and problems sourcing products from overseas. \u201cThe persistent weakness in cash flow is troubling because it leaves businesses more exposed to the economic impact of Omicron, rising inflation and potential further restrictions,\u201d he said. The survey also found that the prospect of Bank of England officials raising interest rates was another concern for firms that had taken on extra debt over the last 20 months to cope with the pandemic. The bank raised rates to 0.25% in December. A series of reports have shown the UK economy heading into a challenging spring, with a strong rise in consumer prices hitting household disposable incomes and denting consumer confidence. Official figures showed the consumer prices index (CPI) jumped to 5.1% in November following persistent increases in oil and gas prices and other commodities, including wheat and copper. Consumer spending has underpinned the recovery, accounting for more than 80% of the UK\u2019s growth, while spending on government services such as the NHS has made up much of the difference. Only a minority of businesses have pushed ahead with spending on new equipment, buildings and machinery, despite the offer of tax subsidies on investment, made in the budget last March. In the second quarter of 2021 GDP growth hit 5.5%, but fell back to 1.3% in the third quarter. The BCC survey, which was conducted in the last week of November, indicated that the economy was on course to flatline in the fourth quarter. It was likely the economy would contract in the first months of this year as the message to work from home and avoid large gatherings affected sales, Thiru said. Thiru added: \u201cThe UK economy is starting 2022 facing some key challenges. The renewed reluctance among consumers to spend and staff shortages triggered by Omicron and plan B may mean that the UK economy contracts in the near term, particularly if more restrictions are needed. \u201cRising inflation is likely to limit UK\u2019s growth prospects this year by eroding consumers\u2019 spending power and squeezing firms\u2019 profit margins and their ability to invest. The notable uptick in concerns over higher interest rates underscores the need for the Bank of England to proceed with caution on further rate rises to avoid undermining confidence and an already fragile recovery.\u201d A separate survey by the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (Cips) found that 85% of the 228 firms questioned experienced supply chain disruption last year. A quarter of the firms said suppliers shutting down due to Covid restrictions caused them the most acute supply shortages. The majority (71%) of those experiencing disruption and shortages expected it to last for six months or more, while more than a third said shortages would persist into 2023. The Institute of Directors said its economic confidence index had tumbled from -6 in November to -17 this month, a sign of nervousness among business owners about the UK\u2019s economic prospects. It said three-quarters of company directors expected costs to rise in the next 12 months, and most said they would raise prices to either fully or partially offset the rise in costs. A snapshot of the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector in December showed supply chain disruption and staff shortages continued to hold back growth. The IHS Markit/Cips survey showed growth in UK factory output was limited last month by Covid restrictions and Brexit weighing on orders and pushing up costs. Inflows of new work from overseas dropped for the fourth month in a row. The BCC director general, Shevaun Haviland, said: \u201cSupply chain disruption is continuing to persist, inflation is soaring, and rising energy costs are presenting firms with a huge headache. \u201cWith companies now having to grapple with the impact of Omicron and further changes to the rules on imports and exports of goods to the EU, there are significant hurdles for businesses in the months ahead.\u201d"

            "content": "Inflation was supposed to be yesterday\u2019s problem. This time last year, the government\u2019s preferred measure of the annual increase in the cost of living was running at less than 1%. Now it stands at 5.4% \u2013 the highest in almost 30 years \u2013 and it has not peaked yet. With the lagged impact of the supply-chain bottlenecks of last autumn feeding through into prices in the shops and a likely 50% jump in domestic energy bills to come, inflation will certainly exceed 6% in April and may be closer to 7%. Clearly, the data released by the Office for National Statistics will concern the Bank of England, which is mandated to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target and has continually underestimated price pressure over the past year. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will next meet in early February \u2013 and with the cost of food, household goods, eating out, staying in hotels and clothing and footwear all pushing inflation higher last month \u2013 the chances of an increase in borrowing costs from 0.25% to 0.5% have increased. Threadneedle Street\u2019s view is that inflation will peak in the spring and then start to head back down towards target. A return to a more normal economy as the impact of the Omicron variant wanes could help if consumers start spending less on goods (where inflationary pressure is most apparent) and more on services. But the ONS figures for producer prices \u2013 the cost paid by firms for fuel and raw materials and the cost of goods leaving factory gates \u2013 suggest there is plenty of inflationary pressure in the pipeline. Industry\u2019s input prices were 13.5% higher in December than a year earlier while output prices were up 9.3%. In both cases there was only a small fall from November\u2019s even higher levels, and the Bank\u2019s fear is that, with firms struggling to find workers, higher prices will lead to higher wage settlements and an inflationary spiral will set in. Rishi Sunak is also feeling the heat. As Labour\u2019s Jonathan Reynolds noted, households face a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d over the coming months: higher taxes, higher energy bills, and wages failing to keep pace with prices. In his response to the highest inflation rate since John Major and Neil Kinnock were facing off during the 1992 election campaign, the chancellor said he understood the pressures people were facing with the cost of living. Sunak is working on a package of help for low-income households before the regulator Ofgem announces the new energy price cap early next month. Steadily rising inflation means the government needs to make it a generous one \u2013 or face a political price."

            "content": "One in five parents give their children pocket money by bank transfer, a survey has found, with youngsters in the UK set for a pay rise from their families this year. Children\u2019s average weekly \u201csalaries\u201d are to increase from \u00a36.97 to \u00a37.58, a jump which is almost twice the rate of inflation, according to a poll by Barclays that surveyed parents of children under 16. While most parents are sticking to giving out cash, typically in exchange for help around the home, more than one in five (22%) opt for bank transfer. Household chores including washing the car, looking after younger siblings and cleaning the bathroom tend to reap the highest rewards, the survey showed. It also found that sweets and chocolate are the most popular way for children to spend their earnings. More than two-fifths (44%) of children decide to put the money towards a later purchase and more than half of adult respondents (53%) said their child is good at managing money. Children\u2019s early experiences with handling money can shape their financial behaviour as adults, according to the study published by the government\u2019s MoneyHelper service. By the age of seven, the University of Cambridge research found, most children understand the value of money, delaying gratification and the idea that poor choices now can affect their future. Gillean Dooney, head of families at Barclays, said: \u201cIf your kids are happy to do their bit around the house, pocket money is a really good way of teaching them the value of money at an early age.\u201d Barclays\u2019 research found many parents start giving their child a small amount when they turn seven. \u201cMany of the parents we surveyed said that this was one of the biggest motivators behind giving pocket money to their children,\u201d she added. Dooney recommended creating a visual savings plan with key milestones that children could track and tick off along the way. Other banks have also rolled out services in recent months to encourage families to talk about finances early. In October, NatWest acquired the London-based children\u2019s pocket money app RoosterMoney, which is designed to get parents and children to practise budgeting skills together."

            "content": "The Federal Reserve is preparing to raise rates in March for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic struck the US as it attempts to curb rising prices. After its latest two-day meeting the central bank announced that it would leave interest rates close to zero for now but signaled it was preparing to raise them at its next meeting. At a press conference, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said the central bank would continue to monitor the course of the pandemic, inflation and unemployment but gave his clearest signal yet that the US\u2019s historically low interest rates would start to rise soon. \u201cI would say the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so,\u201d said Powell. \u201cThe economy no longer needs sustained monetary policy support,\u201d he said. The central bank cut rates to close to zero when the coronavirus pandemic hit the US in March 2020 and began pumping money into the economy by buying financial assets in order to stave off a potential financial collapse. At this week\u2019s meeting, the Fed committee approved one final round of asset purchases, which will bring that stimulus program to a conclusion by March. The Fed has a dual mandate: to maximize employment and to keep prices stable. In recent months inflation has risen sharply to an annual rate of 7% and the unemployment rate has fallen back to 3.9%, close to pre-pandemic levels. It has signaled for months that rate rises are coming in order to tamp down price rises and Powell said there was \u201cquite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market\u201d. But the end of the Fed\u2019s easy money policy has rattled investors. The announcement follows days of wild swings on the stock markets where investors have worried about the speed with which the Fed will end its era of easy money and the impact on the global economy from rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine. US stock markets plummeted on Monday and Tuesday only to regain most of their losses. Nevertheless, by Tuesday the S&amp;P 500 had recorded its worst-ever losses for the start of a year with the once hot tech sector contributing most of those losses. US stock markets recovered ground on Wednesday but fell as Powell outlined the Fed\u2019s plans."

            "date": "2022-01-25T14:00:34Z",
            "content": "The International Monetary Fund has sharply cut its growth forecast for 2022 with a warning that higher-than-expected inflation and the Omicron variant have worsened the outlook for the global economy. In a quarterly update to predictions made in October 2021, the IMF said it anticipated growth of 4.4% this year \u2013 down 0.5 percentage points \u2013 and emphasised the risks were of a weaker performance. Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said that as a result of Covid-19 the global economy would be $13.8t smaller by 2024 than it would have been had its pre-pandemic trend continued. The Washington-based organisation blamed the downgrade on rising cost pressures and the rapid spread of Omicron, and said while the 2022 outlook was markedly worse for the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 the US and China \u2013 few countries would be spared a slowdown. The UK is expected to grow by 4.7% in 2022, a cut of 0.3 points to the IMF\u2019s forecast in its October 2021 World Economic Outlook. Despite the reduction, the IMF anticipates the UK growing faster this year than the other six members of the G7 industrial nations \u2013 the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. Gopinath said there was a case for the government providing \u201cwell-targeted support to highly vulnerable\u201d UK households facing rocketing energy bills this spring. After recent stock market volatility, Gopinath said she would expect to see corrections in share prices as global interest rates went up this year, but said these should be \u201corderly\u201d provided central banks communicated the thinking behind their decisions. An escalation of the tension between Russia and Ukraine would give an added twist to already high global energy costs, she predicted. In its updated WEO, the IMF said bottlenecks had shaved between 0.5% and 1% off global growth in 2021. \u201cMeanwhile, inflation has been higher and more broad-based than anticipated, particularly in the US. Adding to these pressures, the retrenchment in China\u2019s real estate sector appears to be more drawn out, and the recovery in private consumption is weaker than previously expected.\u201d The IMF publishes its world economic outlook each April and October, with updates in January and July. After pencilling in 2022 world growth of almost 5% in October, it has now cut its baseline forecast for every G7 country apart from Japan. The biggest downgrade has been to the US \u2013 where the IMF\u2019s growth forecast has been shaved by 1.2 points to 4%, but there were also cuts of 0.8 points for Germany and Canada, and 0.4 points for France and Italy. China\u2019s growth forecast has been reduced by 0.8 points to 4.8%. \u201cRisks to the global baseline are tilted to the downside,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cThe emergence of new Covid-19 variants could prolong the pandemic and induce renewed economic disruptions. Moreover, supply chain disruptions, energy price volatility, and localised wage pressures mean uncertainty around inflation and policy paths is high.\u201d The IMF used the update to repeat its call for more equal vaccine coverage, noting the fully vaccinated share of the population was about 70% for high-income countries, but below 4% for low-income countries. It set a target of vaccinating 40% of the world\u2019s population by the end of 2021 but this was missed in 86 countries. \u201cWith the pandemic continuing to maintain its grip, the emphasis on an effective global health strategy is more salient than ever. Worldwide access to vaccines, tests, and treatments is essential to reduce the risk of further dangerous Covid-19 variants.\u201d The IMF said its forecasts were based on Covid-19 health problems declining to low levels by the end of 2022, a pickup in vaccination rates and therapies becoming more effective."

            "date": "2022-01-14T10:05:32Z",
            "content": "It has taken a year and a half but the UK economy has regained the ground lost during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. A better than anticipated performance last November means national output is now 0.7% higher than it was in February 2020. Other countries reached this milestone sooner, with the US, for example, already operating well above its previous peak. Even so, Britain has experienced what economists call a V-shaped recession, with a precipitous drop in activity in March and April 2020 followed by a brisk \u2013 if occasionally interrupted \u2013 recovery. That pattern is explained by the nature of the Covid shock. Governments imposed lockdowns in an attempt to prevent the virus spreading and, once the restrictions were eased, businesses that had been closed reopened and economies bounced back. The UK economy contracted by less during the financial crisis of 2008-09 than it did in 2020 but took much longer to regain the lost ground. The economy is still smaller than it would have been had the pandemic never happened, and a key question over the coming months will be whether it can get back to its pre-Covid trend or whether there will be a permanent loss of output. The Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility both expect Covid-19 to result in some scarring, even though the resilience of the labour market means estimates of the lasting damage have been gradually scaled back over the past 18 months. The 0.9% monthly increase in output in November was down to a combination of factors: the easing of supply chain bottlenecks that had been hitting manufacturing and construction firms; consumers shopping early for Christmas; and people feeling more confident about going out to enjoy themselves. The arrival of the Omicron variant has muddied the waters. It looks inevitable that output fell in December owing to widespread staff absences, the introduction of the government\u2019s plan B restrictions, and individuals becoming more cautious. January will be another tough month, so the chances are that the economy will fall back below its February 2020 peak. If, as expected, the government decides to ease restrictions in England later this month, output will recover again in February and March. But as Paul Dales of Capital Economics notes, in April the economy will be hit by a double whammy of rocketing energy bills and higher taxes. As is often the case with the UK economy, it will be one step forward, one step back."

            "content": "Record vacancies, as firms complain they can\u2019t find staff. Employers taking that most extreme of measures: raising wages. This is not the usual post-recession story, partly reflecting that the pandemic has shrunk our labour force by around half a million workers. This has led to speculation about the lasting effects of pandemic-induced labour shortages, with suggestions ranging from higher prices, to more machines replacing missing workers, or a smaller economy. But in terms of what comes next, it\u2019s possible that less crystal ball gazing and a few more history lessons might help. That\u2019s where new research into the impact of cholera outbreaks in 19th-century France that killed 1% of the population comes in. It looks at the number of deaths in different areas to investigate how the labour scarcity they caused affected the adoption of technology. It turns out that bigger shortages had a positive effect on uptake of technology (ploughs) and innovation (irrigation) in agriculture, but a temporary negative impact on industry (mining/textiles). Why? Because technology substitutes workers in agriculture, so can replace them, but complements them in industry. Labour shortages increased people\u2019s confidence that learning how to read would pay off via higher wages, boosting the need for agricultural mechanisation because literate workers avoided low-paid jobs there. So, some good news for those hoping labour shortages will boost investment. The bad news? It involved training, which we\u2019re not much interested in these days. Importantly, today\u2019s workforce reduction is about older workers and young men not seeking work, compared with cholera deaths in 19th-century France. So we shouldn\u2019t just ponder the effect of labour shortages \u2013 we should reduce them by supporting people back to work. \u2022 Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

            "date": "2022-01-25T16:25:45Z",
            "content": "Olavo de Carvalho, the coronavirus-denying mentor of Jair Bolsonaro and Brazil\u2019s radical right, has died in the United States, with one of his children citing Covid-19 as the cause. \u201cThe family \u2026 asks for prayers for the professor\u2019s soul,\u201d relatives said on Twitter after announcing the death of the 74-year-old polemicist \u2013 a towering figure in contemporary Brazilian politics who was adored and abhorred in equal measure by millions of followers and foes. The statement did not say how Carvalho \u2013 a former astrologer who repeatedly trivialized Covid as the \u201cmoronavirus\u201d \u2013 had died. However, his estranged daughter, Helo\u00edsa de Carvalho, said coronavirus was the cause. \u201cHe has blood on his hands,\u201d she told the magazine Veja, blaming her father\u2019s \u201cdenialist ideas\u201d and dissemination of fake news for the Brazilian government\u2019s delay in purchasing Covid vaccines. \u201cBut I do not celebrate his death.\u201d Bolsonaro \u2013 whose shock 2018 election was turbocharged by Carvalho\u2019s extreme and often expletive-ridden teachings \u2013 lamented the loss of \u201cone of the greatest thinkers in our country\u2019s history\u201d and declared a national day of mourning. \u201cOlavo was a \u2026 beacon for millions of Brazilians,\u201d Brazil\u2019s ultraconservative president claimed. The president\u2019s son, Eduardo, also celebrated the pipe-smoking septuagenarian whose influence was such that he reputedly named several members of Bolsonaro\u2019s cabinet despite having lived in the US since 2005. Progressive Brazilians \u2013 disgusted by the leading role they claim Carvalho played in poisoning their country\u2019s social and political life and spreading life-threatening misinformation about Covid \u2013 rejected such eulogies. Before his death Carvalho continually minimized coronavirus \u2013 which has killed nearly 625,000 Brazilians and 5.6 million people globally \u2013 peddled conspiracies about its origins, and attacked those trying to slow its spread. It is unclear if he had been vaccinated. In May 2020, as Covid pummeled South America, Carvalho tweeted: \u201cThe fear of a supposedly deadly virus is nothing more than a little horror story designed to scare the population and make them accept slavery as they would a present from Father Christmas.\u201d Carvalho branded containment measures \u201cthe most enormous and sordid crime ever committed against the entire human species\u201d and once alleged the global health emergency \u201csimply doesn\u2019t exist\u201d. On another occasion he said only \u201ca perfect fool\u201d would believe the spread of the \u201cChinese virus\u201d was accidental. \u201cDoes the moronavirus really kill people or does he just help them become statistics?\u201d he wondered last January as Brazil\u2019s death toll rose to over 200,000. When Twitter deleted one of Carvalho\u2019s posts for violating its rules on spreading harmful or misleading information about Covid, he told the company\u2019s then president Jack Dorsey: \u201cYou can stick your network up your\u201d buttocks. Felipe Neto, one of Brazil\u2019s top online influencers, tweeted: \u201cThe far right will now try to turn Olavo de Carvalho into a martyr, a hero. Olavo is one of the main culprits for the sea of mud into which we have sunk.\u201d Journalist Andr\u00e9 Fran wrote: \u201cMy condolences to all those whose relatives have fallen victim to the Bolsonarista hatred and denialism that Olavo did so much to a disseminate.\u201d Carvalho\u2019s daughter also had harsh words for her father, who was reportedly diagnosed with Covid on 16 January. \u201cMay God forgive him all the evil he has done,\u201d she tweeted, recalling losing a friend to Covid on the day her father falsely claimed the world had not seen a single confirmed death. \u201cShe was a widow and left three orphaned children under the age of 10.\u201d Brian Winter, a Brazil specialist who interviewed Carvalho at his rifle-filled Virginia home, said Bolsonaro\u2019s guru had helped import \u201ca kind of tropicalized Fox News culture focused on gender, guns and anti-globalism\u201d. Winter said during the first decade of this century \u2013 as Brazil flourished under the leftist government of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 Carvalho was widely considered a \u201ccrazy crank\u201d. However, during the 2010s, as the country sank into profound recession and political turmoil, his intellectual-sounding \u201cprofanity-laced vitriol\u201d against the left suddenly gained traction. Bookshops sold hundreds of thousands of copies of his most famous work, The Least You Must Know to Avoid Being an Idiot \u2013 a tome Bolsonaro promoted after winning power. Winter remembered first seeing Carvalho\u2019s name at a 2013 anti-government protest on a poster reading: \u201cOlavo was right.\u201d \u201cHe and Bolsonaro were products of the titanic trauma that Brazil endured during the 2010s: the worst recession in a hundred years, the collapse of the political establishment, corruption scandals everywhere you looked, 70,000 homicides a year. Out of this despair, he and Bolsonaro happened to emerge as the winners because they sounded so radically different from anything that happened before. That was their appeal.\u201d Many believe that appeal is now fading, with former president Lula seemingly poised to trounce Bolsonaro in October\u2019s election. \u201cPart of the struggle Bolsonaro is having now is that he\u2019s still going around talking about gun rights and gender and these other Olavista ideas in a Brazil where people just want solutions to the pandemic, hunger and unemployment,\u201d Winter said. \u201cBolsonaro is playing the Olavista oldies and most Brazilians want to be hearing something else.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-31T10:00:46Z",
            "content": "Plenty of people \u2013 on the left as well as the right \u2013 believed George Osborne when he conjured up a dystopian vision of Britain after a vote for Brexit during the final weeks of the referendum campaign. The then chancellor said victory for leave would result in a \u201cDIY recession\u201d, the loss of 800,000 jobs, a weaker housing market and a stock market crash. Two years on from our date of departure from the EU, none of it has happened. Unemployment is lower than it was in 2016 and, although this is very much a mixed blessing, house prices are higher. Share prices have risen and until Covid-19 arrived there was no recession. That hasn\u2019t halted the flow of gloomy predictions: Nissan would quit the UK, tens of thousands of City jobs would be lost to Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. More recently, Brexit supply chain problems would mean a turkey-less Christmas and empty high street shelves in December. None of that happened either, and the wait for economic meltdown goes on. Far from quitting the UK, Nissan last year announced it was investing \u00a31bn in electric vehicle production at its Sunderland plant. Children didn\u2019t wake up to empty Christmas stockings. A study by the consultancy EY found almost nine out of 10 global financial services firms plan to establish or expand operations in the UK this year. Confirmation bias is where people latch on to evidence that suits their argument while zoning out things that don\u2019t. Opponents of Brexit, for example, filter out the success of the UK\u2019s go-it-alone vaccine procurement strategy and the freedom the government now has to cut VAT on domestic energy bills. Brexit supporters, by contrast, point out that UK exports to the EU in the second half of 2021 varied little from their level in the same period of 2020 when trade was still frictionless, but ignore the fact that other countries performed more strongly last year as lockdown restrictions were eased. Likewise, they downplay the loss of share trading to Amsterdam and the UK\u2019s poor investment performance after the Brexit vote. Stripped of the social media spats, the reality is that Brexit has not magically transformed Britain\u2019s economic prospects, but nor has it been calamitous. From a big-picture perspective, Britain\u2019s economy will exit Covid-19 looking pretty much the same as when the virus first arrived two years ago, even though the UK left the single market and the customs union in the meantime. Unemployment is little different, interest rates are a little lower, the housing market is hot. The big difference is that inflation is a lot higher, as it is in every developed country. That\u2019s not to say the transition from EU membership has been seamless or cost free. It has been a burden that small exporting businesses could have done without at any time, let alone when seeking to cope with the impact of a global pandemic. But the response to Covid-19 has proved two things: businesses adapt to changed circumstances pretty quickly, and that process can be accelerated by supportive government policy. The models suggesting the damage from Brexit will be permanent rather than transitional are flawed for two reasons: they are based on a number of questionable \u2013 and often neoliberal \u2013 assumptions; and they envisage life goes on as before, with no change in behaviour either by the private sector or the state. There is a parallel here with the aim of \u201cgreening\u201d the economy. Clearly, there will be costs from decarbonising the economy, but supporters of the net zero target think these can be mitigated by activist government, and see the opportunity to break with a broken model. There are those for whom this represents a false parallel because there can be no possible benefits from leaving the EU. For them it is only a matter of time before the doomsday scenario comes about, and therefore the only way ahead is for Britain to rejoin. But this strategy would only work if one of the two main parties supported it, and neither of them do. The most significant Brexit development of the past two years has not been economic but political: the decision by Keir Starmer to accept that the left needed to come up with its own plan for a post-EU Britain. Interviewed by my colleague Simon Hattenstone, Starmer could not have been clearer: \u201cLook, we\u2019ve left the EU. There\u2019s no case for rejoining so we have to make it work. We are out, and we\u2019re staying out.\u201d Asked whether that ruled out a return to the single market or customs union under a Labour government he went on: \u201cYes, it does. We\u2019ve got to make Brexit work from the outside and not reopen old wounds.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the same when she recently outlined her five-point plan for the economy. For Labour, Brexit is a done deal, and accepting that has meant it has been Reeves, who supported remain in 2016, rather than Rishi Sunak, who backed leave, who has been making the case to cut VAT on energy bills. Labour\u2019s new stance makes sense, and not just because it gives the party a chance of winning the next election. Until recently there were only two options: a wasted-opportunity Brexit where nothing much happens and the economy trundles along much as before; and a rightwing free-market Brexit. Now there\u2019s a third: a Labour Brexit in which the state uses its new powers to build a greener, fairer, levelled-up Britain. Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor"

            "content": "The luxury carmaker Bentley has announced that its first fully electric car will be developed and built at its Crewe factory. The British brand\u2019s first battery electric vehicle is scheduled to roll off the production line in 2025. Bentley, which has been making cars since 1919 and is now owned by Germany\u2019s Volkswagen, has committed to investing \u00a32.5bn in sustainability over the next 10 years. This will include what the company called the \u201ccomplete transformation\u201d of all Bentley vehicles and its Crewe plant, which employs 4,000 workers. Workers who build the brand\u2019s internal combustion engines will be retrained and redeployed to work in different areas of the plant. Bentley, known for its large and powerful cars, announced in late 2020 that it would stop making vehicles that run on fossil fuel by 2030, aiming to make its operations fully carbon neutral by the same date. Sales of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in the UK from 2030. As part of the brand\u2019s Beyond100 strategy, mapping out its plans beyond its centenary, the company set itself ambitious targets in the transition towards electric vehicles. In Bentley\u2019s switch from building cars with traditional internal combustion engines, it will first make hybrid vehicles, before introducing its first pure electric cars, with zero-carbon exhaust emissions. The company has not revealed any details of its first fully electric car. Adrian Hallmark, Bentley\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said: \u201cSecuring production of our first BEV in Crewe is a milestone moment for Bentley, and the UK, as we plan for a long-term sustainable future in Crewe.\u201d Bentley\u2019s plant at its Cheshire headquarters will be turned into an advanced manufacturing facility as part of its move towards environmental sustainability. The carmaker, whose vehicles cost from about \u00a3130,000 to more than \u00a3240,000, has previously said its environmental targets would help it to be \u201cfinancially resilient and recession-proof\u201d after the coronavirus pandemic. Electric vehicle sales boomed in 2021, according to recent figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, as carmakers sold 190,000 battery electric cars, accounting for almost 12% of total sales."

A late surge in donations, coupled with a four-day extension helped push the 2021 charity appeal to \u00a31,005,000 before it closed on Thursday night. It is the seventh year in a row that the appeal has raised more than \u00a31m for charity. Just over 9,500 people gave to the appeal. Donations will be shared between four charities: Practical Action, Global Greengrants Fund UK, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and Environmental Justice Foundation. The theme this year was climate justice, inspired by stories of people and communities uprooted by climate volatility, whether flooding, wildfire, melting ice or drought, from Madagascar to the Arctic Circle. Thousands of donors emailed to tell us why they had given money to the appeal. Many said climate change was the most urgent issue affecting the planet, with many making the point that the people worst affected by climate crisis, in the world\u2019s poorest countries, had done least to cause it. Each of the appeal\u2019s four partner charities work in developing countries in the global south. \u201cWe all have responsibility for the future of our Earth and a further responsibility to support those communities most affected by extreme weather events,\u201d one donor wrote this week. Practical Action\u2019s chief executive, Sarah Roberts, said: \u201cOn behalf of all of the communities we work with, I\u2019d like to say a huge thank you to Guardian and the Observer readers. Their generosity will help us enable people on the frontline of climate change get the tools and knowledge they need to take back control of their lives.\u201d Eva Rehse, the chief executive of Global Greengrants Fund UK, said: \u201cThanks to the readers of the Guardian and Observer for your incredible generosity and solidarity. Your donations are acts of climate justice, and give us hope for a better future.\u201d Steve Trent, the chief executive of Environmental Justice Foundation, said: \u201cThe overwhelming generosity of the readers of the Guardian and Observer has meant we are going into 2022 ready to continue our fight for climate justice.\u201d Richard Deverell, the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said: \u201cWe can\u2019t thank the supporters of the Guardian and Observer appeal enough.

            "date": "2022-01-30T18:30:27Z",
            "content": "The court system of England and Wales was already in crisis before the pandemic \u2013 a direct effect of government cuts leading to closures and staff shortages. Between 2010 and 2020, the Ministry of Justice\u2019s budget was cut by 40%. Annual spending on legal aid fell by almost \u00a31bn over a period of five years. Then Covid hit, gumming up the system further and leading to widespread cancellations and delays. The consequence is an enormous backlog that has been largely overlooked, in part because most people do not regularly interact with the justice system. Currently there are 372,000 cases waiting to be heard in magistrates courts and almost 60,000 in crown courts, where more serious offences are tried. We don\u2019t tend to describe court delays as a \u201cwaiting list\u201d, but a long queue for justice is what these numbers add up to. This affects victims and witnesses as well as defendants. All must wait, sometimes for years, for the outcome of events that may well have changed their lives. For those held on remand and subsequently found not guilty, there is no recompense for time wasted. Cumulatively, and over time, the risk is a wider loss of public confidence in the legal system. Among victims\u2019 groups, one fear is that offenders may be emboldened. The number of reported rapes reached a new record of 63,136 in the year to September 2021. At least the government has realised that this situation is untenable. Ministers are considering the recommendations of an independent review of legal aid, including an immediate \u00a3135m-a-year funding increase, and the creation of a new oversight board. But the announcement of a new recruitment campaign for 4,000 volunteer magistrates provides cause for concern as well as reassurance. This is because the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is not seeking simply to build up numbers again \u2013 there were 12,651 magistrates last year compared with 25,170 in 2012. Instead his department, supported by the Magistrates Association, is giving them the power to send people to prison for up to a year (the current maximum for a single offence is six months). The plan is that this will free up 1,700 crown court sitting days. Magistrates, who are lay people with no legal qualifications, play an important role in our legal system. There are good reasons for justice to be administered locally, by people who belong to the community in which crimes have been committed. The closure of around half of all magistrates courts between 2010 and 2019 was shortsighted, and efforts to recruit from a more diverse pool are welcome (and supported by the payment of expenses, including for loss of earnings). But there are also reasons why magistrates\u2019 authority, particularly to send people to prison for long stretches, is limited. Sitting for as few as 13 days a year on a voluntary basis, they lack the overview and expertise of judges. England and Wales already have the highest per capita prison population in western Europe, and an atrocious record on rehabilitation. Improving the performance of the probation service, and developing the use of community sentences, would be more likely to benefit the public than these changes. Other concerns include the effect that the new sentencing powers will have on defendants\u2019 decision-making. If longer sentences handed down by magistrates result in more appeals, then reduced waiting lists will not be achieved. Mr Raab, who is the sixth Conservative justice secretary in just seven years, is right about one thing: the backlog in the courts is a disaster. But a system-wide crisis created by chronic underfunding will not, with the best will in the world, be resolved by volunteers. This is no way to deliver justice."

            "date": "2022-01-27T14:30:32Z",
            "content": "That sound you hear is Democrats in Washington and across the country letting out a sigh of profound relief: Associate Justice Stephen Breyer is retiring in June, at the end of the US supreme court\u2019s current term. News of the 83-year-old\u2019s choice to step down broke on Wednesday \u2013 evidently a little earlier than the man himself would have liked \u2013 giving Joe Biden his first opportunity to fill a vacancy on the nation\u2019s highest court. The decision from Breyer ends months of speculation and a determined pressure campaign to convince the ageing liberal justice to retire while Democrats still held both the White House and the Senate, that rare and precarious circumstance that is now required for any Democratic president to see his federal court nominees confirmed. Breyer\u2019s decision to step down this summer gives the Democrats a narrow window to appoint his replacement before they are expected to lose control of the Senate in the November midterms. Breyer\u2019s retirement, after nearly 30 years as a justice, will not change the balance of power on the supreme court, which has heaved dramatically rightward since Justice Anthony Kennedy chose to retire under Donald Trump in 2018. Nor will his exit mitigate what are likely to be ruinous outcomes in this term\u2019s major rulings, which include the hateful Dobbs v Jackson, the case that is almost certain to overturn Roe v Wade. The benefits of his timely exit aren\u2019t so much ameliorative as preventive: because he has retired under a Democratic trifecta, he has ensured that the supreme court\u2019s conservative 6-3 supermajority will at least stay 6-3, and not become and insurmountable 7-2. But the extremist makeup of an increasingly maximalist rightwing court will continue. What his retirement does bring to an end is a long legal and political career of the kind that has since become unfeasible. Breyer\u2019s early career was marked by the industrious bipartisanship of the latter 20th century, and he helped shape that era\u2019s neoliberal consensus. When he was young, Breyer was a legal academic at Harvard \u2013 read any biography of a federal courts judge and the words \u201clegal academic at Harvard\u201d are likely to appear \u2013and he wrote inventively about the prerogatives of executive agencies, a field known as administrative law. He favored deregulation, and took several leaves of absence from teaching throughout the 1970s to work as a special counsel to Democrats in the US Senate; among his accomplishments there was shepherding the deregulation of the airline industry. He gained a reputation for friendliness and a willingness to negotiate, and as this was in keeping with the social norms of Washington at the time, he was close with a number of Republicans. His children played with the children of the segregationist Republican senator Strom Thurmond. This closeness with men on the other side of the aisle paid off: when President Clinton nominated Breyer to the supreme court in 1994, he was confirmed 87 to 9. On the court itself, Breyer exerted his influence primarily in conference, attempting to extract compromises from his conservative colleagues and to cultivate their more moderate impulses. His colleagues on the left, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and later Sonia Sotomayor, took up the role first crafted by Thurgood Marshall, and wrote passionate dissents to conservative rulings that were meant to sway the public as much as the legal community. This was not Breyer\u2019s style; he was nearly always speaking to other lawyers, not to lay people. We don\u2019t know how much this worked \u2013 the justice\u2019s conferences are confidential \u2013 but it is entirely possible that as the court shifted right over the course of his tenure, it was Breyer whose private arguments helped slow its lurch. But as the court and the nation became more polarized, Breyer had come to seem out of place. His commitment to persuasion was no match for a 6-3 court packed with conservative ideologues; his passionate belief in legislative power did not fit with the realities of a deadlocked and dysfunctional Congress that increasingly delegated policymaking power to the judiciary. His questions \u2013 always famous for their long-windedness and convoluted structure \u2013 devolved into meandering soliloquies, and on the audio broadcasts of the court\u2019s oral arguments, his liberal colleagues Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor could often be heard trying to nudge him towards conclusion or clarify his point. It was obvious that he was from another time, and that time has now ended. The best thing he could have done for the country was go, and it is to his credit that he did. What comes next? On the campaign trail, candidate Biden promised to appoint a Black woman to the court, and the likeliest candidate is Ketanji Brown Jackson, a former Breyer clerk who has the justice\u2019s blessing and whose promotion to the DC circuit court of appeals last June was seen as a stepping stone to succeed her former boss. She is 51, and could serve on the court for decades. But, if she is appointed, the institution that awaits Judge Brown Jackson is less collegial and less dignified than the one that welcomed Breyer. Despite the increasingly laughable protestations of its conservative wing, the supreme court has become an all but nakedly political body, frequently warping the law in bizarre and inventive ways to ensure outcomes that align with Republican priorities. They are going to dispose of abortion rights this year. Affirmative action is set to be dismantled. Voting rights have already been shockingly eroded, and the conservatives seem intent on interpreting religious freedom rights for Christians in whichever way can secure the maximum injury and indignity for everybody else. Increasingly, the impression left by the justices themselves is one of vain and petty figures, fixated on their own PR, attempting to maintain the solemn mystique of an institution that has long since lost it. Who would want to join such a workplace? Perhaps Judge Brown Jackson, if she does indeed become the nominee, deserves not only our congratulations, but also our condolences.

            "content": "Motorists across the whole of London could be charged for every journey from 2024 under plans being drawn up to reduce carbon emissions and improve air quality. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said London should be a global leader in introducing smart road pricing, as a report found car journeys in the capital needed to be cut by more than a quarter to meet net zero emissions targets by 2030. Khan said air pollution and the climate emergency were \u201can issue of social justice across the globe \u2013 and in London as well, it\u2019s the poorest Londoners, the least likely to own a car, who suffer the consequences\u201d. He has asked Transport for London (TfL) to explore road pricing that would charge by distance travelled, time and location. However, with technology to operate a scheme unlikely to be ready soon, he has told TfL to consider other options to make drivers pay for polluting before the end of his second term in office in May 2024. Possible options include: a daily clean air charge for all petrol and diesel cars journeys throughout Greater London; or expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) as it currently operates with a daily \u00a312.50 charge for older models throughout all boroughs; or a combination of these. Tfl will also consider introducing a boundary charge to drive into Greater London. Fully electric and other zero-emission cars would be exempt under all options. Khan said he would like to see both the London congestion charge \u2013 introduced in 2003 \u2013 and the Ulez replaced with road pricing before the end of the decade: \u201cBoth schemes are quite blunt and technology has moved on. I want London to be a global leader.\u201d The mayor said he wanted to start \u201can earnest conversation with Londoners\u201d about ways to reduce car use, ease congestion and cut levels of air pollution \u2013 so high last Friday that people were advised not to exercise outdoors. Jemima Hartshorn, of the campaign group Mums for Lungs, said it was \u201ca good day for London\u2019s kids\u201d. However, motoring organisations warned the proposals could \u201cpunish\u201d people who relied on their cars and urged the mayor to rethink. The RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said the proposals \u201cwould create massive financial challenges for individuals, families and businesses who run a car in London and even for those who visit the fringes of the capital \u2026 and will punish those who simply cannot afford an electric car\u201d. Some proposals would require government backing to extend powers and funding, and consent would be required to enable a boundary charge for drivers entering Greater London, the mayor\u2019s office says. The area covered by the ultra-low emission zone, whose boundary expanded only in October from central London to the north and south circular roads, could be more than doubled. Extending its scope to newer vehicles would also affect far more motorists in the area where it currently applies: about 90% of vehicles in the expanded zone, where 3.8 million live and work, are currently not charged, as most petrol cars less than 15 years old and the newest diesels are exempt. Only 2% of vehicles on London roads are electric. An additional daily charge throughout London \u2013 comparable to the price of a single fare on public transport \u2013 is another option. Khan said it would be a \u201cnudge\u201d to car owners, \u201csomething that make it worthwhile to take a bus rather than jump in a car\u201d. According to TfL, a third of car journeys in the capital can be walked in less than 25 minutes, and two-thirds cycled in less than 20. Achieving net zero by 2030 would need a 27% cut in car journeys \u2013 and still require billions to be spent offsetting London\u2019s emissions, according to a report by consultancy Element Energy commissioned by Khan and published on Tuesday. While the ambition to cut London\u2019s emissions will also tackle home insulation and offices, Khan said he was focusing on transport, which had been slow to decarbonise \u2013 reducing emissions by just 7% between 2000 and 2018, compared with a 57% reduction from workplaces and 40% from homes. Smart charging could take into account distance travelled, locations, public transport alternatives, the time of day, as well as how polluting a vehicle was, Khan said, with exemptions and discounts for those on low incomes and with disabilities, and support for charities and small businesses. Transport for London is seeking long-term funding support from the government after losing billions in fare revenue as tube journeys in particular fell during the pandemic. Proposals for a boundary charge to raise funds were initially rebuffed by ministers. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 January 2022. A policy option earlier said to involve a \u00a312.50 daily charge for all or most petrol and diesel cars in the London ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) \u2013 rather than older models only \u2013 has been replaced. A new paragraph gives more detailed options for an additional charge, expansion of the area involved, or a combination of these."

            "date": "2022-01-13T15:25:19Z",
            "content": "For survivors of Syria\u2019s brutal detention system, the landmark conviction of a former Syrian intelligence official for crimes against humanity represents a vital step towards justice. \u201cWe initially hoped for a trial at the international criminal court, but nevertheless this is an important step,\u201d said Hussein Ghrer, one of 24 former detainees of Branch 251, a military intelligence unit with its own prison in Damascus, who testified against Anwar Raslan. \u201cFinally, we have an official conviction saying that these individuals have committed crimes in the context of mass attacks on Syrians and systematic crimes against humanity. I believe this is the most important thing to build on in future.\u201d Raslan, a former colonel with the Syrian intelligence service, was convicted by a court in Koblenz, Germany, of crimes against humanity, including 27 counts of murder. He was accused by prosecutors of overseeing abuse, sexual assault and the torture of more than 4,000 people at Branch 251. The site became synonymous with brutal abuse by security officials after the government of Bashar al-Assad used maximum force to quell protests. Raslan is the highest-ranking Syrian official to stand trial for atrocities committed in Syria. He was charged under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of serious crimes against international law, such as genocide and torture, in one country even if they happened elsewhere. At least 100,000 people are recorded as detained or missing in Syria, the United Nations said in 2019, although activists say the true number may be far higher. The Syrian Network for Human Rights puts the figure at about 150,000 and estimates that nearly 15,000 people have died from torture in Syria since March 2011. Human Rights Watch described this as \u201cviolence that is not readily visible: the hidden prisons and torture centres into which tens of thousands of Syrians have disappeared \u2013 sometimes to re-emerge years later, sometimes never to be heard from again\u201d. Raslan is the second person to be convicted in Koblenz for activities related to Branch 251, after the conviction last year of Eyad al-Gharib, a former intelligence officer, for his role in transporting detainees to the prison. The trial represented the first opportunity of its kind for former detainees such as Ghrer to testify about their treatment in detention. \u201cI was interrogated and beaten all over my body, but the worst was seeing others being brutally tortured, because you don\u2019t know what could happen next,\u201d he said. Ghrer also described the experience of seeing Raslan \u2013 the man who directed his torture and that of his fellow detainees \u2013 in the dock, a decade after he was arrested in Damascus for filming protests. \u201cWe were powerless, we were mistreated. [Raslan] was not mistreated, and he has a right to lawyers and translators,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be in his shoes, of course,\u201d Ghrer added, \u201cbut to be in a place where we are holding him accountable, it feels good. Finally, we were able to pursue a kind of justice. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in full justice \u2013 I believe in a journey towards justice and this is the first step.\u201d In a statement read out by his defence lawyers during the hearing, Raslan claimed he was not associated with torture and denied that it had taken place under his watch. Martin Holsky, a chief inspector with the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state police, later testified that Raslan told him: \u201cWith this many interrogations in one day, you can\u2019t always be polite. With armed groups, you sometimes need to be stricter.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe he did anything wrong,\u201d said Ghrer. \u201cI was in court many times, watching his expressions. He looks at us with disgust. As if he doesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s being held accountable, or he believes he\u2019s not like other members of the regime.\u201d Other survivors agreed. \u201cIn my testimony, I said that I wish for him to spend a lot of time in prison so he could think about all of us,\u201d said Ruham Hawash, who was detained at Branch 251 in 2012. \u201cI want him to think about all the people who testified against him in court, all the people that he tortured and whose torture he was responsible for during his career. I think with enough time he will not be able to run from these thoughts.\u201d Hawash said the trial in Koblenz represented an opportunity for justice she had not expected. \u201cI was tortured at Branch 251. I felt like, at that time, a part of my dignity was taken from me. So another thing about this trial is that I feel like, for me personally, I\u2019m getting some of my dignity back that I lost in 2012,\u201d she said. She also pointed to the body of evidence used to convicted Raslan, including thousands of photos of detainees tortured to death in prison, provided by a Syrian military photographer known only as Caesar. \u201cThis verdict is a tool to demonstrate that this regime uses systematic torture,\u201d she said. The verdict carries wider implications for countries across Europe, including the UK and Denmark, where governments have voiced proposals to return Syrian asylum seekers. \u201cI see this trial not just as justice but as a sign to the world that this regime uses torture systematically \u2013 which also means we can\u2019t send people back,\u201d she said. Raslan\u2019s conviction also comes amid efforts by some governments across the Middle East to re-establish relations with Assad\u2019s government, despite previously backing his overthrow. The verdict in Koblenz, as well as multiple ongoing trials against former regime officials in Germany and elsewhere across Europe, present opportunities for accountability alongside the risk that such trials might dissuade higher-level officials from within the Syrian regime from providing information, or being brought to justice outside Syria. \u201cOther perpetrators might see that they can\u2019t get away with their crimes, but it also means they won\u2019t leave Syria, or people who worked for the regime might not leave their posts,\u201d said Hawash. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. But it\u2019s still sending a strong message to them that we will strive for justice to hold those perpetrators accountable for their crimes against us and humanity.\u201d Yet for campaigners and the families of thousands of those still missing inside Syrian detention centres, Raslan\u2019s conviction represents an important step to providing vital information about their fate. \u201cThere are still more than 100,000 people in prison \u2013 we have no idea where they are and if they\u2019re alive or dead. Justice cannot truly come while there are still people in jail,\u201d said Lamis al-Khateeb, a member of the group Families for Freedom, who gathered outside court to witness Raslan\u2019s sentencing."

            "title": "Scepticism in uneasy Kazakhstan as president promises reform",
            "date": "2022-01-15T05:00:12Z",
            "content": "Kazakhstan\u2019s president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, who at the height of unrest last week said he had ordered troops to shoot to kill without warning, has spent this week taking a softer line and promising genuine reform. However, with thousands of people still in detention and a behind-the-scenes power struggle still not fully resolved, many have expressed scepticism. \u201cPeople who have carried out serious crimes will be punished in accordance with the law,\u201d Tokayev wrote on Twitter on Friday. \u201cFor others, I order the prosecutor to determine their level of guilt, and if there are no aggravating circumstances, to soften their punishment.\u201d More than 10,000 people have been detained during the past two weeks. At the height of the protests, Tokayev said \u201c20,000 terrorists\u201d had attacked Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, Almaty, but these numbers seem to have been quietly revised. On Thursday, the prosecutor\u2019s office said 494 criminal cases had been opened, including 44 for terrorism. Most of those detained instead faced administrative charges with a maximum of 15 days in jail. Journalists and rights activists say there is little transparency about the criminal charges and still no reliable figure for the number of people who died in the violence. An earlier figure of 164, published by a government-linked source, was later retracted. Even in the west of the country, where the protests began over a sharp increase in fuel prices, and where events remained largely peaceful, police rounded up hundreds of people involved in the demonstrations. Max Bokay, a longstanding rights activist in the western city of Atyrau, said by telephone that about 500 people had been detained in the region, often by police who came to their homes after Tokayev implemented a state of emergency last week. He only knew of one case where criminal charges had been launched, but said people detained on administrative charges had spoken of intimidation and beatings. Bokay, who was arrested at a 2016 protest and spent five years in jail before being released last year, said this time he had not been detained, although he had been \u201croughed up\u201d by a group of men on the street during the days of protest. \u201cAnd just today, a few hours ago, there were people kicking my apartment door, probably because today I had a one-person protest against torture in jails, I guess it\u2019s an intimidation tactic,\u201d he said on Friday. The protests, over economic and political demands, were apparently hijacked by an intra-elite battle between Tokayev and figures close to Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country\u2019s president from its founding in 1991 until 2019, when he handpicked Tokayev as his successor. Karim Masimov, head of the KNB security services and a former prime minister under Nazarbayev, has been arrested on treason charges and accused of trying to seize power, along with two of his deputies. He has not been seen or heard from since the protests began. Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, a former minister and Nazarbayev adviser, blamed \u201creactionary and conservative forces from the Nazarbayev clan\u201d for stoking the unrest. \u201cI think negotiations are ongoing, and there is a search for a compromise,\u201d he said. At the height of the protests, when Tokayev\u2019s grip on Kazakhstan appeared shaky, he called on a Russia-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, to intervene. More than 2,000 mostly Russian troops arrived, which helped shore up Tokayev\u2019s position, and have already begun their departure. Observers say the mission, while brief, has put Tokayev in Vladimir Putin\u2019s debt and placed Kazakhstan more firmly in Moscow\u2019s orbit. Putin has described the unrest as a \u201ccoloured revolution\u201d backed by nefarious forces in the west, leading many people to fear a crackdown on what remains of Kazakh civil society. Echoing Putin, Tokayev accused the independent media of helping fan the protests. \u201cWe were very disappointed to hear those words,\u201d said Vyacheslav Abramov, the editor-in-chief of the news portal Vlast.kz. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that it\u2019s not media, it\u2019s not civil society, who are responsible for the crisis \u2013 it\u2019s the people in power.\u201d So far, Tokayev has not acted against media outlets, and has announced a series of measures aimed at winning popular support, including setting up a new fund for public good to which oligarchs and wealthy businessman will be forced to contribute. Abramov said there were now three possible scenarios: \u201cThe first is that we have a massive crackdown, like in Belarus; the second is that we go back to where we were before the crisis; and the third one we are going towards real reforms.\u201d The third option seemed the least likely, he added."

            "content": "The Royal Navy will fail without reform, the outgoing deputy of the service has said in a farewell message to personnel and civil servants in which he bemoaned what he said was as an inadequate status quo. V-Adm Nick Hine posted a candidly worded letter on Twitter in which he said change had to happen, and that he had sometimes despaired at the type of thinking around him. His time in the role corresponded with a period in which \u2013 as the Commons defence committee said in a report last month \u2013 spending on the navy and the wider military had been capped despite it facing changing threats and taking on additional responsibilities. \u201cPlease understand that the need for and, the value of change, is not a fantasy \u2013 if we don\u2019t transform we will fail and we will lose. It is that simple,\u201d he wrote, adding that he was also addressing \u201cpedants and naysayers\u201d. Those who had known him for a long time would know that his \u201cbig bugbear\u201d was that \u201cour great navy has lost its ambition\u201d, he wrote. \u201cI have despaired at times that collectively we had become self-censoring, risk-averse and lacking in curiosity, confidence and critical thinking skills. \u201cWe have these qualities but have allowed a rose-tinted view of tradition and a spurious belief that you can avoid risk by sticking to a failing status quo to avoid driving transformation.\u201d The defence committee report identified a series a challenges the navy faces, including delays to crucial procurement programmes as a result of budget cuts, an increasing reliance on allies and successive governments prioritising of ships\u2019 defensive rather than offensive capabilities. \u201cWhen ships do get to sea they act like porcupines \u2013 well defended herbivores with limited offensive capabilities. This is a result of decisions by successive governments to limit budgets and prioritise defensive capabilities,\u201d it said. \u201cThese significant challenges have not prevented the Navy delivering significant successes, most notably the commissioning of the two aircraft carriers and the 2021 carrier strike group deployment to the Indo-Pacific. However, they do raise concerns about the Navy\u2019s ability to deliver the crucial transformations it has planned.\u201d Boris Johnson selected the head of the navy as the next chief of Britain\u2019s armed forces for the first time in 20 years in October, a choice intended to reinforce the UK\u2019s post-Brexit switch in focus to the Indo-Pacific region. Downing Street also published an integrated review of defence and foreign policy earlier last year, a key feature of which was to call for a significant British re-engagement in the Indo-Pacific, which had been abandoned in the late 1960s. Sea power is seen to be at the heart of competing with China, which has the world\u2019s largest navy. The UK signed a three-country pact with the US last month to supply long-range nuclear-powered submarines for Australia. A navy spokesperson, said: \u201cThreats to the UK and our allies multiply every day and so it is critical the Royal Navy continues to transform to ensure that personnel and valuable resources are placed where they are needed most. \u201cThe government has made the biggest investment in the armed forces since the cold war. We will continue to modernise, ensuring we are ready to meet the future challenges."

            "date": "2022-01-14T01:24:42Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden was in crisis talks with Senate Democratic rebels Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema at the White House on Thursday night after they thwarted his high-stakes efforts to push voting rights legislation through Congress, according to several reports. Even before the US president arrived on Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon to join Democratic senators for their regular lunch gathering, in a diplomatic public offensive, Sinema of Arizona bluntly reiterated that she would not support any change to filibuster rules to get voting rights passed. Her surprise last-minute move with a speech effectively killed her party\u2019s hope of passing the most sweeping voting rights protections in a generation. And in a stark joint demonstration of their opposition, Manchin of West Virginia later praised Sinema and released his own statement confirming he also would not vote to change the filibuster. A clearly-exasperated Biden concluded after his Senate lunch meeting: \u201cI hope we can get this done, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Not long after, he suffered another blow when the supreme court blocked his administration from enforcing a requirement that employees at large businesses be vaccinated against Covid-19 or undergo weekly testing and wear a mask on the job. By the evening, however, Biden was huddled back at the White House in last-ditch talks with Sinema and Manchin, CNN and Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. Sinema had taken to the Senate floor around noon opposing any changes to the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation, while Democrats currently hold a bare majority in the 100-seat chamber and two voting rights bills are stalled. \u201cWhile I continue to support these [voting rights] bills, I will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cWe must address the disease itself, the disease of division, to protect our democracy, and it cannot be achieved by one party alone. It cannot be achieved solely by the federal government. The response requires something greater and, yes, more difficult than what the Senate is discussing today.\u201d Sinema\u2019s speech came at an extremely perilous moment for US democracy. Republican lawmakers in 19 states have enacted 34 new laws, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, that impose new voting restrictions. They have also passed a slew of bills that seek to inject more partisan control into election administration and the counting of votes, an unprecedented trend experts are deeply concerned about and call election subversion. Many of those measures have been passed in state legislatures on simple majority, party-line votes. For months, Sinema and Manchin have staunchly defended the filibuster, which stands as the major hurdle to voting rights reform. No Republicans support either the voting rights bills or changing the rules of the filibuster, so Democrats cannot do anything unless both senators are on board. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, has pledged a vote on the measure and rule changes by Monday, a public holiday to celebrate the civil rights leader Martin Luther King. The opposition damages Biden, who gave a speech in Atlanta on Tuesday calling on Democrats to support the bill. On Thursday he said: \u201cLike every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time, we can come back and try it a second time. We missed this time. We missed this time,\u201d he added. Raphael Warnock, a first term Democratic senator of Georgia, whose victory last January helped Democrats win control of the Senate, said: \u201cThe state of Georgia is ground zero for these voter suppression bills that we\u2019re seeing emerge all across the country.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a defining moral moment. It is the most important thing we can do this Congress.\u201d Civil rights leaders quickly denounced Sinema after her speech on Thursday. \u201cHistory will remember Senator Sinema unkindly. While she remains stubborn in her \u2018optimism\u2019, Black and brown Americans are losing their right to vote,\u201d said Martin Luther King III, the son of the civil rights leader, who had met with Biden and vice president Kamala Harris on their high-profile joint visit to Georgia. \u201cShe\u2019s siding with the legacy of Bull Connor and George Wallace instead of the legacy of my father and all those who fought to make real our democracy,\u201d he said, citing the notorious segregationists. Signa Oliver, an activist with the Arizona chapter of Indivisible, a grassroots group, said: \u201cArizonans value leaders who can compromise and work across the aisle, but let me be clear: the filibuster is non-negotiable. Indivisibles, like myself, worked tooth-and-nail to get Sinema elected in 2018 \u2013 we made calls, registered voters and knocked on doors in the 120F weather.\u201d Jared Huffman, a Democratic congressman from California, tweeted at Sinema and Manchin: \u201cShame on you.\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate minority leader, praised Sinema\u2019s speech as an act of \u201cpolitical courage\u201d that could \u201csave the Senate as an institution\u201d, according to the Associated Press. For months, Democrats have championed two bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The former measure would overhaul federal election rules to set baseline requirements for voter access. It would require 15 days of early voting, as well as same-day and automatic registration. It also includes provisions that make it harder to remove election officials without justification, and would make it easier for voters to go to court to ensure their votes aren\u2019t thrown out. The latter bill would require states where there is repeated evidence of recent voting discrimination to get changes approved by the federal government before they go into effect. It updates and restores a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, that was struck down by the supreme court in 2013. The US House passed a mega-bill on Thursday morning that combined both of those measures into a single bill. It was a procedural move designed to allow the Senate to quickly hear and debate the measure."

            "date": "2022-01-04T20:04:11Z",
            "content": "A C$40bn agreement-in-principle has been reached in Canada to reform the child welfare system for First Nations people and compensate more than 200,000 individuals and families who suffered because of it. At the heart of the deal is a legacy of discrimination in child welfare systems that saw many children removed from their homes and placed in state care, and others who were denied adequate medical care and social services because of their Indigenous identity. Half of the C$40bn (US$31bn) is earmarked for reforming a child welfare system deemed discriminatory by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) and federal court. The other half is reserved for payments to First Nations people harmed by the on-reserve and Yukon child welfare systems between 1 April 1991 and 31 March 2022. First Nations people who experienced delays or denials of medical care and social services between 1991 and 2017 will also receive compensation. \u201cFor too long, the Government of Canada did not adequately fund or support the wellness of First Nations families and children,\u201d said Patty Hajdu, minister of Indigenous services, as details of the deal were released on Tuesday. \u201cNo compensation amount can make up for the trauma people have experienced, but these agreements-in-principle acknowledge to survivors and their families the harm and pain caused by the discrimination in funding and services,\u201d the minister continued. Cindy Woodhouse of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), who participated in the negotiations, told reporters that federal policies had led to the overrepresentation of First Nations in every province\u2019s and territory\u2019s child welfare system. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t about parenting. This is about poverty and First Nations children being removed from their families and communities instead of provided help with food, clothing or shelter,\u201d Woodhouse said, adding that child welfare agencies wouldn\u2019t receive funding unless a child was removed. Another of the First Nations organizations involved in the negotiations warned against premature celebration. Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, underlined that this was merely a non-binding agreement. \u201cI see it as words on paper,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cNothing changes in the lives of children today.\u201d First Nations children are more than 17 times more likely to be in foster care than the typical Canadian, and after they turn 18, they are often left without support to find safe housing, employment or education opportunities or even the most basic care services, Blackstock said. She said some of the $20bn earmarked for reform will go toward those needs. The $40bn settlement was reached in the 11th hour of negotiations, on 31 December \u2013 the culmination of years of hard-fought litigation, class-action lawsuits and challenges from the federal government, which began with a human rights complaint in 2007. That complaint alleged that federal authorities intentionally underfunded services for First Nations communities and needlessly removed children from their homes. One of its primary arguments was that Canada was not respecting its duty to uphold Jordan\u2019s Principle, which was passed after the 2005 death of five-year-old Jordan River Anderson of the Norway House Cree Nation in Manitoba. Born with medical problems, Anderson spent most of his life in hospital and ultimately died while the provincial and federal governments squabbled over who should pay for his care. Jordan\u2019s Principle dictates that the first government of contact is required to immediately cover the cost of services, and resolve jurisdictional disputes later. In Canada, healthcare is a provincial responsibility for non-Indigenous individuals, but Indigenous people fall under federal jurisdiction. Nine years later, the CHRT found the government acted intentionally. Tuesday\u2019s settlement reflects this judgment, as well as other litigation. The outcomes of discrimination in child welfare have long been seen as an extension of the residential school system, a program that ran from the 1880s until 1996 that saw First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit children removed from their homes and placed in residential schools where physical, sexual and psychological abuse was often rampant. In 2021, the bodies of thousands of children were discovered on the grounds of former residential schools across Canada, as well as in the United States. Blackstock noted that many of the children included in this compensation program were born to parents who attended residential schools or who were separated from their families in the \u201cSixties Scoop\u201d. \u201c[The federal government] is a repeat offender against First Nations children,\u201d she said. David Sterns, a lawyer representing one of the classes, pointed out that more First Nations children are in foster care than were living in residential schools at their height. He said some individuals will receive more than $40,000 each for their suffering. He urged First Nations people who may have been affected to register for class inclusion at SotosClassActions.com."

            "content": "A new report has revealed that a record number of Americans are now alarmed about the climate crisis. The study, published by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, found that Americans overall are becoming increasingly worried about global heating, more engaged with the issue and more supportive of finding solutions to the issue. The study categorized Americans into six distinct groups based on their beliefs, attitudes, policy support and behavior about climate change. The six distinct groups are: the Alarmed, who are the most engaged and very worried about global warming; the Concerned, who think global warming is a significant threat but prioritize it less and are less likely to take action; the Cautious, who are aware of climate change but are uncertain about its causes and are not very worried; the Disengaged, who are largely unaware of global warming; the Doubtful, who doubt it is happening or human-caused and the Dismissive, who firmly reject its reality and oppose most climate change policies. The study revealed that the largest group, Alarmed (33%) greatly outnumber the dismissive (9%) by more than three to one. Approximately six in 10 Americans (59%) are either Alarmed or Concerned while only approximately two in 10 (19%) are Doubtful or Dismissive. Over the last five years, the Alarmed group has nearly doubled in size, growing 15 percentage points in total. From just March 2021 to September 2021 alone, the Alarmed segment increased by 9 percentage points. Meanwhile, the Dismissive group shrank from 11% to 9% in the past five years, with only about one in 10 Americans now firmly rejecting the reality of human-caused global warming. When the group first began its surveys in 2008, the Concerned was the largest segment. Two years later, the group decreased slightly while the Cautious grew and became roughly equally as large. On the contrary, the Alarmed was the second smallest group as recently as early 2015. The Cautious, Doubtful and Dismissive groups have all shrunk in recent years. \u201cThe growth of the Alarmed segment \u2026 is encouraging because progress on climate change requires strong, coordinated, and sustained action, and the Alarmed are the most likely to demand and support these actions by leaders,\u201d the study said."

            "content": "George Monbiot writes movingly about his despair in the face of environmental inaction (Watching Don\u2019t Look Up made me see my whole life of campaigning flash before me, 4 January). It is possible to understand the strange lack of urgency by considering what George articulates elsewhere, namely that humanity is trapped in a consumer-capitalist system, whose effects are environmentally disastrous. The problem leading to pessimism is that changes to the fundamental belief systems of any culture must inevitably be very slow. The associated values are so taken for granted as the atmosphere of social existence, and shared as the basic assumptions of life, that it takes generations for cultures to change in their fundamentals. The disasters faced by the world, directly caused by our cultural values, are so serious and so imminent that change is needed immediately. However, change requires an alternative system of values to be adopted by humanity to create a new cultural context. It is not possible to create cultural values intellectually and then impose them on a society; they only enter as a social presence by a process of organic growth. So the momentum of our predominant values, deep in our psyches, overwhelms the evidence of our peril and very effectively maintains the status quo, apart from a bit of tinkering. We are all collectively mad because we share the same intimate values, and the collective nature of our delusions both obscures reality and comforts us. Stephen Smith Glasgow \u2022 The problem is not so much the media, as George Monbiot suggests, as academia. Judged from the standpoint of helping us solve the climate crisis, academia is an intellectual and practical disaster. If academia was rationally and effectively devoted to helping us solve the climate crisis, and other global problems, it would give absolute intellectual priority to the tasks of articulating the problems, and proposing and critically assessing possible solutions. The pursuit of knowledge would be important, but secondary. A central task would be to engage actively with the public to promote action designed to solve the climate crisis \u2013 above all, put pressure on the government to act. But universities do not remotely proceed in such a way. They are devoted to the pursuit and application of knowledge; they do not take their primary task to be intelligently conducted public education about what our problems are, and what we need to do to solve them. As I have argued in book after book, article after article, for nearly 50 years, we face climate catastrophe because of the gross and profoundly damaging structural irrationality of academia, which prohibits giving priority to our all-important problems of living. Nicholas Maxwell Science and technology studies, University College London \u2022 I felt a deep empathy with George Monbiot\u2019s frustration with the media. Last evening I stormed out of the room where my husband was watching the news because I was so frustrated at the relative unimportance of the main items. Where is the news about the progress, or lack of it, on the actions that should be taking place by world leaders on climate change? What can we do to make them sit up and take notice of Monbiot, and those like him, who tell us the painful truth? My fear and frustration are not for myself \u2013 I\u2019m 80 \u2013 but for the following generations. All I can do is rant.

It was a pretty convivial evening. J\u00f8rgen I wouldn\u2019t say it was love at first sight, but we had a good bond. We talked about face masks. I think the rules stray into the personal rights of people. The blue and white masks were designed against bacteria. Those masks last for roughly half an hour, because they get wet and the pores get bigger. So they don\u2019t work that well against bacteria \u2013 and viruses are so small they can get through. Neal I was surprised about someone who works in a medical area seeming to suggest the holes in the masks are bigger than the virus. The virus isn\u2019t a free-floating thing: it resides in water droplets, and the masks stop the droplets. The big beef Neal The climate does change over geological time, but the changes we have seen in the last 100, 200 years have to be down to human activity. J\u00f8rgen There is too much consensus, no opposing views. The climate is changing, but I\u2019m doubting it is man-made. In hindsight, we often see that 20, 40 years ago we were wrong. A bit like cholesterol and butter and all those things; 20 years ago, they were the most dangerous things you could put into your body; now the same scientists are saying: \u201cSorry, we miscalculated, it\u2019s good for you.\u201d Neal Neither of us is a climate scientist, so our perspectives have to come from an emotional response to what we read and what is in the culture. J\u00f8rgen I\u2019m sceptical. I rethink, and doubt, even my own actions. And I\u2019m in favour of personal freedom. I want to have my thoughts: drive my car, eat my meat, make bad jokes about certain groups of people. I don\u2019t want to offend people, but I want the right to offend.

The European Union is too lenient. Neal Europe needs an influx of people because of the demographic situation. I would say J\u00f8rgen is a \u201cFortress Europe\u201d person. His issue is European culture and values compared with Africa and the Middle East. J\u00f8rgen I see us in Europe with a more Christian background and heritage, and if you come to Europe from outside you should accept these values, like equality of men and women, freedom of religion. I see some who don\u2019t want to agree with those values. Neal That sounded to me like quite old-school racist talk, tarring people who are non-European with a pretty broad brush. Takeaways J\u00f8rgen Without discussion, without different opinions, there would be no progress. You need disagreement, because you are forced to defend your opinions, and maybe form new ones. It was a very nice evening, but too short. Neal People mostly don\u2019t like confrontation. So it\u2019s unusual to deliberately focus on those things, which was healthy. It was also good to be able to separate these existential political matters from the human being you are sharing a glass of wine with.

            "date": "2022-01-16T16:15:20Z",
            "content": "It is January 2020. Donald Trump and Greta Thunberg are the star turns at the annual festival of globalisation organised by the World Economic Forum in Davos. The fossil fuel-loving president and the teenage environmentalist have a pop at each other. There are reports of a new virus emerging from China but Covid barely gets a mention. Much has happened since. For a second year running, Davos is not going ahead in person. US billionaires will not be parking their private jets at Zurich airport. The skies above the ski resort made famous by Thomas Mann in the Magic Mountain will not be thick with helicopters. Hotels will not be able to charge five times their normal rates for a captive audience of policymakers, business leaders, academics, campaigners, journalists and assorted hangers-on. Let\u2019s face it: few of us are going to miss being lectured about the need to tackle global heating from those with the biggest carbon footprints, or watching company bosses who do all they can to avoid paying tax shed crocodile tears about the lack of decent schools, skilled workers and public infrastructure. That said, the issues that were salient at the 2020 Davos have not gone away. In many respects, the trends have worsened in the past two years. Take inequality, where there has been a widening of the gap between rich and poor, both within countries and between them. The sort of people who attend Davos have been insulated from the worst of the pandemic and, in many cases, have actually prospered from it. Academics, journalists, PR consultants have all been able to work in relative safety at home while less well-remunerated frontline workers have put themselves at risk. Stimulus policies pursued by central banks \u2013 zero interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 have put rocket boosters under asset prices. Poorer countries have had far less scope to stimulate their economies and have been squeezed out in the global race for vaccines. In the early stages of the pandemic, there was much talk about how the pandemic would bring people and countries together, but the opposite has been the case. In the UK, the mood has soured since the days when people stood on their doorsteps to clap for the NHS. In Europe and the US there have been vociferous, and sometimes violent, anti-vax protests. In the labour markets, there have been faint echoes of what happened after the Black Death in the mid-14th century. Back then, shortages of workers caused by a much more deadly virus put upward pressure on wage rates. Lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 have had similar effects: firms \u2013 especially those in low-wage sectors \u2013 are having trouble recruiting and retaining staff, and have had no option but to raise pay rates. The risk of a wage-price spiral has alarmed some of the world\u2019s leading central banks, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, who feel \u2013 rightly \u2013 their credibility is at stake. With interest rates on their way back up, belief in the Goldilocks scenario (just enough tightening to reduce inflationary pressure but not so much as to halt recovery) is going to be put to the test this year. Clearly, there is a risk of the porridge in 2022 either being too hot, in which case inflation is longer lasting, or too cold, in which case there will be a global recession. The sharp contraction in the global economy in 2020 did not remove the threat posed by climate change, and those who would have turned up in Davos know it. Each year, global movers and shakers are asked by the WEF what they perceive to be the biggest long-term risks. Even though the world is still struggling with Covid, this year the top five issues identified were all linked to the environment. Action on climate change is being made more difficult because the crisis has made countries more domestically focused. In part, that\u2019s because disruptions to global supply chains have encouraged a drive for self-sufficiency, but there has also been a tendency for governments to look after their own, self-defeating though this will prove to be. Vaccine apartheid is a classic example of the lack of international solidarity, but there are other worrying trends too. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have warned repeatedly that more and more countries are struggling with unpayable debts, to little effect. A new debt crisis is about to erupt, amplifying the impact of the pandemic. As the Bank\u2019s president, David Malpass, noted last week, before the pandemic on average 53% of 10-year-olds in the world\u2019s poorest countries were unable to read a simple story. The figure is now 70%. Any hopes that the departure of Trump from the White House would lead to a de-escalation of geopolitical tension have proved groundless. Joe Biden has turned out to be just as hawkish towards China as his predecessor, while relations between the west and Russia are as bad as they have been since the end of the cold war. The collapse of communism was supposed to usher in an era in which free markets and democracy would spread around the world, but the golden age of globalisation lasted barely 15 years. The World Trade Organization \u2013 the symbol of the new world order \u2013 is moribund, while authoritarian leaders are back in vogue. The end of history thesis proved to be wildly overblown. The plan is that Davos will still take place, in the late spring when the Omicron wave has abated, and if it happens there will be plenty to discuss. How many members of the usual crowd show up once the snow has melted remains to be seen. We have had peak globalisation; we\u2019ve also had peak Davos."

The sixth-smallest country in Europe, with an area of 180 sq miles (468 sq km), it is smaller than every English county apart from Rutland. Landlocked, and lying entirely above 840 metres (2,750ft), the climate is, as you would expect, mostly continental and alpine. Because Andorra lies on the southern, Spanish side of the highest peaks, which run along its northern border, it is more sheltered and drier than locations on the French side. Winters are fairly cold, dry and sunny, with as much as five hours of daily sunshine in January and February. Winter temperatures in the capital, Andorra la Vella, are mostly a few degrees above freezing and precipitation is mostly low \u2013 just 160mm (6.3in) from December to February. However, heavy snowfalls can occur, especially when fronts sweep in from the Atlantic to the west. In Soldeu, at an altitude of 1,800 metres (5,900ft), temperatures are much colder throughout the year, staying below freezing from December to March. Temperatures rise rapidly from May onwards, with average daily maxima of the mid-20s Celsius (high 70s Fahrenheit) in the summer months; pleasantly warm but rarely very hot. The wettest months are usually May and June, when there are regular thunderstorms. Rainfall is low and fairly regular for the remainder of the year."

            "content": "Australia\u2019s giant offshore gasfields are paying almost no royalties, create few jobs and are a large and rising source of greenhouse gases, according to a new report from the Australia Institute. The \u201cGas-fired robbery\u201d report, released Monday, finds Western Australia receives only a tiny fraction of its revenue from an industry that generated $27bn in WA exports last year. The report comes just days after a WA heatwave matched Australia\u2019s hottest ever reliably recorded temperature of 50.7C and reportedly caused an outage at a nearby gas plant. The $430m that ended up in the state\u2019s coffers was a mere 1% of budget revenue, or half as much as it collected from motor vehicle registrations. By contrast, the iron-ore industry tipped $7.8bn into the 2019/20 budget, more than 18 times as much as gas. \u201cOil and gas companies like Woodside and Chevron are being given this valuable and finite resource virtually for free, making huge profits from its sale, creating few jobs and returning almost nothing to everyday West Australians,\u201d said Mark Ogge, principal adviser at the Australia Institute\u2019s Climate &amp; Energy Program, and author of the report. The North West Shelf gas operations provide the bulk of the liquefied natural gas royalties paid at $425m, with no tax or LNG royalties from Woodside\u2019s Pluto, Chevron\u2019s Wheatstone or Shell\u2019s Prelude projects, the analysis found. Chevron\u2019s Gorgon contributed $7m in 2019-20 to the WA budget but was potentially generating revenue of more than four times that tally per day. Although \u201cpaltry\u201d, if the North West Shelf payments were extended at the same rate to the rest of the LNG industry in WA, more than $1bn would be generated for the state and $500m for the commonwealth, the report found. At its peak in 2013/14, the Woodside-run operation provided about triple the current level, or about $1.2bn, making up more than 4% of the budget revenue that year. The tax and royalty arrangements \u201csee large amounts of gas effectively given away for free to multinational oil and gas companies\u201d, the report said. \u201c[T]he obvious question is how much money could be raised if WA\u2019s gas was subject to an effective royalty regime.\u201d With its reliance on expensive equipment rather than labour, the industry is also a relatively small employer in the state, accounting for less than 1% of the workforce, the report found. LNG also managed to extract $94m in subsidies from the state government in 2020/21. \u201cThis kind of legislative blank cheque from government to an industry that offers so few jobs and revenue in return is symptomatic of the disproportionate influence of the LNG industry,\u201d it said. LNG\u2019s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is \u201cimmense\u201d and growing as more projects line up for approval. Current and proposed LNG projects - including Browse, Scarborough and the Pluto expansion \u2013 will alone emit 41.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent in production and processing. That tally \u2013 which excludes the contribution when the gas is burnt by customers \u2013 amounts to almost half WA\u2019s total emissions each year. A spokesperson for the WA government did not dispute the revenue figures but said the contribution of the LNG industry \u2013 which reserves 15% of its output for WA customers \u2013 went beyond the extraction and processing of the fuel. \u201cGiven energy is an essential input into most economic activity, we should not consider the employment effects of energy projects by simply looking at their operational workforce,\u201d the official said. \u201cDomestic gas has underpinned the Western Australian economy \u2013 for domestic and industrial uses \u2013 for decades, and due to our strong domestic gas policy LNG projects continue to make a significant contribution to the state.\u201d Gas provides as much as 60% of the state\u2019s electricity, and the Western Australian Gas and Downstream Industry Opportunities Study in August 2021 estimated downstream gas processing projects may contribute between $3bn-$10bn to the state economy over 20 years. Chevron, too, defended its economic contribution. The US-based company has paid about $7bn in Australian state and federal taxes and royalties since 2009, a spokesperson said. \u201cForecasts show by the early to mid-2020s, we will pay $1bn to $2.5bn a year in federal and state taxes and royalties,\u201d she said. \u201cOur contribution in Australia goes far beyond tax,\u201d with more than $60bn in local content generated by the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects with contracts reaching almost 1,000 in number for Australian businesses, and 19,000 construction jobs. Claire Wilkinson, director of the WA division of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said: \u201cWestern Australians know that natural gas creates local jobs and is essential to our community, no matter what this east coast outfit [the Australia Institute] suggests. \u201cCritically, mining and minerals processing, a key generator of royalties for WA, is a big user of natural gas to power their activities,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cIn the last 10 years alone, Western Australian natural gas has supported at least 57,000 full-time jobs and paid more than $53bn in taxes.\u201d Guardian Australia also approached the Morrison government, Woodside and Shell for comment."

            "date": "2022-01-30T12:00:20Z",
            "content": "When bitcoin mining company Bit Digital started shipping its energy-intensive computers out of China in early 2021, eyebrows were raised. \u201cA lot of people thought we were being overly paranoid,\u201d says chief strategy officer Samir Tabar, who helped relocate all of the company\u2019s machines to the US and Canada. But the company\u2019s paranoia paid off. China\u2019s bitcoin mining ban last summer, driven partly by environmental concerns, sent the industry spinning into chaos. The announcement sparked a fire sale of the computers used to power bitcoin, with mining companies scrambling to ship more than 2m of the machines out of China. They arrived by the crateload in countries like the US, Russia and Kazakhstan. China was home to about 65% of global bitcoin production in 2020, according to an estimate by the University of Cambridge. Although the country banned bitcoin mining for a number of reasons, one was the massive energy consumption bitcoin required and the impediment that posed to China\u2019s goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. Chinese regulators aren\u2019t the only ones concerned by bitcoin mining\u2019s environmental impact. The latest calculation from Cambridge University\u2019s bitcoin electricity consumption index estimates that bitcoin mining consumes 133.63 terawatt hours a year of electricity \u2013 more than the entire countries of Ukraine and Norway. This figure keeps growing: bitcoin mining currently uses 66 times more electricity than in 2015. Bitcoiners like to say that China\u2019s ban proved the resilience of the network. Although the \u201chashrate\u201d \u2013 a measure of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin \u2013 plummeted around the time of the crackdown, it had recovered by the end of the year. But bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption now poses an existential threat to the mining industry, with a growing number of lawmakers around the world eager to follow China\u2019s lead. Kazakhstan initially welcomed China\u2019s stranded bitcoin miners as a potential boon to the economy. Lured by the promise of lax regulation and cheap coal power, an estimated fifth of global bitcoin mining production migrated there. But bitcoin\u2019s rapacious energy demand created intense pressure on Kazakhstan\u2019s ageing energy grid this winter. The threat of emergency blackouts soon led the government to permit grid operators to limit power supply to miners, leaving some facilities without power. Even in renewable energy havens, the future of bitcoin mining is far from assured. Iceland, which gets almost all of its energy from renewables, won\u2019t welcome any more bitcoin miners to its shores. Regulators in Sweden say that bitcoin mining siphons energy from more productive industries, and are currently lobbying the EU to ban the practice outright. Norway-based bitcoin miner Arcane\u2019s CEO Torbj\u00f8rn Bull Jenssen dismisses this as a \u201cvery planned-economy approach\u201d. But even in the free-market-loving US, an increasing number of lawmakers are souring on the industry. In theory, a greener bitcoin is possible. The digital coin\u2019s energy consumption is tied to its underlying \u201cproof-of-work\u201d protocol (PoW). This is the decentralised consensus mechanism that secures the currency and prevents fraud or hacking, in the absence of oversight from banks or another centralised body. The role of bitcoin miners is essentially to verify transactions on the blockchain. Think of bitcoin mining as a contest where miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The \u201cwinner\u201d adds the next block of transactions to the distributed ledger (ie, the blockchain) and claims payment in the form of new bitcoins and a transaction fee. The miner using the most computing power is likely to solve the problem fastest, creating the incentive to expend more energy in order to \u201cwin\u201d. This ballooning energy consumption is fuelling the popularity of a less energy-intensive alternative: proof-of-stake (PoS). Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, a blockchain platform that allows users to create smart contracts, says that a friend of hers ran a cryptography mailing list when bitcoin was first announced. \u201cArguably the first bitcoin sceptic\u201d, his first reaction was, \u201c\u2018If this is successful, it\u2019s going to absorb all the energy in the universe, and it\u2019s going to be terrible.\u2019\u201d Tezos is built on PoS instead, which uses a consensus mechanism different from bitcoin\u2019s. Rather than \u201cminers\u201d competing with computing power, different nodes of the distributed network compete by committing \u201cstakes\u201d of tokens. Staking a greater number of tokens \u2013 which risk being forfeited in the event of fraud \u2013 increases the likelihood that a node will be selected by an algorithm to produce the next block of transactions, receiving rewards in the form of more tokens. Because it\u2019s the \u201cstake\u201d (ie, the number of tokens) rather than \u201cwork\u201d (ie, energy expenditure) that secures the network, PoS reduces network power demand by more than 99% relative to PoW. Instead of warehouses stacked high with purpose-built machines, PoS can run on a dinky Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Although Breitman says environmental concerns aren\u2019t what pushed her blockchain to pick PoS, it\u2019s becoming more advantageous as scrutiny on PoW ramps up. Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain after bitcoin, is planning to shift to PoS by the end of 2022, and a number of new blockchain applications such as Cardano and Polkadot have chosen to launch using this protocol. The European Commission is among the regulatory bodies trying to incentivise the industry to migrate applications from PoW to PoS but the bitcoin network has so far resisted any such move. It\u2019s not that bitcoiners don\u2019t care about the environmental impact \u2013 although a vocal minority on social media might give this impression, says digital assets lead at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), Michel Rauchs. The issue is that a majority of bitcoiners remain adamant that PoS is not a worthy replacement for PoW. Many bitcoiners believe that PoS subverts the fundamental principles of a decentralised currency that must remain outside the reach of governments and the banking system. \u201cThe problem with proof-of-stake is that it\u2019s not trustless and it\u2019s not censorship-resistant, and it\u2019s not objective,\u201d says Chris Bendiksen, research lead at digital assets investment company CoinShares. \u201cThere\u2019s no real difference from a high-level perspective between proof-of-stake and consensus shareholder capitalism\u2026 Proof-of-stake is not a replacement for proof-of-work, it\u2019s just a return to the pre-bitcoin system.\u201d Some bitcoiners claim that the environmental debate is overblown because energy usage will fall over the coming years. This is because the profit miners receive for minting new coins is programmed to halve roughly every four years. Eventually, all bitcoins will be mined and miners will only receive transaction fees. \u201cSince the [payment in the form of new coins] will go away and transaction fees won\u2019t go up, electricity consumption will end up being much lower than the doomsayers believe,\u201d says Pierre Rochard, a longtime bitcoin investor and developer. In other words, shrinking rewards should shrink the pool of competing miners. Whether or not this will be the case, reluctance to rewire bitcoin\u2019s underlying protocol tosses the ball back into the bitcoin miners\u2019 court to tackle the issue of energy consumption. They\u2019re rising to the challenge \u2013 at least in rhetoric. Bitcoin mining is the cleanest and most efficient use of energy in the world out of any major industry, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, founder of the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), said in a recent briefing. \u201cThe only way you get more sustainable and more efficient would be to create an imaginary industry.\u201d (More imaginary than bitcoin, that is.) The BMC is a body of bitcoin miners set up last year to address growing concerns over the cryptocurrency\u2019s energy consumption. Its purpose is to promote sustainability within the industry, but it\u2019s also part of the fightback against bitcoin\u2019s image problem. The headline figure promoted at the meeting was that bitcoin accounts for only 0.1% of the Earth\u2019s total energy consumption \u2013 which sounds a lot smaller than the frequent comparisons to small countries. (The 0.1% figure caught on fast among bitcoin miners \u2013 several quoted it to the Observer.) Rauchs said that the 0.1% figure sounded \u201croughly in line\u201d with CCAF\u2019s data. What\u2019s more, 58% of the energy used to power the industry is sustainable according to the BMC. A report from CCAF in 2020 estimated this figure at a more conservative 39%, but Rauchs stresses this was only a snapshot of energy consumption at that moment in time, and couldn\u2019t comment on the reliability of the BMC\u2019s estimate without seeing the underlying data. Some bitcoiners argue that the cryptocurrency could incentivise a more rapid shift to renewable energy. Because bitcoin mining operations don\u2019t have to be switched on all the time, they pair well with the intermittent nature of renewable energy according to the argument, and can compel energy companies to increase renewable energy capacity, as well as helping to balance the grid. Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital Holdings, which runs operations in Nebraska, Texas and South Dakota, claims to have such agreements with power providers. \u201cThe company that generates the electricity can tell us to shut down our mining rigs,\u201d says its CEO Fred Thiel, meaning \u201cthey\u2019ll all of a sudden have 100-200 megawatts \u2013 whatever amount we\u2019re consuming \u2013 available to put into the grid at a moment\u2019s notice. We act like a big battery.\u201d There isn\u2019t evidence that this is happening at scale yet, says Rauchs, although it could become more important in future. However, bitcoin mining is not particularly unique in this regard, says Arvind Ravikumar, a petroleum researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. Electric vehicle charging and so-called \u201ctier zero\u201d data centres that don\u2019t support critical functions are also suited to these \u201cdemand response\u201d arrangements that can be paired with renewable energy on the grid, he says. \u201cThe idea that you have to create a new demand, like bitcoin mining, is not correct.\u201d And the flipside is where growing energy demands incentivise defunct fossil fuel-powered stations to come back online. Controversially, bitcoin mining company Greenidge Generation Holdings reopened a former coal power plant in Dresden, New York, and converted it to natural gas, causing the plant\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to increase almost tenfold between 2019 and 2020. Discussions about Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption tend to wind up in a philosophical cul-de-sac about the inherent utility of the industry. Critics contend that this utility is zero, which can provoke defensiveness in its advocates. \u201cThere are old-school bitcoiners who are like, \u2018Who cares about the energy consumption? Bitcoin deserves to exist,\u2019\u201d says Breitman. \u201cIt becomes an argument about values.\u201d Many allege that energy overuse is simply the latest stick with which to beat bitcoin, and that the industry is subject to unfair moral scrutiny compared to others \u2013 like gold mining or Wall Street day trading. Rauchs is \u201cactually pretty sympathetic\u201d to that argument, saying bitcoiners are correct that hyperbole about bitcoin destroying years of climate progress is \u201ccompletely out of proportion\u201d. Whichever way you slice it, eliminating bitcoin isn\u2019t a fast-track solution to global heating. Ravikumar says the most important issue is what the industry is doing to reduce emissions. \u201cThat\u2019s the question we need to be focusing on \u2013 rather than what, if any, are the benefits of Bitcoin mining.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-30T16:03:24Z",
            "content": "US coalmining giant Peabody Energy has repeatedly submitted incorrect greenhouse gas emissions reports to the Australian government, prompting questions about the reliability of national climate data based on company assessments. The Clean Energy Regulator found Peabody had a history of filing inaccurate reports required under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act due to calculation errors, poor record-keeping and inconsistent data collection and analysis. The mistakes were in both directions, leading to significant under- and over-reporting of emissions from the underground Wambo coalmine in New South Wales. The total error was large \u2013 when added up, out by more than 51% of the total emissions from the site \u2013 but the under- and over-reporting largely cancelled each other out. It meant the submitted total was 5.4% lower than what it should have been. \u2022 Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Peabody is the fifth-biggest coalminer in Australia, owning two thermal coalmines (used for electricity generation) and five metallurgical coalmines (for steelmaking). The company has agreed to hire an external consultant to compile its emissions reports using industry best-practice reporting methodologies, and to commission an independent auditor to examine its mines and other facilities. Annica Schoo, the lead environmental investigator at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said there were \u201cmore and more examples\u201d of companies submitting emissions data that did not stand up to scrutiny. It follows Dutch scientists examining satellite imagery and finding the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, leaking from some Queensland coalmines was greater than has been reported. Schoo said the company reports lodged with the regulator were used to help fulfil Australia\u2019s international obligations under several treaties, including the Paris climate agreement, and as part of the government\u2019s annual projections of future emissions. \u201cThe accuracy of this data is critical to getting on top of the climate crisis. The lack of care Peabody has shown is completely unacceptable,\u201d she said. In response to questions, the regulator said there were no broader concerns about the accuracy of emissions data submitted to the government, and ensuring the data was accurate was \u201can enduring compliance and enforcement priority\u201d. Emissions reports were reviewed and assessed, and that assessments drew upon a range of information sources, it said. A spokesperson for Peabody said the company understood the importance of accurately capturing and reporting emissions and had \u201cat all times genuinely sought\u201d to act in compliance with the act. \u201cThe reporting issues identified were completely unintentional and the result of calculation errors, which we have taken immediate actions to rectify,\u201d they said. \u201cAn independent expert auditor has thoroughly reviewed our systems. We have already acted on many of his recommendations and our processes will be regularly reviewed to embed necessary improvements.\u201d Schoo said the regulator had \u201cdone the right thing\u201d by requiring Peabody to address its emissions reporting but it was a concern that it was the first compliance action of its type since the safeguard mechanism \u2013 which was promised to prevent increases in industrial emissions but in practice often hasn\u2019t \u2013 was introduced in 2016. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director with the Australia Institute, said the \u201cenforceable undertakings\u201d agreed by Peabody following the reporting failures were an example of the regulator being \u201call bark and no bite\u201d. \u201cWe are left with rising emissions from Australia\u2019s major polluters, enabled by loose reporting requirements,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-01-13T01:05:15Z",
            "content": "Allowing fossil fuel companies to extract gas from beneath the Lake Eyre basin would \u201cblow out of the water\u201d the Queensland government\u2019s emission targets and make it more difficult for Australia to comply with its international obligations, a new report says. Origin Energy was given approval by the state government to begin exploration for gas on leases in the basin in late December. If allowed to proceed the application could open up the region \u2013 home to one of the last major free-flowing desert river systems \u2013 to the extraction of fossil fuels across 225,000 hectares of Queensland\u2019s channel country. Though the licences only allow for exploration, the Queensland academic Ian Lowe examined the potential emissions that would be created if the basin were opened up to production and found that it would derail the state government\u2019s plan to lower emissions. His analysis modelled the emissions created over two scenarios: a high-activity scenario where the gas is produced for export and a low-activity scenario where only minimal work takes place. Under the former, Lowe found gas extraction in the area would generate 199m tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year, while in the latter activity would produce 16m tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year. This is because the gas resource has an unusually high concentration of CO2, ranging from 30% to 35%. Because of this, a large amount of CO2 would be released during the process of extracting the gas \u2013 even before it was processed, shipped and burned. \u201cI\u2019d not come across anything like that level of CO2 in other gas fields,\u201d Lowe said. \u201cEven if there wasn\u2019t a leakage of methane and even if the gas was burnt somewhere else so that it didn\u2019t count against Australia\u2019s emissions targets, there\u2019d be a significant release associated with getting the gas out of the ground.\u201d Under the high-activity scenario, Lowe said, extraction and export of gas from the basin would soak up a significant portion of Australia\u2019s national carbon budget and \u201crequire a 60% reduction just to stay where we are, let alone moving towards zero\u201d. This would make it more difficult for Australia to satisfy its international agreements under the Paris agreement. But even under the low-activity scenario, Lowe found the yearly emissions created required would amount to half the yearly reduction under the state government\u2019s 2030 emissions reduction target. \u201cThe conclusion I came to is even a modest extraction of gas, would blow out of the water Queensland\u2019s stated emissions target,\u201d Lowe said. Under its plan to reach net zero by 2050, the government is aiming for a 30% emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. A government spokesperson insisted its emissions targets \u201care achievable\u201d and said it was working with industry to \u201cinvestigate ways to reduce fugitive emissions from resource activities, particularly in the Bowen Basin\u201d. \u201cThe channel country leases were required to be issued under previous legislation and are for exploration only \u2013 they are not for the production of petroleum or gas,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAny on ground exploration activities would require an Environmental Authority from the Department of Environment and Science, and an approval under the Regional Planning Interests Act, subject to stringent assessment criteria.\u201d The state government \u201cexpects industry to reduce emissions, including fugitive emissions\u201d and \u201cmore consultation will be done\u201d before permission was granted to Origin to develop its field. Origin was contacted for comment. The International Energy Agency suggested in May that limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant the exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ellie Smith, a spokesperson for Lock the Gate Alliance Queensland, which commissioned the report, said it showed the responsibility of meeting the 2030 emissions target was being left to other sectors of the economy. This was because \u201cat the moment in Queensland we have no direct regulation of emissions\u201d, Smith said. \u201cIt feels like the fossil fuel industry pushing to get as much gas out of the ground in the dying days of the industry. They know, we all know, it\u2019s the end of the fossil fuel industry. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they\u2019re just trying to push and push and push on every front, whether it\u2019s just Queensland, Northern Territory, WA, New South Wales \u2013 there\u2019s new development everywhere.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-20T11:00:04Z",
            "content": "The trees are not exactly imposing. Slim and spiny, with limbs that grip small poms of sharp leaves, they look like something a child might dream up. Or maybe Salvador Dal\u00ed. Even the name, Joshua tree, sounds kind of awkward. On a wet and chilly December morning, I stood at a makeshift encampment in the Mojave national preserve in San Bernardino county, California, listening as a group of strangers fretted over the trees\u2019 precarious future. Within the preserve is Cima Dome, a broad-sloping mound that, until recently, contained the densest Joshua tree forest in the world. That changed in August 2020, when a lightning storm ignited the Dome fire, which ripped through over 43,000 acres of Cima Dome and burned about 1.3m Joshua trees. Given that Joshua trees \u2013 which technically are not trees but a species of desert succulent \u2013 are native only to the south-western US, the Dome fire represented an outright disaster to their survival. Looking out that morning, I saw seemingly endless fields of the trees\u2019 scorched and tortured carcasses. This was a terrible harbinger of things to come: a 2019 Ecosphere journal study determined that, if carbon emissions stay at current levels, just 0.02% of the species would survive. The August 2020 Dome Fire in the Mojave national preserve burned more than 1m Joshua trees to varying degrees. Now, a year and a half later, a wide-ranging group of volunteers are working alongside the National Park Service, which manages the preserve, to replant Joshua trees. When I visited in early December, the plan was to plant 1,500 seedlings over the next several weeks. The 18 people spending their day (or days, in some cases) with the trees included civilians from all walks of life, members of the Arizona and Nevada Conservation Corps, and a group of women who brought along two pack camels to help carry baby Joshua trees through some of the more treacherous terrain. Joshua trees typically have a lifespan of 150 years; if all goes according to plan, these saplings will become a fixture of the preserve for a long, long time. Among those assembled was Brendan Cummings, the conservation director with the Center for Biological Diversity, a national non-profit focused on saving imperiled plants and animals. Tall and wiry with a thick head of salt and pepper hair and a pensive demeanor, Cummings is spearheading an attempt to list the tree under the state-level Endangered Species Act. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing could be the model for what climate restoration will look like,\u201d he told me on the phone a few weeks prior. In December 2021, a group of volunteers traveled to the Mojave national preserve to plant 1,500 eastern Joshua tree seedlings. Pictured: Volunteers Brendan Cummings, Avery Arp, Anthony Chesney and Nancy Fite. The threat isn\u2019t just wildfires. The climate crisis, invasive grasses and poor migration patterns for the trees\u2019 seeds all contribute to the species\u2019 imperilment. Human development \u2013 the trees have been cleared out to build anything from new neighborhoods to solar farms \u2013 isn\u2019t helping matters. Because the threats are so varied, it can be difficult to calculate exactly how many trees are in danger (something land developers love to point out). But Cummings believes that fact is beside the point. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know whether there were 500 passengers or 2,000 passengers on the Titanic to know that the entire population was threatened when they hit an iceberg,\u201d he said as we stood near the basecamp on that frigid winter day. A western Joshua tree in the Mojave Desert. About 40% of the western varietal is on private land that will probably be developed. After about an hour\u2019s wait \u2013 the camels were ultimately unwilling to saddle the load of supplies, \u201cliving up to the stereotype of being recalcitrant\u201d, as Cummings put it \u2013 the volunteers were split into small groups and directed to designated sites. There they would plant the spiky green seedlings that, if all went according to plan, would over the course of a few decades replace the blackened husks of trees that now line the landscape. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Though they look pretty similar, there are in fact two different species of Joshua trees: western and eastern. The majority of easterns are located on federal land and are not under threat by developers. Cummings\u2019 work as a conservationist focuses on the western variety. \u201cMost of the range of the eastern species is on federal land, which is never going to get bulldozed,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout 40% of western Joshua tree habitat is on private land, and most of that will ultimately get developed.\u201d A solar panel at the Antelope Valley solar ranch in the western Mojave Desert. Solar farms such as this one can contribute to the endangerment of Joshua trees because building them can require forests to be cleared out. Cummings\u2019 fight to save the western species picked up steam in September 2020, when the California fish and game commission accepted a petition he authored to offer endangered protections to Joshua trees for one year (since extended to May of 2022), during which the agency is conducting research into the plants\u2019 long-term viability. Those protections made it illegal to damage or remove Joshua trees without special permits. (That ban didn\u2019t apply to everyone: the commission approved an exemption allowing solar projects in Kern and San Bernardino counties to continue removing Joshua trees during construction.) \u201cAfter the commission receives the report, it can complete the process to make a final determination whether or not to list the Joshua tree as threatened or endangered under the California Endangered Species Act,\u201d said Rachel Ballanti, deputy executive director of California fish and game commission. Though temporary, the decision was still precedent-setting: it marked the first time a plant species was given protection as a result of a climate crisis threat. \u201cClimate change is creating a much hotter and much drier desert environment, and that is restricting species\u2019 ability to reproduce,\u201d said Cameron Barrows, one of the Ecosphere study\u2019s authors and an ecologist with the University of California, Riverside. In the case of Joshua trees, drought has left the soil too dry to sustain saplings. As a result, we\u2019re left with a species that skews quite old. It\u2019s sort of akin, as Barrows explained, to a community with a senior center but no elementary school: \u201cYou would immediately realize the community has a very short lifespan.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 This isn\u2019t Cummings\u2019 first conservation rodeo. He was also part of the successful push to get the polar bear listed as endangered under the Bush administration. Yet, all these years later, the bear is still on thin ice, with recent estimates warning the species could be wiped out by the end of the century. I asked Cummings if, given this fact, all the conversation around government protections really matter in the first place. He nodded his head in amusement; clearly he was expecting the question. Volunteers Brendan Cummings and Chris Clarke plant eastern Joshua tree saplings in the Mojave national preserve. \u201cIf you look at the modeling for say, polar bears in Alaska, if we halt global warming in the next 20 years, even in that optimistic scenario, polar bears have about an 80% chance of extinction,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if you reduce other threats that kill polar bears \u2013 oil development in their habitat in the Arctic Refuge, trophy hunting \u2013 the extinction risk drops from 80% down to about 50%. You have a significantly greater chance of a species surviving, if you can reduce those other threats.\u201d The same thing, he explained, applies to Joshua trees. It\u2019s not exactly a sunny outlook, but coming from a man who\u2019s dedicated his life to the preservation of the natural world, it\u2019s probably the most clear-eyed view we\u2019ve got. Map of Joshua tree planting sites at a basecamp in the Mojave national preserve. In the meantime, all he can do is dig. Crouching over a sapling, Cummings and the other volunteers were given a quick run-down on planting the dozen eastern babies they had been assigned: why, for example, it\u2019s important to build a berm around the sapling (it helps to retain water), or why only half of the saplings are encased by small chicken-wire cages (a maze of regulations prohibit the use of fencing, so they\u2019re conducting a mini-field experiment to evaluate whether the barriers will improve life expectancy). \u201cA lot of red tape to navigate,\u201d explained Nic Anderson, the unofficial supervisor and a researcher with the Great Basin Institute, an environmental group working closely with the National Park Service. Soon enough the volunteers were packing their infant plants into the soil, all under the mournful gaze of the thousands of burned Joshua trees. It was a hopeful sight, but also an eerie one: like witnessing a birth in a morgue. Left: Chris Clarke and Brendan Cummings place a chicken-wire cage around recently planted saplings. Right: A western Joshua tree in the west Mojave. I got to talking with volunteer Chris Clarke, an associate director with the National Parks Conservation Association, another environmental group. Clarke explained how the Dome fire didn\u2019t just impact the trees, but also the antelope squirrels that eat their seeds, and the ladder-backed woodpeckers that look for insects in their limbs. And the desert night lizards that seek shelter under their stumps. And tortoises. And jackrabbits. And cottontail rabbits. \u201cThere are lots of animals that depend on the Joshua tree forest for food,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe Joshua tree is really the linchpin of the ecosystem.\u201d After about two hours, the group had all 12 of their saplings firmly planted into the ground. By then the rain had picked up and temperatures had dipped into the 40s, and the caravans of tree-huggers decided to head back to base. It was a modest effort, and one that even in the best-case scenario, won\u2019t come to approaching the scale of devastation wrought by the Dome fire. But the process was therapeutic for the humans involved as much as it was restorative for the ecosystem. Park ranger Sierra Willoughby caresses the burned bark of a Joshua tree. And maybe the dead trees aren\u2019t so dead after all. Though the Mojave national preserve staff had initially believed every tree was dead, they\u2019d suddenly noticed a handful of natural new growths sprouting from the husks of the charred trees (though it\u2019s macabre, imagine a baby limb on a decaying corpse). As Cummings and I strolled through the forests near the basecamp, he couldn\u2019t help but eagerly point out any unexpected saplings. Even after 16 years living among the trees in the town of Joshua Tree, he\u2019s still amazed by them. \u201cYou walk through the burned Cima Dome and feel a little hopeless,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cBut dig a hole and plant a new tree in the ground and suddenly it feels a little less hopeless.\u201d"

            "content": "British companies have been urged to bolster their digital security over concerns of possible Russian cyber-attacks linked to the growing political crisis in Ukraine. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a part of the GCHQ intelligence agency, has updated its guidance telling firms to \u201cbuild resilience and stay ahead of potential threats\u201d. The NCSC said: \u201cUK organisations are being urged to bolster their cybersecurity resilience in response to malicious cyber-incidents in and around Ukraine.\u201d The NCSC said that although it was investigating malicious cyber-incidents in Ukraine, \u201cwhich are similar to a pattern of Russian behaviour seen before in previous situations\u201d, it was not aware of any \u201cspecific threats\u201d to UK organisations. The NCSC is concerned that businesses could be targeted after the UK, US and EU issued warnings to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, against attacking Ukraine after he deployed 100,000 troops on its borders. \u201cWhile we are unaware of any specific threats to UK organisations in relation to events in Ukraine, we are monitoring the situation closely and it is vital that organisations follow the guidance to ensure they are all resilient,\u201d said Paul Chichester, the director of operations at the NCSC. A cyber-attack on Ukraine government websites earlier this month warned the public to \u201cbe afraid and expect the worst\u201d, which Ukraine said was orchestrated by Russia. \u201cOver several years, we have observed a pattern of malicious Russian behaviour in cyberspace,\u201d Chichester said. \u201cLast week\u2019s incidents in Ukraine bear the hallmarks of similar Russian activity we have observed before.\u201d The guidance, which is primarily aimed at larger organisations, comes after the NCSC warned businesses in the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure \u2013 such as energy, water supply, transportation and telecommunications \u2013 about specific vulnerabilities Russian hackers have been known to exploit. Ukraine was subjected to a crippling Russian cyber-attack in 2017, dubbed the NotPetya attack, which wiped clean computers in the country but spilled over into systems around the world. It gained access to computers by hacking a widely used piece of tax reporting software in Ukraine, which also affected foreign companies based there and spilled over to more than 60 countries. The attack was nominally a piece of \u201cransomware\u201d \u2013 where affected targets are asked to pay a bitcoin ransom to unlock their hard drives \u2013 but there was in fact no way of decrypting the affected files, making it what is known as a \u201cwiper\u201d attack in industry jargon. Stuart McKenzie, a senior vice-president at US cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said that Russia would have planned any cyber offensive linked to a Ukraine conflict well in advance: \u201cRussia is very strategic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will have been strategically planned over a number of years.\u201d McKenzie said it was unlikely that a NotPetya-style attack would hit the UK. \u201cThe possibility of a wiper attack across the whole of the UK is incredibly unlikely. It is much more likely to be a strategic attack against limited targets.\u201d However, he said that the NotPetya attack appeared to show a lack of regard for collateral damage outside the targeted country. The malware caused an estimated $10bn of damage around the world, with the Danish shipping company Maersk among those affected, after reporting costs of up to $300m related to the attack. He said: \u201cI absolutely believe Russia will have strong strategic plans for what they are going to do but they don\u2019t know what the unintended consequences will be.\u201d"

A BOA spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve given athletes and staff practical advice so that they can make their own choice as to whether they take their personal devices to the Games, or not. Where they do not want to take their own equipment, we have provisioned temporary devices for them to use.\u201d The Dutch Olympic Committee*Dutch Sports Federation (NOC*NSF) has gone a step further by telling its athletes not to bring their personal mobile phones or laptops because it anticipates China may carry out surveillance on electronic devices during the Games. The Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said the NOC*NSF would give athletes and support staff phones and laptops which will be destroyed when they return home. NOC*NSF spokesperson Geert Slot declined to discuss specific cases but said cybersecurity was part of the risk assessment. \u201cThe importance of cybersecurity has grown over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut China has completely closed off its internet, which makes it a specific case.\u201d As at previous Olympics, Team GB athletes wanting to raise awareness of political issues during the event have been advised to discuss this with the BOA before doing so. However, athletes will be able to post on social media while in Beijing, with China allowing access to Twitter and Facebook for foreign athletes and journalists during the Games."

            "date": "2022-01-21T06:00:24Z",
            "content": "Members of a cross-party China human rights group have accused Britain\u2019s cybersecurity agency of \u201cfailing to respond\u201d with help after their website was taken offline this week in an attack they fear came from Beijing. MPs from the Inter Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac) said the incident took place on Tuesday, days after the group had said publicly it was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by reports that an Anglo-Chinese lawyer had been trying to improperly influence parliamentarians in the UK. They complained the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) did not engage or show interest in investigating the episode, the second time in under a year the website of the campaign group of international parliamentarians had been knocked out. Conservative MP Tim Loughton said: \u201cIt is unacceptable that the NCSC is failing to respond to reports of suspected cyber-attacks from Chinese state backed actors. The British government must be doing its utmost to protect parliamentarians and activists working on these issues from further attacks and intimidation.\u201d Ipac\u2019s website was taken offline for three hours by a denial of service attack \u2013 where a host is flooded with requests and can no longer function. But without any help from NCSC, Ipac will not be able determine who was behind it. Labour\u2019s Afzal Khan said: \u201cIn light of the cyber-attack and last week\u2019s events, it is clear that this government must act to ensure its cybersecurity is up to scratch. The government cannot ignore those at the sharp end of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s intimidation campaign.\u201d NCSC said it was aware of the denial of service attack, and had made contact with Ipac. As far it was aware the issue had been resolved. A spokesperson added that \u201cIpac have not directly raised any concerns about the NCSC\u2019s response to this issue but we would welcome any further engagement with them.\u201d Last week, MI5 took the rare step of issuing an \u201cinterference alert\u201d to MPs and peers, in which the spy agency accused a lawyer, Christine Lee, of seeking to improperly influence parliamentarians on behalf of China\u2019s ruling Communist party. Lee had been photographed meeting former prime minister David Cameron in 2015 and had given \u00a3584,177 to help fund the office of Labour MP and former shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner. Members of Ipac include legislators from the US, India, Japan, France and the UK, and the group aims to encourage democratic countries to give \u201cdue prominence to universal human rights\u201d in their dealings with China \u2013 and to insist that Beijing hold to the \u201cstandards of the international legal order\u201d. Beijing has responded with hostility. Five British members of the group and several more from the EU have been sanctioned by Beijing for speaking out about the treatment of the Uyghur Muslim minority, including Loughton and Labour peer Helena Kennedy. Last October, Ipac held a meeting on the margins of the G20 summit in Rome to protest against the presence of the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, and urge leaders not to let China off the hook over human rights abuses in return for cooperation on the climate crisis. China normally denies allegations of hacking or cyber interference, accusing the US and its allies of engaging in smear campaigns, although the topic is a subject of growing diplomatic and intelligence agency concern in the west."

            "title": "What your smart TV knows about you \u2013 and how to stop it harvesting data",
            "date": "2022-01-29T17:00:04Z",
            "content": "Watching TV feels like a benign pastime, but as all TVs become \u201csmart\u201d \u2013 connected to the internet via your router \u2013 they are gaining the ability to watch you too. As soon as you switch them on, smart TVs made by the likes of LG, Samsung and Sony are gathering data from the TV itself, as well as from the operating system and apps. Then there are the devices you plug into your TV, such as Google\u2019s Chromecast, Apple TV and Amazon\u2019s Fire Stick. A TV is no longer just a device for showing you content \u2013 it has become a two-way mirror allowing you to be observed in real time by a network of advertisers and data brokers, says Rowenna Fielding, director of data protection consultancy Miss IG Geek. \u201cThe purpose of this is to gather as much information as possible about your behaviour, interests, preferences and demographics so it can be monetised, mainly through targeted advertising.\u201d Smart TV spying is difficult to avoid. A study by researchers at Northeastern University and Imperial College London found data from TVs and smart devices was sent to Google\u2019s ad business and to Netflix, even if people didn\u2019t have Netflix. What does your smart TV know about you? The data collected by your smart TV depends on its manufacturer, brand and version. In theory, most smart TVs are capable of collecting audio, video and TV usage data, says Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at cybersecurity company Darktrace. Voice activation is one feature with the potential to gather large amounts of data. Microphones and software are listening for instructions and they can capture conversations and other sounds within range. These recordings might be sent to third parties to be analysed. Cross-device tracking is another issue to consider. Data collected via your smart TV is more valuable when combined with information from other smart devices such as mobile phones, laptops and home automation gear, according to Fielding. \u201cThis allows individuals to be profiled in detail: geo-location history, web browsing activity and social media information can be added to TV data.\u201d Then there are the cookies and trackers. Apps and browsers on smart TVs use cookie- and pixel-tracking technologies just like websites do to track, recognise and identify devices for user-profiling. \u201cMost apps installed on your smart TV will be snitching to a large network of advertisers and data brokers,\u201d Fielding warns. What does your TV do with the data? There is no clear-cut answer. What exactly is done with the data is complex and \u201chighly opaque\u201d, says Lewis. \u201cWhen looking at what a smart TV does on the network, it is often unclear why certain data is being harvested and where it is being sent.\u201d There is not much difference between TV brands. Manufacturers claim to use your information for \u201cpersonalisation\u201d and quality of content, but it is common to sell this type of data, anonymised or semi-anonymised, to third parties, advertising companies or streaming services. \u201cAfter the data has been sold, it is out of the manufacturer\u2019s control,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cIt is often unclear what data exactly is being sent back, depending on the T&amp;Cs and privacy settings, and it can be very difficult to change default settings once you have agreed to them.\u201d How streaming services are also gathering data Using streaming services on a smart TV is another surefire way to hand over lots of your personal data. Apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Now TV tend to claim they only use data for necessary services such as recommendations or credit checks. But this can include data such as device identifiers, geo-location, browser type, email address and payment information. Netflix\u2019s powerful recommendations algorithm fuels the quality of its service by helping you choose which shows to watch. If you log on to Netflix via your browser, you can tweak the privacy settings to limit the data that\u2019s collected and shared. Yet most of the data Netflix gathers, such as the shows you watched and when, is so core to its service that you can\u2019t opt out of it. What is automatic content recognition or ACR? Back to the smart TV itself. One scary feature to look out for is automated content recognition (ACR). Often turned on by default, this uses analytical techniques to identify video and audio running on the TV, matching it against a big database to identify what\u2019s being played. It\u2019s pretty creepy stuff \u2013 ACR works on anything played on the TV including DVDs and Blu-rays, CDs and games. Viewing data and habits are shared with manufacturers and ultimately sold to advertisers in order to target you with ads, says Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at security company ESET. When your TV is connected to your home router, data will include your IP address and location too, he adds. And in theory, ACR could be used for even more unsettling profiling, says Lewis. \u201cWith the analytical technologies available, data from facial recognition, sentiment analysis, speech-to-text and content analysis could be gathered to build an in-depth picture of an individual user.\u201d Instead of matching content against a list of known movies, ACR could in theory be analysed for political position, ethnicity, socioeconomic position and other things that could be abused in the wrong hands, Lewis says. Should you use your TV as a browser or your smartphone as a TV remote? Using the browser on your TV might be convenient, but it\u2019s a major attack target for hackers. This is because your smart TV browser lacks the antivirus and additional security settings built into your smartphone or PC. \u201cCyber-attackers can eavesdrop on the browser\u2019s traffic and compromise the cookies that manage authentication to online services, such as social media accounts or online banking, and impersonate people,\u201d says Dr Francisco Navarro, a senior lecturer at De Montfort University\u2019s Cyber Security Centre in Leicester. But in contrast, experts say using your smartphone as a TV remote is fine. Just be mindful that connecting to a smart TV with a mobile will be done via Bluetooth or across the network, says James Griffiths, cofounder and technical director at security consultancy Cyber Security Associates. \u201cIf the smart TV was hacked, it might be used to attack your mobile device, but the risk of this happening is low.\u201d Protect yourself from smart TV spying As long as they are connected to the internet, smart TVs will collect data and you can\u2019t stop this from happening altogether. In many instances it\u2019s not in your interests to do so as it will affect your viewing experience \u2013 take Netflix\u2019s useful recommendations features as an example. Yet there are some basic measures you can take to protect yourself from smart TV spying. Turn off ACR in the settings, disable personalisation, opt out of all advertising features and cover or disable cameras and microphones. It\u2019s also important to make sure your router is protected by changing the password and setting up a guest network. You can improve security by opting out of web tracking when it\u2019s offered and applying software updates as soon as they\u2019re available."

            "date": "2022-01-03T21:40:45Z",
            "content": "Tuesday marks the end of an era: BlackBerry will discontinue service on its classic smartphones. So for those still holding on to their QWERTY keyboards, be warned. In a 22 December statement, the company reminded users of the development, which will affect services for all of its devices not running on Android software, including the BlackBerry 10, 7.1 OS and earlier. \u201cAs of this date, devices running these legacy services and software through either carrier or Wi-Fi connections will no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality,\u201d the statement says. Boasting a physical keyboard and BBM instant messaging, the BlackBerry was once a powerplayer in the cell phone world. In the first decade of the 2000s, the devices were toted with pride by white-collar professionals and then-President Barack Obama alike. At its peak in 2009 and 2010, BlackBerry owned nearly 20% of the global smartphone market \u2013 with an even higher percentage in the US \u2013 selling more than 50m smartphones a year. But with the rise of the iPhone and Android touchscreen devices, the phone eventually fell out of style. And unless it warrants a reboot like the T-Mobile Sidekick or Motorola Razr, it seems that BlackBerry\u2019s moment in the sun has passed. When the iPhone first launched in June 2007, it didn\u2019t immediately overtake BlackBerry\u2019s reign. With an elite status and user-friendly reputation, businesspeople especially, stayed loyal to the product. BlackBerry\u2019s BBM instant messaging system also remained a user favorite feature, boasting the same cachet and ease of iMessage today. Soon, though, BlackBerry\u2019s technology fell behind and users began to make the move away from physical keyboards. BlackBerry launched a series of poorly received devices as the iPhone leveled up and Androids became viable alternatives. After the release of the iPhone 4, Apple\u2019s phone sales passed BlackBerry\u2019s for good. By the time BlackBerry\u2019s technology began to catch up, it was out of fashion. Working professionals, one of BlackBerry\u2019s core customer bases, began to make the switch to iPhones and Androids. In September 2012, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer snubbed the devices by asking that employees transition \u201cfrom BlackBerries to smartphones\u201d. By 2016, BlackBerry announced it would outsource its product and no longer manufacture its own phones. Instead, the company made a move to pivot into software, similar to Nokia, another former cellular giant. Today, BlackBerry bills itself primarily as \u201can enterprise software and cybersecurity company\u201d developing software solutions for corporations. The company still employs thousands of workers and pulled in about a billion dollars in revenue in 2020, according to Statista."

            "date": "2022-01-12T14:47:30Z",
            "content": "Schools going virtual, airlines canceling flights, pharmacies and testing centers closing temporarily, shelves emptying in grocery stores because of transportation delays, blood donations dropping to crisis levels for the first time ever and the country\u2019s hospitals are becoming stretched. This is the US in the grip of the Omicron variant. Omicron may cause milder symptoms in some people, but its effects are ricocheting throughout America and creating some of the greatest challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe have supply shortages, we have transportation shortages, that are a result of people being out because of Covid, and especially Omicron being so infectious. And that is obviously limiting the workforce, and limiting the workforce is creating some of the havoc that we\u2019re all experiencing,\u201d said Ezekiel Emanuel, vice-provost at the University of Pennsylvania. Joe Biden has vowed to keep businesses and schools open, but some experts wonder if that\u2019s possible given the nature of Omicron and the lack of adequate measures to combat it. \u201cThe economy cannot stay open and schools cannot stay open when so many people are getting sick,\u201d said Margaret Thornton, an educational researcher at Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. \u201cWe must take action to slow the spread in order to keep schools running, to keep businesses running,\u201d she said \u2013 but much of that action has been slow to happen. In order to control Omicron and future surges, officials need to rely on tried-and-true tactics, from testing to high-quality masks and better ventilation, say some health experts. \u201cWe now have tools such as N95 masks, vaccines, treatments and rapid diagnostics to help prevent infection and reduce severity of illness,\u201d said Rick Bright, CEO of the Pandemic Prevention Institute at the Rockefeller Foundation and a former official for the US Department of Health. \u201cHowever, we need to do more to make them affordable and available to everyone, with clear guidance on when and how to use them most effectively.\u201d Facing an astronomical rise in cases and hospitalizations, health systems have been slammed. Omicron comes on the heels of a devastating Delta wave in the fall and existing staff and supply shortages, with little opportunity to recover. The seven-day average of infections in the US is now running at more than 750,000 cases, far higher than during Delta\u2019s peak. \u201cIt was back-to-back,\u201d said Jorge Moreno, assistant professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s affecting every section of healthcare.\u201d Health workers have spoken out on social media about being asked to volunteer to restock supplies and answer phones, or to volunteer in housekeeping, food service and transportation. One resident physician was reportedly asked to work as a scrub tech \u2013 a job they never trained for, and were not paid for. Meanwhile, nurses in New York are stretched so thin, there are parts of facilities where no one is scheduled to monitor patients. Hospitals in some parts of the country are allowing staff to continue working with positive cases without isolating at all. There was an outbreak among patients in a Rhode Island hospital shortly after Covid-positive workers were asked to return, although a hospital spokesperson said there was no connection. \u201cWe can have an empty bed, but if there\u2019s not a nurse to manage it or even a doctor to manage it, there\u2019s no way to manage the patient. So we\u2019re really in a crunch,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cWe\u2019re bursting right now at the seams\u201d \u2013 and since hospitalizations lag by a week or two behind cases, the worst is still to come, he said. Hospitals across the nation may already be more full than official numbers suggest. In Maryland, hospitals are 87% full, according to official reports \u2013 but in reality they are closer to or exceeding 100% capacity, according to an analysis. There are also fewer hospitals now than when the pandemic began, particularly in rural areas. In 2020, 19 rural hospitals closed \u2013 the most in one year since 2005, when data first began being collected. Omicron is also responsible for staff shortages in nursing homes. That leads to facilities limiting the number of new patient admissions \u2013 and a backup in hospitals among patients who could transition to a lower level of care. Childcare facilities are also facing rising cases and staff shortages. Daycares were already strained, with some centers losing up to 90% of workers as of December. According to Cindy Lehnhoff, director of the National Childcare Association, \u201ccatastrophic\u201d shortages have hit about 80% of centers across the country, leading to closures and long wait lists. Schools have also struggled to remain in-person. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s complete chaos,\u201d Thornton said. In Philadelphia, for example, 98 schools have now gone virtual, she said. \u201cThere truly are just not enough grownups who are well enough to be in the building.\u201d Leaders have \u201cgotten the reasoning backwards\u201d on keeping schools open, she said. \u201cThis administration has said they prioritize schools because of the economy, in order to get parents back to work. And I think that\u2019s just a really backward approach. We need to prioritize schools because they\u2019re important to kids.\u201d In schools, there are proven ways to reduce the spread of any variant. The measures just need to be taken, Thornton said. These measures include well-run remote options for those who want them in order to reduce classroom sizes and reduce exposure risks. Regular testing, where families opt in instead of opting out, would make a huge difference, as well as providing guidance on what to do if you test positive. Making sure that all students have high-quality masks is also essential, Thornton said. \u201cKeeping schools open and the economy running is very important and a real challenge with so much of society getting sick over the next few weeks,\u201d Bright said. \u201cI believe we can do so safely. However, we need to follow the science, use the tools at our disposal and use the tools we have appropriately. \u201cThe reality is that Covid-19 is not going away anytime soon. We need to move from crisis to control,\u201d he said. Bright and Emanuel both outlined steps the administration could take to reach its goals, including measures such as expanding testing, vaccines and medication, and rebuilding trust in public health. \u201cWe are going to have a rocky next two or three weeks,\u201d Emanuel said. But if measures can be put in place, it would have an enormous effect. And whatever measures are put in place now will help address future surges, Bright said. \u201cI believe the next variant is already lurking among us now, which makes it all the more critical that we get ahead and stop it before it has the chance to spread like Omicron did.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 24 January 2022. An earlier version indicated that in Rhode Island a policy of allowing hospital staff who test positive to continue working without isolating had led to an outbreak among patients. The hospital in question has said there was no connection between the asymptomatic Covid-positive workers and the Covid outbreak in patients."

            "title": "Markets rebound as US economy records fastest growth since 1984 \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2022-01-27T17:41:06Z",
            "content": "Time to wrap up, with Reuters\u2019 latest take on today\u2019s strong US GDP report: The U.S. economy notched its strongest growth in nearly four decades in 2021 after the government injected trillions of dollars in COVID-19 relief, and is seen soldiering on this year despite headwinds from the pandemic, strained supply chains as well as high inflation. The Commerce Department\u2019s report on Thursday showed the economy accelerating in the fourth quarter as businesses replenished depleted inventories to meet strong demand for goods. Last year\u2019s robust growth supports the Federal Reserve\u2019s pivot towards raising interest rates in March. The sharp rebound in growth last year could offer some cheer for President Joe Biden whose popularity is falling amid a stalled domestic economic agenda after the U.S. Congress failed to pass his signature $1.75 trillion Build Back Better legislation. It, however, could diminish prospects of more money from the government. The government pumped nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief. \u201cWhile Omicron will lead to weaker growth in the first quarter, activity is expected to rebound nicely once the latest pandemic wave abates and supply-chain glitches ease,\u201d said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. \u201cThe Fed will need to be \u2018humble and nimble\u2019 as it navigates underlying economic strength, worsening labor shortages, and stubbornly high inflation.\u201d The economy grew 5.7% in 2021, the strongest since 1984. It contracted 3.4% in 2020, the biggest drop in 74 years. The stunning reversal came as gross domestic product increased at a 6.9% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. That followed a 2.3% growth pace in the third quarter. Here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories too: Here\u2019s Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, on the latest US growth figures, and the highlights from today\u2019s financial results: \u201cAnd despite higher than forecast US GDP figures it\u2019s impossible not to consider the factors that propelled the country to those heights. Firstly, we can\u2019t forget where the country had been during the first Covid pummelling, secondly, all that stimulus lubricating the wheels is going to start to disappear which is why growth is forecast to slow considerably. And that\u2019s the bit investors need to focus on, where economies are going and not just where they\u2019ve been. \u201cAnd looking through some of today\u2019s earnings updates both in the UK and the US, there\u2019s good news and then there\u2019s bad. Mastercard\u2019s profits were given a nice nudge thanks to the return of the traveller, a universal factor which also helped EasyJet which reported surging forward bookings. But cost pressures and supply issues are still continuing to dog businesses of all kinds. UK drinks maker Fevertree and US chip maker Intel Corp saw shares fall after both warned those lingering issues will impact profits in the near term. \u201cIt\u2019s something burger slinger McDonald\u2019s has first-hand knowledge of, but as with all investments, there\u2019s no one size fits all. Though shares fell after the market opened, they did recover slightly. Many of the factors which weighed down those golden arches have now been resolved and the buying power of the fast-food giant coupled with its brand loyalty and low-cost offer should put it on a better footing this quarter. Wall Street\u2019s volatility index has dipped today, as trading calmed down after some rather rocky sessions: In the City, shares have ended the day higher with the FTSE 100 index up 85 points at 7554, up 1.1% today. Banks and mining companies posted gains, along with online grocery tech company Ocado (which yesterday announced it had developed \u201cgame-changed\u201d robots to allow cheaper, faster deliveries). The strong US growth figures lifted European markets higher, after coming under pressure this morning. Germany\u2019s DAX gained 0.4%, while France\u2019s CAC finished 0.6% higher, shrugging off earlier worries about rising US interest rates. David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital, says the fear that was running through the markets faded. Bargain hunters stepped into the fold, and now the DAX, the FTSE 100 and the CAC are have finished higher on the day. It is similar scene in the US, where the S&amp;P 500 is up over 0.8%. Earlier, it was announced the US economy grew by 6.9% in the final quarter of 2021, which easily beat the 5.3% forecast that economists were expecting. The reading was a sharp rise on the 2.3% growth was that seen in the third quarter of last year. This is clearly good news for the health of the US economy, while it strengthens the case for an aggressive tightening policy from the Federal Reserve. The fact that US stocks are higher despite the solid GDP reading could be a sign that dealers are getting used to the idea there could easily be four or five rate hikes this year. Despite the recovery, US home sales dropped in December as a lack of supply hit the market. Contracts to buy US previously owned homes fell by 3.8% last month, with the inventory of properties on the market at record lows. Pending home sales fell in all four regions. Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors (NAR), explains: \u201cPending home sales faded toward the end of 2021, as a diminished housing supply offered consumers very few options.\u201d The US economy could continue to recover this quarter, as the surge in Omicron cases falls back, says Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \u201cMuch of the strong growth in fourth quarter GDP was due to businesses building up inventories, and the numbers indicate consumer spending slowed in December either because of Omicron or because spending was frontloaded in October and November as holiday shoppers feared shortages. With the Omicron wave falling quickly, shelves restocked and consumer demand generally strong, we should see the economy continue its healthy recovery this quarter.\u201d Back in the UK, the government wants to reverse a controversial privatisation deal by seeking to wrest ownership of 38,000 homes in the Ministry of Defence housing portfolio from the billionaire private equity boss Guy Hands. The move is expected to lead to a legal battle between the MoD and Hands\u2019 private equity firm Terra Firma over whether the government can take back full ownership of the homes. In 1996, under the defence secretary Michael Portillo, the Conservative government sold 57,400 houses used by military service men and women and their families to Annington Homes for \u00a31.7bn in a sale and leaseback deal. In one swoop, Annington became the biggest residential property owner in England and Wales. The MoD rented back the homes on a 200-year lease at a discount but also agreed to pay for their maintenance and refurbishment. The value of the properties has ballooned under Annington\u2019s ownership to many times their original purchase price, meaning the taxpayer has missed out on any profits from the property boom. They were valued by Annington at \u00a37.6bn last year, while their vacant possession value is estimated at \u00a310bn. The MoD is paying about \u00a3180m a year in rent plus \u00a3140m in repairs and upgrades. Terra Firma, which purchased Annington from Nomura Holdings for \u00a33.2bn in 2012, said it would challenge the MoD\u2019s move, and that it expected to win in what it predicted would be a \u201cvery long and very expensive\u201d court case. At the time of the deal the MoD hoped to free up cash for renovation as the homes were falling apart. However, the National Audit Office concluded in a 2018 review that taxpayers were between \u00a32.2bn and \u00a34.2bn worse off as a result of the arrangement. The NAO said the MoD had \u201clost out on billions of pounds\u2019 worth of increases in asset values, while Annington has made a significantly higher return on its investment than expected\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: Although 5.7% annual growth is certainly strong, it does follow a torrid 2020, which saw the downturn since the second world war. That creates a strong \u2018base effect\u2019, as the relaxing of restrictions allows growth to recover. But having said that, the US has recovered faster than other G7 nations, regaining its pre-Covid size by the middle of last year. Intel\u2019s shares are being pummelled after the semiconductor maker issued a lower-than-expected profit forecast. Intel have dropped 7%, despite the company reporting record quarterly earnings last night. Traders are disappointed that Intel forecast first-quarter earnings per share of 80 cents, compared to an expectation of 86 cents. Chief executive Patrick Gelsinger warned that supply chain constraints would continue this year, and into next year as the \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d for chips continued. Intel is also spending heavily on new capacity and improving its production technology, after Gelsinger - a Silicon Valley pioneer - rejoined Intel as CEO last year. Those investments could help it challenge rival AMD better, but will also weigh on profitability. Today\u2019s higher-than-expected GDP figures suggest the US economy is in a strong position to handle higher interest rates, argues Josie Dent, managing economist at the CEBR. Indeed, yesterday [Fed chair Jerome] Powell acknowledged that the economy is in a much stronger position than the last time the Fed tried to increase interest rates, with a low unemployment rate and strong output growth. Overall, Cebr is forecasting 3.8% growth in GDP in the US in 2022 as the recovery from 2020\u2019s contraction slows.\u201d The markets are now pricing in five increases in US interest rates this year, after Powell made it clear that the Fed would act to bring down inflation, which hit a 40-year high of 7% last month. President Biden has tweeted that last year\u2019s 5.7% growth shows his economic policies are working: Wall Street has jumped, as investors hail the faster-than-expected acceleration in US growth in the last quarter. Stocks are higher in early trading, despite concerns that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates aggressively to tame inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen by 337 points, or 1%, to 34,505 points. Chemicals producer Dow Inc (+4.9%), Microsoft (+2.1%), Nike (+2.1%) and Salesforce.com (+1.9%) are leading the risers. The broader S&amp;P 500 index has jumped by 1.2%, recovering some of its recent losses. Neil Birrell, chief investment officer &amp; fund manager at Premier Miton Diversified Growth Fund, says \u201cA raft of US economic data has shown that the economy is in robust health. The GDP data came in higher than expected for Q4 and jobless claims were a bit lower than expected. There can be little doubt that the Fed needs to act, but we know that already, it\u2019s all about the speed and the scale of the policy move. Markets are struggling to digest the macro environment at the moment, and it is likely to drive asset prices, even through the reporting season.\u201d The strong US recovery shows the value of the huge fiscal and monetary pandemic stimulus packages, says Claudia Sahm, director of macroeconomic research at the Jain Family Institute. The U.S. economy grew last year at the fastest pace since Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. Today\u2019s GDP report shows the economy expanded by 5.7% during 2021, as growth bounced back from the shock of the pandemic. Government and central bank stimulus packages supported consumer spending and businesses, while vaccine rollouts have helped firms to reopen and rehire staff. It\u2019s the strongest calendar-year growth since the US gross domestic product \u2014 its total output of goods and services \u2014 surged by 7.2% in 1984. It\u2019s a strong recovery from 2020, when the US economy had shrunk by 3.4% as Covid-19 rocked the US and global economy. Associated Press reports. The economy ended the year by growing at a solid 6.9% annual pace from October through December, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Squeezed by inflation and still gripped by COVID-19 caseloads, the economy is expected to keep expanding this year, though at a slower pace. Many economists have been downgrading their forecasts for the current January-March quarter, reflecting the impact of the omicron variant. For all of 2022, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the nation\u2019s GDP growth will slow to 4% for 2022. Today\u2019s GDP figures surpass expectations and suggest that the U.S. economy is accelerating faster than anticipated, says Richard Flynn, Managing Director at Charles Schwab UK. That may put more pressure on prices (which could spur the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates more quickly). Flynn says: There is a heightened risk that an overheating economy could push inflation even higher. With booming growth, the tight labour market is pushing up wages, and inflation has spiked to its highest level in decades. Real interest rates, adjusted for inflation, have been steeply negative for the past few years, contributing to very loose financial conditions. \u201cDespite a strong performance in Q4, the unfortunate reality is that U.S. economic performance continues to be driven by the pandemic. Today\u2019s figures measure GDP up until the end of December 2021, excluding some of the recent surges in COVID-19 cases. Indeed, there\u2019s been weakness across U.S. stock indices in the first weeks of 2022, as investors digest some of the risks facing the economy: receding monetary and fiscal liquidity, persistent effects from the pandemic, and a rise in inflationary pressures.\u201d The US economic recovery picked up speed in the final quarter of the year. GDP rose by 1.7% in the October-December quarter, or at an annualised rate of 6.9%. That\u2019s much stronger than the 2.3% annualised growth recorded in July-September, and faster than expected. The acceleration of growth in the fourth quarter was led by an upturn in exports as well as accelerations in inventory investment and consumer spending, the GDP report says. It says: The increase in exports of goods was widespread, and the leading contributors were consumer goods, industrial supplies and materials, and foods, feeds, and beverages. The increase in exports of services was led by travel. Consumer spending, or personal consumption, grew by 3.3% during the quarter, up from 2% in Q3, while business investment rose by 2%. Inventories surged as firms stocked up on goods to meet high demand, and to protect themselves from the supply chain crisis. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit has dropped. There were 260,000 new \u2018initial claims\u2019 filed last week, a drop of 30,000 compared with the previous week. It suggests demand for labor remained strong this month, with workers keen to hold onto staff. Wall Street futures have pushed higher, with the S&amp;P 500 index now expected to rise around 0.4% when trading begins in an hour. As this chart shows, it\u2019s been a choppy week! Indian tech company Ola has announced plans to invest \u00a3100m in the UK to open a research and development facility for a planned electric car, in a significant boost to the British automotive industry. Ola launched its taxi app that rivals Uber in cities including London, Birmingham and Cardiff in 2018, but it is pushing into electric vehicles with a recently launched road-going scooter and a planned electric car. The new facility will be based in Coventry, the traditional West Midlands centre of the UK automotive industry. It will create 200 jobs in design and engineering. Workers at the plant will also research battery technology. Ola was founded in India in 2010 by Bhavish Aggarwal, and it now claims to be the world\u2019s third-largest ride-hailing app. This week its electric vehicle arm, Ola Electric, raised $200m in funding at a reported $5bn (\u00a33.7bn) valuation \u2013 previous backers include Softbank, the major Japanese technology investor. It is also reportedly planning a stock market float to raise as much as $2bn. Oil is trading at fresh seven-year highs today, amid concerns that the Ukraine crisis could disrupt energy markets. Brent crude has risen to $90.64 per barrel, having hit the $90/barrel mark yesterday for the first time since 2014. The energy team at SP Angel say: Crude prices surged on Wednesday, with Brent climbing to US$90/bbl for the first time in seven years, amid tensions between Ukraine and Russia, the world\u2019s second-largest oil producer, that have fanned fears of energy supply disruptions to Europe OPEC+ has also missed its planned supply increase target in December, highlighting capacity constraints that are limiting supply as global demand recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic The FT\u2019s Colby Smith has a good take on last night\u2019s Federal Reserve press conference, where America\u2019s top central banker took a tough line on fighting inflation: Jay Powell had always said that if inflation was in danger of spiralling out of control, the Federal Reserve would be willing to bring out the hammer to knock prices down. On Wednesday, in his most hawkish press conference since the start of the pandemic, the chair of the Fed gave the clearest signal yet that such a moment was fast approaching. \u201cPowell essentially said to the markets and the economy, \u2018put on your seatbelt, we are getting ready to take off\u2019,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citigroup and a former under-secretary at the US Treasury. \u201cIf inflation doesn\u2019t fall as they expect, the Fed is prepared to be vigorous.\u201d The Fed\u2019s drive towards tighter policy was apparent not just from what Powell said about the path forward for monetary policy, but also what he refused to divulge about the US central bank\u2019s plans for interest rates later this year. \u201cPowell was distinctly not willing to rule out more frequent [or] larger rate hikes,\u201d Sheets said. More here: \u2018No more Mr Nice Guy\u2019: Fed chair signals tougher stance on inflation UK retailers have suffered weak January sales, as the Omicron variant kept people away from the shops over the festive period. Retail sales were poor for the time of year for the first time since September, according to the CBI\u2019s latest Distributive Trades Survey. A net balance of 23% of retailers said trading was below normal, the weakest reading since March. The poll took place between 22 December and 18 January, when Covid-19 cases were surging, and Plan B restrictions meant many people were working from home. But..... sales are expected to remain below seasonal norms in February, with the cost of living squeeze likely to leave people with less to spend in the shops. Ben Jones, Lead Economist at the CBI, says: \u201cIt was not surprising that retail sales dropped back below seasonal norms in January, given the spread of Omicron, the reintroduction of restrictions late last year and increased consumer caution. \u201cEven as cases fall and Omicron-related restrictions are rowed back, retailers will be looking to the year ahead with a degree of concern. The sector faces an inflation double whammy, as rising energy and transport costs erode households\u2019 spending power and retailers\u2019 own costs continue to mount. \u201cIt is vital that the Government comes forward with measures to protect the most vulnerable consumers, who will struggle the most with anticipated price rises.\u201d Retailers also reported that their stock levels were too low, as the supply chain crisis continues to hamper deliveries: Economic activity appears to have picked up in the UK last week, as firms try to recover from the shock of Omicron. Retail footfall in the UK increased by 2%, to 80% of the level seen in the equivalent week of 2019. Visits to high streets rose by 4%, as more shoppers ventured out as Covid-19 cases fell from recent record highs. People spent more, with credit and debit card purchases rising 2% last week. Restaurants saw a welcome increase in customers too, after the usually busy Christmas period was wiped out by Omicron. The number of UK seated diners increased by 5 percentage points in the week to Monday, to 97% of its pre-pandemic levels. But many businesses are still reeling from a drop in trading this month. A third reported that their turnover had decreased compared with normal expectations for this time of year, with over half blaming the pandemic. Firms are also short of workers, the ONS adds: In mid-January 2022, 13% of businesses reported a shortage of workers; the accommodation and food service activities industry reported the highest percentage (28%), with 60% of these businesses reporting that employees are now working increased hours because of the shortages. Sterling has hit a one-month low against the US dollar, as expectations of US interest rate rises push up the greenback. The pound dipped below $1.34 for the first time since 27th December, down half a cent today. After last night\u2019s hawkish press conference from the Fed, the dollar has strengthened. It\u2019s hit its highest level since July 2020 against a basket of currencies. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: The Fed gave the green light to lifting rates in March but chose to keep on with asset purchases until them, rather than ending them sooner. Quantitative tightening \u2013 reducing the balance sheet \u2013 will come some time later. The hawkishness came from Jay Powell in the press conference. He stressed that the economy and labour market are in much better shape than in 2015, the last hiking cycle. Powell dropped some remarks that can only lead us to think the Fed is minded to raise rates more aggressively than the dots and markets had thought. \u201cI think there\u2019s quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labour market,\u201d he said. Powell didn\u2019t rule out hiking every meeting, pointing to as many as seven 25bps hikes this year. Dario Perkins of City firm TS Lombard tweets: Posh mixer maker Fevertree has warned that costs will rise faster than expected this year. Shares in Fevertree have dropped almost 7% this morning, after it reported that cost headwinds in 2022 will be more significant than it had anticipated. Fevertree, which makes a range of tonic waters and sodas plus ginger beer and lemonade, grew its sales by 23% last year, including 33% growth in the US, in the face of \u201cunprecedented macro uncertainty and supply chain disruption\u201d. CEO Tim Warrillow cautioned that restrictions at hospitality venues could weigh on growth, even though there\u2019s less disruption than in 2021: The Group continues to deliver impressive growth in every one of our key markets, however, I am of course mindful that short-term logistics challenges and cost pressures remain, along with On-Trade restrictions, albeit at a much lower level than this time last year. Home drinking and cocktail making boosted Fevertree, though. It reports a good performance from \u2018off-trade\u2019 (sales in supermarket etc) as at-home consumption and interest in premium long mixed drinks becomes increasingly established. Saga, the travel and insurance group specialising in products and holidays for over-50s, has joined easyJet (see earlier post) in reporting a bounce back in bookings -- lifting optimism for a recovery this summer. Saga said it has seen strong bookings for its cruises in the period from 1 August to 26 January. The company said that for this 2022/2023 financial year, which runs from 27 January, cruises have a booking load factor of 86% in its first half and 73% for the full year. Euan Sutherland, chief executive of Saga, says: \u201cWhile Omicron has impacted travel bookings through December and January, our outlook for cruises in 2022/2023 and beyond is positive.\u201d The company said that the cruises operation produced profits on an adjusted basis in the period to 26 January, but a pre-tax loss of \u00a345m to \u00a350m. Here\u2019s the full story: While other markets are struggling, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has now popped into positive territory. The blue-chip index is 24 points higher, up 0.3%, while Germany (-0.5%) and France (-0.35%) are still lower after big losses in Asia overnight. Banks and mining companies are leading the charge, including Standard Chartered (+4.5%), HSBC (+2.8%), Rio Tinto (+2.1%) and Barclays (+1.8%), along with packaging firm DS Smith (+1.4%). The London market cops a lot of flack for its old-economy focus (it was dubbed Jurassic Park last year, for its lack of innovative technology companies and its focus on dividends over growth). But the current move away from innovative but unprofitable tech firms is working in the Footsie\u2019s favour, after Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell failed to stop January\u2019s market rout. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, points out that the FTSE 100 is outperforming other indices so far this year (it\u2019s up 1.5%, while the US S&amp;P 500 is down over 8%). \u201cIt\u2019s what Powell didn\u2019t say that troubled investors. The key concerns are how aggressive the Fed will be with raising rates \u2013 will they go up at every meeting this year, and will they go up by more than 0.25 percentage points each time? \u201cPowell said the central bank would be guided by the data and so growing investor fears that the Fed might be quite aggressive in its efforts to curb inflation remain intact as there was no clarity on exactly what would happen and when. \u201cThe only thing we can really take from the Fed\u2019s latest meeting is that interest rates are almost certainly going to go up in March. \u201cOnce again, the FTSE 100 was an outlier among global markets, with 2022 proving to be quite a year for the underdog. For the past decade the UK market has been like the last child to picked for a team in gym class, no-one having faith in its abilities for fear it wouldn\u2019t perform well. But the FTSE 100 is now one of the best performing major markets this year on a relative basis. \u201cFor once, investors are eager to own the FTSE\u2019s \u2018old economy\u2019 companies in banking, tobacco and oil, as these are value stocks which are once again in fashion.\u201d Electricals retailer AO World is reviewing its operations in Germany, as rising costs and the relaxation of lockdown rules hit sales. AO\u2019s revenues in Germany fell by 24% year-on-year in the last quarter, twice as fast as in the UK. It has now launched a strategic review of the German business, which it says is facing several challenges, including rising competition and supply chain problems: Our German business is being significantly impacted by a number of recent material changes to the local trading environment: competition in the online market has intensified whilst online penetration has returned to pre-pandemic levels; digital marketing costs have substantially increased against pre-pandemic levels; and supply remains constrained. We expect these trends will continue for the foreseeable future in the German market. Shares in AO have dropped 2.7% to 103p. Back at the start of 2021 they were worth over \u00a34, after a surge in demand from locked-down customers. Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund has reported a 14.5% return for last year, helped by the boom in technology shares. Norway\u2019s Government Pension Fund Global, which invests the profits from Norway\u2019s North Sea oil boom, achieved a return of 1,580bn kroner (\u00a3133bn) in 2021. That lifted the fund\u2019s value at the end of last year to 12,340bn kroner, or just over \u00a31trn. Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management which oversees the fund, says the stock market boom last year boosted its returns. \u201cThe good results are mainly due to very strong developments in the equity market throughout the year. There was good return in all sectors, but the investments in technology and financials performed particularly well. The investments in technology returned an impressive 30.2 percent.\u201d The UK\u2019s competition watchdog has launched an in-depth study into the booming music streaming market, to assess whether the big record labels and services such as Spotify hold \u201cexcessive power\u201d, and whether artists and fans are getting a fair deal. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which was called on to launch the study following a scathing report by a cross-party committee of MPs last year calling for a \u201ccomplete reset\u201d of a streaming model which it believed only benefited big labels and superstar acts. Music streaming now dominates fans\u2019 listening habits and accounts for 80% of the \u00a31.7bn total UK industry income last year. Spending on subscriptions to services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music hit \u00a31.3bn, compared with just \u00a3135.6m on vinyl albums, and \u00a3150m on CDs. \u201cWhether you\u2019re into Bowie, Beethoven or Beyonc\u00e9, most of us now choose to stream our favourite music,\u201d said Andrea Coscelli, the CMA chief executive. \u201cA vibrant and competitive music streaming market not only serves the interests of fans and creators but helps support a diverse and dynamic sector, which is of significant cultural and economic value to the UK.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: And here\u2019s a recent feature looking into the music streaming sector: Germany\u2019s DAX share index is having a tough morning too, down 1.4% this morning. The technology sector is leading the selloff, with software group SAP down almost 8% despite reporting strong growth in cloud computing sales. Online food ordering service Delivery Hero (-5%), laboratory equipment maker Sartorius (-5.1%), e-commerce group Zalando (-2.9%) and chemical firm Linde (-2.3%) are also in the fallers. The yield, or interest rate, on two-year UK government debt has hit its highest in over a decade. Two-year gilt yields have risen to 0.993% this morning, the highest since May 2011. That follows a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, after the Federal Reserve signalled it would raise interest rates in March, as it prepares to start reducing its balance sheet. Yields measure the rate of return on a bond, and move inversely to prices. The 2-year yields fell below zero in 2020, in the rush for safer assets. The reopening of hospitality venues, and higher demand for premium spirits, has boosted drinks maker Diageo. Diageo, whose brands include Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka, Tanqueray gin and Baileys Irish Cream, grew its sales by 15.8% in the second half of 2021. Operating profits jumped 22.5%, with operating margins also widening. The world\u2019s largest spirits maker has benefited from shoppers stocking up on spirits and beers at home during the Covid-19 pandemic, with wealthier consumers splashing out on more expensive brands. Diageo says prices increases in some countries boosted its results, alongside stronger sales to bars and restaurants (the \u2018on-trade\u2019 sector) as customers returned to hospitality venues. The positive price/mix benefit was primarily driven by mix, reflecting the strong growth of premium plus brands, particularly in scotch, tequila and Chinese white spirits, as well as the continued recovery of the on-trade channel in Europe and North America and the partial recovery of Travel Retail. There was also a price benefit, primarily from price increases in Latin America and Caribbean, Africa and North America. Richard Flood, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: \u201cDiageo has produced a great set of results with a strong increase in sales, margin, and profits over the past six months. The continuing shift by consumers to spirits consumption has benefited the company, as this is a sector of the drinks market that it dominates. Diageo has been able to successfully navigate the challenges of Covid with its strong presence in both the off-trade, as well as the pubs sector \u2013 or on-trade \u2013 which is expected to recover further as Covid fades, leaving Diageo well positioned for the future.\u201d Private rents in Britain are rising at their fastest rate on record, piling more pressure on households feeling the strain of the cost of living crisis. The average advertised rent outside London is 9.9% higher than a year ago as tenants making plans for a post-pandemic life jostle for properties, according to the website Rightmove. Meanwhile, London rents have hit a new record and are higher now than before the start of the pandemic after a bounceback in demand fuelled by the gradual return to the workplace and more overseas students looking for a place to live. The average advertised asking rent outside London is \u00a31,068 a calendar month, said Rightmove. In London it is \u00a32,142. The increases have been attributed to a mismatch between the number of tenants looking for a place and the stock of available properties. Tenant demand is 32% higher than this time last year, but the number of available properties is 51% lower, said the website. France\u2019s CAC share index has dropped by 1.3% in early trading, Spain\u2019s IBEX is down 1%, while Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is 0.7% lower. Charles Henry Monchau, CIO at Bank Syz, sees more volatility ahead, as the recent market jitters hasn\u2019t deterred the Fed from pressing on with normalising monetary policy. What is clear from yesterday\u2019s critical Federal Reserve announcement is that markets still need to go through an adjustment process and price-in the fact that the Fed will need to normalise policy through rate hikes and shrinking of the Fed balance sheet. The FOMC statement also implies no Fed put at this stage, i.e. the Fed will not place itself into a corner and backtrack on its plans to normalize monetary policy just for the sake of putting a halt to equity market correction. So, while we stay bullish on equities, the worsening of liquidity conditions implies a bumpy road ahead with more volatility. The London stock market has opened lower, with the blue-chip FTSE 100 index losing 45 points or 0.6% to 7423 points. Silver producer Fresnillo (-5%), hedge fund Pershing Square (-4.75%) and technology investor Scottish Mortgage (-3.1%) are leading the fallers. Banks are holding up better (higher interest rates help profit margins), with Standard Chartered up 1.5%. The smaller FTSE 250 index, which is more domestically focused, has lost 1.2%. There\u2019s lots going on in the City this morning too, including budget airline easyJet reporting that the Omicron variant has hit takings. EasyJet\u2019s load factor, a measure of how many seats were filled, fell to 67% in December, from over 80% in October and November. It attributed the fall to \u201cthe impact that Omicron had on customers\u2019 confidence and ability to travel during December\u201d, which led to reduced ski travel. easyJet saw significant levels of late flight transfers out of December due to travel restrictions and concerns over Omicron. This pulled load factor over the last quarter down to 77%, missing guidance of over 80%. But brighter times could be ahead, with easyJet seeing an increase in bookings after the UK Government decided to remove all travel testing requirements. Johan Lundgren, easyJet chief executive said: Booking volumes jumped in the UK following the welcome reduction of travel restrictions announced on 5 January, which have been sustained and then given a further boost from the UK Government\u2019s decision earlier this week to remove all testing requirements. We believe testing for travel across our network should soon become a thing of the past. We see a strong summer ahead, with pent up demand that will see easyJet returning to near 2019 levels of capacity with UK beach and leisure routes performing particularly well. Jonathan Sullivan, Managing Director in Accenture\u2019s Travel Industry, says airlines need systems that can cope with more disruption: Because leisure travel is notoriously seasonal, the key differentiator in airlines\u2019 long-term survival will be the ability to offer and deliver more services and products that tempt and delight customers. \u201cWhile that sounds simple, the industry must overcome the obstacle of its dated underlying systems. Modern digital systems are essential to digitally sell and manage a broader variety of add-on services, including from third parties. These systems also need to gracefully cope with the reality that travel plans may be changed or rescheduled at short notice. Deutsche Bank\u2019s US economists now expect the Fed to raise US interest rates five times this year, one more than their previous base case. Strategist Jim Reid explains: The biggest takeaway was the Chair\u2019s emphasis that this cycle was different from the last round of tightening, in that inflation is well-above target, the labour market is historically tight, and growth projections remain above long-run potential. While the Chair demurred when asked what that specially meant for parameters of monetary policy, he did not rule out a faster pace of rate hikes or larger increments, adding that the Fed had plenty of room to tighten given the state of the labour market. So March, and every subsequent meeting should be treated as live with a 50bp hike at some point an increasing possibility, Reid adds. Luigi Speranza, chief global economist at BNP Paribas Markets 360, now expects the Fed to raise interest rates six times this year, after last night\u2019s hawkish comments from Jerome Powell: We read Fed Chair Powell\u2019s comment that this cycle is different from the previous one as an indication that the Fed\u2019s bias is for a steeper tightening than the markets and we had envisaged. We have moved our call for this year to six 25bp hikes from four previously and now expect the fed funds target range at 2.25-2.50% at end-2023, 25bp higher than we had previously forecast. Our new base case for six hikes this year poses challenges to our bullish outlook for US equities. However, it is not sufficient to derail it on a standalone basis if earnings growth remains strong, in our view. Last month, the Fed\u2019s officials predicted they would increase rates three times in 2022, while the markets had been pricing in four increases. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global markets are rattled today after the US central bank signalled it is ready to raise interest rates as it battles the highest inflation rate in forty years. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell struck a notably hawkish tone at last night\u2019s press conference, saying officials were minded to raise interest in March, and didn\u2019t rule out an aggressive string of interest rate rises at coming meetings. Powell told reporters there was \u201cquite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market\u201d, as it also prepares to shrink its balance sheet which has swelled to $9trn . He also warned that inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s long-run goal and supply chain issues may be more persistent than previously thought. Investors are bracing for a sharp rise in interest rates this year, after Powell hinted that the Fed could tighten policy faster than in its last hiking cycle, with growth and inflation are higher than in 2015. As Powell put it: We are going to need to be, as I\u2019ve mentioned, nimble about this. The economy is quite different this time. Powell\u2019s hawkish comments wiped out Wednesday\u2019s Wall Street rally, and has sent shares reeling in Asia-Pacific markets to their lowest level in 15 months. \u201cThe Fed\u2019s gone from being the market\u2019s best friend, to a possible enemy,\u201d said Kyle Rodda, analyst at the online trading platform IG in Sydney, adding that the Fed was set on \u201cbringing inflation down, rather than protecting asset prices\u201d. Japan\u2019s Nikkei has led the way, plunging more than 3% while the Kospi in Seoul found itself in similarly negative territory. The market in Hong Kong was off 2.5% and Sydney shed nearly 2%. MSCI\u2019s broad gauge of regional markets outside Japan fell more than 2% to its lowest level since November 2020. European stock markets are set to drop sharply, as January\u2019s market turbulence continues. Also coming up today We find out how the US economy fared in the final three months of 2021, when the first estimate of GDP for October-December is released. Economists predict that growth sped up, to an annualised rate of 5.5%, from 2.3% in Q3, before the Omicron variant hit at the end of the year In the UK, car production has fallen to its lowest level since 1956, as rising energy costs and computer chips shortages hurt the recovery.

            "date": "2022-01-20T08:00:15Z",
            "content": "At the 12-month mark, the obituaries for the Biden administration are being written. The polls are terrible. Biden\u2019s marquee legislation is stalled. In recent weeks, even appeals by the president to the hallowed legacy of civil rights have failed to move the Democratic party\u2019s holdouts in the Senate \u2013 Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema \u2013 thus blocking the passage of voting rights legislation. While the president invoked Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Manchin countered with the need to preserve the 232-year tradition of conservative stability in the Senate. Not for nothing, 2022 starts with talk about civil war. It is a depressing picture. It is, however, worth reminding ourselves of where the nation was 12 months ago. As 2021 began, it was an open question whether the United States still had a functioning government. There was no orderly transition. The Trump administration simply gave up on Covid. As we now know, America\u2019s senior soldiers were deeply concerned about the nuclear command chain. Then on 6 January there was the riot in the Capitol \u2013 now a morbid obsession of the Democrats \u2013 and the news from Georgia of the double Democrat win in the Senate runoff. It is on that thin basis that the Biden administration has since attempted to govern. The restoration of normality that followed in the spring of 2021 was undeniably a relief, affirmed by the rapid rollout of vaccines. In foreign policy, Biden announced that the US was back. America rejoined the Paris climate treaty. Biden reasserted presidential control of the military command chain, insisting on his policy of withdrawal from Afghanistan, whatever the price. There were to be no distractions. All America\u2019s resources were to be concerted around the competition with China. He was even open to a deal with Russia. In March 2021, the passage of the $1.9tn American rescue plan was a big win. On top of the two other stimulus packages carried by the Democratic majority in 2020, the rescue plan has catapulted the US to the most rapid economic recovery on record. So large is the rebound that it has stretched global supply chains and engendered fears of a wage-price spiral. The inflation talk is now so deafening that it is worth reminding oneself that achieving a tight labour market was the point. As Biden remarked when employers complained about not being able to find workers: \u201cPay them more.\u201d The problem for Biden, if there is one, is not that wages are increasing, but that they are not increasing rapidly enough. It is the erosion of real household purchasing power that makes inflation unpopular and means that Biden is not getting the credit you might expect given the surprisingly healthy state of the economy. Nor, despite the triumph of vaccine rollout, has Biden earned much kudos on Covid. Over the summer, mortality surged among the unvaccinated in the American south and west. Now Omicron has exposed the fact that his administration did not establish an adequate system for mass testing fast enough. Rapid tests that are taken for granted in Europe have been desperately scarce. Across the country, school openings and healthcare systems are a mess. Among the discouraged and stressed are doctors, nurses and teachers, core members of the Democratic party constituency. To tackle the problem, the administration has done an about-face on at-home rapid testing. To tackle the pandemic at source would require a global vaccination programme. On global vaccines, the Biden administration has upped donations and talked about liberalising vaccine patents. What it has not delivered is a well-funded, high-pressure global campaign. When it comes to global policy, the Biden administration would clearly like to be seen as a serious climate leader \u2013 its climate envoy John Kerry played a suave part at Cop26. But what can the US actually deliver? The carefully calibrated Build Back Better legislation, valued at $1.75tn, which was supposed to drive America\u2019s energy transition, is stuck on Joe Manchin\u2019s opposition. Nor is this merely a matter of one senator\u2019s obdurate personality. The fact is that America is profoundly divided. There is a liberal majority, but the US constitution demands a winning strategy across states including the likes of West Virginia, represented by Manchin. He represents an electorate barely larger than that of the New York borough of Brooklyn. West Virginians voted for Trump by a margin of two to one and they have two Senators to represent them on Capitol Hill, just like California or New York. Manchin, meanwhile, has not articulated anything remotely like an alternative policy vision; he cannot even claim to represent West Virginia\u2019s coalminers who like the look of Biden\u2019s energy transition policy. He sees his ticket to survival in speaking not for miners but for mine-owners. The result is to expose the contradictions in the coalition that makes up the Democratic party. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in 2016 and Trump\u2019s unhinging of convention opened the door to the left in the Democratic party. The Green New Deal had its breakthrough moment. When Biden defeated Sanders in the primaries he assimilated a large part of the left agenda and the energy that went with it. But whereas Biden won the presidency, the congressional Democrats did poorly. It was down to the runoff elections in Georgia in January 2021 to decide whether the Democrats would have even the slimmest of majorities. The result is the deadlock in Washington that has crippled the Biden administration. There is an ambitious agenda, with backing from the left, but to legislate they depend on the votes of the entire party, including its centrists. The right wing eagerly seizes on the radical agenda to mount scare campaigns, leaving Manchin to pose as the guardian of real American values against the radicals from both sides. It is early to make predictions, but with the polls showing a huge slide in Democratic support, the president\u2019s prospects in the midterm elections don\u2019t look good. Like Clinton and Obama before him, he faces the prospect of governing with a hostile Congress. Both of those predecessors went on to win reelection to the White House, and Biden might stand a chance, but talk of 2024 brings up the awkward issue of his age. Were he to win reelection, he would start his second term of office at 82: that is old even by the geriatric standards of modern American politics. What is the alternative? Originally, the idea may have been that Biden would hand off to his vice-president, Kamala Harris. But nothing in the last year suggests that she would make a strong candidate. If this feels like an impasse haunted by the spectre of Trump\u2019s return, that should be no surprise. Biden-Harris was a ticket chosen in an emergency. In November 2020, for all Trump\u2019s outrages, the electorate delivered a profoundly divided verdict. We are living with the consequences of that. \u2022 Adam Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University"

            "date": "2022-01-02T14:11:49Z",
            "content": "Once again we start a new year with the country in the grip of Covid-19. But as 2022 dawns, the UK should have been better prepared for the disruption of a new variant. In March 2020, the TUC and unions pressed the chancellor to adopt our detailed proposals for a furlough scheme \u2013 an emergency response to the first wave of the pandemic. It was a huge success \u2013 protecting millions of jobs, keeping businesses open, making the reopening smoother and quicker and making sure families all over the UK could pay their bills. Now, as we face Omicron, we\u2019re having the same old argument about whether government should step in and protect working people\u2019s livelihoods in a crisis. It\u2019s been clear for months that the UK needs a permanent short-time working scheme, learning from the success of furlough, to protect jobs during periods of economic turbulence. Such schemes are common across Europe and help keep businesses afloat when there is a sudden temporary collapse in demand. But ministers have chosen not to listen. After cutting off furlough prematurely in the autumn, the government watched as Omicron hammered our arts, hospitality and aviation sectors in the run-up to Christmas. While the chancellor\u2019s 11th-hour rescue package for pubs, restaurants and theatres will help some, serious damage has already been done to pay packets and to livelihoods. We need to end this stop-start approach to managing our economy. Businesses and working families shouldn\u2019t be put through an emotional rollercoaster every time the pandemic flares up. They need financial certainty and stability so that when better times return our economy can bounce back fast. Having a permanent short-time working scheme in place, conditional on upskilling and retraining, will ensure that if new restrictions have to be imposed again there is support ready to go. But we can\u2019t stop there. We need to build an economy that can help working families face the future with confidence. There are huge challenges on the horizon. Alongside Covid, climate change is already causing global chaos and threatening jobs in energy-intensive industries such as steel and manufacturing. The longer we put off getting to net zero, the more jobs will be put at risk. And let\u2019s not forget the looming cost-of-living storm. The last 11 years have been the worst period for real wage growth since the Napoleonic wars. And this has come at a huge cost to people\u2019s living standards. Over half of families in poverty today are working families. And many of our key workers \u2013 keeping hospitals and public services running \u2013 are still earning less in real terms than in 2010. It\u2019s a national disgrace. Without action, the pressure on UK household budgets will only get worse in 2022. This spring, working families face a triple whammy of skyrocketing bills, cuts to universal credit and a hike in national insurance contributions. We urgently need a long-term economic plan for getting wages rising. And the best way to start is by getting more workers covered by collective agreements, sector-by-sector \u2013 so they can negotiate a fair pay rise with employers. Giving trade unions greater access to workplaces is the key to boosting pay and employment standards across the country. And it\u2019s not just me saying this. The OECD and governments across the world, from America to New Zealand, have recognised the key role collective bargaining can play in reducing inequality and giving people security at work. Committing to industry-wide fair pay agreements would transform the lives of millions by setting minimum standards \u2013 on pay, training, health and safety \u2013 and prevent good employers from being undercut by the bad. And fair pay agreements would help ease staffing shortages in under-pressure sectors such as logistics, food production and social care, by making those industries better places to work in. Whether they can boost living standards and working conditions is the acid test of the government\u2019s levelling up agenda. Alongside campaigning for a pay rise for working people, we are still waiting for the employment bill Boris Johnson promised more than two years ago. Tackling insecure work, outlawing fire and rehire and banning zero-hours contracts \u2013 all are long overdue. As too is fixing our broken sick pay system. It beggars belief that we are heading into another wave of the pandemic with millions unable to afford to self-isolate. This year is a crossroads. Beset by pandemics and climate chaos, we can keep reeling from crisis to crisis, unleashing rampant insecurity and inequality anew. Or we can harness the power of active government \u2013 in partnership with unions and employers \u2013 to create a fairer and more resilient economy. In this age of anxiety, working people are crying out for security. That is my wish for 2022. \u2022 Frances O\u2019Grady is general secretary of the Trades Union Congress"

            "content": "The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, marked Martin Luther King Day with a speech acknowledging that the US economy \u201chas never worked fairly for Black Americans or, really, for any American of color\u201d. Interpreting the late civil rights leader\u2019s I Have a Dream speech, Yellen said: \u201cDr King knew that economic injustice was bound up in the larger injustice he fought against.\u201d In her comments, recorded for delivery at the Rev Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network breakfast in Washington, Yellen noted the financial metaphors the Rev Martin Luther King Jr used in his address, delivered on 28 August 1963, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. Monday would have been the 93rd birthday of King, who was just 39 when he was assassinated in 1968 while helping sanitation workers strike for better pay and workplace safety in Memphis, Tennessee. King, Yellen noted, had referred to the guarantees in the Declaration of Independence as \u201ca promise that all men, yes, Black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d. \u201cIt is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned,\u201d King said. Later in his address, the civil rights leader used the metaphor of a bad check. \u201cIn a sense we\u2019ve come to our nation\u2019s capital to cash a check,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked \u2018insufficient funds\u2019.\u201d King\u2019s metaphor, an accusation in blunt economic terms, Yellen said, showed that he \u201cknew that economic injustice was bound up in the larger injustice\u201d. Yellen added that the Biden administration was working to change that, \u201cto ensure that neither the figurative bank of justice, nor any literal economic institution, fails to work for people of color\u201d. In her remarks, Yellen noted the steps the Biden administration had taken to address economic inequities, including building equity into the American Rescue Plan so that communities of color would get pandemic relief, and injecting $9bn into community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions. \u201cThere is still much more work Treasury needs to do to narrow the racial wealth divide,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2022-01-03T07:00:39Z",
            "content": "Key Donald Trump loyalists Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn are at the forefront of a drive to expand Trumpist influence at the local level of US politics while forging ahead with efforts aimed at promoting baseless claims that Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory was fraudulent. The growing drive by Trump\u2019s hardcore allies has spurred election watchdog groups to voice alarm about the threat to democracy posed by Flynn and Bannon \u2013 and other Trump acolytes \u2013 as they combine debunked claims about election fraud and calls for further 2020 election audits with planning conservative takeovers of official positions that run US elections. The moves come a year after the attack on the Capitol in Washington when a pro-Trump mob invaded the building in an attempt to stop the certification of Biden\u2019s election victory. Flynn and Bannon, using varying paths, have focused new energy on increasing conservative influence by recruiting more allies for key posts at the local and precinct level with an eye on the 2022 and 2024 elections, and building more political alliances on issues such as vaccine requirements and mask mandates. The strategies Flynn and Bannon are deploying overlap those of other conservative outfits, such as the influential youth group Turning Point USA, to expand the pro-Trump base at the precinct level, and work to elect Trump-backed politicians to key posts such as secretary of state in Georgia, Arizona and other battleground states. Flynn and Bannon have separately relied on a mix of non-profit groups, including one backed by the multimillionaire Patrick Byrne, conservative social media outlets favored by the far right like Telegram, and events that convey evangelical Christian messages with political disinformation. Bannon, for instance, has used his War Room podcast to espouse plans for \u201ctaking over the Republican party through the precinct committee strategy\u201d and invited would-be candidates to appear as guests. The podcast, which has tens of millions of downloads, has found a large and receptive conservative following. Flynn, meanwhile, touts the adage that \u201clocal action has national impact\u201d and has been a star speaker in several key states at \u201cReAwaken America\u201d events, which are dubbed \u201chealth and freedom\u201d conferences and combine evangelical themes with misinformation about the 2020 election and vaccine skepticism. The conservative crusades by Flynn and Bannon come after Trump pardoned them post-election for lying to the FBI and fraud respectively. Bannon and Flynn also were central actors with other Trump loyalists in scheming about ways to block Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s election, efforts that are under scrutiny as part of a House select committee investigation of the deadly Capitol attack by hundreds of Trump supporters. As they have carved out new roles in the conservative ecosystem, Flynn and Bannon still support Trump\u2019s conspiratorial claims that he lost in 2020 due to massive cheating, a mantra that reinforces their drives to expand local and state electoral influence to give Republicans a better shot at recapturing Congress next year, and the White House in 2024. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a dangerous trend of election deniers lining up to fill election administration positions across the country,\u201d Joanna Lydgate, chief executive of the States United Democracy Center, said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cAnd the efforts by Flynn, Bannon and other promoters of the big lie are all part of this playbook to hijack elections in 2022 and 2024 if their preferred candidate doesn\u2019t win.\u201d Likewise, as they have revved up political work on multiple fronts, the two ex-Trump advisers have taken more extremist stances sparking strong criticism. Flynn, a retired army lieutenant general, has been skewered for his authoritarian style advocacy of \u201cone religion\u201d for America, and for speaking at some events with heavy presences by adherents of QAnon conspiracy movement. Flynn\u2019s call for \u201cone religion\u201d came during a talk to a conservative Christian audience in Texas on the ReAwaken America tour in November. \u201cIf we are going to have one nation under God, which we must, we have to have one religion,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cOne nation under God and one religion under God, right? All of us, working together.\u201d Flynn\u2019s feature role at ReAwaken America meetings in several states such as Michigan and Florida is hardly an accident, according to Byrne, the multimillionaire founder of the America Project that counts Flynn as special adviser and spokesperson. Byrne, who has joined Flynn at some ReAwaken rallies, said in text messages that he and Flynn had a large hand in launching the ReAwaken tour during the spring by bankrolling the events with some \u201ctens of thousands of dollars\u201d from the America Project. Overall, Byrne said that the America Project has raised about $9.5m, of which he donated close to $7m. Byrne and the America Project poured over $3m into a months-long audit of Arizona\u2019s largest county, which Trump was banking on to find major fraud, but which resulted in no significant changes to Biden\u2019s win there or overall in the state, much to Trump\u2019s dismay. Byrne said the project has helped promote audits in other states besides Arizona. Boasting a net worth pegged at about $75m, Byrne is the ex-chief executive of furniture retailer Overstock. Byrne texted that he didn\u2019t vote for Trump, and deems himself a \u201crule of law\u201d advocate who claims there\u2019s still a \u201cmountain of evidence\u201d to support the widely debunked allegations of fraud. Byrne\u2019s project has had no dearth of Trump links. The project\u2019s president until late last month was Emily Newman, a former Trump aide. Newman, along with Byrne and Flynn, attended a meeting in December 2020 with Trump about ways to block Biden taking office where Flynn touted the option of declaring martial law and deploying the military to rerun the election in key states Trump lost, according to multiple reports. Flynn\u2019s brother, Joe Flynn, has succeeded Newman as the project\u2019s president, Byrne said. On top of his work with the America Project, Flynn\u2019s focus on expanding the Maga base at the local level increased when he became chairman in May of another non-profit, America\u2019s Future, which, in turn, has partnered with Turning Point USA and others to form a larger alliance dubbed County Citizens Defending Freedom USA. The county citizens group has sponsored an array of training programs, protests and candidate meetings with a focus on mask mandates, vaccine requirements and critical race theory, according to Florida lawyer Ron Filipkowski, a former prosecutor who authored a Washington Post article on the wave of local drives by Trump backers. For his part, Bannon\u2019s heavy emphasis on a local \u201cprecinct strategy\u201d to help Republican\u2019s electoral fortunes combines conspiratorial and apocalyptic bravado. Bannon told CNN in December that his War Room podcast is an organizing tool to expand Trump\u2019s base. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning elections with the right people \u2013 Maga people,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cWe will have our people in at every level.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re taking over all the elections,\u201d Bannon said in November on his War Room podcast. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the bottom of [last year\u2019s election] and we\u2019re going to decertify the electors. And you\u2019re going to have a constitutional crisis. But you know what? We\u2019re a big and tough country, and we can handle that, we\u2019ll be able to handle that. We\u2019ll get through that.\u201d Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University, told the Guardian that much of Bannon\u2019s political messaging has relied on alternative social media channels such as Telegram that appeal to conservative and far right allies to spread pro Trump gospel and help broaden the Maga base at the local level. To Squire, Bannon\u2019s rhetoric and large audience look increasingly dangerous. \u201cAfter being de-platformed from mainstream social media over the past year, Bannon has been promoting \u2018alternative\u2019, permissive social media channels such as Telegram and Gettr. There his listeners are able to amplify and intensify Bannon\u2019s messaging into a 24-hour-a-day echo chamber filled with disinformation, scams, and conspiracy theories.\u201d For Lydgate, the chief executive of the States United Democracy Center, the multi-front drives by Bannon, Flynn and other key Trump loyalists pose serious risks for the integrity of future elections. \u201cThey want to sow doubt in our democracy and make it easier to undermine the will of American voters.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-17T10:00:17Z",
            "content": "Last year for Martin Luther King Jr Day, I interviewed a group of WNBA players along with Eric Garner\u2019s daughter, Emerald. We spoke about their campaign to unseat Republican Kelly Loeffler, who had been part of the leadership group of the Atlanta Dream, from the US Senate. With the players\u2019 help, the outside candidate Raphael Warnock beat Loeffler giving Democrats control of the Senate. That election in Georgia was an excellent example of how athletes can cause real change. But, as we mark MLK Day on Monday, there are plenty of signs the struggle is far from over. We\u2019ve just passed the first anniversary of the 6 January riots, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol. The subsequent investigation into the riots was a chance to address the extremism that is poisoning US society. But Republicans have attempted to block the inquiry, while politicians and the rightwing media who fanned the flames have not been held accountable. We have also just watched the sentencing of the three white men who murdered a young Black man, Ahmaud Arbery, in cold blood while he was out jogging. And while justice was eventually served, we should remember that prosecutors failed to act until two months after the killing, when video of the murder was leaked, touching off international outcry. It\u2019s fair to say that America still has a long way to go until it is a safe and just place for all. WNBA players caused real change last year in Georgia and their NBA peers made an impact after the murder of George Floyd in the summer of 2020. John Wall, Bradley Beal, Russell Westbrook, Jaylen Brown, Enes Kanter and the Ball brothers were among the dozens of NBA players who attended and spoke at Black Lives Matter marches. Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade and Chris Paul founded the NBA Social Change Fund, which aims to support critical issues in the Black community. But now it\u2019s time to take it a step further. And the NBA could and should use the WNBA as a blueprint to follow. I have even identified a place where they could make an important impact: Texas. Lee Merritt, who served as one of the lawyers for the Arbery family, is running for attorney general in the second-most populous state in the United States. He would be the most powerful legal figure in a state where battles over racial justice, policing, immigration and voting rights are being fought every day. In my new book, Police Brutality And White Supremacy: The Fight Against American Traditions, I interviewed politicians, athletes, activists and educators as well as victims (and their family members) of police brutality. Many of these people said fighting for laws to be changed is a vital part of changing the status quo. And while many have grown understandably tired of the voting process, local elections stand as one of the best methods to take a serious step in the right direction of justice. And there is no doubt Merritt is committed to justice. \u201cThe reason I am moving into the political spectrum is \u2026 that we still exist in the deadliest police culture in the modern world. Other countries have done it better. Other countries that we compare ourselves with. We\u2019re in last place in terms of policing our communities without resorting to violence,\u201d he told me on my podcast, The Rematch. \u201cWe need a better policy, and we\u2019ve talked about it long enough. Now that we know the truth, let\u2019s stop turning a blind eye to it and pursue policies that will actually lead to long term systemic change. And I believe that means having constitutional attorneys like myself assume the role of attorney general. And not only myself but Letitia James in New York, Keith Ellison in Minnesota, Kwame Raoul in Illinois.\u201d He also acknowledged the tremendous role the NBA could play in achieving real change. \u201cMembers of the NBA have the opportunity, they have the position to really have an impact on how we pursue policy not only in the state of Texas but throughout the country and the voices of the NBA are critically important to that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for the NBA, and everyone else with a platform to join us in this movement because we can really change this country for the better.\u201d He has a great point. Last year, WNBA players showed the power of athletes\u2019 voices. Imagine what prominent Texas NBA players, executives and coaches such as Mark Cuban, Jason Kidd, Gregg Popovich, Tim Hardaway Jr and Luka Doncic (or indeed NFL players like Dallas Cowboys stars Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott) could do if they endorsed Merritt? Slogans on jerseys calling for justice are all well and good. But if NBA players could make a difference in the election for a role as important as Texas attorney general, it would be huge a boost in the fight for justice in the United States. Etan Thomas played in the NBA from 2000 through 2011. He is a published poet, activist and motivational speaker"

Perhaps that nice caff at No 5. We are after all lunching with that nice American trade envoy, Katherine Tai. Perhaps two measures of dry gin; three bottles of Pazo Barrantes Albari\u00f1o, a Spanish white wine, costing a total of \u00a3153; and two bottles of the French red Coudoulet de Beaucastel, costing a total of \u00a3130. Perhaps a \u00a33,000 bill. Besides, the proprietor of 5 Hertford Street is Robin Birley, half-brother to Boris Johnson\u2019s mate Zac Goldsmith, and buddy of Michael Gove and David Cameron. And he tipped Johnson 20 grand for his \u201cleadership\u201d campaign, wherever that went. Surely such generosity calls for a kindly nod and wink. 5 Hertford Street posted substantial losses last year, so the money might come in handy. Birley even halved the bill if it could be paid straight away. The office wants Truss to slum it in Soho. She hits the roof. Who wins trade deals in Soho? Besides, this is one for Birley. The joy of British corruption is that there are no crude brown envelopes stuffed with notes. Money is never seen changing hands. Negotiation is via a pat on the shoulder, a placement at a dinner, a nod at the tennis net. There need not be a direct quid pro, but favours can flow both ways: a party donation, a contract, a planning refusal overturned, all rounded off with the knighthood or peerage. The British like to pretend their political culture is pure, but benign terms have been used to mask questionable interactions. In times past, the Metropolitan police vehicle for the receipt of informal benefit was the \u201cpolice benevolent fund\u201d. It was the stuff of legend and occasional comedy. Now, at a time of wild budgetary spending, every dodgy oddball is crowding round the pig trough. Goodness knows what antics will be revealed, if ever, from the proposed inquiry into the pandemic. It should be standing room only at the Old Bailey. The strangest transactions seem to revolve around politicians striving to live up to the dignity of their office, be it flat decorations, country houses or foreign holidays. Lunch at 5 Hertford Street is a classic. Turn to a party donor; at least he could host a good lunch. Truss\u2019s civil servants saw the danger a mile off and steered her towards a more modest watering hole. She would have none of it. It went to her permanent secretary, who let it through, but he is clearly a mouse not a man. Should it now go to the cohort of Whitehall standards scrutineers? If so they must be worked off their feet, with every self-respecting property developer or drug manufacturer feeling they are carrying the weight of the Tory party on their shoulders. Perhaps the best discipline is daylight. Lunch at 5 Hertford Street is hardly a hanging crime. It rather indicates a general casualness towards public funds and relationships; an attitude of mind. Johnson was very nice to Truss. She returns the favour by shamelessly going on manoeuvres to replace him. Now she is currying favour with his friends. Is that who we want as a future prime minister?

            "content": "The contrast between the upbeat tone of the prime minister\u2019s new year message and the political cloud hanging over him as he goes into 2022 could not be starker. Boris Johnson said Britain is in an \u201cincomparably better\u201d state in the fight against Covid than it was at the start of 2021; thanks to the scientific research that produced a vaccine in less than a year, that is certainly true. But Johnson begins the new year as an irrevocably weakened political figure, his poll ratings significantly down from a year ago, his authority within his own parliamentary party eroded. Just two years after winning a decisive parliamentary majority of 80, this will be the year that requires him to fight for his survival. While 2022 will hopefully bring a diminishing of the disruption and harm caused by Covid, it will also see the launch of the independent inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Johnson\u2019s dreadful errors of judgment over the last 21 months will be raked over: his decisions to hang back in introducing social restrictions not once, not twice, but three times cost too many people their lives, and still more the hardship of living under harsher social restrictions for longer as a result of his delays. The inquiry may also uncover further revelations about Johnson\u2019s hypocrisy in his approach to enforcing the social restrictions he imposed on the country within his own residence. The Cabinet Office investigation into the Downing Street parties will report and, if it generates evidence that the law was broken, may even lead to a police investigation. Johnson will also continue to face scrutiny over his lack of probity around declaring political donations. The country is facing an acute cost of living crisis that the government has made immeasurably worse through its policies. A decade of tax credit cuts enacted by successive Tory chancellors \u2013 which effectively paid for tax cuts for more affluent families \u2013 has eroded the incomes of low-paid parents, for some households by thousands of pounds a year. Yet this did not stop Johnson enacting a further tax credit cut of \u00a31,000 a year in October, the biggest overnight benefit cuts for low-income families with children in history. The increase in generosity of the universal credit taper rate the government introduced in November still leaves three-quarters of families on universal credit worse off, and despite the pandemic, unemployment benefits are now at their lowest real rates since 1990. These cuts will hit families living in the constituencies the Conservatives won from Labour in the so-called red wall much harder than those in their heartlands and will make it even harder for families to cope with fast-rising housing, energy and food costs. It is likely that the cost of living crisis \u2013 and the lack of government support to help the lower-paid weather the storm \u2013 will further damage Johnson in the coming months. The Brexit that Johnson so coveted as a cynical route to the premiership will also continue to throw up difficulties. The key Brexit conundrum remains unsolved: there is no Brexit that involves a complete break with all of the EU\u2019s regulations and institutions that is compatible with both no border in the Irish Sea and no border on the island of Ireland. Given that the UK willingly sacrifices sovereignty in exchange for trade in other trade agreements, it seems extraordinary that this should become the sticking point of principle over which Conservative politicians are willing to undermine the Good Friday agreement. But thanks to the ideologues of the Eurosceptic right, that is where we are. Johnson\u2019s approach thus far has been to pretend this irresolvable dilemma does not exist, misleading the public that the Northern Ireland protocol would involve no customs checks on goods coming from Northern Ireland into the rest of the UK. And the insidious economic impact of Brexit will continue; voters do not need to associate its economic malaise with Brexit itself to hold the government responsible for the state of the economy as we move towards the next election. Voter discontent with the government has translated into a consistentpoll lead for Labour in recent weeks. This creates a window of opportunity for Keir Starmer to position Labour as a government in waiting, one the country can get behind. There have been some important achievements in the first 20 months of Starmer\u2019s leadership. He has begun the journey towards rooting out antisemitism from his party, suspending Jeremy Corbyn from the party after he minimised the findings of the statutory regulator, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, on antisemitism in Labour. He has introduced rule changes that should help ensure future leaders are more appealing to Labour voters. And after a botched reshuffle last May, he has recently promoted promising talent to Labour\u2019s frontbench. What he has not yet succeeded in doing, however, is communicating to voters how Britain would be different under a Starmer premiership. To be fair, this is difficult for any opposition leader to achieve in the first year or two of a new parliament and even harder when there is an ongoing national crisis that has quite rightly dominated the political discourse. But 2022 will be a make-or-break year for Starmer as to whether he can succeed in mustering enthusiasm among voters alongside their growing disenchantment with Johnson. It is far too early to write him off altogether, but we begin 2022 with a glimmer of hope that there may be an end in sight to the corruption, hypocrisy and incompetence of Boris Johnson and the damage his premiership continues to wreak on Britain. That is sufficient to make the new year wishes for good health, wellbeing and prosperity glow with a political optimism that was absent 12 months ago."

            "content": "A suspected member of the group involved in the assassination of Haiti\u2019s president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, has been arrested by US authorities after he was detained while transiting through Panama following his deportation from Jamaica to Colombia. Mario Antonio Palacios, 43, a former member of the Colombian military, is accused by Haitian authorities of being part of a mercenary group that tortured and killed Mo\u00efse and wounded his wife, Martine, during an attack on Mo\u00efse\u2019s private home in July. Palacios has admitted in a media interview being in Mo\u00efse\u2019s bedroom during the assault in which the president died, but has denied being involved in the killing. He entered Jamaica illegally and was detained in prison after his arrest in October while the courts considered an application from Haiti for his extradition. Jamaica instead ordered his deportation to Colombia, but while transiting to his home country via Panama he was intercepted at the airport and put on a flight to the US, which, like Haiti, has issued an Interpol red notice requesting his arrest. Palacios appeared at a federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon but did not enter a plea. He is scheduled to appear in court again on 31 January. Panama authorities have issued no public comment on the affair but a person familiar with the matter in Panama confirmed that Palacios had been detained. A video shared with Reuters by the source, who declined to be identified, showed two immigration agents escorting a man, whose face was not shown, through what appeared to be Panama\u2019s airport. An official source quoted by the Colombian news site El Tiempo said: \u201cIt seems very certain that Palacios will be sent to the United States because the [legal] process there was pushed forward urgently and they have a plane ready for him.\u201d Palacios\u2019s detention in Panama and arrest by US authorities marks the latest twist in the saga of the investigation into Moise\u2019s assassination, which remains largely mired in mystery. Jamaican authorities ruled that Haiti\u2019s request for Palacios\u2019s extradition did not meet its legal requirements. \u201cThis request, as a matter of law, could not proceed, could not be processed and was destined to fail,\u201d said Paula Llewellyn, Jamaica\u2019s director of public prosecutions (DPP), on Friday. According to reports, Palacios had not been named as a suspect in the murder but was instead being sought on a charge of armed robbery. It appeared at the weekend that the Colombian would be allowed to travel home after he was photographed shaking hands with the Colombian ambassador to Jamaica, Jairo Clopatofsky Ghisays. Palacios is believed to be the last of the alleged group of mercenaries to be detained. In an interview given while he was still in hiding, he insisted he had no knowledge of who killed Mo\u00efse. \u201cI don\u2019t know who killed him. I say it from the heart for my family, for my children,\u201d he told the Week, though he did admit he had entered Mo\u00efse\u2019s house. According to a report prepared by the Haitian police and leaked to various media outlets, Palacios \u2013 also known by his nickname of \u201cFloro\u201d \u2013 is accused of being one of the instigators of Mo\u00efse\u2019s assassination on 7 July. He is accused of being one of 26 Colombians and two Haitian Americans who made up a hit squad that stormed the president\u2019s private residence in the middle of the night claiming to be part of a US Drug Enforcement Administration operation. Mo\u00efse was shot a dozen times and also appeared to have had an eye gouged out during the assault. None of the surviving Colombians captured in Haiti have yet been put on trial, and the motivation behind the assassination remains unclear amid contradictory claims. On Saturday, gunmen tried to kill Haiti\u2019s prime minister, Ariel Henry, during an event to mark the anniversary of the country\u2019s independence, officials say. The incident happened at a church in the northern city of Gona\u00efves. Video posted online showed the prime minister and his entourage scrambling toward their cars amid intense gunfire."

            "date": "2022-01-26T10:30:06Z",
            "content": "Along a paved road that climbs the hillside to Celaque Mountain national park in south-western Honduras, one-room shacks are overshadowed by high-walled mansions \u2013 including the homes of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and his political allies. Local people say the results of Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years as president are on full display. \u201cHe worked hard for his own good \u2013 not for the good of the people,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez, 68, a farmer resting in the picturesque colonial park in the center of Gracias. \u201cThe people continue in calamity, and he\u2019s leaving as a millionaire.\u201d On Thursday, Honduras will inaugurate Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s successor: the country\u2019s first female president, Xiomara Castro. Her resounding victory in November\u2019s general election was propelled by a wave of anti-Hern\u00e1ndez sentiment that reached even into his home town of Gracias. \u201cThe results of the election are an expression of the overwhelming rejection of Juan Orlando and what he represented,\u201d said Gustavo Ir\u00edas, director of the Honduran watchdog group Cespad. Hern\u00e1ndez is widely expected to be indicted by US prosecutors on drug trafficking conspiracy charges upon leaving office. It would mark a spectacular fall from grace for a president who was once considered one of Washington\u2019s top allies in the region. The son of a prominent landholder who fathered at least 17 children, Hern\u00e1ndez, 53, began his decades-long political career here in Gracias. He was raised in relative comfort compared with his rural counterparts \u2013 but far below that enjoyed by the urban elite. \u201c[His father] had his properties, his cattle and a vehicle \u2013 and in those times a person who had a vehicle was wealthy,\u201d said Ana Guillermina, a local historian and retired teacher who once counted Hern\u00e1ndez among her primary school students. \u201cI don\u2019t recall that there was anything special about him.\u201d When Hern\u00e1ndez joined congress in 1998, fellow legislators from the time described him as quiet, humble, with few friends but with a keen interest on capitalizing upon his office. Hern\u00e1ndez rose steadily up the political ladder, becoming president of Congress in 2010 and then president of the republic four years later. At the time, Honduras had one of the world\u2019s highest homicide rates and was plagued by violent gangs and drug traffickers. To combat the crime wave, he deployed the military in the streets, filled the country\u2019s prisons and started extraditing high-level drug traffickers to the United States. He was commended for his administration\u2019s efforts by numerous US agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration. But at the same time, drug trafficking allegations mounted against one of his brothers, former legislator Juan Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez, who was linked to a drug lab in 2014 and later to a helicopter that had transported cocaine, among other accusations. In 2016, Hern\u00e1ndez announced that he would seek re-election despite a constitutional prohibition against it. That decision would ultimately turn many Hondurans against him, and the subsequent 2017 election was marred by allegations of fraud and violent repression of protesters by state security forces. \u201cIt would have been best for him to step aside because he was re-elected in a very unclear way,\u201d said high school teacher Wilmer Oliva, as he sat in the shade of Gracias\u2019s central park in December. Oliva voted for Hern\u00e1ndez twice, but quickly regretted the second time. \u201cThese last four years have definitely been lousy. So many corruption and drug trafficking scandals.\u201d In November 2018, less than a year into Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s second term, Tony was arrested while visiting Miami and charged with drug trafficking and related weapons charges. A year later, a New York jury found him guilty on all counts following a trial that gripped the nation and exposed the depths of the government\u2019s complicity in drug trafficking. Prosecutors named Hern\u00e1ndez as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case against his brother and accused him of receiving millions in bribes from drug traffickers in what they described as \u201cstate-sponsored drug trafficking\u201d. Hern\u00e1ndez was then named by US prosecutors as a co-conspirator in two additional drug trafficking cases, including one in which he allegedly plotted with a drug trafficker to \u201cshove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos\u201d, Hern\u00e1ndez has denied all allegations related to drug trafficking, calling them lies made up by violent criminals who are seeking to reduce their sentences. He did not respond to an interview request. The Trump administration turned a blind eye to the accusations while Hern\u00e1ndez continued to bend to the will of its migration agenda. But the Biden administration, which has pledged to fight corruption as part of its plan to address the root causes of migration, has essentially shunned the outgoing president, preferring to wait out his term with the hope of a fresh start with the new administration. Meanwhile, the drug trafficking accusations piled on top of numerous corruption scandals, in which Hern\u00e1ndez has also denied involvement. A bungled response to the Covid-19 pandemic and a devastating pair of major hurricanes in November 2020 made matters worse. Poverty rose to its highest level in four decades. Perhaps it was unsurprising then, that when the country went to the polls in November, Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s party suffered unprecedented losses across the country, even losing control of city hall in Gracias, one of the party\u2019s historic strongholds. \u201cThe king is dead, long live the king,\u201d said the outgoing mayor of Gracias, Dr Javier Enamorado. With his party set to lose control of government and his power in Honduras withering away, Hern\u00e1ndez has been forced to look abroad for allies \u2013 and potentially a place where he could avoid arrest and extradition to the United States. Until now, he has been protected from indictment by a Department of Justice policy of not presenting charges against sitting heads of state. On 10 January, he attended the inauguration of Nicaragua\u2019s leader, Daniel Ortega, who was re-elected for a third time after an election broadly denounced as a charade. \u201cHe showed up as a defeated emperor without his great entourage,\u201d said Ir\u00edas, who noted that Nicaragua is already providing refuge to two former presidents of El Salvador who face corruption charges at home. \u201cHis intention was clearly to support one of the most authoritarian regimes of the region in exchange for an eventual refuge.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-01-19T12:00:11Z",
            "content": "The US presidency was supposed to be something different, something novel, compared with the fossilised monarchical rule that it supplanted after the American revolution. Born of Enlightenment theory, settler colonialism and 18th-century warfare, the US constitution gave the chief executive primarily an enforcement role, with the authority to lead armed forces in the event of foreign encroachment or domestic unrest but stripped of the capacity to legislate or issue judicial decisions. The architects of the new republic meant for the president to preside over a citizenry well-endowed with rights, not to rule over cowed subjects. Chief executives from George Washington and Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan have been sorely tested by both the responsibilities and the limitations of the country\u2019s highest, loneliest office. Through civil war, economic catastrophes, foreign misadventures, social upheavals and plagues, the presidency has endured, but it \u2013 and the 45 men who have occupied the job \u2013 has been moulded and often humbled by the promise and perils of the office. Is the US presidency \u2013 indeed, American democracy \u2013 equal to the dire challenges of the 21st century? One could certainly argue that it isn\u2019t, based on the ongoing bungling of the Covid-19 response, the horrifying (and presidentially inspired) insurrection of 6 January 2021 and the glacially slow and fickle efforts to address everything from climate change to widening social inequality. If the founding fathers meant to circumscribe the power of the presidency out of a well-founded fear of kingly abuses, then they would surely comprehend the creeping threat that authoritarianism and political extremism present to the US system of government today. Nevertheless, they probably could not have guessed that the hard lessons that they had learned about the fragility of democracy would be so fiercely resisted or blithely ignored more than two centuries after they beseeched a patrician general from the Virginia countryside to preside over their fledgling experiment in government by the people. Of the many works that I have found useful in thinking about the history of the US presidency and for writing my newest book, The Black President: Hope and Fury in the Age of Obama, these 10 have been among the most helpful. They are a mix of biographies, memoirs and reportage which, taken together, represent some of the best writings by and about the small group of powerful people who have occupied the White House. 1. Never Caught: The Washingtons\u2019 Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge by Erica Armstrong Dunbar (2017) Dunbar\u2019s important book is less a biography of George Washington, Martha Washington, or Ona Judge, the runaway enslaved woman whom the first couple made such extraordinary efforts to recapture, than a look into the power and privilege of a slaveholding elite forcing its way through a new republic rhetorically committed to liberty. The relentless pursuit of Judge by the Washingtons after her bold flight from the new US capital in Philadelphia is expertly told by Dunbar. 2. The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family by Annette Gordon-Reed (2008) This history of overlapping, intertwined families vivifies the world around Thomas Jefferson, the third US president, while skilfully making more legible the travails and aspirations of the enslaved people on his storied estate at Monticello. The decades-long relationship between Jefferson and Sally Hemings, one of the Black women he owned and who bore several of his children, occupies the core of the book, but Gordon-Reed manages to craft a complicated and often contradictory history that extends far beyond the tangle of race, gender, and status that marked the Jeffersons and the Hemingses\u2019 commingled journey through US history. 3. Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin (2005) This book follows the intersecting biographical tributaries of the powerful, ambitious men whom Abraham Lincoln, the nation\u2019s 16th president, was able to steer toward the rushing river of his own turbulent civil war presidency. Lincoln as political strategist and savvy tactician is the frame that Goodwin points up most dramatically. But the book also succeeds at conveying Lincoln as a beleaguered and empathic head of state whose mettle is tried time and again by those around him and news from the battlefield. 4. Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S Grant (1885-1886) Rightly considered by many historians and literary critics as among the best of presidential autobiographies, this book was completed a generation after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox as Grant succumbed to a slow strangulation by throat cancer in the 1880s. The memoirs provide a vantage point on the nation\u2019s bloodiest and most defining conflict that only a soldier elemental to the war and its aftermath could offer. 5. Theodore Rex by Edmund Morris (2001) As the best biographical volume on America\u2019s 26th president, Theodore Roosevelt, Morris\u2019s book draws bold-coloured portraits of outsized historical figures, with equally knowing shades of nuance and frailty. Morris has the contextual eye of the historian and sets scenes that are alive and convincing. He also conveys mood and meaning as well as any novelist. 6. Franklin D Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932-1940 by William Leuchtenburg (1963) Dated, frayed, and surpassed by newer research and more eloquent storytellers, Leuchtenburg\u2019s volume on the first two presidential terms of Franklin Roosevelt still stands the test of time as a scholarly, well-researched, and jargon-free narration of arguably the most consequential presidency of the 20th century. It is the tale of the rise of the liberal welfare state against the backdrop of the Great Depression and the gathering clouds of world war. Leuchtenburg tells the story well and sets the standard for future researchers. 7. The Making of the President, 1960 by Theodore White (1961) White\u2019s fascinating chronicle of the 1960 presidential race is the starting point of quality, book-length journalistic coverage of modern American politics. Writing in the moment, White had an eye for discerning the essential character of men such as John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon who sought the country\u2019s highest office, even as the media ecosystem of his day made such discernment more difficult to achieve. 8. Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years by Haynes Johnson (1991) Johnson captures the zeitgeist of the 1980s by juxtaposing the countervailing forces of American optimism \u2013 or the desperate need of many Americans to again believe in their scandal-wracked government \u2013 against the greed, corruption, militarism and debt that threatened to unmask the soothing myths of American exceptionalism. At the centre of Johnson\u2019s story is a self-made man, an actor by training and temperament who through force of will, theatrics \u2013 and a good dose of luck \u2013 led the country through domestic and external perils whose ramifications are still being felt today. 9. Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by Barack Obama (1995) Of Obama\u2019s autobiographical writings, this one provides the best understanding of his origins and burgeoning sense of self. His early and more frank ruminations on race are present here, and the book is not encumbered by the exigencies of political campaigning. At once a memoir, travelogue and deeply introspective meditation, it is a fluent self-study of his efforts to reconcile himself with his eclectic lineage and to discover his place and purpose in the world. 10. Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin (2010) The essential volume on the 2008 presidential primaries and general election. Heilemann and Halperin had generous access to many of the historical players \u2013 including Barack Obama, John McCain, Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin \u2013 and their staffs. It is a fast-paced, even breathless read, and anyone who paid even casual attention at the time to the historic events chronicled here will recognise its richly drawn characters, plotlines and twists of fate. The Black President: Hope and Fury in the Age of Obama by Claude A Clegg III is published by Johns Hopkins University Press.

            "content": "Good morning. After winning more votes than any presidential candidate in US history, Joe Biden is now \u2013 just 12 months later \u2013 one of the country\u2019s most unpopular presidents. Much of his domestic agenda is stalled on Capitol Hill, impeded by members of his own party. The virus is once again raging out of control: daily infections of Covid-19 have soared to record levels, hospitalizing more Americans than at any previous point during the pandemic. The administration\u2019s vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers was blocked by the supreme court\u2019s conservative super-majority. Inflation is at a nearly 40-year high. Diplomatic talks have so far failed to pull Russia back from the brink of war with Ukraine. The puzzle of Biden\u2019s unpopularity has many pieces, pollsters and political analysts say. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of it that has nothing to do with Joe Biden,\u201d Sarah Longwell, a prominent anti-Trump Republican strategist said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tough time.\u201d How unpopular is he? For months, Biden\u2019s approval ratings have languished in the mid to low 40s, with an average approval rating of 42%. A Quinnipiac poll released last week found him at a dire 33%. Leaked photos show scale of damage caused by Tonga volcano eruption Aerial images prepared by the New Zealand defence force for the Tongan government have been leaked online and show some areas have had \u201ccatastrophic\u201d devastation inflicted by the tsunami and volcanic eruption while others were relatively unscathed. The 40 aerial pictures show some areas blanketed with ash, with damaged buildings, while others show parts of the country that appear unscathed. They were taken by the New Zealand defence force during a reconnaissance flight on Monday and put together in a report for the Tongan government. The photos were then leaked online. The Guardian has confirmed the provenance of the photos. After the reconnaissance flight, the New Zealand defence force shared a handful of photos with the media, most of them showing defence personnel at work, rather than shots of the islands. The 40 leaked images paint a much fuller picture of the damage to the country, and include annotations about the severity of damage. Little has been heard from Tonga since the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u2019apai volcano and subsequent tsunami on Saturday, after the Pacific nation\u2019s main communication cable was broken. Capitol attack panel grapples with moving inquiry forward The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is weighing whether to subpoena some of Donald Trump\u2019s top allies on Capitol Hill as it considers its options on how aggressively it should pursue testimony to move forward its inquiry into the January 6 insurrection. The Republican House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Republican members of Congress Jim Jordan and Scott Perry may have inside knowledge about Trump\u2019s plan to stop the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election and whether it was coordinated with the Capitol attack. But the outright refusal of McCarthy and the other Republican lawmakers to testify voluntarily with the investigation has intensified discussions among the panel\u2019s members and investigators about whether to force their cooperation. The select committee is undecided on whether to take that near-unprecedented step. Why are they hesitating? In part because of one major concern that has emerged in recent days, according to two sources familiar with the matter: Republican retaliation against Biden and Democrats in future inquiries. In other news \u2026 The vice-president, Kamala Harris, said on Monday that the right to vote in America was \u201cunder assault\u201d. The speech was given on the Martin Luther King day public holiday and comes as King\u2019s family push for expanded federal voting rights legislation despite opposition from Republicans. The cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet now threatens the stability of global ecosystems upon which humanity depends, scientists have said. Plastic pollution is now found from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. A British man who flew to the US, acquired a gun and took hostages at a Texas synagogue had a criminal record and an extensive history of mental health issues, the Guardian understands. Malik Faisal Akram was killed after a tense 11-hour hostage standoff at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue. Joss Whedon, the Buffy creator and director of films including The Avengers and Justice League, has responded to allegations of misconduct, denying claims from actors including Gal Gadot and Ray Fisher that he threatened and belittled them on set. Stat of the day: Prince estate valued at $156.4m at end of long legal battle The estate of the late pop singer Prince, including his catalogue of songs, has been valued at $156.4m (\u00a3114m), nearly double the figure arrived at by an earlier appraisal. The estate\u2019s administrator, Comerica Bank, agreed on the figure with the Internal Revenue Service and the heirs to Prince\u2019s estate. The singer died in 2016 without a will, and his estate will pass to three of his siblings as well as the publishing company Primary Wave, who in August 2021 bought rights to the Prince catalogue from another three heirs, two of them deceased. Don\u2019t miss this: The charming history of menopause and HRT For centuries the symptoms of menopause were documented, but women went through it with little intervention. It wasn\u2019t until the advent of science as we know it that physicians (all male at the time, obviously) started more commonly \u201ctreating\u201d its symptoms. Suffice it to say, the history of misogyny in medicine goes way, way back, all founded in the idea of women as inferior, and of menstrual blood as evil and poisonous. Climate check: How Exxon is leveraging Texas courts to silence its climate critics ExxonMobil is attempting to use an unusual Texas law to target and intimidate its critics, claiming that lawsuits against the company over its long history of downplaying and denying the climate crisis violate the US constitution\u2019s guarantees of free speech. The US\u2019s largest oil firm is asking the Texas supreme court to allow it to use the law, known as rule 202, to pursue legal action against more than a dozen California municipal officials. Last Thing: Marlon Bundo, Pence family pet rabbit and unlikely star of gay rights book, dies Marlon Bundo, the family pet rabbit of the former vice-president Mike Pence, has died, marking the end of an unlikely career as a prominent gay rights figure in the US. Political pets are a common theme in American politics but Bundo\u2019s high media profile was unusual. Firstly, he featured in a series of children\u2019s books written by the second family. Secondly, as a parody of Pence\u2019s deep social conservatism, Bundo was also the main theme of a satirical book by the comedian John Oliver that chronicled his search for a same-sex bunny partner.

            "date": "2022-01-18T07:00:48Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden ends his first year in office at a particularly bleak moment for a US president who promised competency and normalcy. Much of his domestic agenda is stalled on Capitol Hill, impeded by members of his own party. The virus is once again raging out of control: daily infections of Covid-19 have soared to record levels, hospitalizing more Americans than at any previous point during the pandemic. The administration\u2019s vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers was blocked by the supreme court\u2019s conservative supermajority. Inflation is at a nearly 40-year high. Diplomatic talks have so far failed to pull Russia back from the brink of war with Ukraine. After winning more votes than any presidential candidate in American history, Biden is now \u2013 just 12 months later \u2013 one of the country\u2019s most unpopular presidents. For months, Biden\u2019s approval ratings have languished in the mid to low 40s, with an average approval rating of 42%. A Quinnipiac poll released last week found him at a dire 33%, which the White House has dismissed as an outlier. Nevertheless, among his modern predecessors, only Donald Trump fared worse at this point in their presidencies. The puzzle of Biden\u2019s unpopularity has many pieces, pollsters and political analysts say. How much of it is within his control is difficult to say. Biden came to office with lofty ambitions: he promised to lift the threat of deadly virus and to usher in a new era of responsive governance and bipartisanship in Washington. One year into his presidency, Biden remains confronted by an unabating pandemic, a nation still very much divided and a Republican party that continues to embrace the \u201cbig lie\u201d that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. \u201cWhenever a president disappoints expectations, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Bill Galston, a senior fellow of governance studies at the Brookings Institution who also served as a White House policy adviser to former President Clinton. Galston said the administration had \u201cnot done a good job of managing expectations\u201d around Covid. In July, Biden came just shy of declaring \u201cindependence\u201d from the virus, only to be proven wrong by the arrival of the fast-spreading Delta variant. Now, amid a surge caused by the Omicron variant, the president and his team are recalibrating. Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease specialist, recently said that Omicron would \u201cfind just about everybody\u201d. Biden recently conceded that eradicating the virus was unlikely, but that it was possible to \u201ccontrol\u201d it. It is the case for swing voters who believed Biden would govern as a centrist bridge-builder in an age of deep division, Galston continued, and for Democrats to whom Biden promised an ambitious legislative agenda despite holding wafer-thin margins in Congress. Sarah Longwell, a prominent anti-Trump Republican strategist, has observed support for the president decline among voters in the focus groups she has convened over the past year. When asked to grade Biden\u2019s first year, many voters she spoke to, including Democrats, gave him Cs, Ds and Fs. The grades, Longwell said, were not a reflection of Biden, who she said many are still \u201crooting for\u201d, but of a shared discontent as the pandemic enters its third year and inflation continues to rise. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of it that has nothing to do with Joe Biden,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tough time.\u201d Asked about Biden\u2019s gloomy reviews, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, offered a similar explanation. \u201cPeople are fatigued across the country. It\u2019s impacting how they live, how they work. There are worries about their kids, their ability to experience joyful things in life like concerts and going to restaurants and seeing friends,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cWe understand that.\u201d \u201cThe president knows that the best, most important step he can take is to continue to fight to get the pandemic under control and also to lower costs for Americans across the country,\u201d she added. Biden\u2019s popularity began to slip as the Delta variant of Covid-19 spread across the country, then falling sharply after the US\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 service members were killed by a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport. Though a majority of Americans favored withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, the desperate scenes from Kabul as the Taliban took control undercut perceptions of Biden as a seasoned foreign policy expert who would restore America\u2019s standing on the world stage. \u201cThe way in which we left Afghanistan inflicted a blow on the president\u2019s general image of experience and competence, which had a lingering effect,\u201d Galston said. Historically, voters tend to punish the president\u2019s party in the first midterm elections after a new administration takes power. But the defeats tend to be steeper when a president is unpopular. According to Gallup polling, presidents with job approval ratings below 50% have seen their parties lose an average of 37 House seats during the midterm elections. Already Republicans\u2019 unexpected strength last year in off-cycle elections in states Biden won by wide margins in 2020 \u2013 like Virginia and New Jersey \u2013 has delivered a stark warning of a dangerous future to Democrats. The results suggested that the resistance-driven passion that drove Democratic victories during the Trump era had fizzled. Perhaps most alarming for Democrats was the electorate\u2019s deep sense of malaise. Despite a mass vaccination campaign and trillions of dollars in relief money, voters feel worse now about the state of the pandemic and the economy than they did earlier in Biden\u2019s presidency, according to a CBS News/YouGov survey. Few voters give Biden credit for muscling through a trillion-dollar investment in the nation\u2019s infrastructure or passing the American Rescue Plan, which sent checks to most Americans and slashed poverty rates. \u201cIt\u2019s an ironic situation where the policies are more popular than the politicians, which is very rare,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster. \u201cUsually it\u2019s the other way around.\u201d Further capturing that frustration, a Gallup poll released on Monday found a dramatic shift in party preference over the last year, swinging from a nine-point Democratic advantage at the beginning of 2021 to a five-point Republican advantage by the end of the year. The change follows the collapse of Biden\u2019s presidential approval ratings. This augurs poorly for Democrats, leaving a narrowing window to deliver on their campaign promises, from Build Back Better to voting rights and immigration reform. Messy intra-party negotiations over Biden\u2019s sprawling climate and social policy bill overshadowed the policy, leaving the public with a shallow understanding of its contents and concern over its cost. The legislation remains in limbo after Senator Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, announced he could not support the measure in its current form. Amid the stalemate over his agenda, Democrats have become disenchanted with Biden. For months, Democratic lawmakers and activists have been sounding the alarm that the president is losing support among key segments of party\u2019s coalition. He is bleeding support among young voters angry over inaction on climate change, health care and student debt forgiveness. Hispanic voters have lost confidence in Biden\u2019s handling of the pandemic and the economy, a red flag for Democrats after they shifted toward Trump and the Republican party in 2020. And support has been sliding among Black voters, who were critical to Biden\u2019s victory but have been disappointed by the lack of progress on voting rights and police reform. In an attempt to reset, Biden recently delivered a pair of searing speeches, during which he implored the Senate to pass federal voting rights legislation and assailed Republicans \u2013 or any senator \u2013 who stood in the way of siding with Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis. Many Democrats cheered Biden\u2019s rhetorical shift, but some civil rights leaders and voting rights advocates boycotted the speech in Atlanta to express disapproval of what they view as a belated push on an issue that is paramount for their communities and the functioning of democracy itself. In a statement, the president of the NAACP, Derrick Johnson, said it was past time for the administration to \u201cmatch their words with actions\u201d. Two days later, Biden\u2019s efforts to push voting rights protections through Congress foundered amid Democratic opposition to scrapping the filibuster. Though not all the variables are within Biden\u2019s control, Lake said there is still plenty of time \u2013 and opportunities \u2013 to improve his standing before the midterms in November. She said the president\u2019s newly emboldened tone was a good start, that would help to \u201cenergize\u201d Democrats while signalling \u201cstrength\u201d to wary independents. \u201cHe\u2019s in leadership mode now,\u201d she said. Lorella Praeli, co-president of the progressive group Community Change Action said voters need to see Biden fighting on their behalf. She urged the president to use every executive tool at his disposal to ease the financial pressures facing millions of Americans, like canceling student debt, as he continues to push for a path forward on Build Back Better, voting rights and immigration reform. Part of the challenge for Biden, she said, is to convince a demoralized public that \u201cthe future is still up for grabs\u201d. \u201cFight for people, deliver for people and then make sure they know what has happened,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really that simple.\u201d"
