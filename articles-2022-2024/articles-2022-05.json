            "date": "2022-05-06T11:40:45Z",
            "content": "Polly Toynbee: Does Boris Johnson survive this? Labour must certainly hope so Symbols matter, so Labour\u2019s victories in Westminster (wow!), Wandsworth (ha!) and Barnet (speaks to progress on antisemitism) give a fine fillip to the party\u2019s fortunes. Wins in Cumberland and Southampton augur well. It\u2019s too early in the day to know how close Labour is to becoming the biggest party at the next election, but the Liberal Democrat revival gnawing at Tory votes helps. Conservative councillors went over the top defenceless, lambs to the slaughter. But they deserve every loss, after tolerating intolerable 50% cuts to their council budgets without rebelling against their Westminster party. They blame their leader\u2019s collapsed ratings and the cost of living crisis, but don\u2019t pity Tories reaping their own whirlwind: their MPs and local parties cynically chose a rogue prime minister, knowing his egregious unfitness for office. Now he\u2019s their loser, Tory ex-council leaders line up to call for his head. If final results suggest Brexit divides still lurk, especially in the north, the Tories may keep Johnson hoping he can rekindle old passions. Labour should hope they do, as his negatives far outweigh the dying embers of Brexit passions. However, fire in the belly is what the official opposition lacks right now: time to let the frontbench off their tight leash of disciplined messaging for more forthright speaking from the heart. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist James Johnson: The Tories are in denial about the scale of the problem they face Faced with the results today, some Conservatives are saying all is well. This is wrong. Of course, these results are not a sign of a seismic Labour recovery, or a Blair-like storming to power for Keir Starmer. Though Labour made gains, they were not enough to win back areas like those it lost back in 2005 and 2010, like Nuneaton and Peterborough. But Labour does not need a Blair-sized victory to deprive the Conservatives of power: it can do so while being behind on votes, come a general election. The Conservative vote is in trouble on two fronts. Most stark is the serious attrition in London and the south, especially in areas with more educated and middle-class voters: to go backwards by so much in these areas spells serious trouble for southern marginals at the next election. To simply write off a Labour advance with the middle classes as Starmer being a \u201cmetropolitan elite\u201d \u2013 as one Tory source has \u2013 is to misunderstand the Conservative victory in 2019, where the party was able to carry southern seats as well as northern ones. And there are plenty of middle-class voters in the \u201cred wall\u201d too. Nor were the results good for the Conservatives in the red wall. Again, key here are the 2018 council elections, not the 2019 general election. Labour standing still (as it did in Hartlepool), making gains (Dudley), or even going slightly backwards (Sandwell) is a good result for the party. Why? Because in 2018 it held the northern and Midlands seats that Boris Johnson went on to win a year later. In other words Labour is currently doing as well as it did before it \u201clost\u201d the red wall in 2019. Today, some Conservatives \u2013 whether wilfully or not \u2013 are in denial about the scale of that problem, especially those most loyal to No 10. But since January, the interests of Boris Johnson and the Conservative party have become disconnected. If Conservatives want to win again at the next general election, they will need to come to that realisation \u2013 or risk sleepwalking into national defeat. \u2022 James Johnson is a former Downing Street pollster who worked under Theresa May and now runs JL Partners Amna Ahmad: It\u2019s clear the Lib Dems offer the alternative that many voters are looking for At the time of writing, Liberal Democrats across the country are jubilant. Gains have been made in traditionally Conservative and Labour areas in the capital, such as Merton and Brent, with astonishing wins in places such as Richmond and Kingston-upon-Hull. This follows on the heels of \u201cblue wall\u201d byelection wins in Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire in 2021. More local election results are still to be announced, but we are delighted with the wins. It is usually foolhardy to directly equate local and national politics, but this time it felt different. Voters told me that they were worried about rising inflation, spiralling energy costs and, in the wake of Partygate, couldn\u2019t help but feel that the Conservative cabinet was only looking out for itself. Councillors \u2013 current, new and former \u2013 have told me that cash is desperately needed from central government to do more for those most in need \u2013 but that local government is seen as a low national priority. I\u2019ve noticed ethnic minority communities feeling let down by promises of a Brexit \u201cdividend\u201d that never transpired, and anecdotal evidence of particularly low voter turnout among these groups. It\u2019s clear that the Lib Dems provided an alternative for many thousands across the country. Neither Boris Johnson nor Keir Starmer can claim an outright win today, despite reasonable results in parts of the country. This makes the next 12 months, in the runup to the next local elections and a rumoured general election, a critical time. Today\u2019s results show us that people are looking for a new political home. Expect more upsets. \u2022 Amna Ahmad is vice-president of the Liberal Democrat party Owen Jones: Labour bet the farm on Starmer \u2013 and despite the \u2018long Corbyn\u2019 excuse, he is not enough The political conditions for Labour could hardly be more fortuitous. We have a Tory government enveloped in a scandal over systematically breaking its own laws during a national emergency, riddled with sleaze, led by a man whose own admirers acknowledge is a stranger to honesty, and overseeing the worst squeeze in living standards in modern history. In midterm, too, voters are well-disposed to give the incumbents a kicking. First, Labour\u2019s good news: the Tories have collapsed in London. Wandsworth, the laboratory of Thatcherism; Westminster, whose former leader Shirley Porter from the 1980s was best known for gerrymandering; and Barnet are now all red. A long-term trend must be acknowledged in a city with an increasingly young, diverse, working-class population defined by a housing crisis. But piling up votes in the capital is no compensation for going backwards in England. \u201cLong Corbyn\u201d is given as the reason by Labour politicians and commentators, a bizarre excuse for doing worse in English boroughs than Keir Starmer\u2019s predecessor did in 2018. The Labour leader\u2019s brazen discarding of his leadership pitch \u2013 radical policies fused with party unity \u2013 in favour of a vision-free offer and relentless punching left has not delivered the electoral goods. The rise of the Greens is just one sign that marginalised progressive voters were already looking elsewhere. Perhaps a cost-of-living crisis set to rob the pockets of millions is Starmer\u2019s lifeboat, allowing him to win by default without offering any inspiring plan for the country he seeks to lead. Maybe, but Labour have bet the farm on a leader as devoid of principle as he is of charisma, mopping up purely because of Tory failure. It is clearly not enough. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"

            "date": "2022-05-09T21:08:24Z",
            "content": "Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, has won a landslide presidential election victory, signalling an extraordinary rehabilitation for one of the country\u2019s most notorious political families. With more than 90% of an initial count concluded, Marcos Jr had almost 30 million votes, more than double the tally of his closest rival, the current vice-president, Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer. Supporters dressed in red shirts, his campaign colour, gathered outside his camp\u2019s headquarters in Mandaluyong City on Monday night, waving the flag of the Philippines as passing cars sounded their horns. Marcos Jr thanked volunteers and political leaders \u201cthat have cast their lot with us\u201d in a late-night video message, but he stopped short of claiming victory. \u201cLet\u2019s wait until it\u2019s very clear, until the count reaches 100%, then we can celebrate,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t get tired of trusting us,\u201d Marcos also told supporters in remarks streamed on Facebook. \u201cWe have plenty of things to do,\u201d he said, adding \u201can endeavour as large as this does not involve one person.\u201d Marcos Jr, 64, ran with the slogan \u201cTogether we shall rise again\u201d, invoking nostalgia for his father\u2019s authoritarian regime, which the family and its supporters have portrayed as a golden era in a campaign fuelled by online disinformation as social media has been flooded with false stories that have swept aside the atrocities and corruption widespread during the period. Such portrayals have horrified survivors of Marcos Sr\u2019s brutal regime. Thousands of political opponents were tortured, arrested and disappeared under his rule, while as much as $10bn (\u00a38bn) was plundered. Marcos Sr was ousted in the People Power revolution in 1986, when the family was humiliatingly airlifted from the presidential palace by helicopter, and fled into exile. Ever since, say analysts, the Marcoses have sought to rebrand themselves and regain their place in politics. \u201cThe disinformation infrastructure has been there for a long time. It\u2019s not as if it just sprouted during this campaign. The Marcoses\u2019 plan to reach the presidency has been in action for decades,\u201d said Aries Arugay, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who is based in Manila. Marcos Jr had maintained a clear lead over his opponents in surveys conducted in the run-up to the vote, with Robredo second. A former human rights lawyer who has advocated for marginalised groups, she campaigned on a promise of good governance and an end to corruption. People began lining up to vote before polling centres opened at 6am local time (2300 BST) on Monday morning, and some waited more than four hours in the heat as malfunctioning voting machines caused delays. The vote followed three months of fierce campaigning, in which 2 million Robredo volunteers launched an unprecedented door-to-door campaign to try to win over voters and counter the onslaught of online disinformation. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Robredo delivered a statement to her supporters, saying the voice of the people was \u201cgetting clearer and clearer.\u201d \u201cIn the name of the Philippines, which I know you also love so dearly, we should hear this voice because in the end, we only have this one nation to share.\u201d She told her supporters that a movement had been born, and said the fight for reforms would not end with the elections. \u201cPress for the truth. It took long for the structure of lies to be erected. We have the time and opportunity now to fight and dismantle this.\u201d On Tuesday in Manila, crowds, many wearing black, gathered in front of the Comelec office, the Commission on Elections, protesting against the return of the Marcoses and alleging cheating. Marcos Jr\u2019s candidacy has polarised opinion, and some do not believe that the family has plundered state wealth, despite court rulings at home and abroad. At Santa Ana elementary school, in a residential area of Manila, which opened as a polling station, Raquel Deguzaman, 59, said she supported Marcos Jr and did not believe the family was corrupt. \u201c[Marcos Sr] was able to help the Philippines. He\u2019s really good,\u201d she said, adding that he had built infrastructure, including hospitals. Jack Drescher, 58, who was on his way to vote, also cited the building of infrastructure under Marcos Sr as a reason for backing his son. He was not concerned about corruption within the family, he said. \u201cHe has a lot of gold so he won\u2019t steal any money,\u201d he said, adding that he had heard this from YouTube. A myth claiming that the Marcoses own large stashes of gold has circulated online in various forms for years, including the claim that it will be given back to the people if the family is returned to power. Although Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised online campaign, he was the overwhelming beneficiary of false claims circulating on social media. The majority of disinformation was either designed to undermine Robredo\u2019s reputation or enhance the images of the Marcoses, according to analysis by the fact-checking coalition Tsek.ph, which monitored disinformation in the run-up to the election. Marcos Jr has avoided TV debates and challenging media interviews ahead of the election, and his campaign has been thin on policy detail. The idea that Marcos Sr\u2019s rule was a prosperous and peaceful era appeals to a generation of voters who did not live through Marcos Sr\u2019s martial law regime, including those who \u201cmay harbour deep dissatisfaction with the non-inclusive development of the past 30 or so years,\u201d said Ronald Mendoza, dean of Manila\u2019s Ateneo school of government. Cleo Anne A Calimbahin, an associate professor of political science at De La Salle University Manila, said the results should not come as a surprise but that they were sobering. They reflected in part a growing frustration among the public with previous administrations. \u201cI think this is a response of a public that saw the lack of progress made since 1986,\u201d said Calimbahin, referencing the People Power revolution that put the Philippines on the road to democracy, a process that has not been linear. \u201cUnfortunately, the reforms agenda and its inability to deliver since 1986 has made people even wary of reformist candidates,\u201d said Calimbahin. The election winner will take office on 30 June for a single six-year term."

            "date": "2022-05-29T23:45:35Z",
            "content": "Colombia\u2019s election will go to a runoff between two opposing anti-establishment candidates on 19 June after voters on Sunday were unable to pick a president outright. Gustavo Petro, a leftist former guerrilla and onetime mayor of Bogot\u00e1, won the largest share of the vote, with 40%, but fell short of the 50% required to win outright and prevent a second round. Petro\u2019s rival in the runoff will be Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez, a business magnate and social media firebrand, who is viewed as a conservative, populist outsider. Voters in the South American country went to the polls amid a polarized environment and growing discontent over increasing inequality and inflation. Hern\u00e1ndez was a relative unknown until surging in polls ahead of the election. His campaign \u2013 largely carried out on TikTok \u2013 has been criticised for being light on policies and heavy on anti-establishment populism. He won 28% of the vote on Sunday. \u201cToday the nation of workers, of honesty, won,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said in a speech published on his Facebook page on Sunday evening. \u201cToday the nation won that doesn\u2019t want to go on, even for one more day, with the same [people] that got us in the painful situation that we are in.\u201d Federico Gutierrez, the rightwing former mayor of Medell\u00edn widely seen as a continuation of the current government of term-limited president Iv\u00e1n Duque, underperformed on Sunday, having only picked up 23% of the vote. He could prove kingmaker in the second-round as his supporters are likely to switch to Hern\u00e1ndez. Petro, who has been a frontrunner in the polls for months, came second in the 2018 election. He has promised to make significant adjustments to the economy, including tax reform, and to change how Colombia fights drug cartels and other armed groups. If he is able to beat Hern\u00e1ndez in June, it would be the first time the South American nation has a president from the left. Petro\u2019s running mate Francia M\u00e1rquez is already making history as the first black female vice-presidential candidate. Petro cast his vote in Bogot\u00e1, after initially having to dart home to pick up the ID card he\u2019d forgotten and needed to vote, to shouts of \u201cPetro for president!\u201d from his supporters. \u201cI believe in Colombia, the peaceful dream, beautiful, fair, and full of work and knowledge,\u2019 Petro wrote in a brief handwritten letter posted to social media on Sunday morning. \u201cI believe it\u2019s time to make dreams come true.\u201d Also on the ballot on Sunday was Colombia\u2019s fragile peace process with the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), who demobilised after a peace deal was signed in 2016, ending decades of civil war that killed over 260,000 and displaced 7 million people. State forces and their paramilitary allies contributed to the violence. Petro is a fervent supporter of the deal, while the vanquished Gutierrez is seen as a skeptic. Hern\u00e1ndez has pledged to support the deal, though critics say the septuagenerian businessman could shift that position as he seeks to build a right-wing coalition. \u201cWe know that Petro stands with the poor,\u201d said Ana Romero, a student from Bogot\u00e1, outside a polling station on Sunday afternoon. \u201cNobody knows anything about Rodolfo [Hern\u00e1ndez].\u201d Voting took place on Sunday amid fears of political violence, though authorities reported that no major violent incidents linked to the election. M\u00e1rquez voted in her home town in the conflict-ridden Cauca province, accompanied by police officers with bulletproof shields, while Petro has campaigned from behind a phalanx of bodyguards. The National Liberation Army (ELN), another leftist rebel group, announced a ceasefire in the run-up to Sunday\u2019s vote, but other factions and criminal groups have routinely targeted political candidates and polling stations in recent years. The surge in anti-establishment campaigns squares with a public cleaved apart by social unrest. Mass protests against inequality last year shutdown cities across the country. A recent Gallup poll found that 75% of respondents felt their country was going in the wrong direction. That discontent was felt at the ballot box. \u201cColombians are demanding a change of the socio-economic paradigm that will dictate the public policies for the next four years, but most importantly a change that restores their hope; hope for better days, for a better social environment with less corruption and more equality,\u201d said Silvana Amaya, a senior analyst at risk consultancy firm Control Risks, ahead of the election."

            "title": "Revealed: election conspiracy theorists work as election officials across Georgia",
            "date": "2022-05-13T11:32:07Z",
            "content": "The effort to install local election officials who promote Donald Trump\u2019s lie that the 2020 election was stolen has seen particular success in the crucial swing state of Georgia, where at least eight county election officials are promoters of the falsehood, a Guardian investigation has found. The officials span the state, from suburban counties outside Atlanta to rural counties near the Tennessee and Alabama borders. All have substantial power over the administration of local, state and national elections in their counties, often with little oversight beyond scantly attended public meetings and small-town newspapers. They include: \u2022 one election official who has posted in support of a discredited election conspiracist who believes the alleged presence of bamboo in paper ballots is proof they came from Asia, and thus show interference from China; \u2022 two officials who tried, on the basis of bogus fraud allegations, to decertify the results of the January 2021 runoff that resulted in the election of the state\u2019s first Black senator; \u2022 one official who insisted that Georgia\u2019s election laws needed to change if Republicans were going to \u201chave a shot\u201d at winning future elections. All continue to serve in their appointed positions as county election board officials in Floyd, Forsyth, Gwinnett, Hall, Jackson, Lumpkin and Spalding counties. None responded to requests for comment from the Guardian. The investigation looked at seven counties out of 159, meaning the number of election officials who support election conspiracy theories could be much higher. \u201cThese disturbing facts bring to light what we\u2019ve known for a while: support for the big lie is growing \u2013 the result of powerful political actors stoking a dangerous fire,\u201d the voting rights group New Georgia Project said in a statement. \u201cThere is absolutely no place on our boards of elections, or in any of our elected offices, for leaders who refuse to accept the results of fair and certified elections.\u201d Election boards have access to voter rolls, and make rules about polling places, ballots and voter registration. They also make determinations on ballots in which the voters\u2019 intention is unclear. The boards seat between four and five members, usually split evenly between the two main parties with a tie-breaking, \u201cnon-partisan\u201d member often chosen by the county commission or a local judge. With 159 counties, Georgia therefore has hundreds of county election board officials, creating and changing election policy on a weekly basis with little other than local activists and press to track them. Among them is Dottie Krull, a 79-year-old Republican on the Lumpkin county election board, located a little over an hour north of Atlanta. Shortly after the 2020 election, Krull began posting about the big lie on her personal Facebook page. \u201cI guess we all know why Biden stayed in his basement and didn\u2019t campaign,\u201d Krull quoted a friend as saying. \u201cHe knew he didn\u2019t need to.\u201d In Forsyth county, elections board member Joel Natt was present on a conference call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and other election officials when he blamed unspecified election \u201cirregularities\u201d as a reason why Georgians of both parties were becoming \u201cless and less trusting\u201d of Raffensperger\u2019s office. In Floyd county, Pam Peters was described by an election conspiracy theorist who spoke to the Washington Post as an \u201cinvestigative partner\u201d. Days before election day, Peters volunteered for Trump in Rome, Georgia. In Hall county, elections board member Tom Smiley said he took issue with claims that the 2020 election saw no fraud, saying he would amend it to \u201cNO FRAUD DISCOVERED\u201d. Perhaps no elections board official has been the subject of as much controversy as Alice O\u2019Lenick, chair of the Gwinnett county board of registration. O\u2019Lenick has been a vocal supporter of restrictions to poll access and voting rights, her critics say. In 2016, O\u2019Lenick opposed the use of Spanish-language ballots. (The county was eventually forced to include them by the US Census Bureau under the Voting Rights Act.) She has also supported the abolition of so-called \u201cno excuse\u201d absentee voting, advocating that only the elderly or infirm would be allowed to fill out an absentee ballot; opposed the use of drop boxes, alleging spurious claims of ballot harvesting; served on a task force that recommended sweeping changes to voting rights so Republicans could \u201cat least have a shot\u201d at winning elections; and alleged without providing direct evidence that Gwinnett county saw an uptick in attempted voting by undocumented immigrants. In Spalding county, election board chair Ben Johnson continues to post prolifically about a wide variety of far-right conspiracy theories, including those involving alleged ballot harvesting and Dominion voting machines. In late April, Johnson shared a photo from a Canadian news outlet that had been altered to proclaim that conspiracy theorists \u201ckeep getting things right\u201d. In Jackson county, Republican election board officials Larry Ewing and Jeff Hughes, after a campaign by the national conservative group True the Vote, forced an investigation into 211 people who had voted after recently changing their address, in the unsubstantiated belief that up to 2,000 Jackson county residents who had recently changed their addresses could have voted illegally. The pair also refused to certify the runoff election of Raphael Warnock, the state\u2019s first Black senator, until the 211 names were passed on to the secretary of state for further investigation. The results were eventually certified with their dissent. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how widespread the election fraud lies have taken hold in the area,\u201d said Pete Fuller, chair of the Jackson county Democratic party. \u201cIt\u2019s very disconcerting how effective the misinformation has been.\u201d"

Raffensperger, who oversaw three recounts of the presidential vote, all of which affirmed Joe Biden\u2019s victory, refused the request, enraging Trump. That phone call is now at the center of what may be the most important primary election this year. Raffensperger is running for re-election as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state and Trump is seeking to oust him from office. He wants to replace him with Jody Hice, a Republican congressman who has said the election was stolen and joined efforts to overturn it. It\u2019s one of several races across the country in which Trump is seeking to install allies in important election administration positions in which they could throw out the results of a future election. Georgia\u2019s race is especially significant \u2013 it\u2019s the only place where Trump is seeking to punish a statewide Republican election official for explicitly refusing his request to subvert democracy. It could determine whether the person overseeing the next presidential election in Georgia is someone who prevented an election from being overturned or someone who tried to overturn the last one. Election day is 24 May and the race is very close, recent polling shows. Whoever wins will oversee elections in Georgia, which has emerged in recent years as ground zero in fights over election rules. The state has long been seen as a Republican bastion, but in recent years non-white voters have been exercising new levels of political power. It is now a political battleground after Democrats won the presidential race and two Senate seats last year. \u201cAll eyes should be on this race between Raffensperger and Hice,\u201d said Joanna Lydgate, CEO of States United Action, which is tracking election deniers running for office across the country. \u201cGeorgia was a place in 2020 where we watched three statewide elected officials stand up and protect the vote, protect the will of the voters. If we want to see that happen again in 2024, if there are further efforts to undermine our elections and the results and ultimately the will of American voters, we need to make sure that we\u2019re electing people who fundamentally believe in the system.\u201d She noted all three officials who refused to overturn the election in 2020 \u2013 the governor, attorney general and secretary of state \u2013 are up for re-election. *** Raffensperger, a mild-mannered engineer, is an odd fit to be at the center of a race for US democracy. He\u2019s not a flamethrower and he\u2019s a little bit awkward as a politician, occasionally stumbling over his words. He can land a political punch, but is more comfortable discussing trusses and beams and quoting Ecclesiastes and CS Lewis. One day in early May, Raffensperger stood in front of the federal courthouse in Atlanta, a wrinkle or two in his red tie, as he raised his voice to speak over nearby construction. After speaking and taking questions for about 10 minutes, he darted off from the podium, down the steps, and hurried back toward his office at the Georgia capitol. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer through and through and so sometimes I\u2019m not as eloquent with my words as I need to be,\u201d he said the next day. He also has wholeheartedly championed traditional Republican efforts to restrict voting access. He is a staunch defender of a new Georgia law that bans handing out food or water to people standing in line to vote. He believes Georgia should get rid of no-excuse mail-in voting. He also supports getting rid of a federal blackout period that prevents people from being purged from the voter rolls within 90 days of an election. The centerpiece of his campaign is preventing non-citizen voting, which is virtually nonexistent, according to Raffensperger\u2019s own office. Ns\u00e9 Ufot, CEO of the non-partisan New Georgia Project, which works on voter registration in the state, said Raffensperger had received national praise for not overturning the election, \u201cas if that alone is the litmus test as to whether someone is a vote suppressor or not\u201d. \u201cHe did not break the law that one time. That does not mean that he does not align with the party\u2019s priorities and with their lies and rhetoric about voting,\u201d she said. Raffensperger\u2019s focus on non-citizen voting in particular shows how he is pandering to his party, said Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University. \u201cHe is looking for a low-cost symbolic gesture that I think he hopes will restore his conservative bona fides among people who questioned them because he didn\u2019t overturn the results of the 2020 election,\u201d she said. Raffensperger has refused to back down from his defense of the 2020 election, essentially betting that voters will re-elect him for doing his job and standing up to Trump, even if they support the former president. At the event in Washington, Raffensperger methodically laid out his case for upholding the results of the 2020 election to the small crowd (there was a competing baseball game and awards dinner that night). He relied on statistics: 28,000 Georgia voters skipped the presidential election but voted down ballot, Raffensperger said, repeating a statistic he frequently mentions on the campaign trail. Republican members of Congress got 33,000 more votes in Georgia than Trump did, he said. Republican state senators got 400,000 more votes than Trump, he added. He then detailed how he looked into Trump\u2019s claims of election fraud. When Trump said thousands of dead people voted in 2020, Raffensperger\u2019s office investigated and found just four. Then Trump said more than 2,000 felons voted in the 2020 election. Raffensperger investigated and found that there were possibly 74. Trump then said 2,423 non-registered voters cast a ballot in 2020. Raffensperger investigated and found there were zero. Then Trump started saying machines were flipping votes and Raffensperger did a hand recount of all 5m ballots cast in the state and found the results were essentially the same. It was one of three ballot counts in the state that affirmed Biden\u2019s victory there. \u201cEvery allegation that was made, we checked it all out. As an engineer, you want to make sure you check it out, right? Because you don\u2019t want to look foolish,\u201d he said later. Raffensperger doesn\u2019t say it outright, but it seems that a central bet of his campaign is that the truth about the 2020 campaign will prevail. He is betting on voters like Carolee Curti, an 82-year-old retiree who lives in Rome, a city in deeply Republican north-west Georgia, who voted for him. At the early voting site where she voted, signs dotted the parking lot for Hice and Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman who represents the district. There were none for Raffensperger. \u201cI felt that under all that pressure, he did a good job,\u201d she said after casting her vote. \u201cI know it upset Trump, and I\u2019m a Trump person, but fair is fair.\u201d Kenneth Studdard, 56, who owns Dogwood Books in Rome, also said he liked Trump, and said he would probably vote for Raffensperger, though he wasn\u2019t following the race too closely yet. \u201cI think he did a good job. I think the other guy\u2019s running more for spite,\u201d he said. *** It seems unlikely that Hice, a pastor and former radio host, would be running absent the myth of a stolen election. He has built his entire campaign around the idea. This contrast was on full display during a candidate debate in Atlanta in early May. Hice repeated a number of lies about the 2020 election and said that Raffensperger created so-called ballot harvesting in Georgia (Raffensperger supported a 2019 law that outlawed third-party collection of mail-in ballots). He claimed Raffensperger had made a deal with Stacey Abrams to weaken signature matching standards in the state (a 2020 court settlement required that multiple election officials check a signature before it was rejected and notify the voter before rejecting it). Hice also criticised Raffensperger for sending out mail-in ballot applications during the election (Raffensperger sent out mail-in ballot applications to all Georgia voters during the state\u2019s 2020 primary, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but did not do so during the general election). After the debate, Hice told a small gaggle of reporters that nothing would convince him the 2020 election results were accurate. \u201cI would not have certified them without getting first, an absolute understanding of what an accurate election result was,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election was just overwhelmed with fraudulent activity. There\u2019s nothing that can change my opinion of that.\u201d If elected secretary of state, it could be Hice on the other end the next time Trump, or another politician, calls with a request to find votes. Hice didn\u2019t answer how he would handle such a request, but said he didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it in 2020. \u201cAbsolutely, there was nothing wrong with that request,\u201d Hice said. \u201cHe was not saying \u2018go out and find illegal ballots for me.\u2019 He was saying look at all the fraud that\u2019s out here. Do your job. Make sure we have legal ballots that are cast, legal ballots that are counted, and had Brad done so, I believe the outcome would have been different.\u201d Trump\u2019s phone call was not a generalized request to investigate. When Raffensperger and a lawyer told the president they had probed his allegations, the president said refused to accept it. \u201cI won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There\u2019s no way I lost Georgia. There\u2019s no way,\u201d Trump said. Hice\u2019s message that resonated with Mike Albright, 62, who voted for Hice in the Atlanta suburbs. \u201cI was very disappointed by the last election. I didn\u2019t think the results were honest. I think there was a lot of corruption that went on. And the current secretary of state didn\u2019t know how to do an adequate investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think his audits were adequate. They weren\u2019t real audits. Basically, they didn\u2019t confirm that voters were really voters.\u201d In Rome, Tom and Emily Saltino also voted for Hice. They said they were unconvinced Trump lost the 2020 election in Georgia because they had seen the large crowds of people that came to see him when he visited the state. \u201c[There were] a lot of things he could have done, it seems, that was not done to satisfy the masses that everything was on the up and up\u201d, Tom, 84, said. \u201cI just think that position needs to be cleaned up, somebody new come in.\u201d Emily added she would not vote for Raffensperger in November if he won the Republican nomination. During the debate, Raffensperger pointed out repeatedly that Hice was lying, but at times even he seemed exasperated by trying to convince people that was the case. \u201cThe real problem that you have gets down to basic honesty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets down to, it was actual, total, disinformation, misinformation, outright lying. And there\u2019s not much I can do about that,\u201d he said. \u201cJody Hice has been running from one rumor to another for the last 18 months. And how can you have confidence when people that should be holding a responsible position as a sitting congressman should be telling the truth?\u201d *** Talking with the bartender in Washington, Raffensperger defended his decision to stand up to Trump. \u201cI wanted to make sure I was respectful to President Trump\u2019s position of authority,\u201d he began. \u201cHe was disappointed. But I\u2019ve been disappointed in life. I haven\u2019t won every football game or basketball game ever played. My volleyball team in high school wasn\u2019t that strong either, but we still played and had a good time. And when we lost, we tried harder.\u201d \u201cIt sounded like intimidation to me,\u201d the man said. \u201cI personally appreciate what you did very much. I hope you hear that all the time.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a good man,\u201d Raffensperger said back. \u201cGod bless you.\u201d Afterwards, Raffensperger lingered in the town square for a bit talking to voters as the sun set over the courthouse \u2013 the county\u2019s early voting site. He sounded like a man who was at peace with his decision to defy the leader of his party, even if it costs him his job. \u201cThose are all good people in there. And even people that can dog cuss you and the people that are mad, I keep in mind that they\u2019ve been lied to. I gently say misinformation, disinformation. People know that there weren\u2019t thousands of dead people,\u201d he said, swatting the occasional bug away. \u201cA person of integrity expects to be believed, and when he\u2019s not, he lets time prove him right. So time has proven me right.\u201d Raffensperger would not say whether he would vote for Trump again in 2024. And he declined to say whether he would vote for Hice if he gets the Republican nomination. \u201cAs secretary of state, I don\u2019t endorse candidates,\u201d he said. Even though he has received an onslaught of death threats and harassment since the 2020 election, Raffensperger doesn\u2019t really seem to have given much thought to the possibility of not running again. \u201cIf the good walk off the field and leave the field to the bad, then the bad wins,\u201d he said. But in his race, it\u2019s quite possible that lies could prevail. What message would it send if that happens? \u201cIt means that we need to do more rebuilding of ourselves individually,\u201d Raffensperger said."

            "content": "About the Northern Ireland assembly election The elections to the Northern Ireland assembly are quite different to most UK elections. Members of the assembly are elected to 18 multi-member constituencies by single transferable vote. Each constituency has five representatives, totalling 90 overall. Voters assign preferences to candidates on a ballot slip. If a candidate gets enough first-preference votes, they win a seat, and if not, second and then third preferences \u2013 and so on \u2013 are counted until all seats are filled. Because of this, multiple counts are needed in each constituency, which means results can take a while to compile. It is possible for the first count not to result in the award of a seat. Another consequence is that it is not clear whether a party has increased or decreased its total seats in a constituency or overall, until all seats have been awarded. By the terms of the Good Friday Agreement the government of Northern Ireland is shared between the two main communities: nationalists, who favour closer ties with the Republic of Ireland, and unionists, for whom Northern Ireland\u2019s position in the UK is more important. The largest party in the assembly appoints the first minister, and the largest party from the other community appoints the deputy first minister. Some parties with cross-community support or whose supporters do not identify strongly with either community think this arrangement perpetuates divisions, but in practice since 1998 the largest party has always been from the unionist community and the second-largest from the nationalist."

            "content": "The headlines describing the performance of the main parties in last week\u2019s local elections were undramatic, but they disguised a profound truth. The Conservatives suffered a dismal set of losses following the police fines for the prime minister and the chancellor for breaking the law during the pandemic. Labour achieved eye-catching success in London and made some progress elsewhere, but not enough for a party hoping to win an outright majority at the next general election. The Liberal Democrats went some way towards restoring their role as a repository of protest votes and as challenger to the Tories in swathes of the south and west. Nationalist parties performed well. The most important dimension of last Thursday\u2019s results is what they might mean for the country\u2019s constitutional settlement. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s success in the Northern Ireland assembly elections, coupled with the growing possibility of a Labour administration in Westminster contingent on SNP support, could have long-term and irreversible ramifications for the relationship between the UK\u2019s four constituent nations. The Tories have tried to shrug off their losses as the usual mid-term slump. But there are signs that these are indicators of structural rather than cyclical malaise. Boris Johnson is a deeply unpopular leader, and the Lib Dem resurgence is eating into the Conservative vote share. By the time of the next general election voters will be suffering even more as a result of unsustainably high energy, fuel and food costs. As Brexit has declined in salience as an issue for voters, the electoral coalition that Johnson so successfully forged off it in 2019 is looking more fragile. But the flip side is not Labour surging ahead in all the areas where the Conservatives are retreating; the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the SNP have benefited. There were bright spots for Labour: taking Westminster off the Tories to cement its dominance in London; good results in Wales; and the first tentative signs of a Scottish recovery. But these only translate into a moderate lead over the Conservatives and are not suggestive of a party on a trajectory to win an outright majority in the next general election. Expecting Labour to achieve this just five years after its worst election defeat since 1935 under Jeremy Corbyn would be a tall order. But Johnson has been beset by crisis after crisis, and Labour should be doing better given the state of the economy. Sir Keir Starmer has made important steps to distance himself from Corbyn on antisemitism within Labour and on foreign policy, but has struggled to articulate a positive vision. He seems much more comfortable defining himself by his opposition to Johnson and the left of his party than communicating what he stands for. Labour has to do more to convince the country that it has a positive vision for the future, and the policies to realise it. Labour\u2019s solid, but far from stellar, performance makes a hung parliament more likely, with a Labour government reliant on the SNP and the Lib Dems. Nicola Sturgeon is likely to demand another referendum on Scottish independence as the price of that support. She is out of step with the Scottish public on this \u2013 a survey for Scotland in Union out today suggests that fewer than a third of Scots back the SNP\u2019s policy for a referendum next year, and polling suggests that there is no pro-independence majority. But it is too close for comfort, and a second referendum would dominate UK politics for the years following the election, to the exclusion of other important issues. In Northern Ireland, the collapse in the DUP\u2019s vote paved the way for Sinn F\u00e9in to claim first place in elections to the Stormont assembly. This is no reflection of growing public support for Irish reunification \u2013 Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s vote share has increased only marginally since 2017 and support for a united Ireland has remained fairly consistent around the 30% mark in recent years. But it has huge implications for power-sharing in Stormont and the political stability of Northern Ireland. The DUP opposes the Northern Ireland protocol that introduced post-Brexit border checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK; Sinn F\u00e9in views it as an acceptable way out of the conundrum Brexit poses for the Good Friday agreement. The DUP will probably make Johnson breaking the protocol the condition of entering a power-sharing administration with Sinn F\u00e9in, which would lead to damaging retaliatory measures from the EU. Six years after the Brexit vote, it remains unclear how taking the UK out of the single market and customs union, thus requiring customs checks either on the island of Ireland or in the Irish Sea, could ever be consistent with power-sharing and consensual politics in Northern Ireland. The issue will only become more existential in the run-up to the end of 2024, the deadline for the Stormont assembly to vote on consent for the protocol to continue. Westminster politics is likely to continue to be dominated by allegations and counter-allegations about the breaking of Covid rules, and the announcement of and reaction to government policies with the sole purpose of distracting from bad economic news, such as its dreadful plans to forcibly deport asylum seekers to Rwanda and its destructive proposal to privatise Channel 4. But last week\u2019s results sound a warning note for any politician who supports the union: a more fragmentary politics across the whole country could undermine stability in Northern Ireland, and end up changing the shape of the UK forever. They ignore this at their peril."

            "content": "Boris Johnson has said the Conservatives took \u201ctough\u201d losses in the local elections, as Labour won key London seats and the Lib Dems and Greens made gains. Results in Scotland and Wales have started to come in and in Northern Ireland the results are expected from mid-afternoon. Here five people in England share their reaction to the results so far and speak about the factors that decided their vote. \u2018The new Green candidate is active and visible\u2019 This time I voted Green locally, although I usually vote Labour. I feel the world\u2019s problems are so beyond my control and this government infuriates me every day, so I decided to think very locally. The Greens have been quite active in my ward, Central St Leonards. They\u2019ve organised street cleaning parties and community events and are just involved in a way that I haven\u2019t picked up from the Labour party for a long time. They have been cruising along, I think. It\u2019s been the same people in control for years. Meanwhile, the Greens were knocking on doors and introducing themselves. I know it\u2019s either Labour or Tories nationally, so I usually vote Labour at general elections to try and keep the Tories out. But I\u2019m an environmentalist and the new Green candidate is active and visible. He\u2019s woken people up and even if he doesn\u2019t win it may shake up the Labour party locally. Sally Walton, 70, artist and radio DJ, St Leonards-on-Sea (Hastings \u2013 not yet declared) \u2018I will never vote Tory again\u2019 I live in Westminster and used to vote Tory until about 10 years ago when I felt they were failing to control capitalism and take global warming seriously. I loathe the whole party now and am absolutely appalled by their behaviour and aggression. It\u2019s horrific. There\u2019s so much to complain about \u2013 the corruption, lies and cronyism. Even Brexit was a huge nail in the coffin. I voted Labour during the local election this year in what was both a protest vote but also because I like [Keir] Starmer. He\u2019s not charismatic and he\u2019s low-profile but I like that and I believe the Labour party is righting the ship of state. I\u2019m delighted that Westminster is now Labour \u2013 I will never vote Tory again. Alaric, retired scientist, London (Westminster council \u2013 Con to Lab) \u2018I like our local Tory councillor but I voted for the Lib Dem candidate\u2019 I voted on local issues and to record dissatisfaction with the current government. Our local councillor is a Tory. He has been very effective and responsive to local people. However, I voted for the Lib Dem candidate since I could not bring myself to register a vote for Boris Johnson\u2019s government. Although the Lib Dem position on local housing development is not as strong as the Tory one, they represent the most palatable policies. I find myself getting more engaged in politics as I get older. I am pleased that the Tories have lost control in a number of areas, and more so that the party seems to now be acknowledging the problem they have at the top. How the government has stayed together this long is completely beyond me \u2013 if ministers had any integrity, they would have resigned en masse long ago. David Woodhead, 65, management consultant, Hartley Wintney, Hampshire (Hart \u2013 no overall control, hold) \u2018I would love to see a more ambitious Labour party\u2019 This is my first time voting in Wandsworth as I just moved, so I was definitely influenced by national politics more than local. Climate change is always the priority for me and I don\u2019t think the Conservatives are acting to safeguard our future. I would love to see a more ambitious Labour party who is more in touch with the issues the public care about. I think it\u2019s important that Keir Starmer takes a stronger stance on issues so that people can see what he stands for. I\u2019ll always vote Labour over Conservative, but I find he\u2019s a bit of a flip-flopper. Climate change is a priority for me and it\u2019s important that we see strong implementation on net zero pledges. To be honest, neither party is all that convincing. I voted Labour this year. I flit between them and the Greens, but this time my reasoning was purely strategic. I wanted to see the Conservatives out. Annabel Rice, 24, works in climate change policy for a city network, London (Wandsworth \u2013 Con to Lab) \u2018I\u2019ve disregarded my national inclinations and voted Tory\u2019 I want a councillor who lives here and canvases local opinion and then takes up the issues until they are solved. So my vote went to someone who represents my least loved party, the Conservatives, but who has an excellent track record locally. The candidate is actively looking at traffic issues, parks and green space areas, as well as allotments in her ward. The Labour party present a new candidate for every election, local or national, whom we have never heard of and promises a (vague) new future, whereas the Tory incumbent MP has a great agent who gets him mentioned in every issue of the local paper doing \u201cgood works\u201d. So who do we think of at the ballot box? No wonder we are a safe seat. I\u2019ve disregarded my national inclinations (Labour) and voted local (Tory). Same old, same old.

            "content": "Treasury bosses have been criticised for authorising \u00a3500,000 of taxpayers\u2019 money to be spent on focus groups and polls amid the cost of living crisis. Deltapoll, an independent public opinion consultancy firm, was selected to carry out the work with an option to extend the contract for another year which would take the potential total cost to \u00a31m. Labour said it was \u201csimply staggering\u201d the department had given the green light to \u201clittle more than a taxpayer-funded vanity exercise\u201d. Procurement documents published by the government show that the contract states the researchers are expected to carry out twice-weekly focus groups and weekly online polling over a 12-month period, ending in February 2023. They should also produce \u201cin-depth reports\u201d on their findings, including analysis, on a monthly basis. A Treasury source insisted the research was policy-focused rather than seeking feedback on Rishi Sunak\u2019s personal profile. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cAt a time when Rishi Sunak has told the British people he has no money to ease the cost of living crisis, and that cutting their energy bills would be \u2018silly\u2019, it is simply staggering that he has ordered half a million more of taxpayers\u2019 money to be spent on private focus groups and opinion polls. \u201cThe government apparently has half a million to spend on spin doctors while Jacob Rees-Mogg is threatening to axe thousands of civil service jobs in the name of cost-saving, throwing working people under the bus once again. \u201cAt the start of the pandemic, the Treasury justified their spending on focus groups and polls as an emergency measure to test the impact of different policy options, but now this is little more than a taxpayer-funded vanity exercise for a chancellor desperate to repair his image. \u201cHe should not need to spend a small fortune on focus groups to hear what the British public are telling him: they want serious action to help with the cost of living crisis, starting with the adoption of Labour\u2019s plan for a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas to fund cuts in energy bills.\u201d While the contract runs until February next year, the award letter states that it can be extended by a further 12 months. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cThe Treasury conducts regular polling to help develop and measure the impact and understanding of its policies. All polling is subject to the usual tender process, ensuring the best value for taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d On Friday, it emerged that Sunak has become the first frontline politician to be ranked among the UK\u2019s wealthiest people. The former hedge fund manager and his Indian heiress wife, Akshata Murty, were named in the Sunday Times rich list as the 222nd wealthiest people in the UK, with a combined \u00a3730m fortune. It came days after the chancellor warned consumers that \u201cthe next few months will be tough\u201d as the cost of living crisis intensifies. Last July, Boris Johnson\u2019s government was accused of \u201cabusing\u201d taxpayers\u2019 cash after it emerged public funds were used to conduct polling on opposition politicians. Documents released by the Good Law Project, a campaign organisation, showed there were \u201cquestions asked\u201d about Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and Labour London mayor Sadiq Khan. The documents, which included emails, said the questions allowed the Conservatives to assess the \u201ccredibility\u201d of its own spokespeople against other political figures."

            "date": "2022-05-02T17:35:38Z",
            "content": "The Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton, Neil Parish, announced he would quit as an MP after admitting to twice watching pornography in the House of Commons, triggering another byelection. It comes days after the resignation of Imran Ahmad Khan, Tory MP for Wakefield, who was found guilty of sexual assault. While Parish\u2019s seat at least may seem safe for the Tories, recent byelections have brought shock results. Here\u2019s a rundown of the two votes to come \u2013 and the eight already held since the last general election. Tiverton and Honiton The Conservatives have held the Devon seat since its creation in 1997 but are expected to face a fight to cling on to it after Parish\u2019s resignation. While Labour finished second in 2019, the Liberal Democrats are bullish about their chances. Amid talk of an informal plan for neither party to over-exert itself where the other is better-placed to unseat a Tory incumbent, the Lib Dems believe they could end up being the principal challenger. No date has yet been set for the byelection. Wakefield One of the seats the Conservatives were most proud to grab during their raid of the so-called red wall in 2019, they now fear losing it before the parliamentary term is up. Imran Ahmad Khan resigned after being convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy in April, then being confronted by the Guardian with more allegations. The byelection is expected in June. North Shropshire: Lib Dem gain from Conservatives Among the greatest upsets of recent byelections, and one of the most closely associated with Boris Johnson\u2019s personal failings in No 10. The Lib Dem candidate Helen Morgan pulled off a 34% swing in a supposedly safe Tory seat in December after the prime minister\u2019s disastrous attempt to prevent Owen Paterson facing the consequences of an \u201cegregious\u201d breach of lobbying rules ended with the former minister\u2019s resignation. Paterson had won a near-23,000 majority in 2019. Morgan emerged triumphant with her own 6,000 majority. Chesham and Amersham: Lib Dem gain from Conservatives Another Lib Dem gain from the Conservatives in what had been one of their safest seats \u2013 this time in the Buckinghamshire constituency. Sarah Green built up a majority of more than 8,000 votes as she managed a swing of 25 percentage points to win last June \u2013 foreshadowing the Lib Dems\u2019 win in Shropshire six months later. The contest was called after the death from cancer of the local MP Cheryl Gillan, who had represented the constituency since 1992 and held it in 2019 with a majority of 16,223. Hartlepool: Conservative gain from Labour The Conservatives are not the only party to have seen a seat they may have hoped to hold slip away during this parliament. A year ago, the people of Hartlepool woke up in a Tory constituency for the first time in more than 50 years after Jill Mortimer won. While distrust of Johnson has been identified as one of the issues behind Tory troubles, Labour figures said the prime minister\u2019s popularity made their task an uphill one in this north-east England byelection, which was precipitated by the resignation of Mike Hill amid misconduct allegations. An employment tribunal later ruled he sexually assaulted and harassed a parliamentary staff member. Airdrie and Shotts: SNP hold Labour may have gained ground after the resignation of Neil Gray to stand in a Scottish parliamentary election in the overlapping Holyrood constituency, but Anum Qaisar-Javed ultimately held the Westminster seat for the SNP last May. In so doing, the modern studies teacher became only Scotland\u2019s second female Muslim MP. She told BBC Scotland she hoped to be a role model for others from diverse backgrounds, and she pledged to fight for Scottish independence. Old Bexley and Sidcup: Conservative hold In Shropshire last December, the Conservatives paid the price of what Johnson admitted was his \u201ctotal mistake\u201d in trying to replace the system that found Paterson breached the rules with one dominated by his own party. But they had escaped such censure in the south-east London suburb of Old Bexley and Sidcup two weeks earlier. Louie French held the safe seat in a byelection triggered by the death from lung cancer of the former cabinet minister James Brokenshire \u2013 albeit with a reduced majority on a smaller turnout. Batley and Spen: Labour hold Kim Leadbeater, sister of the murdered MP Jo Cox, held the seat for Labour after her party colleague Tracy Brabin stood down when she was elected West Yorkshire\u2019s mayor. Anger at the revelation that the former health secretary, Matt Hancock, had breached his own government\u2019s social distancing rules, as well as a concerted effort to keep George Galloway out of power after he was blamed for stoking division, were identified as key drivers of the Labour vote. Birmingham Erdington: Labour hold The election of Paulette Hamilton to the West Midlands seat in March this year followed the sudden death of the former shadow minister Jack Dromey, who had held the seat since 2010. Hamilton, a former nurse who became Birmingham\u2019s first black MP, increased Labour\u2019s vote share on 2019. She said the result showed that \u201cwith listening to what the public are telling us and acting upon that\u201d, Labour could secure more success. Southend West: Tory hold Anna Firth held the Essex constituency for the Conservatives in February in a byelection that followed the murder of the MP David Amess by an Islamist terrorist. She won with 86% of the vote after Labour, the Liberal Democrats and other mainstream political parties chose not to contest the seat. Speaking after her victory speech, she praised Amess\u2019 widow, adding that she recognised it was a \u201csad and painful day\u201d for his family."

            "content": "It\u2019s The Final Countdown! (Yes, Europe\u2019s classic song was played today). The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, had hectic, frenetic days. Here\u2019s what happened: Josh Butler and Paul Karp were playing follow the leader, here are their reports. (And here\u2019s Karp\u2019s duel with Morrison.) We asked you, dear readers, who you thought would win. And we listed the seven key policies where the two parties differ. Meanwhile, Sarah Martin sketched out the seats that will decide the result. We also took a look at what might happen in the senate. Here\u2019s Guardian Australia\u2019s view on what should happen. There are suggestions \u201cembarrassed\u201d voters might have kept quiet about their support for Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia party. An election-eve leak from cabinet\u2019s national security committee injected a little hiccup into the campaign trail. Have you been paying attention? It\u2019s OK if not. Here\u2019s today\u2019s election briefing and campaign catchup. Oh, and Australia got monkeypox. That\u2019s it from us for today. Amy Remeikis will be here in the morning, and the Guardian Australia team will be out at polls and political shindigs, keeping an eye on how election day unfolds. Tomorrow night we might know who the new government, and prime minister is. Or we might not. Fun times! As for preferred prime minister: Psephologist Kevin Bonham says: While Anthony Albanese\u2019s ABC 7.30 interview (recorded earlier tonight) was being played on TV, he was having one last quiet campaign event before election day \u2013 meeting supermarket workers at a Woolworths warehouse in the marginal seat of Chisholm. After flying into Melbourne in the early evening, the campaign bus went to the city\u2019s east. Albanese met a group of workers he said were at the \u201cfrontline\u201d of the pandemic \u2013 stocking shelves and working checkouts to keep people fed. He was joined by deputy Labor leader, Richard Marles, and Chisholm candidate, Carina Garland, who is trying to win the seat off Liberal incumbent, Gladys Liu, who has a wafer-thin 0.4% margin. Albanese told a group of employees: My son works at Woolies. Thank you for what you do, and what you did during the pandemic. With a few quick handshakes, he was back out the door, into the night. Just moments earlier, the latest Newspoll dropped, showing Labor still with a commanding 53-47 two-party lead, but also a two-point drop in its primary vote. It will be a long and potentially sleepless night for both major parties and their leaders. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will also be in Melbourne, with the two men to start election day in the same city. The final Newspoll is in, showing 53% two-party preferred for Labor to 47% for the Coalition: Leigh Sales thanks the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, for honouring his commitment to appear on the program twice, and it\u2019s over. Sales asks about the opposition\u2019s campaigns, and compares it to the Liberal opposition under Tony Abbott, which won with crisp three-word slogans. Albanese says: What I will deliver is what I am saying we\u2019ll deliver. Cheaper childcare. Cheaper energy bills. A future made in Australia. End the climate wars. A national anti-corruption commission and [to] move forward with the constitutional recognition of First Nations people with a voice to parliament. Next up is the seat of Fowler, where Kristina Keneally might be in trouble. Albanese says: What I\u2019d say is that Kristina Keneally is a senior member of the Labor party ... she\u2019s passionate about making a difference in politics, including to the community of Fowler in south-west Sydney. She will have a seat around the cabinet table and will make an enormous difference to that electorate. Kristina is someone with great capacity, intelligence and able to advocate for that community. She\u2019ll be an outstanding, strong representative, and I\u2019m sure that they\u2019ll be very proud of what she\u2019s able to deliver as part of a Labor government. Sales asks when coal production will end, and Albanese says \u201cthat will be determined by decisions in board rooms here in Australia and around the world\u201d. He says \u201cthe cheapest form of new energy in Australia is renewables\u201d. There\u2019s great prospect in areas like green hydrogen and other emerging industries as well. That is what is happening, and it\u2019s being driven by the market. Sales is racing through the questions. The next one is on Scott Morrison\u2019s housing policy, and she asks Albanese why people shouldn\u2019t have the choice to use their super to buy a house. Albanese says: Because we don\u2019t think that you should get an asset by getting rid of another asset. And what we have here is a policy that is consistent with the government that has undermined superannuation every opportunity that it has had. We already know that women retire with less income than men. This government has continued to undermine superannuation at every step. On a teacher shortage, Albanese says: Well, one of the things that we can do is to take some pressure off the education system. We make no apologies for the policy about attracting more high-performance teachers into the profession. We need to value teaching. It\u2019s an honourable profession. And we need to lift its status. We have a range of other policies that we\u2019ve announced, including funding for schools to bounce back from Covid. We know that students and teachers have done it really tough. And providing additional support for every school for mental health support or for excursions in order to, according to the priorities of those schools, will make a difference as well. On the wage increase, Albanese says: I actually gave a straight answer to a straight question about 5.1% and minimum wage, would I welcome it? And I stand by that. It\u2019s a dollar an hour increase. And I don\u2019t believe, and I said throughout the entire campaign I\u2019ve said [we have] two big themes. We don\u2019t think that people should fall behind, and we don\u2019t think that people should be held back. And people on minimum wages can\u2019t afford a real cut in their wages. Albanese and Sales are butting heads over Albanese\u2019s \u201cgaffes\u201d. Sales says: You made the unemployment figure mistake. You said this week that Australia\u2019s borders were closed when they\u2019re not. You supported a 5.1% wage increase and then wound it back to say that it would only be for minimum wage earners. Albanese is trying to just focus on the wage increase, which is obviously much safer territory. He says it\u2019s media \u201cgotcha\u201d questions that put people off politics. Pushed on the unemployment rate gaffe, he says: I \u2018fessed up to just having a memory lapse at that particular time in that context. I\u2019m not about making excuses. I owned it. And moved on. Sales asks how a Labor government would solve Australia\u2019s skills shortage. Albanese says: Well, we will have 465,000 fee-free Tafe places in areas of skills shortage. We\u2019ll also have an additional 20,000 university places. We understand that we need to train Australians for those jobs ... you can\u2019t just change 10 years of damage in one day. What you need to do is train people for those jobs. You need also to look at the migration system. I\u2019ve said that very up-front in areas like nurses, historically Australia is a great migration country. Albanese is talking about inheriting $1tn of debt, but Sales forces him to defend passing the stage three income tax cuts, while not committing to raising the rate of jobseeker. Albanese says: They\u2019ve been legislated. I\u2019ll tell you what happened \u2013 we lost the last election. We lost the last election and those cuts, the tax cuts, have been legislated. We\u2019re not going to re-litigate all of the issues that have occurred at previous elections and we\u2019re going to ensure that there\u2019s certainty going forward about what the tax system looks like. So that\u2019s why we made that decision. But that was a decision that was made, of course, in the parliament, in the senate. We tried to amend the legislation. We weren\u2019t successful. So that\u2019s just a historical fact that that occurred. Sales asks Albanese about the infamous \u201cMediscare\u201d campaign, saying the confected campaign by Labor goes to the issue of trust. Albanese runs through what a Labor party would do in the healthcare system, including the promised urgent care clinics, and says: They\u2019ll be bulk billed. The only thing you\u2019ll need in an urgent care clinic is your Medicare card. Labor will always be better on Medicare and healthcare, and the policy that we\u2019ve put out as well of $250m per year, every year, for three years, that\u2019s been endorsed by the Australian Medical Association, we\u2019ve worked out how we can make sure that we can get better delivery, of primary healthcare and other health services. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ve worked constructively on. It\u2019s something that we would take into government. Albanese says while \u201cthe strength of our Australian society was shown\u201d, \u201cat the same time, the vulnerabilities of our economy, the fact that we\u2019re at the end of global supply chains meant that we didn\u2019t have enough PPE, we didn\u2019t have enough ventilators, we struggled to get access to vaccines\u201d. He says: One of the things we need to do after the pandemic is identify how we can overcome those issues, how we stand on our own two feet. How do we develop sovereign capability? We make more things here. Labor has a plan to do that. The problem for this government is that they don\u2019t have a plan for the future. And during the pandemic, we were responsible, we were constructive, we didn\u2019t play politics. We actually went into the parliament and said \u2013 we have some disagreements with this legislation, but in advance, if our amendments aren\u2019t carried, we won\u2019t allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. So we were responsible during that period. One of the things that that meant, of course, was that as an opposition, we didn\u2019t get the profile that would normally occur during that period of the pandemic. We put the national interest first. I make no apologies for that. Sales points out that Australia\u2019s recovery has been one of the best in the world. Albanese says \u201cAustralians were in charge of that\u201d: The Australian people have been magnificent. They responded by looking after each other, whether they were people in the care sector or just people going out and getting vaccinated. But what we know is that the impact was worse from the pandemic because Scott Morrison said it wasn\u2019t a race for getting the vaccines to Australia. And then he did the same thing when it came to rapid antigen tests. When it came to issues like economic support, Scott Morrison described wage subsidies as a dangerous idea. Sales points out that Morrison implemented jobkeeper, and Albanese says it was a Labor idea: Eventually they put it in and when they did put it in, they designed a scheme that gave $20bn to companies who were actually increasing their profits, even though they knew that that was happening. Sales starts by outlining the problem Scott Morrison has (ie being unpopular) but asks Albanese if he\u2019s done enough to lure people away from the idea of \u201cbetter the devil you know\u201d. Albanese says \u201cwe\u2019ll find out tomorrow night\u201d: But I\u2019ll make this point \u2013 even Scott Morrison has given up on better the devil you know, and has distanced himself from Scott Morrison when he has said that he will change if he\u2019s elected. Well, the way that you get change is to change the government tomorrow. Coming up in a couple of minutes we have the ABC\u2019s Leigh Sales interviewing the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, on 7.30. Sales starts the show saying neither leader has \u201cinspired the public\u201d. Caroline Jones, a journalism legend and a mentor to Australian women, has died. The ABC has dedicated an Australian Story episode to her. Jones was the first female reporter at This Day Tonight. The ABC describes her as a \u201cfierce, credible and hard-hitting reporter\u201d. Jones, 84, died this week. An insight into the democracy sausage, a bulldozing confrontation, and a rather large election-eve leak. Daniel Hurst\u2019s election briefing plugs the gaps: Josh Butler and Paul Karp bring you postcards from a hectic election eve: Some more colour and movement from AAP, from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on the campaign trail: On that \u201cHerculean\u201d effort from the Australian Electoral Commission to staff polling booths, commissioner Tom Rogers says it looks good for now, but Covid may strike in the morning. He says: If election day began at 7pm tonight every single one of the 7,000 polling places we\u2019ve planned for would open its doors. If some of the small number of people we\u2019ve lined up to work at a local voting centre withdraw on the morning of the election, we may not have backups available in that town. And if there are queues, he says, please treat staff with kindness. Anthony Albanese has joined ABC Melbourne, moments after touching down in Victoria. After the radio station played Europe\u2019s \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d, the Labor leader talked up his frantic final day, visiting three states and four marginal electorates. He said: It shows I want to represent the whole country. Albanese said he plans to do a round of breakfast TV in the morning and hand out how-to-vote cards in Melbourne, before going back to Sydney. He said: We\u2019ve run a very successful campaign. Albanese complained about the \u201cgotcha\u201d questions he got from journalists, and said he\u2019d tried to run a \u201cpositive\u201d campaign. He also rejected claims he\u2019d run a \u201csmall target\u201d election, talking up his \u201ctransformative\u201d climate policy: You\u2019ve got to bring people with you on the journey of change. You can\u2019t go from zero to 100 overnight. Asked by host Raf Epstein if we would know an election result by 8pm on election day, Albanese says \u201cprobably not\u201d. He said Labor supporters were \u201cdevastated\u201d and wanted to get \u201cin the foetal position\u201d after the 2019 loss, and claimed his campaign has made Labor more competitive this time. Albanese claimed many people had \u201cchanged their view of Labor\u201d in recent years, citing their childcare and social policies, and that he was \u201chopeful\u201d of a strong result on Saturday. Goodbye from health minister and member for Flinders, Greg Hunt: As always, brilliant shots of the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, on the campaign trail from AAP: Liberal MP for Bass, Bridget Archer, stopped short of endorsing Scott Morrison\u2019s leadership when asked in Launceston today. The first-term MP has differed with Morrison on issues including an integrity commission and welfare. She was at the pre-poll in Launceston where Albanese visited this afternoon, and a coincidence meant the Labor leader\u2019s travelling press pack got to join her for a quick press conference. She got a few questions on the PM, including whether he was the right person to lead the Liberals. She didn\u2019t give a ringing endorsement. She said: Those will be decisions that will be had into the future as they always are. Asked for her views on him remaining leader, she said: I don\u2019t have a view at the moment. Scott Morrison is taking us to this election and my focus is on retaining the seat of Bass. The Albanese campaign has touched down in Melbourne, where he\u2019ll visit the marginal seat of Chisholm to meet supermarket workers. The Labor leader is also spending the night before election day (happy election eve, for those who celebrate) appearing on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program. He\u2019s expected to head back to Sydney early tomorrow morning, to vote in Grayndler. Tom Rogers from the Australian Electoral Commission says the telephone voting is going well, after the last minute rejig. He tells the ABC \u201call of the staffing issues have been resolved ... as of this evening, after a Herculean effort by all involved\u201d. He says: I want to clarify something \u2013 we have no magic wand, [we are] subject to every issue in the pandemic. In the last week we had a 15% drop out in [our] 105,000 workforce. Last night alone, 40 officers in charge fell out as a result of Covid. So, I\u2019ve seen some commentary that, oh well, the AEC should have been aware of it \u2013 of course we have. We\u2019ve been working overtime to make sure to deliver the vote. Some communities, that means tomorrow, we chartered a plane to send people out. We\u2019ve got our own staff deployed, I think my chief operating officer is in a small town five hours east of Perth. It is an amazing job by all staff. May I say, while I have the floor, if you are working for us tomorrow, thank you. If you\u2019re in a small polling place and you wake up in the morning, unless you have Covid, please turn up, you are helping your community [so] cast a vote tomorrow. If you\u2019ve been following the blog, listening to the Campaign catchup, reading the daily election briefing, and slavishly absorbing the Guardian Australia team\u2019s reporting, this one\u2019s for you: Australia\u2019s Covid death toll is now 8,027: Roy Morgan\u2019s final poll has Labor on 53% two-party preferred, to the Coalition\u2019s 47%: This week\u2019s final Roy Morgan Poll showed support for the LNP Coalition at only 34% of the primary vote \u2013 far too low for the party to have a chance of forming government after the federal election. This is ... interesting: Katharine Murphy and Jane Lee have the latest Campaign catchup for you \u2013 listen in so you can sound smart in front of your friends tomorrow night (if you\u2019re not already a political nerd): Independent MP Andrew Wilkie is talking about his experience on the crossbench in a hung parliament in the past, and how he\u2019d deal with it if it happens this time: I\u2019ve made it very clear that, if no party is an absolute majority, then I won\u2019t be doing any formal deals with either of the parties to help them form government. I learned the lesson back in my first term, the 43rd parliament when I was elected in 2010. Julia Gillard was looking for numbers to form government, I learned back then if you do go into a formal deal with anyone, then you are effectively on a short leash and they can take you for granted, whereas if you don\u2019t have a formal deal, it\u2019s every vote on its merits. So [if it comes to a vote of confidence] I will have to decide at the time, based on a whole range of factors ... I can\u2019t answer the question right now because we need to see who gets the most votes, the most seats, what the sentiment is in my own community. Obviously this is traditionally a Labor seat, I\u2019ve got to be mindful of that, but we have to wait and see what happens. Asked if leader Barnaby Joyce can\u2019t relate to people south of the Queensland border and is a \u201cdrag\u201d on the women\u2019s vote, McKenzie starts talking about Nationals MPs Darren Chester and Damian Drum. And she\u2019s seen no sign of worker shortages at regional polling booths, she says, and that\u2019s that for now. The \u201cprobable\u201d monkeypox case in NSW has now been confirmed. NSW Health says a recently returned traveller from Europe has the virus. The department said in a statement: The urgent testing that identified the probable case of monkeypox has been confirmed by further tests. This is the first case of monkeypox to be confirmed in NSW. The man in his 40s continues to isolate at home, with care and support being provided by their GP and NSW Health. Cases of monkeypox have been identified in several non-endemic countries in recent weeks, including several European countries and the United States. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people and is usually associated with travel to Central or West Africa, where it is endemic. McKenzie says the Nationals \u201care fighting to keep all the seats we currently hold\u201d. Asked if Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia party is eating away at the Nationals rump (sorry for that mental image), she says: I was talking to a radiographer [the other day]. He and his wife didn\u2019t want to get vaccinated, and they were choosing to vote one way in a federal election that they\u2019d never voted before simply because of [premier] Daniel Andrews and the lockdowns here in Victoria. So we are seeing a lot of different issues and aspects, particularly of Covid-19, playing into people\u2019s decisions on who they are voting for this election. Make of this what you will. McKenzie says grants were helping the regions move towards a low emissions future. She says: It\u2019s only the Liberals and the National party that actually take moving our country to a low emissions future seriously. Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie is up now. The ABC\u2019s Greg Jennett asks her if it will \u201ctake a miracle\u201d for the Coalition to win from here. She smartly sidesteps that one to have a good old whack at the Greens, and calls for Labor to commit to regional funding programs that Fran Kelly quickly points out were part of the sports rorts saga. Kelly asks: Is it a bit rich and risky for you, particularly you, to be campaigning against Labor scrapping this fund, the fund the shadow finance minister Katy Gallagher calls a dodgy slush fund, when you would be the minister in charge of this regionalisation fund, and you as minister were involved in the sports rorts community grants scandal that was condemned by the auditor general, you are in the heart of that, and you would be in charge of this one? All the rules were followed, McKenzie says. Greens leader Adam Bandt says they\u2019re feeling there\u2019s a \u201cgrowing swing to the Greens\u201d. He says: We\u2019re seeing really strong support in Queensland and in inner city Brisbane seats, seats like Ryan and Brisbane and Griffith, where we saw a really strong swing at the state election. The message we\u2019re hearing is that people want this terrible government to go, but they haven\u2019t been inspired by the opposition and they can see us putting an alternative on the table. They\u2019re hoping to pick up Senate seats in South Australia, Queensland and NSW, and get the balance of power. And finally, Ruston is asked about the national security committee leak, and whether it could have been officials. She says: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how this came about, it would be foolish to speculate. Ruston says prime minister Scott Morrison, when talking about his post-bulldozer era, \u201cwas referring to the fact that hopefully, as we come out of Covid, we will be able to go back to some more normal settings about how we manage the country\u201d. Asked whether the PM was nervous about Swan and Pearce (because that\u2019s where he is today), Ruston says: I think the prime minister himself set a campaign plan at the start of the campaign. He stuck to that, no matter what, because he had a plan and stuck to that plan, a bit like we had an economic plan and we will continue to stick to that economic plan. Liberal campaign spokeswoman Anne Ruston says she thinks people have mostly made up their minds, and that it\u2019s been \u201crespectful\u201d at the polling booths. Fran Kelly asks her what her pitch to women is (women are three times more likely to be undecided, while Liberal polling shows the female vote is down). Ruston says: I will be imploring the women of Australia, and everybody in Australia, to have a look at the choice before you, the track record of the government of which I\u2019m a member. We\u2019ve got ... eight very strong, capable women in our cabinet. We have fantastic women candidates. I haven\u2019t seen a discernible difference in men and women on polling booths. I think they\u2019re all keen to engage, they\u2019re very keen to ask questions. Now the ABC is showing slow-motion footage of prime minister Scott Morrison bulldozing young Luca on the soccer pitch, with a Chariots of Fire soundtrack (which was a tribute to the song\u2019s composer, Vangelis, who has died). ABC host Fran Kelly welcomes former Liberal MP Christopher Pyne and former Labor MP Craig Emerson, saying they\u2019re \u201cpretty popular\u201d with viewers. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Pyne says. (I\u2019m not going to bring you a blow by blow of their conversation, just thought some might like a little Pyneism). Pyne has also told Labor leader Anthony Albanese that he\u2019ll be proud of him if he wins: I don\u2019t think Anthony will mind me saying that I spoke to him today, and I told him actually that I don\u2019t want him to win the election, which is true. But I said if you do get elected, I will be personally very proud of you because it\u2019s an enormous achievement ... I might even shed a quiet tear on election night because it\u2019s a great story and in my valedictory when I left parliament I said I haven\u2019t got a log cabin story, unlike the member for Grayndler \u2013 Anthony Albanese, he does. (But he doesn\u2019t want him to win). Burke declines to discuss what will happen with the Labor leadership if they lose tomorrow (imagine if he did!) : No one is thinking beyond the time, right at the moment, we have a real chance for a better future with Anthony\u2019s plan to where he wants to take Australia, the people to be able to start getting ahead again. Labor\u2019s Tony Burke says he\u2019s been doing the rounds of the polling booths, and that there is a \u201csense of momentum\u201d (for Labor leader Anthony Albanese, obviously), and a \u201cmood of frustration\u201d (that\u2019d be the other bloke). He tells the ABC this election is different from 2007, when voters got rid of former Liberal prime minister John Howard in favour of Labor\u2019s Kevin Rudd. He says: The frustration and anger that I hear from people about Scott Morrison, I never heard it [then]. If you\u2019ve been wondering how Bumley Phartinggale was going in his battle against Felicity Nicelady, First Dog on the Moon has been looking into it: Labor leader Anthony Albanese said this earlier, about the prime minister\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a bulldozer/I\u2019m not a bulldozer\u201d approach: Even Scott Morrison wants to distance himself from Scott Morrison. I wonder where he got that from? Thanks, Calla Wahlquist. I\u2019m refreshed and ready to go. Again. If you have been barely paying attention or, let\u2019s face it, barely hanging on, Amy Remeikis has you covered. Prime minister Scott Morrison has arrived at the Sikh Gurdwara Perth, a temple in Hasluck. Morrison is here with both the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, and the MP for abolished electorate Stirling, Vince Connelly, who is vying to replace Anne Aly in neighbouring Cowan. The prime minister will announce an election commitment of $1.3m for a sporting complex. Morrison will be received by a greeting party from the Sikh Gurdwara and escorted into the temple to pay respects. Morrison will then join an afternoon tea with members of the Sikh community in the Tea Room. President of the Sikh Gurdwara Jurnail Singh will introduce the prime minister to deliver remarks and make the announcement. The Australian Electoral Commission has updated its website to allow people who tested positive to Covid-19 after 6pm last Friday to vote over the phone. The change was announced this morning but was only formalised this afternoon. It comes after the AEC revealed that up to 200,000 people who tested positive before the previous cut-off of 6pm Wednesday, were still in their seven-day isolation period, and had not registered for postal voting, would not be able to vote. Electoral commissioner Tom Rogers said: With many jurisdictions internationally not offering voting services for Covid positive voters during the pandemic, we\u2019re proud to be delivering the combination of safe and secure voting services for all voters. We heard from community members who did not apply for a postal vote before the deadline, we acted to extend the phone voting service and all Covid positive voters can vote in the election. The telephone voting queues are expected to be long and the process is complicated \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re voting below the line in the senate - so it\u2019s recommended if you need to use this option that you do it as soon as possible, and check your ballot paper online before phoning. There are interpreters available. Call the AEC support line (not the voting line) on 13 23 26 if that is something you might need. In other deeply significant election news, Pig the dugong has called the election for Anthony Albanese. Pig, 23, lives at Sydney\u2019s Sea Life aquarium. He\u2019s been there since being rescued in 2008 and is one of only two dugongs living in captivity in the world. His keepers offered him the choice of a blue toy or a red bucket, and he went straight for the bucket, wearing it as a hat. It\u2019s his first election prediction, but he handled it confidently. Pig is not the only animal to call the election: Speckles the saltwater crocodile also called it for Labor; Gloomy the octopus chose the Coalition, and Hugo the Galapagos tortoise pondered the decision for some time before ignoring both in favour of his girlfriend, Estrella. You can read more about Pig\u2019s electoral debut here: Hello, it\u2019s Calla Wahlquist here, filling in for Tory Shepherd for a moment while she mentally prepares to keep blogging until the final hours tonight. We were talking about sausages earlier, and the prime ministerial preparation thereof. You may have noticed that Scott Morrion helpfully offered Paul Karp a vegetarian sausage in Perth. Although Paul is not vegetarian we appreciate the effort. If you are vegetarian or have any other dietary requirements but would still like to participate in the grand Australian tradition on voting day, the Democracy Sausage website is a wealth of information on the offerings available at local polling places around the country. The election sausage sizzle and cake stall is a major community fundraiser, so please do partake. Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Friday, as the country records at least 52 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 963 In hospital: 84 (with 4 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 10 Cases: 10,084 In hospital: 1,226 (with 41 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 1 Cases: 290 In hospital: 23 (with 2 people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 9 Cases: 6,220 In hospital: 478 (with 11 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 4 Cases: 3,901 In hospital: 218 (with 13 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 0 Cases: 967 In hospital: 44 (with 1 person in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 23 Cases: 12,556 In hospital: 514 (with 35 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 5 Cases: 15,205 In hospital: 304 (with 11 people in ICU) Sarah Martin\u2019s taken a look at who might have the most seats when the music stops: Next stop \u2026 The prime minister\u2019s office is arguing that communications with a minister and his office, talking points prepared for ministers, and media inquiry documents are not \u201cofficial documents of a minister\u201d and therefore do not need to be released under freedom of information law. In 2019 Labor had sought access to documents related to the scandal over forged documents regarding City of Sydney\u2019s annual report out of energy minister Angus Taylor\u2019s office. The FOI had been rejected on the grounds the prime minister\u2019s workload and the time it would take to process the request would be too onerous. Last month the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner rejected this claim and ordered PMO to process the request. As with similar FOIs relating to text messages from Barnaby Joyce\u2019s time as drought envoy, and texts between Scott Morrison and QAnon supporter Tim Stewart, PMO also rejected the request on the grounds that the documents in question are not official documents of a minister. All three requests are open to appeal, but would take years once again to get processed. But if Morrison loses tomorrow and Labor wins, the documents are very unlikely to be retained for the incoming government. Please enjoy the footage of Paul \u201cKarpnado\u201d Karp taking it up to Scott \u201cBulldozer\u201d Morrison: It all got a little wild earlier, with those competing press conferences that were about both the flu and the monkeypox. In short: get vaccinated for the flu, and read this on the monkeypox: Prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking again from Perth. He\u2019s talking about women\u2019s sport (because that\u2019s gone so smoothly throughout the election campaign), and the importance of community sporting facilities. He\u2019s at the Wanneroo Rugby Club, which has attracted election pledges from both Labor and the Liberal party. And now, the PM says, he\u2019s off to have a sausage. People in New South Wales are being warned to brace for \u201cone heck of a flu season\u201d, with the number of flu-related hospital admissions doubling over the past week. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said: If anybody is in any doubt as to whether we have a flu season, don\u2019t be in any doubt. It is here and you need to take it very seriously. It is absolutely crucial that all of us take this virus very very seriously and go and have a flu vaccination.This is going to be one heck of a flu season. Last week 129 people were admitted to hospital across the state with the flu, up from 60 the week before. Chief health officer Kerry Chant reiterated the call to get people vaccinated and to stay home when sick. Chant says the \u201cpreliminary\u201d tests indicate it\u2019s monkeypox, so they\u2019re still calling it a \u201cprobable\u201d case. And I suppose for the community, some of differential diagnosis of what doctors think it might be, and some of things that it might look like is something like chickenpox, which now, primary chickenpox is actually quite a rare disease, because again, thanks to the effectiveness of vaccination. The infection is usually a mild illness for most people and most people recover in a few weeks. But some people can experience more serious illness. You are infectious whilst you\u2019re unwell, and that extends while the lesions are open. And cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in Europe and North America, the UK, Spain, Belgium, Italy and Canada. A large proportion of the cases detected overseas are amongst gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men, and we\u2019re particularly urging men who are gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact by phone the sexual health clinic or GP without delay if they have any concerns. It is important to be particularly vigilant if you\u2019ve returned from overseas from a large parties or sex-on-premises venues overseas. Chant says: So just to reassure the community \u2013 it is not the same spread mechanism as Covid or flu, where it is more fleeting. The incubation period, so everyone will be aware, we\u2019ve talked about that for Covid for so, so long \u2013 it takes about one to two weeks after you\u2019ve been exposed that you develop those symptoms, but there can be extremes of five days to around three weeks. It starts off with fever, muscle aches and pains. You can get those enlarged lymph nodes, headaches, feeling tired and lethargic and can be followed by a rash one to three days later. Often the rash starts on the face, but it can start in other locations. The rash is flat, and then develops blisters and then pus and then scabs, and it can last two to four weeks. Back to Dr Kerry Chant! Simultaneous press conferences \u2013 a pox on them. Chant (NSW chief health officer) says it\u2019s rare that it spreads among humans. She says: Monkeypox is in the same family as cowpox, and it\u2019s usually sporadically reported with people who had contacted with infected animals. But it can be spread human-to-human. Again, this is usually rare. It\u2019s spread by skin-to-skin contact when the lesions are present, and also, it can be spread through droplet exposure. But usually, you need to have quite prolonged contact. A lack of immunity to influenza, because we had virtually no cases last year, means we can expect a bigger season this year, Sutton says. Sutton\u2019s now talking about the flu \u2013 which is getting a bit confusing considering we were all focused on monkeypox. Vulnerable people should all be vaccinated, he says, in fact anyone six months and above should get it. Cheng says people with monkeypox are infectious in a similar way to chickenpox \u2013 until skin lesions heal. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, but there are no specific antivirals for monkeypox. OK, the TV stations ditched the NSW press conference, but I\u2019ve found the Victorian one online, and Allen Cheng (from Alfred Health) is talking now. He says they\u2019re treating the patient in the same way they\u2019d treat someone with Covid. He says: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say hospitals are under some stress,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t expect monkeypox to contribute to that stress. Dr Kerry Chant, the NSW chief health officer, is talking first about the impact of influenza on the health system. She\u2019s begging parents to get their children vaccinated, and for vulnerable people particularly not to delay getting it, because of an earlier start. Monkeypox presents with initial symptoms that are similar to a cold or a flu, followed by skin lesions, Hazzard says (and apologies, I was listening to audio and expecting the Victorian health minister earlier!). It is \u201cquite incredible\u201d that a GP managed to identify the illness, he says. There\u2019s a press conference now about that monkeypox case detected in NSW with health minister, Brad Hazzard, who says this is the first time it\u2019s come to Australia and is giving a bit of a history lesson of the virus. Contributor: Wing Kuang The federal education minister, Alan Tudge, has been missing in action during the campaign but turned up in a campaign video last week in conversation with a \u201cChinese community leader\u201d, identified only as Marcus. It turns out Marcus is Marcus Li, who is part of Liberal MP for Chisholm, Gladys Liu\u2019s volunteer team and a vocal supporter of conversion therapy. On Friday, Guardian Australia reported the elusive Tudge had emerged on WeChat in an interview with Marcus, where he responded generally to questions which included what to do about the \u201ctoxic gender ideology\u201d allegedly infiltrating schools and what families can do to guard against \u201cwoke\u201d culture. Li has been spotted campaigning at the prepoll station in Mt Waverley wearing a Liberal T-shirt. He is apparently an active member of Crossway Baptist Church and of Chinese-Australian Christian community in Melbourne, and has led a group called \u201cCrossway Political Engagement Community\u201d that opposes the Victorian government\u2019s ban on conversion therapy. An email written by Li in December 2020 and seen by Guardian Australia called for members of the Christian community to contact Coalition MPs and \u201curge them to oppose any bill banning so-called \u2018conversion practices\u201d. He also urged members to make the MPs \u201ccommit to repeal any such legislation when the Coalition is returned to government\u201d. In another email sent to the church members before the federal election in 2019, Li organised an information event about the Liberal party \u201cfor like-minded Christians who want to bring Christian values to the political party\u201d. Here\u2019s the video of former Labor prime minister, Julia Gillard, declaring the party would be \u201ca government for women\u201d: Amanda Meade\u2019s Weekly Beast is in, and it\u2019s a doozy: Laura Tingle again channelling that Laura Tingle vibe: There have been five Covid deaths in Western Australia. There are 304 people in hospital, with 11 in intensive care. The state recorded 15,205 new cases: So strange that claiming the identity of a piece of heavy machinery so quickly became a thing this election. Here\u2019s Calla Wahlquist on the bulldozer versus the builder (do you have to bulldoze before building?): Daniel Hurst has been investigating that leak about the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, asking the national security committee to double the money for the Pacific (and being knocked back). Turns out there\u2019s more to the story: Victoria has a confirmed case of monkeypox. Victoria Health says a traveller who returned from the UK has the virus. Chief health officer, Brett Sutton, and Allen Cheng, an Alfred Health infectious diseases physician, will have a press conference at 2pm. Katharine Murphy did a snap factcheck on prime minister Scott Morrison telling Paul Karp he was sounding like a bit of a bulldozer: I missed a question in the frenzy of the PM\u2019s presser \u2013 sorry! He was asked about the million (plus) people seeking help from FoodBank every month, and how he would make their lives easier. Morrison said (go on, you guessed it) that the answer was, in short, a strong economy that allows the government to provide emergency cash assistance. Morrison is asked about the \u201cdeeply personal\u201d nature of the election, and whether he has any regrets. He says: What I sought to set out right from the first day of the campaign to this \u2013 the choice that Australians have to make. I said this isn\u2019t an election about me or Mr Albanese, for that matter, it\u2019s about you, and what your aspirations are. It\u2019s about what you\u2019re hoping to achieve. It\u2019s about putting what happened with the pandemic well behind us, as we emerge strongly and we secure the opportunities that are ahead of us. And those opportunities are there, but we cannot take them for granted. And \u2013 what a surprise! He then segues into a personal attack on Labor leader Anthony Albanese. The journalist says: You have just made it personal again. Are you disappointed that\u2019s the way it\u2019s gone? Aaaaaaand the Morrison team calls an end to the press conference. Paul Karp puts to Morrison that he said he\u2019d be less of a bulldozer, but also \u201csaid being a bulldozer can help things be done\u201d. \u201cHow can Australians trust this last minute conversion when you have reneged on it in less than a week and there\u2019s been no changes of policy or substance?\u201d Morrison: Paul, I just don\u2019t agree with your assertion. Karp: What have you changed, then? Morrison: I don\u2019t agree with how you have conceived the whole point I\u2019ve been making. I\u2019ll come back to this when I get the proper transcript, but it ended with someone saying: You\u2019re sounding like a bit of a bulldozer. (I\u2019m told that final comment was from Morrison to Karp, to much amusement). Morrison is asked about the Biloela family \u2013 yesterday he said they were owed \u201cno protection\u201d: You said yesterday the Murugappan family isn\u2019t owed protection. But your government can use its discretionary powers to allow them to return to Biloela. You said you want to be more empathetic. Will you start by using those powers to allow them to return to Biloela? Morrison says: There\u2019s two tracks here. There\u2019s the track in the courts and those courts have not found that a protection obligation is owed under that convention. They have not been afforded the status of refugees. So they\u2019re not refugees. That is what the courts have found. And you know what the government policy is. If you grant visas to people who have illegally entered Australia, you may as well start writing the prospectus for people smugglers. Q: On Chinese influence in the Pacific, you mention that China doesn\u2019t play by the same rules. Your government has made a point about calling out Chinese cyber-attacks, if there\u2019s evidence of corruption in the Pacific or Solomon Islands, will your government make that information or intelligence public as deterrence? Morrison says: We\u2019ll do what is in our national interest and the interests of our partner countries. We work through those issues very carefully with our partner countries. We\u2019re very respectful of our family in the Pacific. As I said to you on a number of occasions during the course of this campaign, one of the things I sought to change as prime minister was the nature of our relationship with these Pacific leaders. Pacific leaders said to me they were unhappy with the way they were treated in the past. And I sought to turn that around. And build close personal relationships with those leaders. And I continue to go down that path and respect [them] as sovereign nations. I will always do that. A reporter says he\u2019s been told the leak came from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade \u2013 which Morrison seemed to hint at with that suggestion that officials were also in the room. Morrison says: I will not speculate on these issues. I\u2019m not confirming these matters have been discussed. Asked if he\u2019ll investigate the source of the leak, Morrison says: I\u2019m not even confirming there\u2019s a leak. So you shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions about these things. I know what the reports are, but I don\u2019t discuss national security matters. The reason I don\u2019t \u2026 play the game of saying yes or no to these questions, [is] I don\u2019t confirm or deny any issues raised around national security. Morrison won\u2019t confirm or deny the reports that foreign affairs minister Marise Payne lobbied the national security committee for more money for the Pacific. He says: My national security committee has been extremely tight. And I have no doubt the members of my national security committee are very, very tight. I\u2019m not going to confirm one way or another the matters in that report. I don\u2019t discuss things. My ministers don\u2019t discuss things that are addressed and worked through at the national security committee. And, asked about that leak, he says: It\u2019s not just attended by ministers. It\u2019s also attended by officials. Also, Morrison says, the frustrations were caused by Covid: Australians have been doing it tough. And yes, they are fatigued and tired of the difficult challenges they\u2019ve had over recent years. And I understand that frustration. But what\u2019s important is that we channel our decisions and our focus on what comes next. And putting the frustrations of the last few years, caused by Covid, we\u2019ve all worked hard together to see this through and to come through in a strong way, and now we can secure those opportunities ahead. Morrison is asked about voters wanting to give him a \u201ckick in the shins\u201d tomorrow. He says: The decisions Australians are making is not about rewarding anyone, or necessarily punishing anyone. Q: Do you accept that people are upset? What it\u2019s about is what is going to be best for them going forward. And what is best going to enable their aspirations is having a strong economy and government that knows how to manage money. Now a question on that case of monkeypox mentioned below. Morrison says health authorities are monitoring the situation very closely, and \u201cno one should be alarmed\u201d: There are treatments available. The advice I have is that it is a far less contagious condition than obviously Covid, and things of that nature. And so while we should be taking this seriously, at the same time, I would say that no one should be alarmed at this point. We\u2019ve got the best health authorities in the world. That is been demonstrated through Covid, and those same authorities, those same health professionals, advising us through coming through Covid are the same ones managing serious issues [like this and Japanese encephalitis]. Q: Lots of people have already voted, there are votes for minor parties and independents, \u201cwhat do you say to Australians about the possibility that when we go to bed tomorrow night, we may not know who will be prime minister?\u201d. Morrison says: Elections in Australia always are always close. It\u2019s very rare you get big changes. It happens occasionally. But in my experience, elections are always very close. And Australians weigh up their decision very, very carefully. Now how they have voted, we\u2019ll see, tomorrow night, and potentially in the days that follow, as more and more votes are counted. (And then we\u2019re back into the \u201cthis election is a choice\u201d and \u201cwho do you trust\u201d speech). This election is all about the strong economy, Morrison says, \u201cbut we can\u2019t take it for granted\u201d. Then on to home ownership: Our plan ensures that people in Australia, young people in particular, starting out, can get access to their own superannuation. Their own money, so they can invest in their own home, to give them that start in life they\u2019re looking for, not have to put it off for years and years, in more and more savings, renting and renting, and potentially seeing that dream slip away from them. Prime minister Scott Morrison is speaking now. He\u2019s in Perth, in the Pearce electorate and is campaigning with Liberal candidate Linda Aitken. She\u2019s hoping to keep the seat in the Liberal fold once sitting MP Christian Porter has retired. He says it\u2019s \u201cin the national interest\u201d for Western Australia to get its \u201cfair share of GST\u201d (that\u2019s the share that other states are not entirely happy with). He says: And that means the state government, with around $2.5bn extra every year, can invest in those important services much needed here in this country. In the roads, in the schools, in the hospitals, in the transport services, keeping people safe with law and order. That\u2019s what that GST commitment and delivery has been all about. Ensuring that here in Western Australia, a growing state, that they have the resources to enable to support that population. We want to see more people move to Western Australia. There\u2019s great opportunities. Here in Western Australia, the unemployment rate is the lowest in the country at 2.9%, a full percentage point below the 48-year low of 3.9%, which we learned of yesterday. So we need more people moving west, there\u2019s plenty of room, there\u2019s plenty of opportunities. Four Covid deaths in South Australia, and 218 people in hospital \u2013 13 in intensive care. SA has recorded 3,901 new cases: Wonder how the campaign strategy gurus feel every time they see just how many people have already made up their minds: Stellar \u2013 and frightfully frenetic \u2013 effort from Amy Remeikis. And she won\u2019t be slowing down for a while. Here\u2019s hoping I can keep up the pace this afternoon. Scott Morrison will be stepping up very soon \u2013 the wonderful Tory Shepherd will take you through that, as I prepare for tomorrow\u2019s election coverage. There are still a lot of hours ahead of us \u2013 each campaign hour is counted in dog years \u2013 so stick with us. And please, take care of you Ax And in that flurry of news, this also happened: NSW has put out this alert and NSW health minister Brad Hazzard will be speaking on it soon: NSW Health has identified a probable case of monkeypox in a recently returned traveller to Europe. A man in his 40s developed a mild illness several days after arriving back in Sydney. He subsequently presented to his GP with symptoms clinically compatible with monkeypox. Urgent testing was carried out which has today identified a probable case of monkeypox, with confirmatory testing under way. The man and a household contact are isolating at home, with care and support being provided by their GP and NSW Health. Cases of monkeypox have been identified in several non-endemic countries in recent weeks, including several European countries and the United States. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said NSW Health has taken steps to ensure it identifies and appropriately managed any potential monkeypox cases. \u201cNSW Health has issued a clinician alert to GPs and hospitals across the state and has also been in contact with sexual health services to increase awareness of the cases identified overseas and to provide advice on diagnosis and referral. We will be speaking with GPs about this issue again today,\u201d Chant said. Chant said monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people and is usually associated with travel to central or West Africa, where it is endemic. \u201cCases are occasionally reported in non-endemic countries in returning travellers or their close contacts, or in owners of imported pets. People can contract monkeypox through very close contact with people who are infected with the virus,\u201d Chant said. \u201cThe infection is usually a mild illness and most people recover within a few weeks.\u201d NSW Health will continue to work closely with its colleagues throughout Australia to monitor for cases and ensure the best clinical response if any are identified. Further information on monkeypox is available from the World Health Organization: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox An eagle eyed blog follower has pointed out the governor general, David Hurley, is not in the country at the moment. Hurley is in Timor Leste for the inauguration of Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta. Which seems important given this story reports Ramos-Horta wants to strengthen ties with China. It is our intention to expand bilateral cooperation with China,\u201d Reuters reports him as saying. \u201cEspecially in the areas of sustainable, organic agriculture, small industries, trade, new technologies, renewable energy, connectivity, digitalisation, artificial intelligence and urban and rural infrastructure.\u201d So much political and media attention is focused on higher interest rates for borrowers (who have various tax incentives to be indebted up to their eyeballs) but much less on savers (who are typically taxed as thanks for their frugality). Anyway, the banks are quick off the mark to raise their lending rates after an RBA rate rise but are typically a lot less nimble when it comes to paying their depositors more. CBA, the biggest bank, today moved one of its savings rates up by 0.25 percentage points, 17 days after the RBA rate hike on 3 May, RateCity.com.au notes today. That\u2019s after NAB and ANZ moved on 13 May and Westpac on 17 May. And so, 2m NetBank Saver customers will see their deposit interests rise from a paltry 0.05% to 0.3%. Those with GoalSaver, Youthsaver and Pensioner Security accounts, though, remain unchanged. \u201cWestpac is the only big four bank to lift rates on its adult, kids and retiree accounts. However, on the eSaver account, only the introductory rate has risen, which means existing customers won\u2019t see an increase,\u201d RateCity said. The banks\u2019 response to the May cash rate hike for savers has been lukewarm at best,\u201d the group\u2019s research director, Sally Tindall, says. Savers were looking to the first cash rate hike in over a decade with hope, but for millions of Australians their rate hasn\u2019t moved an inch.\u201d Cue political outrage? There would certainly be more noise if it were borrowers missing out on a rate cut, you\u2019d have to think. For those shopping around, RateCity notes the Bank of Queensland has hiked its Future Saver account by a full one percentage point, with their young adult accounts offering up to 3%. Across the market, Virgin Money offers some of the best rates at as high as 1.6% but be prepared for delays up to 32 days to withdraw after giving notice. Anyway, it might soon become a monthly ritual \u2013 picking out which are the worst laggards \u2013 if investors are right about RBA rate rises to come. Politicians may get more chances to chime in. Scott Morrison is at a housing estate in Jindalee in the WA seat of Pearce, where Liberal Linda Aitken is aiming to succeed retiring MP Christian Porter. The prime minister will tour the property and meet with two couples aged in their 30s and discuss the Coalition government\u2019s policies to assist with home acquisition. If you count the visit to the pavers yesterday in Tasmania this is five visits to housing estates or residential construction worksites since Monday \u2013 and all for pressers so the TVs are guaranteed to run the footage. And the press conference ends. Q: A question for Ms Gillard, based on your plea to the Australian women to vote for Labor, to change the government, we\u2019ve heard so much about the culture in federal politics. The culture in Parliament House. Is changing the government enough to change that culture and have you given the opposition leader any tips on dealing with a hung parliament? Had to slip that one in. Julia Gillard: Albo doesn\u2019t need any tips from me. On your substantive question, to change the culture of Parliament House you\u2019ve got to include more women. And as a political party, we took that decision as long ago as the early 1990s. I am of that generation of Labor women. Everything about this press conference today seems to be revolving around my age, but anyway \u2013 I am of that generation of Labor women, Joan Kirner was the huge figure in this, who campaigned for an affirmative action rule. As a result that, the Labor party is a much more diverse party, a stronger party, and our political party sends around half men, half women, to the parliaments of Australia, the national parliament and the state parliaments. For a long period of time, I\u2019ve been advocating the conservative side of politics take a similar step. And if they did, then we would have a parliament that was half men and half women, and that is really important to changing the culture. Q: This has been a very personal campaign. And on a personal level, in a word or just a couple of words, as leaders, what do you have that Scott Morrison doesn\u2019t have? Anthony Albanese: I have integrity. And the capacity to take responsibility. Q: You say you\u2019re only contemplating a majority win tomorrow. There\u2019s a huge early vote, big support for minor parties and independents. A tightening in the opinion polls. Should Australians prepare themselves for the possibility there won\u2019t be a conclusive result tomorrow night? Anthony Albanese: A whole lot of people who voted Liberal all their lives have walked away from the party. The values they hold about individual liberty have been trashed. A government that seeks to divide people isn\u2019t in it that tradition. That they\u2019re not conservatives either, because conservatives respect institutions. This is a government that have trashed institutions. We\u2019ve had some discussion about savings. They\u2019ve come up with further cuts to the public service. What after robodebt isn\u2019t obvious, if you make cuts, there\u2019s tragic circumstances to it. When you take humans out of human service delivery, this is a government led by a bloke who speaks about a judicial or quasi-judicial body, the Icac, and calls it a kangaroo court. There\u2019s nothing conservative about that. No wonder so many judges have come out against that. In a range of seats, people have walked away from voting Liberal. What I would say to people, vote Labor. Vote Labor. Because there\u2019s two people running for prime minister, there\u2019s three more years of the same, or there\u2019s myself, who wants to bring the country together. Who wants to be inclusive. Who wants to end the division, end the climate wars, and have a look at the relationship we have, not just with trade unions but with the business community as well. I put my connections with the business community versus anyone across the parliament. And I see that as a great asset. I see that as a way that we can bring people together. This guy himself has said, remarkably, during this campaign, he\u2019s a bulldozer. Bulldozers wreck things. I\u2019m a builder and I want to build things. Q: You mentioned your upbringing a lot during this campaign. You have mentioned your family a lot. I want to know from you, how much have you thought of your mother during this campaign, and 36 hours out from the polls closing, what do you think would she make of the boy from Camperdown being so close to being the next prime minister? Anthony Albanese: Julia knew my mum. And she would be the only one here who did. She would be proud as punch. She would be proud as punch. Because she made the courageous decision in 1963 to keep a child she had out of wedlock. She chose, in order to \u2013 to deal with the pressures that were on a young Catholic woman at that time, in those circumstances, to take my father\u2019s name, and I was raised, being told that he had died. That\u2019s a tough decision. It says something about the pressure that was placed on women. And pressures that are still placed on women, when faced with difficult circumstances. So, the fact that \u2013 that young kid is now running for prime minister, says a lot about her. And her courage. But also says a lot about this country. About this country. That someone from those beginnings, Julia went to my house there in Camperdown, where I grew up, someone can stand before you today, hoping to be elected prime minister of this country tomorrow. And I hope what that does is it sends a message for people of whatever background, including the fact that it is the first time that someone with a non-Anglo Celtic name has put themselves forward for prime minister, we\u2019ve got a fellow called Malinauskas as the state premier, says a lot about our diversity. But says a lot about our strength. And that part of what I\u2019ve said during this campaign is no one held back and no one left behind. No one left behind because Labor will always look after the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. But no one held back because I unashamedly and Labor should always be about aspiration. That\u2019s what we do. We give people from the humblest of beginnings the best opportunity in life. And I pay tribute to my mum, but I also pay tribute to others who have helped me out along the way. No one gets to this spot by themselves. And I thank Julia and others who have helped me along the way. There is a very big push for women voters in this press conference. More women than men disapprove of Scott Morrison\u2019s leadership. With just hours to go, Anthony Albanese is doing what he can to speak to the undecided women voters. The transcript dropped out, but Anthony Albanese covered off questions on cost of living \u2013 he wants it raised and infrastructure, pointing to projects the government announced but never moved forward with, saying Labor will meet its commitments. Q: There was a time of division within the Labor party, if you don\u2019t mind me bringing up, where Julia Gillard couldn\u2019t rely your support. Can you tell me ... Without being too personal, what that, what you have learned from that in your time. And have you offered Julia Gillard the chance to be Australia\u2019s ambassador in Washington as has been suggested? Julia Gillard: Talk about getting ahead of ourselves. Can I say the following about your question about the long and distant past. My clear memory of that period is that Albo and I worked together every day, we occasionally had differences of views, we never exchanged a cross word, we worked together productively in the interest of the government every day. And when the opportunity came to vote for Albo as deputy prime minister, I did. Anthony Albanese: Over here. I will treat that with the seriousness it deserves. Julia Gillard is out there advocating for women, not just here in Australia but throughout the world globally and is doing a fantastic job. Q: Mr Albanese, the polls are tight. The prospect of a hung parliament is a reality. Have you spoken to Julia Gillard about how to get through that time as a leader? And Scott Morrison is spending the morning in WA. You want to win three seats there. Are you worried that you are not in WA today? Anthony Albanese: I can\u2019t be everywhere. I am in four states today. That is not a bad effort. So get your skates on. When this press conference ends, it will be going to another state and one after that. I spent from Saturday to Tuesday ... I put my record up of WA versus Scott Morrison, not just during election campaigns but over many, many, many years. The difference is when I go to WA, I get off the plane, go on get we deviate, funded under the Julia Gillard government. I got on the Great Western Highway, funded under the Kevin Rudd government. Going to city and see the Pope CityLINK we achieved. A massive change in the whole nature. The whole nature of Perth. We are contemplating getting 76 plus seats for the Labor party, that it\u2019ll are contemplating at the electorate this year. Q: Mr Albanese, we are on the eve of the election. As you noted, you\u2019re with somebody today that was regarded as a Labor luminary. Are you going to pressure for the Labor call today and are you contemplating the prospect of defeat? Anthony Albanese: I feel a great responsibility to be successful, because I know there are so many Australians out there that are so passionate about changing the government. People have watched a government led by a man who won\u2019t take responsibility and went \u2013 with missing during the bushfires and missing during the floods. When it came to the pandemic, he said it wasn\u2019t a race to order enough vaccines and there was a worse health and economic outcomes as a result. And didn\u2019t even learn those lessons in terms of the rapid antigen tests. We have a government whereby it never learns from mistakes of the past. It struggles with the present and has no plan for the future. What we actually need to do is to change the government. This prime minister a couple of weeks ago said he wanted to change. He wanted to be someone who he wasn\u2019t. He was going to distance himself from Scott Morrison, even Scott Morrison wants to distance himself from Scott Morrison. We can do better than that. We can do so much better than that. Q: You can see that you face a long-term funding issue? Have you ruled out increasing the Medicare levy, giving you are not doing that, how are you going to address that? And Julia Gillard, can we ask you, as the prime minister to introduce the NDIS, what do you say to those that are saying that the funding is spiralling out of control? Anthony Albanese: We might leave questions for Julia until the end. On the NDIS, the NDIS was very clear and it is what we will have the heart of it. It is about the people who receive that support and their needs. One of the things about the NDIS as well is that all the economic analysis shows that if you are allowing people to fully participate in society, criticism and economic return. It is an investment. An investment in dignity, and investment and inclusiveness, an investment in our nation. That is what we are committed to doing. The shortcuts we have seen and the waste from the AAT procedures and the legalese and the bureaucracies are really undermining the system. That is why will have extra staff as well for the NDIA. Q: Looking back at this campaign, do you think you put your best foot forward? Are you happy with how we have gone? Do people know you are now? Anthony Albanese: I think they have always known that and I was never worried about the spin that was put by our opponents of this campaign. One of the things about this campaign, putting my best foot forward, I am very proud to have served in Julia\u2019s government and in Kevin\u2019s government. I do note that we are now less than 36 hours from an outcome and I am still waiting for a single criticism from the government of the timing which I served as a senior minister in the Labor governments, over six years. During the campaign, I have been positive. I have been who I am. I don\u2019t pretend to be perfect. What I do is accept responsibility. I won\u2019t go missing. I will accept the great honour if I am elected tomorrow to the prime minister of this great country. Anthony Albanese then runs through his stump speech. We have comprehensive positive plans which we will be advocating right up until 6pm tomorrow. What the government has, what the government has is fear campaigns and smear campaigns. Shirking responsibility and smoking while they do it. A government that has left Australia with trillions of dollars in debt but not enough to show for it. The government took out the mortgage but forgot to buy the house. A government that has not enough to show for the debt that has been created and a government that doubled the debt before the pandemic. That is the choice facing Australians tomorrow. Three more years of the same, three more years of dysfunction and disunity or a Labor government that is united. Labor SA premier Peter Malinauskas then steps up: It\u2019s a great pleasure at [to speak ahead of] the man that I really hope is the next prime minister of Australia, not for the Labor party\u2019s sake but for the sake of the Australian people and our collective ambition for the common good. Julia Gillard, who has seen a resurgence of recognition with younger voters after her \u201cI will not be lectured by that man\u201d speech was turned into a TikTok trend, speaks to the women of Australia: I\u2019ve got a particular message for Australian women, having served as the only woman to hold the job as prime minister. You would know in the years since that I\u2019ve made my focus women\u2019s leadership, amongst the biggest things that I do. What I want to see for this country is the government that cares about, values and includes women. And I know that a government led by Albo will do precisely that. So Australian women, if you want to make a better choice, please, tomorrow, go to your ballot places, go to your polling stations and vote Labor and vote for Albo to the prime minister. I am very confident it will be a government for women. The Labor\u2019s leader press conference has begun \u2013 he still at a school in Adelaide in the electorate of Boothby. The bell rings. There you go, the bells are still tolling for the Morrison government, he says. Julia Gillard steps forward to give him her endorsement: It\u2019s a pleasure to be here and as you know I do this much any more. I never do it any more but I have made particular exception today and the reason I\u2019ve done that is because they wanted to come and support my friend, Albo. Albo and I might look really young but the truth is that we have known each other for more than 40 years right back to when we were university students. And with the authority that the more than 40 years of friendship gives me, I can certainly say the following about Albo: he is ready to the prime minister, he will be a great prime minister. This from Elias Visontay is worth your time Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia party is burning through its projected $70m election advertising spend, including hour-long television commercials, as a data analyst warns the fringe party could have more backing than polls predict, with some voters embarrassed to voice their support. It has been a verrrrry long campaign Anthony Albanese, Peter Malinauskas and Julia Gillard are visiting a school in Boothby, and have gotten absolutely mobbed by kids for selfies. They seemed to have timed the arrival perfectly for the recess time at Cabra Dominican College, with hundreds of students massing to see the politicians and media cameras. But not everyone was exactly up-to-date with what was going on, or who they were flocking to get photos of. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy running against ScoMo,\u201d one young girl told her friend. \u201cIs he the guy in the glasses?\u201d one queried back. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here? None of us can vote,\u201d noted one boy. Gillard was a hit with many young women, who flocked for photos and quick conversations. Albanese waved and smiled, while Malinauskas shook hands and tossed a footy with some of the older boys. Case numbers are also increasing. Dipping out of politics for a moment: The AFL grand final will stick to its usual afternoon time slot at the MCG as the 2022 premiership flag decider returns to Melbourne for the first time in two years, in a win for traditionalists who were resistant to the idea of shifting the start time by two hours. In an acknowledgment of broad fan sentiment, this year\u2019s showpiece event on 24 September will begin at 2:30pm AEST, after the last two grand finals were forced interstate by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and played later in the day. Last year\u2019s decider \u2013 a twilight start at Perth\u2019s Optus Stadium \u2013 was considered a roaring success, while the 2020 game was a night fixture played at the Gabba in Brisbane. But recent polling of fans had indicated a prevailing preference for an afternoon start \u2013 an AFL Fans Association survey revealed 79.9% wanted an afternoon start, while 17.3% preferred a twilight game and just 2.8% a night clash. The AFL\u2019s chief executive Gillon McLachlan said the league appreciated the success of last year\u2019s match in Perth, but a return to normality post-Covid restrictions was the deciding factor. \u201cPrior to the start of this season, we emphasised that after two really challenging years, we all yearned to return to the footy rituals and routines that set the rhythms of our lives, to continue to focus on getting back to football and going to football as we know it,\u201d McLachlan said in a statement. \u201cThat return-to-rituals principle underpinned our decision making in ratifying a traditional start time \u2013 the prestige, nostalgia and atmosphere of the day grand final is something we all know and love. The Labor campaign has moved on to a school AAP journalist Marty Silk has rounded up the newspaper election editorials: You can read the Guardian view here: And hear more about why, here: There appears to be queues around the nation for prepolling. People really just want to switch off at this point. We can\u2019t blame them. Asked if she has any tips for Albanese\u2019s final day on the trail, Gillard said \u201che doesn\u2019t need my advice\u201d and that he was \u201ccampaigning magnificently\u201d. Albanese ordered a piccolo, while Gillard had a long black. Albanese joked about having to pace himself with coffee, saying it was his third for the day so far. Albanese and Gillard reminisced about their first meeting, debating the exact date but landing on 1982 when she was 21 and he was 18. The group talked about education, campaigning and their dogs. A who\u2019s-who of SA Labor joined Anthony Albanese at an Adelaide cafe this morning, as former PM Julia Gillard made a rare appearance in national politics. Albanese kicked off a three-state swing on the last day of the campaign with a visit his team calls a \u201ccandid coffee\u201d with local candidate for Sturt, Sonja Baram. Albanese and his partner Jodie Haydon joined Gillard, as well as South Australian veterans Penny Wong, Don Farrell and Mark Butler at the coffee shop in Norwood. The quiet cafe descended into a bit of chaos as the national media pack and half a dozen politicians crammed in; as did a group of Liberal volunteers brandishing \u201cwon\u2019t be easy under Albanese signs\u201d. The campaigners, wearing shirts for Liberal MP James Stevens, were quickly shooed out by the owner. A truck bearing a large billboard of the same Liberal ad slowly circled the block. \u201cI came down to see Albo,\u201d Norwood resident Rob told us, walking down to the scene after seeing an ABC reporter on the news giving a live cross from his local cafe. He noted Sturt was a long-time Liberal area, but claimed there was a \u201cmood for change\u201d on the ground. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d other local regulars asked as they entered to see a dozen flashing cameras. Others walked up and simply turned back, sighing after seeing the media scrum. Albanese grabbed Butler\u2019s baby son for a cuddle and a photo, as the Labor table chatted. Behind them on a wall-mounted TV, Channel Seven\u2019s morning show was coincidentally interviewing Christopher Pyne \u2013 the former Liberal MP for Sturt \u2013 in a segment on the most notable gaffes of the election campaign. A local married couple peered curiously through the window at the packed cafe. Clutching a large SLR camera with a long lens, the man said he wanted to see \u201cfewer words, more action\u201d from politicians. We\u2019re despairing for state of the world,\u201d his wife said. Albanese will hold a press conference in Adelaide in around an hour\u2019s time. Anthony Albanese appears to be taking \u201cembrace the small target strategy\u201d quite literally. There is obviously a little bit of anger around the leak in the Australian today about Marise Payne wanting to double the foreign aid to the Pacific \u2013 something which was rejected, the report says, on cost. Simon Birmingham was not happy this morning, telling ABC radio RN: I\u2019m not going to debate the validity of the newspaper report, especially on the source it came from, if indeed there is accuracy to any elements of it, and those sources could be multiple, as you well know. Prepoll will easily pass the previous record of 4.6m votes judging from what we are seeing around the country: Paul Karp reports Scott Morrison has realised he called his Swan candidate by the wrong name \u201cKirsty\u201d instead of \u201cKristy\u201d after reading from his notes and has peppered his speech with a lot of Kristy\u2019s. It is all happening Scott Morrison has doubled down on his \u201cdying with Covid\u201d rather than \u201cdying of Covid\u201d line he started using earlier this week. But as he admitted himself this morning, there is no breakdown for either. Everyone is tired Scott Morrison\u2019s first event is a community breakfast in Swan, Perth. Almost none of these have been organic events that occur regularly, more usually they are groups convened by the prime minister\u2019s staff and local candidates. With Liberal MP Steve Irons retiring, Swan is a battle between Liberal Kristy McSweeney and Labor\u2019s Zaneta Mascarenhas. I toured three Western Australian seats in March, including Swan, a battle that Labor is framing as between an engineer (Mascarenhas) and a political insider, because McSweeney is a former Liberal staffer and regular contributor to Sky News. Most voters I met had little awareness of their local candidates, and were more focused on Morrison and his handling of the pandemic. It wasn\u2019t good news for the PM, with many thinking he got in the way of Mark McGowan\u2019s response or, at best, took credit for the premier\u2019s work. Far from feeling Morrison was the better devil they know, many noted he had flip-flopped on WA\u2019s border. At the breakfast Morrison and McSweeney will be joined by senators Matt O\u2019Sullivan and Slade Brockman and the attorney general Michaelia Cash, McSweeney\u2019s former boss. The event is at the George Burnett Leisure Centre in Karawara. If re-elected, the Coalition has committed to spend $2.42m upgrading the George Burnett Park, including a new Youth Challenge Park, lighting and improvements to the cycling track. The AEC has released this statement: On Friday 22 April 2022 candidates for the federal election were formally declared at public events held across Australia, in accordance with the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Electoral Act). There has been recent public commentary regarding the enrolment of the following three candidates. Andrew Charlton, ALP candidate for Parramatta Richard Welch, Liberal Party candidate for McEwen Bruce Nockles, Liberal Party candidate for Eden-Monaro As with similar previous matters, the AEC has investigated each of these matters and at this point it is our view that there is insufficient evidence of enrolment fraud or false declarations to support referring any of them to the AFP. Anthony Albanese is about to start his Adelaide campaign with a coffee with Julia Gillard We should start to hear from the leaders in their press conference soon What was Penny Wong\u2019s take on the vibe of the country? Wong: I\u2019ve been to every state and territory and I\u2019ve spoken to voters in seats across this country from Tasmania to the Northern Territory from the seat of Swan to seats in Victoria and I say this: that the one common theme is people really don\u2019t think Mr Morrison is the man for the future. I think people understand that he\u2019s a man who blames others. They\u2019ve heard \u2018It\u2019s not my job\u2019 too many times. They\u2019ve heard him blame others. They\u2019ve they\u2019ve heard him always make excuses. People want change and Mr Morrison gets that, but the only change he\u2019s offering is a promise that he\u2019s going to change. That\u2019s the thing that\u2019s most remarkable [about] this last week. The Liberals\u2019 final-week strategy is \u2018I promise I will change\u2019. Well, they\u2019re not going to, are they. The only way you\u2019re going to change things is if you change the government. The Australian newspaper has reported a leak from the National Security Committee (a big deal in itself) with a story Marise Payne had wanted to increase foreign aid funding to the Pacific last year and was rejected. Penny Wong, in an interview with ABC radio RN, said the leak from the committee was extraordinary but also showed how the government \u201cdropped the ball\u201d on the Pacific: This has leaked the day before the election. What this shows again is Mr Morrison dropping the ball that they simply did not keep ensure that they looked at how Australia could make sure we were the partner of choice. How do we ensure that we secure our region? That\u2019s the key strategic question. And on this, Mr Morrison dropped the ball and Australian security is paying the price. Neil Mitchell: What sort of machine will you be if reelected? We go into another gear, the strength mode is something you always need as prime minister... Mitchell: So what? Are you a bulldozer with different gearing? Or a whipper snipper? Or a lawnmower? They land on \u201ca bulldozer with a different gear\u201d. Asked whether he likes Anthony Albanese or not, Scott Morrison says: No, I mean, that\u2019s not what politics is about. I mean, I don\u2019t agree with him. I don\u2019t think I don\u2019t think he\u2019s up to the job. And I don\u2019t think he knows anything about the economy. And I think he\u2019ll increase debt and deficit. And I think he\u2019s a loose unit on public finances, but, you know, I\u2019ve spent social time with him and none of this is personal. It\u2019s about the future of the country. It\u2019s actually not about me and him and our personalities. I mean, that\u2019s what people vote on in reality television. This is about policies. Q: Are you really telling me people aren\u2019t voting this election on the basis of whether they like you or Anthony Albanese? Because... Morrison: What I\u2019m saying is that that\u2019s not what the election is about. Asked if he has seen any modelling of the impact of Covid during the winter, Scott Morrison says he has seen some \u201cearlier in the year\u201d. Has he seen any since then, Neil Mitchell asks? Any updates? They constantly look at these things, the health department constantly looks at these things,\u201d Morrison says. Asked about Australia\u2019s death rate, with 75% of Australia\u2019s deaths occurring this year, Morrison says: What we do know about Covid is that our hospital system has stood up and that that was always the biggest thing we was seeking to protect and Covid now is in a different phase. We\u2019re in phase four now, where you live with the virus and let me make this point about those who have passed away with Covid. There is a difference between passing away with Covid and passing away because of Covid. So what is the breakdown? How many have died of Covid and how many have died with Covid? Morrison: There is no breakdown of that. The health department isn\u2019t able to break those numbers down at the state level. But my point is when you\u2019ve got Covid with so many people having it, you will have people who are passing away for many different reasons. And it is highly possible they\u2019ll have Covid. They they might have a cold as well, they might have a number of things. Scott Morrison claimed underdog status earlier on in this interview with 3AW, but then says people who claim he is going to lose \u201care wrong\u201d. Neil Mitchell: Your own polling tells you you\u2019re going to lose? Scott Morrison: It\u2019s very tight. Federal elections are always very tight. Mitchell: Does it tell you are going to lose or does it tell you could win? Morrison: It is up to the Australian people and it is the same conversation we had three years ago. I don\u2019t talk about my polling. Why would I talk abut my polling? Mitchell: Well, because some of the insiders are telling me the prime minister is toast, we\u2019re gone. Are you toast? Morrison: They\u2019re wrong. And they were wrong last time to, remember. Everybody is so certain before polling day. What I am always certain that it was the Australian people and their judgment, who quietly go about their business and listen carefully and consider it and weigh it up. On 3AW Scott Morrison has slightly finessed his answer about minority government, he hasn\u2019t ruled out governing in a hung parliament, he has only ruled out horse-trading Liberal policies: We form a government based on people supporting our policies. If they want to support our policies, great, but we\u2019re not about to pursue policies that we think would harm the national interests of the economy, the jobs push up inflation, and push up interest rates ... Will I trade policies? No, no. Asked if he will negotiate with the independents, Morrison said that if negotiate means trading policies, then no, but did not rule out \u201ctalking\u201d to them \u201cif they want to support our policies\u201d. But Morrison said the teal independents \u201cdo not support our policies\u201d: The Greens do not support our policies and frankly we don\u2019t support this because we think they\u2019ll harm Australia. So, it sounds as though accepting confidence and supply from Bob Katter or others, say, Rebekah Sharkie, then that would be just fine. Scott Morrison finally got a soft run for his super-for-housing policy on Brisbane B105. He also unveiled a new attack line against independents: that a hung parliament will result in government by Twitter: A lot of people are saying that they are a little bit disillusioned by this election that they might be going for the independence or the Greens ... We\u2019re facing a lot of challenges both economically, there\u2019s a lot of pressure, and equally in an international security. The war in Europe, all of these issues. China and its own it\u2019s, it\u2019s a very, it\u2019s a very challenging environment. The last thing we need is a weak parliament where basically, you know, people are voting based on what Twitter\u2019s saying and you know, we need strength in our parliament to get through this. And if a government has to negotiate its existence every day, based on how independents are going to jump by what\u2019s been said on Twitter, then frankly, that\u2019s not going to help the country be strong at this time. I understand while people are pretty tired of politics, they\u2019ve seen premiers on the screens every day talking about Covid telling them what they can and can\u2019t do. And then pretty much people are pretty much over governments telling them what to do. And I\u2019m looking forward to putting that right behind us and never going back there. So I get it that people are feeling frustrated. But the answer is not to make things worse. By voting for independents that just will create chaos in the parliament. Over on Melbourne radio 3AW, Scott Morrison is being pushed on whether he still claims he won\u2019t make any deals with the crossbench in the event of a hung parliament and he turns it into an attack on Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court. Neil Mitchell asks if he would \u201crather lose\u201d than form government with the crossbench: Morrison: I would rather run a government that can do the job and not trade away important policies that are really critical for Australia\u2019s future. If people want to support our policies, fine. But if people want us to change things that we think would damage the economy and damage Australia\u2019s national security, that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying do not vote for those teal independents. And then we saw the true colours on them. This week with Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, I mean, that is behind all this money coming out of that big family. And what we\u2019re seeing in the comments that were made about John Howard as the \u201cangel of death\u201d, and then the bullying we saw of Jane [Hume] the other day at the polling booths. Mitchell: Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court says he wasn\u2019t talking about Josef Mengele when he said \u201cangel of death\u201d. Morrison: Well, who else was he talking about? Mitchell: [He says] He was quoting a Liberal insider who had said John Howard was the angel of death who turns up when the seats in real trouble. Morrison: I think that\u2019s a bit cheeky, and frankly, a bit unbelievable. I mean, everybody knows what angel of death means. And I think the use of that phrase was absolutely disgusting \u2026 There is a great respect for Mr Howard and his service to the country. And what has been exposed by what Simon has called him and said is the real sort of hatred of the Liberal party and and he\u2019s motivated by these things. And the way he\u2019s spoken about this to John Howard, I just found absolutely disrespectful. And I think people in those communities, expect their candidates to be respectful, and I think it has exposed those people attendance for exactly who they are just people who hate the Liberal party. Jason Clare was asked if he had leadership ambitions. As a parent with young children, he says (publicly and privately) he doesn\u2019t want the job. He tells the ABC: No, I don\u2019t. Someone said to me the other day, more zingers than a KFC. My kids have seen more of me on TV than in real life. Q: Would you like to be leader at some stage? Clare: I don\u2019t have that ambition. I hope to be part of an Albanese Labor government, building a better future for all Australians. There are about 17,229,000 registered voters in Australia. And an (almost) record number of them have either voted early or asked for a postal vote, the AEC says: With one day to go more than 4.6 million Australians have voted at an early voting centre, which is on track to easily eclipse the 2019 total of 4.7 million and set a new record. The total number of postal vote applications is 2.73 million and more than 25,000 people have voted with an AEC mobile voting team. This means a combined 7.35 million people have accessed voting services ahead of election day, with one day to go. And the official statement on the phone voting change has been released by Ben Morton: The Federal Government, in consultation with the Federal Opposition, has immediately acted on advice provided by the AEC this morning. Any voter who has tested positive for COVID-19 after 6pm Friday 13th May will be able to access the Secure Telephone Voting service. It is important that every Australian who is enrolled and entitled to vote, be able to exercise their democratic right and this change ensures that. Anthony Albanese\u2019s campaign has arrived in Adelaide, first stop in a three-state blitz of marginal seats on the final day of the campaign. We\u2019re expecting visits to Tasmania and Victoria later today. The Labor leader starts in the seat of Sturt, where he\u2019ll be joined by former PM Julia Gillard for a coffee catch-up at a cafe. Albanese will hold a press conference in Adelaide later this morning. Labor has launched its \u201cfinal-day pitch\u201d video on social media, featuring Albanese walking through his childhood suburb of Camperdown, in Sydney\u2019s inner west. \u201cWe can do so much better,\u201d Albanese says, in a black T-shirt and skinny grey chinos. Spliced with staged footage and clips from the election trail \u2013 including packed campaign rallies and cuddling babies \u2013 Albanese presents the election choice as three more years of the same or unlocking the potential of this great country: Our best days are ahead of us. Tom Rogers says the AEC staffing issues has also been largely addressed, with election-day polling venues identified to be of concern decreasing from 76 to 15. It is remote Indigenous communities which are still listed as \u201cvenues of concern\u201d: This is an unalloyed good news story of community members stepping up for democracy in a pandemic but it\u2019s not at all a clear runway \u2013 that\u2019s not how running an election in a pandemic works. Our efforts to engage army reservists, public servants, local councils, police services, job seekers, education departments and others will mean that many regional voting centres with no confirmed staff two days ago will now be able to open. We couldn\u2019t be more appreciative to the more than 7,000 people who\u2019ve put their hand up to work in these regional areas of need in the past 72 hours. The absolute vast majority of the 7,000 election day polling places will be in operation and we\u2019re continuing to work as hard as possible to staff the remaining 15 venues of concern. Those areas are: Kowanyama, Coonawarra, Hyden, Karumba, Jervois, Pannawonica, Arno Bay, Paraburdoo, Georgetown, Broomehill, Wirrulla, Coolgardie and Hopetoun. The AEC commissioner Tom Rogers has released a statement: Telephone voting for people who have tested positive to COVID-19 commenced on Wednesday evening. Only people testing positive after 6pm on Tuesday are able to access the service, in line with the timeframe set out in regulations the AEC must follow. \u201cThere has been a lot of discussion about the telephone voting service provision and we not only understand people\u2019s passion for democratic participation but live and breathe it every day,\u201d Mr Rogers said. \u201cThe telephone voting service was legislated by Parliament as an emergency measure for individuals who had no other voting option once postal vote applications closed at 6pm on Wednesday.\u201d \u201cThe AEC cannot change the eligibility criteria but have certainly heard the concerns expressed by members of the public who tested positive to COVID-19 prior to 6pm on Tuesday and had not cast an early vote or applied for a postal vote. \u201cWe have analysed the service\u2019s take-up so far, our staffing levels and forecasts for use, and are in urgent discussions with Government about the concerns expressed by members of the public. \u201cThis morning I have signed a brief recommending for the eligibility for the service be expanded.\u201d Scott Morrison has confirmed the government will expand eligibility for telephone voting. On 6PR radio he said : What we\u2019ve been waiting on is for the electoral commissioner, the special minister of state he\u2019s been working with the electoral commissioner in recent days, and we\u2019ve been waiting for the electoral commissioner\u2019s advice on how he believes this can be fixed. We\u2019ve received that advice now, and they\u2019ll be expanding eligibility to people who tested positive after 6pm last Friday, that\u2019s the recommendation of the electoral commissioner. He\u2019s worked through the logistics of all of that, what that means, on the call centres and all of those sorts of things, the practical issues that he has to be satisfied of. Jason Clare, who has acted as Labor\u2019s campaign spokesperson this campaign, is then asked about Anthony Albanese\u2019s campaign \u201cgaffes\u201d: I think what Australians have seen over the last six weeks is that Albo is an honest bloke. He doesn\u2019t treat politics like it\u2019s a game. He didn\u2019t make up his own nickname. He\u2019s a bloke who will take responsibility, not shirk it. He\u2019s not the sort of bloke who will say it\u2019s not my job. He\u2019ll bring the country together. Australians have had a gutful of this rip and divide, pull Australians apart, try to create a wedge on every issue. He has brought business and unions together to create better outcomes. Jason Clare has responded to the news there is a solution on the horizon for Covid-positive people who became positive after the legislated phone voting cutoff while speaking to ABC TV: We\u2019re glad to hear it. This is ridiculous, the idea that potentially 200,000 Australians who got Covid last weekend could have missed out on voting this weekend. Just because of a regulation. This can be fixed with a stroke of a pen. I suspect the only reason the government is acting now is because of the media pressure. Good on the media for highlighting this issue. If it wasn\u2019t for the media, potentially 200,000 Aussies could have missed out on casting their vote tomorrow. Anthony Albanese says Labor has been pushing for a solution: We have been raising this with the government for a series of days through Don Farrell \u2013 our shadow minister. The government can fix this and they should. Our vote is precious. Our democracy is precious and it shouldn\u2019t be the plaything of government incompetence. The independent candidate in Kooyong Dr Monique Ryan was also planning an urgent court challenge. A brief has been approved to change the legislation and allow all Covid-positive Australians to use the phone voting system, the ABC reports. There is a phone system in place, but the cutoff was on Tuesday. Anyone who tested positive in the gap before Tuesday 6pm, who didn\u2019t have a postal vote, had been left without options. That looks to have changed. That\u2019s the danger with such a big run of interviews \u2013 people want to talk about the issues. The voting issue is gaining momentum. Between Covid, problems for some people overseas, coronavirus impacting the available workforce and the ability to open up booths, particularly in rural and regional communities, and the impact of floods in northern NSW, voting has been a very fraught issue this time round, and the AEC has been working overtime trying to plug the gaps. Over on the Nine Network, Scott Morrison is all about those \u201cquiet Australians\u201d again: That is up to them. I have always respected the decisions of Australians, those quiet Australians as I refer to them, they are out there working hard every day and they are considering their choice very carefully. Scott Morrison has been asked if he\u2019s being less of a bulldozer, why not let the Murugappan family go home to Biloela. Morrison told ABC News Breakfast: There\u2019s two issues goes on there, one is a ministerial case, being considered by the minister for immigration and he does that independently, that is the matter for the minister for immigration. On the second point, there are court matters still proceeding on this particular issue and to date there has not been a finding that Australia has a protection obligation in that case. The discretion to allow them to stay is \u2026 a ministerial intervention case and [Alex Hawke] makes that independently, he doesn\u2019t do that on the basis of my recommendation or anyone else. He considers the matters before him. Again, I don\u2019t pressure my ministers on these one way or the other. It is why it is called ministerial intervention and it is independent. Scott Morrison has firmed up his answer about whether all Australians should be able to vote. He told ABC News Breakfast: We want to make sure Australians have as much opportunity as they should in a democracy to vote, and any recommendation that the electoral commission provides to us we will certainly act on, whether that means changing regulations or anything of that nature. We will take his advice. It is not something for politicians to interfere in. We have an independent process but we are ensuring the commissioner has every support that he can conduct the election in the best possible way. That question to Scott Morrison came after yesterday\u2019s press conference. He was asked whether he thought there was any comfort for people who were doing it tough to hear that unemployment was low. Scott Morrison has been challenged on Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise about the fact that unemployment is just 3.9% but real wages are going backwards. He said: I don\u2019t think [unemployment is] just a number on a page \u2013 they are real jobs, 94,500 full-time jobs, people in real full-time jobs. That\u2019s what occurred in the last month and around 400,000 more jobs than there were before the pandemic; 3.9% is the lowest since 1974 \u2013 I was six years old. [About 88,000 jobs were lost in that same period though.] Morrison blamed inflation for real pay cuts: Wages have ticked up to 2.4% through the year, a slight increase. The real problem is inflation, the real challenge is inflation and Australians understand what is causing this inflation is what is coming from outside of Australia, the war in Europe, disruption or supply chains, the shutdowns in China, these are things that will continue to press on Australia. Scott Morrison is now about to speak to the Seven Network. It\u2019s about 5.30am in WA so he is using the time difference to be on as many east coast media slots as possible. Scott Morrison has rejected a conspiracy theory propagated mainly by the United Australia party (and a few Liberals) about Australia signing up to a World Health Organization treaty that would allow the Chinese government control over our health restrictions, including lockdowns. He told 2GB Radio: There has been this thing going on about some WHO treaty, I hear the United Australia party has been going on about it. It\u2019s complete rubbish. There is no treaty that we\u2019re signing up to. I would never do that. I\u2019ve rejected United Nations treaties that have tried to interfere in Australia\u2019s sovereignty on immigration before and I certainly wouldn\u2019t allow it in terms of how public health is run in this country. But you know what happens before an election, people put all sorts of rubbish out there to try and confuse people. And to your listeners today I just want to be very clear, Australia would never sign up to such a treaty under my government, and they can be very confident about that when they see those things, they can just ignore them because they\u2019re rubbish. Scott Morrison has suggested the government would act to close the lacuna in the law preventing hundreds of thousands of Covid-positive people from voting \u2013 but it would depend on the Australian Electoral Commission to recommend how. Morrison told 2GB Radio: If the commissioner wishes to make further recommendations then of course the government would support that. I\u2019m sure the opposition would as well ... But the powers that were sort of provided, and of course we want to see people have the opportunity to vote and, and we\u2019d encourage the commissioner to continue to administer the election independently, and manage it in the way that the commission always have ... If the commissioner wishes to make recommendations, then the government would certainly act on those recommendations. Asked if everyone needed to be able to vote because we don\u2019t want people saying the election was rigged, Morrison replied: Of course, and that\u2019s why we have an independent election process here in Australia run by a very competent electoral commission, one of the best in the world. And that is certainly the objective that the commissioner has to fulfill. But Morrison was cautious \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t unambiguously say this needs to be fixed: I don\u2019t think these things should be decided by politicians \u2013 it should be decided by the electoral commissioner. What I\u2019m saying is that the electoral commissioner is the one who has to make those recommendations to ensure this process is independent, he will be aware of all the issues that relate to this and what is in the best interests of running a fair election which maximises the opportunity for everybody to vote. It\u2019s the final full day of campaigning before the polls officially open and both leaders are zooming across the country amid blanket media appearances as they try one final roll of the dice to win undecided voters. Scott Morrison will start the day in WA, where he is sandbagging the Liberal seats of Pearce, Swan and Hasluck, as well as Curtin, which has faced a strong independent challenge. Anthony Albanese continues his marginal seat blitz with three states on the agenda this morning after a whirlwind visit to Queensland yesterday. It\u2019ll start in Victoria as he tries to find Labor\u2019s pathway to a win \u2013 as well as hold everything it already has. Either way, there is no avoiding the campaigns today. With the advertising blackout, politicians will be everywhere, filling the gap of their ads have left. Nowhere is safe. You have Paul Karp following Morrison and Josh Butler with Albanese, while Katharine Murphy leads our coverage from Canberra. Sarah Martin continues the most comprehensive coverage you\u2019ll find of election spend this campaign (there\u2019s a big whiff of pork in the air) while Daniel Hurst highlights what\u2019s happening in foreign affairs and defence. And me? I\u2019ll continue to be your typing monkey for most of the day. I can\u2019t bare to look at another piece of chocolate, if you want to know how things are going. The coffee IV seems to be working well. OK, ready? Didn\u2019t think so. But alas, we have no choice."

            "title": "Jacinda Ardern acknowledges \u2018difficult period\u2019 as Labour party slumps again in polls ",
            "date": "2022-05-04T03:04:21Z",
            "content": "Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Labour party is continuing to slump in popularity, as New Zealand reckons with a worsening cost of living crisis. New polling found the centre-right National party leads Labour although a Labour-led coalition would still have a strong chance at government. The Newshub-Reid research poll put Labour down 6.1 points to 38.2% since its last poll in February, and National up 9.2 points to 40.5%. Ardern\u2019s personal popularity had also dropped 7%, to 36.3%. While still behind Ardern, National leader Christopher Luxon had risen in the preferred prime minister stakes at 23.9%, an increase of 6.1%. It marks Ardern\u2019s lowest result in the Reid poll since she became prime minister in 2017, and the best result for a National leader since before that election. The latest poll is in line with other results earlier in the year. In March, a TVNZ/Kantor poll found National had overtaken Labour \u2013 albeit by a smaller margin \u2013 for the first time since the pandemic began. Those results mark a return to business-as-usual for New Zealand, which has typically relied on the development of multiparty coalition governments rather than single-party rule. The last election, in which Labour won a large enough chunk of the vote to govern alone, was a departure from the norm \u2013 driven by Ardern\u2019s personal popularity, and huge support for the government\u2019s Covid-19 response. Now, New Zealand\u2019s attention has turned from the Covid response to the growing challenges of inflation and the cost of living. In April, annual inflation reached a 30-year high of 6.9%, and in March, food prices were 7.6% higher compared with a year prior. Despite government tax relief on petrol, prices at the pump have been driven up by the flow-on effects of the war in Ukraine. The cost of housing and renting remains a concern, with median rents up 7% year on year, while high prices continuing to lock many first-time buyers out of the housing market. Ardern told Newshub that the results reflected a difficult time for the country. \u201cIt has been a really difficult period for New Zealand and then of course, by default, that makes it a difficult period to govern through,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be from time to time tough decisions that need to be made and if that means that we take a bit of a hit in the numbers, so long as we stand by all of the decisions we\u2019ve made - and we do - then that\u2019s a price we\u2019re willing to pay.\u201d National party leader Christopher Luxon, who took the party\u2019s helm this year, told the New Zealand Herald the results were a result of broad dissatisfaction from New Zealanders. \u201cWhy it\u2019s happening is the public is just feeling that it\u2019s a government that\u2019s all spin and no delivery and it doesn\u2019t get things done,\u201d he said. Under the current numbers, both major parties would be courting coalition options beyond their traditional partners. On the right, the libertarian Act party is sitting at 6.4%, and on the left, the Greens at 8.4%. If the election were to take place tomorrow, that would place the left and right blocks neck and neck, with neither able to form a government with just one coalition partner. Both would be looking to Te Pati M\u0101ori \u2013 the M\u0101ori party \u2013 to get them over the edge, with its 2.5%. The next election must be held before January 2024."

            "title": "Australia election: voters to go to polls in battle of \u2018bulldozer\u2019 and \u2018builder\u2019",
            "date": "2022-05-20T02:12:52Z",
            "content": "Australians head to the polls on Saturday with the opposition Labor party, led by Anthony Albanese, hoping to end nine years of conservative rule. The Liberal-National coalition government, headed by Scott Morrison, goes into the election with 75 MPs in the 151-seat House of Representatives, one short of the majority needed to govern without crossbench support. Labor has been ahead in opinion polls since the campaign began, but the lead has narrowed in the final week of the campaign, and the party is haunted by its failure at the last election, in 2019, when the polls wrongly suggested it would win. The six-week election campaign has largely been an attritional slog between two uninspiring leaders, but enlivened by high-profile independent candidates and minor parties challenging the offerings of the government and opposition. Morrison\u2019s Liberal party has come under pressure in formerly safe inner-city seats, which have been targeted by grassroots campaigns backed by millions of dollars in donations from the lobby group Climate 200 and supporting, almost exclusively, female candidates. The independents are running on a platform of stronger action to address the climate crisis, establishing a national anti-corruption body and addressing gender inequality, all areas where Morrison\u2019s government is seen as weak. Despite the push by the independents and the Greens to put global heating on the agenda, neither major party has committed to strong climate action. The coalition committed, after much reluctance from the rural-based National party, to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but includes new gas projects in its technology-led recovery. Three weeks into the campaign a Nationals senator, Matt Canavan, declared the net zero ambition \u201call over bar the shouting\u201d. Labor presented a modest plan hinged on building more efficient transmission lines and reducing industrial emissions, which has been supported by the business lobby as at least representing some steps towards a credible policy. Among the seats targeted by independent campaigns is Kooyong, the inner-city Melbourne seat held by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. Government MPs in target areas, including Frydenberg, have attempted to distance themselves from the unpopular Morrison and instead called in the conservative former prime minister John Howard to campaign extensively in an attempt to keep their seats. If even a few independent candidates are successful it could result in a hung parliament, the first since 2010. In the upper house, where minor parties have a better chance of election and overall majorities are rare, the Greens hope to gain three seats, which would bring the party\u2019s Senate team to 12. Morrison has focused his campaign on electorates in the outer suburbs and regional cities that have traditionally been held by Labor, in what has been described as an emulation of the \u201cred wall\u201d strategy employed by Boris Johnson in the 2019 UK election. He has shaped his pitch for re-election on the government\u2019s record in getting Australia through the Covid-19 pandemic with the economy intact and without significant loss of life in the first two years. This year, however, Australia has experienced one of the highest Covid transmission rates per capita in the world, with 5,633 deaths since the start of 2022, compared with 2,239 in 2020 and 2021 combined. Morrison said in the last week of the campaign that there was no need for further public health measures to reverse this trend. Morrison promised to change the way he governed if re-elected, admitting to being \u201ca bit of a bulldozer\u201d. Albanese has campaigned largely on the platform of not being Scott Morrison. \u201cThis government has been there for almost a decade, this prime minister had four years in office, and what he\u2019s saying is \u2018if you vote for Scott Morrison, I\u2019ll change\u2019 \u2026 well, if you want change, change the government,\u201d Albanese said. The Labor leader, who was the manager of government business in the 2010-13 parliament, the most legislatively productive in Australia\u2019s history despite Labor having no majority, said he was a \u201cbuilder\u201d to Morrison\u2019s bulldozer. \u201cA bulldozer wrecks things. A bulldozer knocks things over. I\u2019m a builder, that\u2019s what I am. I will build things in this country,\u201d he said. Albanese suffered early from repeated gaffes, including his failure to name the cash rate (the central bank interest rate) or the employment rate on the opening day of the campaign, leading to repeated criticism from Morrison and the Murdoch press, particularly Sky News, that he was not across policy detail. He contracted Covid two weeks into the campaign and spent a week in isolation. Both major parties have focused on the cost of living, as Australia faces a housing affordability crisis, the first rise in the cash rate since 2010, and wages growing at half the inflation rate. Labor has promised to support wage increases for low-paid workers, address the gender wage gap, boost manufacturing, and introduce a $392m housing equity scheme that would allow the government to provide a contribution of up to 40% of the purchase price of a new home. Albanese said he would support a minimum wage increase of 5.1%, in line with inflation, which would amount to about $1 an hour for workers on the minimum wage. Morrison called that \u201cincredibly reckless\u201d and said such a rise \u201cwould force small businesses potentially out of business all together\u201d. \u201cAnthony Albanese is a loose unit on the economy,\u201d Morrison said. The coalition then announced its own plan to address the extreme housing affordability crisis, which would allow Australians to access their superannuation to buy their first home, a move experts say would increase house prices and shrink the retirement savings of millions of Australians. Neither party has backed an increase in Australia\u2019s unemployment benefits, which are below the poverty line, and they remain in lockstep on Australia\u2019s hardline policies on asylum seekers."

            "date": "2022-05-11T15:56:42Z",
            "content": "The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin\u2019s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. If Russia attempts to annex the Kherson region it would make a peace agreement more unlikely, as Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Russia\u2019s withdrawal to prewar positions was a precondition for any successful negotiation. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. The annexation call was made on Wednesday by Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military administration Russia put in place to run Kherson in late April. Russia occupied Kherson in March and seized its city council building in late April. \u201cThe city of Kherson is Russia; there will be no the KNR [Kherson People\u2019s Republic] on the territory of the Kherson region, there will be no referendums,\u201d said Stremousov in a televised briefing. \u201cIt will be a single decree based on the appeal of the leadership of the Kherson region to the president of the Russian Federation, and there will be a request to make [Kherson] into a full-fledged region of the Russian Federation.\u201d Stremousov previously said that Kherson would begin using the rouble currency, a move seen as creeping integration into Russia. Russian officials who have visited Kherson have promised not to abandon the region. \u201cRussia is here to stay forever,\u201d said Andrei Turchak, secretary general of Russia\u2019s ruling United Russia party, while visiting Kherson last week. \u201cThere should be no doubt about it. There will be no return to the past.\u201d But similar requests for annexation from territories such as the Russian-controlled Donetsk People\u2019s Republic have languished for years, as the Kremlin has dangled integration while seeking to put pressure on Kyiv. Putin began his new war in Ukraine by announcing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, territories with local administrations also controlled by Russia. While there have been rumours they could hold new referendums to demand accession into Russia, that has not yet taken place. Local leaders say their model outcome is that of Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 after a referendum under a puppet government. But few Russians have a similar attachment to the Kherson, Donetsk, or Luhansk regions, or want to see them as part of the Russian Federation. Turchak gave a careful answer when asked if Kherson would become part of Russia: \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. In any case, the status will be determined by the residents,\u201d he said. That view was echoed by the Kremlin on Wednesday, with its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying any appeal should be \u201cdecided by the residents of the Kherson region \u2026 and residents of the Kherson region should also determine their fate\u201d. He also said the decision would have to be vetted by lawyers and legal experts to be \u201cabsolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea\u201d. Analysts have said that the call for annexation without a referendum indicated the weakness of the Russian position in those regions. Russia \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel stable on occupied areas, they can\u2019t afford even fake referendum as in 2014. No local support at all,\u201d wrote Maria Zolkina, a political analyst at Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based thinktank. Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, vowed that the Kherson region would be recaptured before any annexation could take place. \u201cThe invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play,\u201d said Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser."

            "content": "Store shelves across the US remain short of baby formula after a military plane carrying enough to fill half a million baby bottles arrived in the US on Sunday but its contents were rushed to health system outlets to feed babies with specific allergies. The first of several such flights from Europe, aimed at relieving a nationwide shortage that has sent parents scrambling to find enough to feed their infants, was packed with specialty hypoallergenic formula to be distributed through channels such as hospitals, doctors\u2019 officers and pharmacies, for babies intolerant of the protein in cow\u2019s milk. The 35 tons of formula had been shipped from Switzerland via Germany and arrived in Indianapolis on Sunday, after Joe Biden authorized the use of military planes. The shipment was greeted on the tarmac by the US agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, who explained it was formula specifically \u201cfor moms and dads who have children who have allergies where the regular formula just simply will not work\u201d. That left many parents who are still scouring supermarket shelves for supplies of regular formula out of luck. More supply flights are due and the Biden administration has ordered a ramping up of production in the US, including increased delivery of raw materials to formula manufacturers. Longer term, the government has expressed a desire for more competition in the domestic industry, which is dominated by a handful of companies. \u201cIt goes back to this question of how we can bring more competition in our economy, have more providers have this formula so that no individual company has this much control over supply chains,\u201d Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, said on Sunday. Last week, the leading brand Abbott reached an agreement with US health regulators to resume production at its largest domestic factory, in Sturgis, Michigan, which has been under investigation over safety concerns."

            "date": "2022-05-24T11:17:58Z",
            "content": "Security forces in Sudan have mounted a fierce crackdown in recent days to crush remaining unrest, six months after a coup that brought a military regime to power in the unstable strategic country. Police fired teargas and shotguns at protesters as thousands took to the streets in the capital, Khartoum, and twin city of Omdurman on Monday. The violence followed a similarly harsh response to demonstrations over the weekend. In all, 113 people have been injured and one killed in recent days, according to doctors. Ninety-six protesters have been killed since the coup in October last year, and more than 1,500 detained. Security forces have carried out a wave of arrests targeting the resistance committees, a network of informal associations that have organised most of the protests. Nazim Siraj, a high-profile pro-democracy campaigner known for organising medical assistance to injured protesters, was detained on Sunday. \u201cIn the last few days, they have increased the arrests. Two from our [resistance] committee were taken at the weekend. There have been lots of other people taken. We are keeping a low profile these days,\u201d said Yousef Abdallah Adam, a 35-year-old painter and decorator who leads a pro-democracy \u201cresistance committee\u201d in south Khartoum. Legal representatives said 80 people associated with the protest movement had been detained in less than two weeks. Many have been dispersed to prisons around the country, often hundreds of miles from their homes. \u201cThe authorities believe the wave of arrests will have an impact on the momentum of the protests but the resistance committees will continue to exercise their right to peacefully protest despite the pressure on them,\u201d said Osman Basri, of the Emergency Lawyers\u2019 Association in Khartoum. \u201cThey will not stop until they achieve a civilian government\u201d. The October coup came two and a half years after the 2019 popular uprising that led to the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir and derailed Sudan\u2019s move from a power-sharing arrangement to democracy. It prompted massive protests, with huge crowds in streets in cities across Sudan denouncing both the military takeover and a subsequent deal that reinstated the prime minister, Abdullah Hamdok, but sidelined the pro-democracy movement. Hamdok resigned in January, saying he was unable to work with the military. Though protests this weekend were the largest for some time, the pro-democracy movement is struggling to mobilise big crowds. In Omdurman, hundreds of mainly young people gathered on Shaheed Abdul Azim Street throughout the afternoon carrying flags, banging drums and chanting protest songs. They blocked traffic with rocks and burning tyres. Some wore plastic helmets or protective glasses. Many had been injured in previous demonstrations and the mood was defiant. \u201cI was protesting against Bashir, against the army rule afterwards, against the coup too. We are many and we will win,\u201d said Momin Ahmed, 27, who has yet to regain the full use of an arm after being shot earlier this year. Ijlal Syed Bushera, 43, said the protest movement would win eventually. \u201cEven if more are killed and they drive trucks over us we be here until we achieve the goals of the revolution,\u201d Bushera told the Guardian. After two hours, police moved in, firing teargas and charging with vehicles to disperse the unarmed protestors who ran down side streets, coughing and streaming tears. Activists admit the crackdown and holidays during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have made it harder to organise large protests, but also say they have switched tactics away from mass rallies to focus on smaller, localised demonstrations. Observers say the unrest that eventually ousted Bashir after 30 years in power started with small but repeated protests but grew as the economy plunged in the last months of the Islamist autocrat\u2019s rule. The military seizure of power in October prompted international donors, including the US and the World Bank, to pause significant amounts of economic assistance and debt relief to Sudan. Economic chaos threatens, with millions of people already facing a severe shortage of food and inflation soaring. Earlier this week, the US government warned American businesses and individuals against dealing with businesses owned by the Sudanese state or controlled by the military. The new advice \u201cshows the costs of the Sudanese military failing to cede power to a credible, civilian-led transitional government\u201d, US officials said. The recent crackdown has been condemned by international and regional powers. The African Union and the United Nations mission in Sudan appealed to authorities \u201cto stop the violence, release all detainees, including members and leaders of the resistance committees, stop all arrests \u2026 lift the state of emergency and [conduct] credible investigations \u2026 into all violent incidents\u201d. The governor of Khartoum state, Ahmed Othman Hamza, praised the role of security forces in maintaining security and stability. The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors said injuries in recent days have been caused by live ammunition, stun grenades, stones and moving vehicles. They included limb fractures, bullet wounds, and breathing difficulties from teargas."

            "title": "Putin\u2019s choices filled with peril on eve of Victory Day parade ",
            "date": "2022-05-07T15:53:03Z",
            "content": "On the brink of its May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russia looks very far from triumph in its war in Ukraine. And all of its options going forward are fraught with danger. After a disastrous assault on Kyiv, Russia is engaged in an attempt to take territory in Ukraine\u2019s east, as its military nears exhaustion and sanctions continue to escalate. \u201cWith the current force that they have, the push that they\u2019re attempting now is all that they have left,\u201d said Jeffrey Edmonds, former director for Russia on the US national security council and senior analyst at the CNA thinktank. \u201cMilitaries just don\u2019t recover that quickly from such a devastating loss. And given how effective the Ukrainians have been with our support, I just don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be able to achieve their objectives within the coming weeks. And the coming weeks are going to be the telltale of where this is going.\u201d Facing setbacks, officials have suggested that Vladimir Putin may use the May 9 holiday to repackage the war in Ukraine. Dramatic options include escalation through a formal declaration of war or general mobilisation \u2013 or de-escalating by proclaiming victory. Alternatively, Putin could offer up a \u201csandwich\u201d, as one analyst put it, that praises the Russian army\u2019s \u201cvictory\u201d while preparing the population for a grinding and painful conflict as status quo. Ukrainian officials in particular have warned that Putin is planning to announce a mass mobilisation, or even to declare war against Ukraine, calling up personnel and resources that were untapped under Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cspecial operation\u201d that began on 24 February. \u201cRussia has already moved to covert mobilisation and is preparing to announce open mobilisation in the near future,\u201d said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence, in an interview this week with the Ukrainian news outlet New Times. \u201cI\u2019m quite curious: how will they explain this to their own people?\u201d The Kremlin has denied it is planning a mobilisation, although some Russians have leaked call-up papers and state orders relating to a potential mobilisation online. A number of enlistment offices have been targeted in arson attacks since March, including one in remote Nizhnevartovsk last week as rumours of a coming mobilisation grew. But a formal mobilisation, which could see tens of thousands of reservists pulled from their jobs, and borders closed to fighting-age men, is something that Russia has never managed before. It would be highly disruptive to the economy and would further raise the stakes in a war where Russia has already disappointed on the battlefield. \u201cProclaiming mobilisation will make this war highly unpopular,\u201d said Pavel Luzin, a Russian military expert. He also questioned whether it would be \u201ctechnically possible\u201d \u2013 \u201cWhat can you do with the mobilised people? Which officers and military units can deal with them?\u201d \u201cThis is no magic pill for them, it\u2019s not a get-out-of-jail free card for Putin,\u201d Edmonds said, noting that by the time new troops were brought up, the \u201cRussians could be falling apart\u201d. Fearing defeat, Russia may threaten to raise the stakes even further. Top propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov showed a simulation of a nuclear strike against the UK on national television this week. \u201cJust one launch, Boris, and England is gone,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce and for all. Why play with us?\u201d Putin may also hint at the potential for nuclear conflict as he stands before the heavy weaponry, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that he returned to the Red Square parade in 2008. \u201cHe also knows that we\u2019re going to be listening to him, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s some nuclear rhetoric in there as well,\u201d said the CNA\u2019s Edmonds. He said he remained sceptical that Russia could use a tactical nuclear weapon in the conflict, but like others noted that the Kremlin has become more unpredictable. \u201cIf Putin sees this as becoming existential, then all bets are off the table.\u201d Seeing the limited potential for victory, Putin could also seek to de-escalate the conflict. Standing before his military and the country on Monday, Putin could announce that Russia has achieved its major war aims in Ukraine by allegedly destroying Ukrainian military capacity, and by taking near control of several mid-sized cities such as Mariupol and Kherson. But that may also be a tough sell, as the Ukrainian military could try to retake lost ground, leading to further losses even if Russia stakes a defensive position. A senior Russian official last week in Kherson said that Russia had returned \u201cforever,\u201d making the idea of a political settlement that would return control of its territory to Ukraine even more remote. And as Ben Noble, an associate professor of Russian politics at University College London, noted, the Kremlin\u2019s vague and changing war aims have meant that many people in Russia may be left unsatisfied with whatever Putin eventually claims as victory. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the strongest reason why many people say that the Kremlin is in a corner now, that they\u2019re stuck, because they\u2019re inevitably going to disappoint some groups with whatever they claim as a victory in the broader term,\u201d he said. Expectations of a big announcement on 9 May, he said, may speak more to the frustration among those outside the Kremlin than to the fact that anything meaningful will be announced. \u201cThey want a sense of certainty, they want a new chapter in this conflict,\u201d he said. While the Kremlin may feel political and economic pressure to end the war, a grinding conflict may be better than admitting defeat. \u201cI assume he will use the 9th of May to somehow address the victory \u2026 something a lot of sociologists tell us is that Russians want this to be over but in a good way,\u201d said Anton Barbashin, the editorial director at Riddle Russia and a political analyst. \u201cBut I would expect that he also needs to introduce some new challenges as well. It needs to be a sandwich, it can\u2019t be just victory. There is so much going on, and by now Putin is aware of the economic risks and problems that are going to arise quite soon. So you probably need to propose a strong vision of how Russia is challenged.\u201d That is already visible in state media reports that explain Russia is at war with Nato rather than just with Ukraine in order to justify some of the military\u2019s recent defeats. The Kremlin is also facing an urgent ideological challenge, Barbashin noted, as the war increasingly begins to affect ordinary Russians who may not have a clear idea of why Russia decided that it would invade Ukraine in the first place. \u201cThe more I think of it, the more astonishing it is that this war has shown that Russia has no ideology whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to come up with something new but none of it actually makes sense. Russians do not understand what the hell Russia is doing there.\u201d Victory Day \u2026 as seen on TV While Russia\u2019s main military parade will be held on Red Square on 9 May, for millions of Russians, Victory Day is a spectacle that will play out on state television. The national holiday is spent with the TV on in many households, where the parade is bookended by news broadcasts and, usually, by Soviet war films and Russian blockbusters about the second world war. But this year may be different. The parade, which begins at 10am with a review of the troops and a speech by Putin, is among the most-watched programmes of the entire year in Russia. State-affiliated pollsters estimate that more than half of households watch it, although those numbers could be inflated. While rumours have swirled about a major announcement by Putin of a military mobilisation or a \u201cmission accomplished\u201d message, he usually dedicates the speech to familiar lines about the \u201cspectre of fascism\u201d and a recognition of veterans of what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War."

            "date": "2022-05-19T06:00:12Z",
            "content": "Conflict and violence forced people from their homes a record number of times last year, a report has found, with sub-Saharan Africa bearing the brunt of mass internal displacement caused by \u201chuge spikes\u201d in fighting. People fleeing violence were internally displaced 14.4m times in 2021, an increase of 4.6m on 2020, according to figures published by the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC). Most of those displacements \u2013 11.6m, or 80% of the total \u2013 took place in sub-Saharan African countries, with the war in northern Ethiopia dwarfing other conflicts in terms of the number of times people were forced from their homes. Alexandra Bilak, IDMC director, said the geographic concentration of the conflict-related displacement across sub-Saharan Africa, from the Sahel to east Africa, was a huge concern. \u201cThese are, of course, countries that have experienced long histories of conflict, but what these numbers show is that the conflicts are far from having been resolved,\u201d she said. \u201cSo on top of protracted crises, you get new waves of violence every year. In Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, we\u2019re talking huge spikes of new violence that have led to incredibly large numbers being displaced and, at least for now, very little prospect for returns.\u201d New flare-ups of violence often collided with climate pressures such as drought or flooding, and resulting food insecurity, making it even harder for countries to give internally displaced people (IDPs) the help they needed, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no window during which some kind of stabilisation could happen, and some degree of return or sustainable local integration. These constant shocks to the system mean that the numbers keep increasing.\u201d According to the report, there were 59.1 million IDPs globally in 2021, a cumulative figure, which has grown steadily since the IDMC began documenting in 2003. Every year more displacement is caused by natural disasters than conflict, but last year the number of forced movements due to disasters such as such as storms, floods and volcanic eruptions \u2013 23.7 million \u2013 was down considerably on 2020. The number of times people were forced from their homes by violence was of particular concern to the IDMC. As the report deals with 2021, the figures do not include the huge humanitarian fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where more than 7 million people are thought to be internally displaced. The only place to rival that scale of displacement was Ethiopia, where conflict \u2013 chiefly war between government forces and Tigrayan rebels in the north of the country \u2013 triggered 5.1m internal displacements. Until the invasion of Ukraine, that was the highest annual figure ever recorded for a single country. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which saw 2.7m displacements due to conflict, and Afghanistan, where the Taliban toppled Ashraf Ghani\u2019s government, also registered all-time highs. The volatile situation in Myanmar, where the military staged a bloody coup, helped triple the overall figure for east Asia compared with the previous year. With more than half the global IDP population under 25, and about 25 million under 18, the IDMC called for more targeted interventions to protect children and young people from the particular dangers they face. \u201cThe financial difficulties IDPs tend to face may force children to engage in dangerous income-generating activities, including crime, transactional sex or joining armed groups,\u201d the report notes. \u201cStrengthening child protection systems that consider these risks is essential.\u201d Displaced girls and boys, it adds, confront different risks, with girls at greater risk of sexual violence and child marriage, and boys of recruitment by fighters. Bilak hoped the report would raise awareness of the worsening plight of IDPs, which historically had received \u201cmuch less attention\u201d from governments and policymakers than that of refugees or migrants. \u201cThis is, first and foremost, a call for acknowledgment of the scale \u2026 and the urgency of the issue,\u201d she said. Faced with the stark increase in conflict-related displacement, she added, the IDMC urged greater investment in peace-building, \u201cand in preventing those conflicts from happening in the first place\u201d."

            "date": "2022-05-19T18:13:06Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has invoked the Defense Production Act to address the shortage of infant formula by speeding production and authorizing flights to import it from abroad, as experts warned desperate parents not to concoct their own \u201chome brew\u201d alternatives. The safety-related closure of the nation\u2019s largest formula manufacturing plant has seen a nationwide squeeze on supply. The Defense Production Act order requires suppliers of formula manufacturers to fulfill orders from those companies before other customers, in an effort to eliminate production bottlenecks. Biden is also authorizing the US defense department to use commercial aircraft to fly in from overseas formula supplies that meet federal standards, in what the White House is calling \u201cOperation Fly Formula\u201d. \u201cBypassing traditional cargo routes will speed up the importation and distribution of formula and serve as an immediate support as manufacturers continue to ramp up production,\u201d a senior administration official told reporters on a call Thursday. Under pressure from parents and lawmakers, the official acknowledged that availability varied by state and said the administration was prepared \u201cto pull every lever\u201d to address the shortage. Supplies of baby formula across the country have been severely curtailed in recent weeks after a February recall by Abbott exacerbated supply chain disruptions among formula makers, leaving fewer options on store shelves and anxious parents struggling to find nutrition for their children. Although baby formula has already been affected by pandemic-related supply chain problems, the nationwide shortage has severely worsened in the three months after Abbott\u2019s recall, which occurred as a result of illnesses and deaths among infants. In March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a warning to consumers, urging them to be aware of certain products branded Similac, Alimentum and EleCare that have been recalled. The FDA launched an investigation after complaints emerged of bacterial infections in four infants who consumed powdered infant formula produced in Abbott Nutrition\u2019s facility in Michigan. According to the reports, all four infants were hospitalized and the bacterial infection may have contributed to the deaths of two of them. All four cases involved the Cronobacter sakazakii infection, which according to the FDA \u201ccan cause severe, life-threatening infections (sepsis) or meningitis (an inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine)\u201d. Cronobacter infections are rare but are especially high-risk for newborns, the agency said. As a result of the recall, approximately 30% of popular baby formula brands may be sold out across the nation, according to an analysis by Datasembly, which assessed supplies in more than 11,000 stores. The shortage has hit poorer families the hardest. Nearly half of the baby formula in the country is bought under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as Wic. Wic is primarily aimed at helping low-income women and their children across the nation. Abbott provides formula to approximately half the infants who are receiving Wic benefits and is just one of the four companies that produce approximately 90% of US formula. Earlier this week, Abbott reached an agreement with US health regulators to resume production at its largest domestic factory. The factory, located in Sturgis, Michigan, has been under investigation in recent months due to safety concerns. Monday\u2019s legally binding agreement between the company and the FDA outlines various steps the company needs to take to reopen its plant. Nevertheless, despite the agreement, Abbott has said that it will take between six and eight weeks before more formula starts arriving on American shelves. In the meantime, parents have been warned not to concoct their own formulas at home. In recent weeks, experts have seen parents using 60-year old recipes, diluting formulas and creating other homemade alternatives. According to experts, such so-called \u201chome brews\u201d can be dangerous due to challenges with sterility, and insufficiency in critical nutrients such as iron. \u201cThe standard by which we develop infant formula is breast milk. We\u2019ve come to understand breast milk better and better,\u201d Steven Abrams, former chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 committee on nutrition, told the BBC. \u201cIf they\u2019re not breastfeeding, [the formula] has got to have all the nutrients in there\u201d. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advised parents to check smaller stores and drug stores for formula and to buy formula online from well-recognized distributors and pharmacies. It has also said that cow\u2019s milk may be an option if a child is older than six months and is usually on regular formula. Nevertheless, such an alternative is \u201cnot ideal and should not become routine,\u201d the organisation said."

            "content": "A week before election day 2020, the US secretary of defense was so worried that Donald Trump would seek to involve the military in the election in an attempt to hold on to power, he told the general commanding the US national guard to notify him of any communication from anyone at all at the White House. \u201cWithout being too explicit,\u201d Mark Esper writes in a new memoir, \u201cmy message was clear: the US military was not going to get involved in the election, no matter who directed it. I would intercede.\u201d Such an intercession, Esper writes, would involve trying to persuade Trump not to use the military to hold on to power, then if necessary Esper would resign, appeal to Republicans in Congress and hold a press conference to appeal to the American people directly. Esper thought Trump might order actions such as seizing ballot boxes in key states. Ultimately, Trump did not attempt to use the military to influence the election, which he lost to Joe Biden. He did seek to overturn the result by other means. Esper was fired by Trump on 9 November 2020, six days after the election. He details the extraordinary steps he felt compelled to take before that in a new book, A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Defense Secretary in Extraordinary Times, which will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. Esper devotes considerable space to his work with Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, to stymie Trump\u2019s attempts to use the military for political purposes, either in military strikes against Iran or in Syria \u2013 or even Mexico \u2013 or at home, by invoking the Insurrection Act against protesters for racial justice. Trump\u2019s request that such protesters be shot in the legs, and Esper\u2019s account of his resistance to it, has been reported elsewhere. The protests died down but Esper says the two most senior Pentagon figures remained concerned Trump could seek to use the military domestically, to tilt power his way. Esper describes a meeting at the Pentagon with Milley and the national guard chief, Gen Daniel Hokanson, on 30 October, \u201cthe last Friday before the election\u201d. The \u201costensible purpose of the meeting\u201d, Esper says, given it was visible to anyone who could see his calendar, was an update on national guard military police units placed on alert to placate Trump during the protests for racial justice. But with regard to the election, Esper says, \u201cthis was a serious moment\u201d. He says he told Gen Hokanson: \u201cIf at any point in the coming days \u2013 before, during or after the election \u2013 you get a call from anyone at the White House, take it, acknowledge the message, and call me immediately. The same rule applies if you hear of any TAGS [national guard state adjutant generals] or governors getting a similar call.\u201d Esper says he also asked Hokanson \u201cto figure out a discreet way to get this last part out, which he said he would\u201d. Esper writes that as the only civilian between the president and the military, he was concerned the White House might \u201ctry to circumvent me to do something inappropriate\u201d and \u201cwanted to be ready for anything\u201d. \u201cThe whole point of my game plan \u2013 the reason that I had taken so much crap over the last several months \u2013 was to be in this position, at this moment, to act. The essence of democracy was free and fair elections, followed by the peaceful transition of power.\u201d Milley, he writes, told him he and the other joint chiefs would \u201cresign if pressed to break their oath\u201d and involve the military in the election. Esper says he did not want to allow the generals \u201cto be put in such a compromising position, especially if a presidential order was legal but grossly wrong or inappropriate. \u201c\u2026 If such an order came from the White House, my immediate recourse would be to demand a meeting with the president. I would want to hear and understand the directive straight from him, to offer alternative solutions if such were possible, and to voice my opposition face-to-face if he was unyielding. If I was unsuccessful I would be forced to resign on the spot in protest. But that wouldn\u2019t be the end of the line for me.\u201d Esper writes that he would have called senior Republicans on Capitol Hill to ask them to intercede with Trump, then staged a press conference \u201cwhere I informed the country about all that had transpired and continued to unfold. \u201cI would present my best case and make an appeal to the American people, their elected leaders in Congress, and the institutions of government to intervene. The point would be to buy time and put pressure on the president to stand down.\u201d As Esper writes, election day, 3 November, \u201ccame and went without any incident involving the armed forces. Thank God.\u201d He says he was relieved that though the contest was not called until the following weekend, Biden\u2019s lead was clear. Esper also says he \u201cnever imagined\u201d what came next: Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the election through lies about electoral fraud and coordination with Republicans in Congress and other rightwing groups and advisers, culminating on 6 January 2021 in the storming of the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. The attack on the Capitol has been linked to seven deaths and has led to more than 800 charges. But it failed to stop certification of Biden\u2019s win. Having been fired after the election, Esper watched the attack on TV."

            "title": "US unveils new sanctions on Russia, targeting services, media and defense industry",
            "date": "2022-05-08T16:00:05Z",
            "content": "The US has unveiled a new layer of sanctions on Russia, targeting services, Russia\u2019s propaganda machine and its defence industry on the eve of Vladimir Putin\u2019s planned Victory Day parade. The new measures were announced as leaders from the G7 group of industrialised democracies held a virtual summit with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a show of solidarity. They are primarily intended to close loopholes in the existing sanctions and to tighten the noose around the Russian economy by another few notches. The new sanctions include: A ban on sales of US services to Russia, like accountancy and management consultancy. No more US advertising or sales of broadcasting equipment to three Kremlin-controlled television stations. Technology export bans including industrial engines, bulldozers and other items that can be used by Russian defence factories. Visa restrictions on another 2,600 Russian and Belarusian individuals, including military officials, and executives from Sberbank and Gazprombank.In imposing a ban on services the US is falling into line with the UK, which made a similar announcement last week. The two countries provide the overwhelming bulk of services like accountancy and management consultancy to Russian corporations. The Biden administration sees US service providers as potential tools Russia could use to sidestep the punitive measures already imposed. \u201cThey\u2019ve been asked by Russian companies to help them figure out how to reformulate their business strategies in the wake of sanctions, in some cases how to get around these sanctions, or in the case of accountants how to hide some of their wealth, and we\u2019re shutting that down,\u201d a senior administration official said. Like the UK, the restrictive measures do not apply to lawyers, but the US official said that could change, and that Washington and London are coordinating their moves in that respect. \u201cWe made a judgment at least for now, that if there was a desire to seek due process through a US lawyer, we would allow that to continue,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut we\u2019re reevaluating the breadth of these services sanctions every day, and depending on how we see behavior change over time, we can certainly broaden the sanctions.\u201d The new media sanctions will target three Kremlin-controlled propaganda outlets: Channel One, Russia-1 and NTV. American companies will no longer be allowed to sell equipment like video cameras or microphones to them, and US advertising on their channels will be banned. Last year, US companies bought $300m in advertising in the Russian market. \u201cA lot of these advertisers have announced since the invasion that they\u2019re going to cut their business activity with these stations, but we want to make sure that decision endures and just send a broader signal that US companies should not be in the business of funding Russian propaganda,\u201d senior a senior administration official briefing the press ahead of the announcement. The new technology export bans on industrial items such as heavy engines and bulldozers are intended to have an impact on Russian war efforts by hitting the supply chain for defence manufacturers. The US claims that Russia two major Russian tank plants, Uralvagonzavod Corporation and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, have already been forced to halt production due to a lack of foreign components. The 2,600 new visa restrictions on individuals include military officials and Russian proxies deemed to have played a part in the invasion and there will be a new visa policy which would apply automatically to military or proxy officials involved in human rights abuses. The targeted sanctions will also hit eight executives from Sberbank, Russian\u2019s largest financial institution, and 27 from Gazprombank, owned by Russia\u2019s giant gas industry. Until now Gazprombank has been left untouched because of its role in facilitating European purchases of Russian natural gas. \u201cThis is not a full block. We\u2019re not freezing the assets of Gazprom bank or prohibiting any transaction with Gazprombank,\u201d the senior administration official said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re signaling is that Gazprombank is not a safe haven, so we\u2019re sanctioning some of their top business executives, people who sit at the top of the organization, to create a chilling effect.\u201d"

            "title": "Pressure grows for summer mini-budget amid recession fears ",
            "date": "2022-05-12T06:40:01Z",
            "content": "Pressure is mounting on the government to deliver an emergency summer mini-budget after recession fears were heightened by a surprise contraction in the economy in March. Evidence that the cost of living crisis was biting even before the arrival last month of dearer energy bills and higher taxes led to a sharp selloff in shares and a drop in the pound\u2019s value to a two-year low against the US dollar. The Labour party, the TUC and the British Chambers of Commerce all pressed for urgent action from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, following the release of official figures showing a marked drop in consumer spending in March. Boris Johnson pledged that the government would \u201cdo things\u201d in the short term to ease the squeeze on living standards without providing any hint about what the measures might be. His pledge came amid growing speculation that the economy would fall into recession \u2013 two successive quarters of negative growth \u2013 over the coming months. According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in March after flatlining in February. Services, which account for about 80% of gross domestic product, contracted by 0.2%, with retail sales down by 1.4% and spending on cars collapsing by more than 15%. Production, which includes manufacturing, also fell by 0.2%, while construction bounced back by 1.7% after the disruption caused by Storm Eunice in February. The economy grew by 0.8% in the first three months of 2022, but only because activity rebounded strongly in January after the lifting of restrictions imposed in late 2021 to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity International, said: \u201cAny momentum the UK economy had as it emerged from the pandemic appears to be ebbing away. Numbers can be revised but it\u2019s clear the UK faces a serious fight to avoid recession this year.\u201d Paul Dales, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cIt now seems likely that GDP will contract in the second quarter. And with the full hit of the cost of living crisis yet to be felt, the chances of a recession have just risen. Even so, with price pressures still strengthening, the Bank of England may have no choice but to add to the woes of households by raising interest rates further.\u201d Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, said the figures for gross domestic product would increase the public\u2019s worries and urged the chancellor to produce an emergency mini-budget, a call echoed by the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cAnything less than coming back urgently with an emergency budget to help ease the pressure from the cost of living crisis is a failure by this Conservative government,\u201d Reeves said. Responding to the weaker-than-expected growth figures, Sunak said: \u201cThe UK economy recovered quickly from the worst of the pandemic and our growth in the first few months of the year was strong, faster than the US, Germany and Italy, but I know these are still anxious times. \u201cOur recovery is being disrupted by Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion of Ukraine and other global challenges but we are continuing to help people where we can.\u201d In the City, the FTSE 100 index closed 114 points lower at 7,233 \u2013 a drop of more than 1.5% \u2013 while the pound at one stage dropped below $1.22 against the US dollar and was trading at levels last seen during the early months of the pandemic. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: \u201cThe economy barely kept its head above the water during a volatile start to the year, but times look set to get that bit tougher. \u201cCost pressures and rising prices have tightened their grip, with both businesses and households feeling the pinch. The end result is a weaker economic outlook.\u201d Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cThe UK economy grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now clearly above pre-pandemic levels, although growth in the latest three months was the lowest for a year.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-04T13:21:56Z",
            "content": "At least no fridges were involved. On Tuesday, it had been Boris Johnson who got the Good Morning Britain treatment. A tough, no-bullshit interview with Susanna Reid that had found The Convict shorter than usual on convincing answers. On Wednesday, it was Keir Starmer\u2019s turn. And if the leader of the opposition had hoped he would be in for an easier ride, he was in for a big disappointment. There were to be no concessions for being trustworthy and not having spent the past five years trying to avoid the programme. Come the end, he too was begging for the exit. Albeit with rather more dignity intact than Johnson. Small consolation. The Convict\u2019s interview had taken place inside No 10. Starmer\u2019s was in the ITV studios, and this time Richard Madeley was allowed to join in the fun. Though he struggled to get a word in edgeways. Not something you can often say. The Labour leader looked tense, nervous and miserable from the off. As if the next 20 minutes were a punishment beating that he couldn\u2019t avoid, rather than an opportunity to sell his party\u2019s policies and pick up any stray votes before Thursday\u2019s local elections. Reid wasted no time on niceties, going straight in on Labour\u2019s plans for a windfall tax on energy companies. Here Starmer had a decent story to tell. He was only looking to tax excess profits, and even the BP chief exec had said a windfall tax wouldn\u2019t stop his company investing in cheaper green energy. Yet even now Starmer managed to sound defensive. As if he was expecting some kind of comeback. None came, as Reid looked satisfied enough with his answers and moved on to the national insurance rise. Would Labour keep it if it won the next general election? Starmer wasn\u2019t at all clear, other than that he definitely wouldn\u2019t have introduced it in the first place. But he couldn\u2019t be any more precise than that as it was impossible to know in what the Tories would leave the economy. On current form the choices appear to be disastrous or completely catastrophic. Yet Keir wouldn\u2019t be drawn. He might keep the tax he wouldn\u2019t have brought in, but there again he might not. And the best explanation he could offer for how he would replace the \u00a312bn to be spent on the NHS was recouping the money lost in fraud during the Covid pandemic. He didn\u2019t make it sound like the most convincing of plans. After Madeley briefly brought up the total non-story of Oliver Dowden\u2019s claims of an electoral pact between Labour and the Lib Dems, Reid moved on to Beergate. What exactly had gone on in Durham when Starmer was photographed through a window having a beer and a \u00a3200 takeaway curry that had been bought for 20 to 30 of his aides? Yes, chipped in Madeley, holding up the front page of the Daily Mail which for the seventh day in a row had led with the story, what had been going on? Anyone might think that Lord Rothermere, the Daily Mail\u2019s non-dom owner, was pissed off that Labour had promised to abolish non-dom status. At least this time the Labour leader was able to categorically deny that the Durham police had questioned him recently about the incident. The previous day he had \u2013 for reasons best known to himself \u2013 three times refused to answer the question. Something we normally expect of Johnson. And yet he managed to do so while still somehow looking and sounding uncomfortable. Borderline shifty. Releasing fragments of information under duress rather than just shooting down the whole story as a desperate attempt to undermine Labour\u2019s integrity. As a sign that he was doing something right and that the Tory establishment was worried. For the whole thing is so obviously bollocks. It was just Starmer and some aides having something to eat after a day\u2019s campaigning. Which was perfectly within the rules, as Durham constabulary had already concluded. It wasn\u2019t a party like the leaving dos or Boris and Party Marty\u2019s free-for-all in the Downing Street garden where staffers and empties had to be removed from the flower beds. And it wasn\u2019t as if anything had been planned. No one had come in to the office with the curry, singing \u201cHappy five days until the Hartlepool byelection to you\u201d. Hell, what kind of party only remembers to serve food at 10pm? And only serves one bottle of beer? What was needed was for Starmer to own the situation. To own the curry. To own the interview. To own the room. To be candid and yet rightfully dismissive of attempts by the Mail \u2013 aided and abetted by The Convict\u2019s very own mouthpiece, the Sun \u2013 to stigmatise every politician as equally venal. As bad as each other. Reducing everyone to his own level is straight out of the Johnson playbook. As it was, Starmer was left diminished, with the Johnson shills triumphant at his imagined guilt. None more so than the ever absurd Nadine Dorries, who is incapable of distinguishing between truth and lies. Though the public appear to be, as the Mail\u2019s campaign has had little effect with voters still quick to finger The Convict as the real wrong\u2019un. So maybe the Labour leader\u2019s discomfort was just a transient misstep. Certainly that seemed to be the Tory party\u2019s take. Why else would you send out an idiot like George Eustice to grab the headlines with a reminder to people not to shop at Waitrose. Let them eat Lidl cake. How to beat the cost of living crisis in one easy fix. Seldom has a government seemed so out of touch. Time for Starmer to stop apologising for himself. It\u2019s the Conservatives who should be saying sorry."

            "content": "Store shelves across the US remain short of baby formula after a military plane carrying enough to fill half a million baby bottles arrived in the US on Sunday but its contents were rushed to health system outlets to feed babies with specific allergies. The first of several such flights from Europe, aimed at relieving a nationwide shortage that has sent parents scrambling to find enough to feed their infants, was packed with specialty hypoallergenic formula to be distributed through channels such as hospitals, doctors\u2019 officers and pharmacies, for babies intolerant of the protein in cow\u2019s milk. The 35 tons of formula had been shipped from Switzerland via Germany and arrived in Indianapolis on Sunday, after Joe Biden authorized the use of military planes. The shipment was greeted on the tarmac by the US agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, who explained it was formula specifically \u201cfor moms and dads who have children who have allergies where the regular formula just simply will not work\u201d. That left many parents who are still scouring supermarket shelves for supplies of regular formula out of luck. More supply flights are due and the Biden administration has ordered a ramping up of production in the US, including increased delivery of raw materials to formula manufacturers. Longer term, the government has expressed a desire for more competition in the domestic industry, which is dominated by a handful of companies. \u201cIt goes back to this question of how we can bring more competition in our economy, have more providers have this formula so that no individual company has this much control over supply chains,\u201d Brian Deese, director of the White House National Economic Council, said on Sunday. Last week, the leading brand Abbott reached an agreement with US health regulators to resume production at its largest domestic factory, in Sturgis, Michigan, which has been under investigation over safety concerns."

            "date": "2022-05-07T05:10:23Z",
            "content": "Former US intelligence officers are advising their successors currently in office to shut up and stop boasting about their role in Ukraine\u2019s military successes. Two stories surfaced in as many days in the American press this week, citing unnamed officials as saying that US intelligence was instrumental in the targeting of Russian generals on the battlefield and in the sinking of the Moskva flagship cruiser on the Black Sea. The initial report in the New York Times on Wednesday about the generals was partially denied by the White House, which said that while the US shares intelligence with Ukrainian forces, it was not specifically shared with the intent to kill Russian general officers. The next day, NBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post all quoted officials as saying that US intelligence had helped Ukraine hit the Moskva with anti-ship missiles last month, making it the biggest Russian ship to be sunk since the second world war. As a general rule, espionage is carried out in secret, though western intelligence agencies have turned that rule on its head over the past few months by going public with what they knew about Russian preparations for invasion, and then with daily reports on the battlefield and from behind Russian lines. The new disclosures are different however, as they concern what the US espionage agencies themselves have been doing, rather than commenting on the state of the war. In both cases, the US was claiming a hand in historic humiliations for Moscow and for Vladimir Putin, triggering warnings of unintended consequences. Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official, said: \u201cMy personal view is it\u2019s unwise. I am surprised at the extent of official confirmation of the role of US intelligence in the sinking of the Moskva, and even more so the killing of the generals. \u201cThe big concern is that this sort of public confirmation of this extensive US role in the setbacks dealt to the Russians may provoke Putin into escalation in a way that he might not otherwise feel it necessary to escalate.\u201d John Sipher, who served for 28 years in the CIA\u2019s clandestine service, some of that time in Moscow, thought the decision to disclose details of intelligence sharing was misguided, but for different reasons. \u201cI just think it\u2019s disrespectful to the Ukrainians,\u201d Sipher said. \u201cIt\u2019s taking away from the people who are actually on the ground, who are taking advantage of the intelligence, who are collecting their own intelligence, who are fighting day and night.\u201d However, he did not think that it significantly raised the risk of escalation between Russia and Nato. \u201cPutin understands how the game is played. He gets intelligence to try to kill Americans if the situation is reversed, as he did in Afghanistan and other places. The Russians have spent years attacking us with cyber warfare and disinformation,\u201d Sipher said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think them being upset that America is sharing intelligence is a game-changer.\u201d European officials made clear their own intelligence agencies would not be following the US lead. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d one official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a carefully coordinated leak.\u201d An official from another European country cast doubt on the centrality of US intelligence to the Ukrainian targeting of Russian generals, saying the main factor was the predictability of Russian officers as they followed rigid Soviet-era doctrine. The breakdown in their secure communications equipment and the top-down hierarchy of the Russian army meant the top officers had to travel to the frontlines to be sure their orders were carried out and Ukrainian snipers were waiting for them. In the case of the Moskva, US officials were at pains to emphasise that Ukraine made its own targeting decisions, and drew information from multiple sources. \u201cWe are not the only sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians. They get intelligence from other nations as well and have a pretty robust intelligence collection capability,\u201d John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been fighting this war against Russia for eight years. It\u2019s not like they are completely blind to the way Russia organises itself and the way Russia conducts itself on the battlefield.\u201d This article was amended on 9/5/22 to correct an error in a quote"

            "date": "2022-05-26T15:00:05Z",
            "content": "Here comes Tom Cruise\u2019s Maverick again, breaking the rules, pushing the limits, buzzing the control tower, then flashing his toothy grin and getting away with it like it\u2019s still 1986. As with its smash-hit predecessor, though, there is one set of rules Top Gun: Maverick scrupulously obeys: those of the US navy \u2013 without its fighter planes, bases, aircraft carriers and full-on cooperation the Top Gun movies would never exist. It is no secret that the Department of Defense (DoD) willingly and frequently collaborates with the entertainment industry, including loaning out its most expensive toys. But that cooperation comes at a price, and it is not just financial. The DoD manages its screen image so carefully, some have suggested it is in effect an unnamed co-producer on thousands of movies, to the extent that Hollywood is operating as its propaganda machine. There is very little in Top Gun: Maverick to dispel such suspicions. As with its predecessor, it is an advertisement for the US military\u2019s professionalism, its sophisticated hardware and its ethos of \u2026 let\u2019s call it masculine camaraderie. Top Gun was 1986\u2019s highest grossing movie in the US, and it cast the navy in such a good light, they set up information tables outside some cinemas. According to estimates, recruitment across the US military jumped by 500% that year. The DoD has been working with Hollywood for nearly a century, going back to 1927 Oscar-winner Wings \u2013 the Top Gun of its day. Each service \u2013 army, navy, air force, marines, coast guard \u2013 has its own entertainment liaison office in Los Angeles, in addition to the Pentagon\u2019s own office, headed by Glen Roberts, who was 17 when Top Gun came out and names it as an influence. He spent 25 years in the air force, although, like many others, he never made it into the cockpit of an F-14. Roberts says his mission is to \u201cproject and protect the image of our armed forces\u201d. Currently they work on about 130 entertainment projects a year, he says \u2013 a dozen or so scripted movies, plus television shows, video games and scores of documentaries. \u201cProductions love us because we provide authenticity and credibility. And also, they get substantial cost savings.\u201d But there are also conditions about how the military is depicted. \u201cWe want to make sure that the productions that we support match our core values,\u201d says Roberts. Applicants must submit their entire script for approval, and accept any changes required. But red lines include showing classified or sensitive information, going against US law and government policy, basic human dignity (such as depicting real-life injured or deceased military members), and inaccuracy: \u201cIf the script says he\u2019s an air force pilot and he\u2019s flying an F-18. Well, that\u2019s a navy aeroplane.\u201d It\u2019s more an art than a science, Roberts says, but he denies that the DoD plays any kind of proactive role in the process: \u201cThe film-makers are the creatives. We\u2019re not the creative force \u2026 our job is to support them, really, not to push an agenda on to their story.\u201d Some film-makers have become very good at playing the military game. Top Gun producer Jerry Bruckheimer has collaborated with the DoD on movies including Black Hawk Down, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. Bruckheimer\u2019s former collaborator Michael Bay has gone even further, not just in overtly military-themed movies but also with his exhaustingly militaristic Transformers franchise. Bay once boasted of having \u201ca direct line to the Pentagon\u201d. Roberts\u2019 predecessor, Phil Strub, admitted in 2009 that the DoD would make recommendations to Bay. \u201cWe might say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve never shown an X, Y or a Z.\u2019 We\u2019ll send them information, talk about its role. Or they\u2019ll come back to us and say, \u2018We\u2019d like to have a C-17. Or what about an aircraft carrier and some F-18s?\u2019\u201d As such, Bay\u2019s Transformers movies became an extended showreel for US military might \u2013 aimed at children. The same could be said of superhero movies. We\u2019ve become accustomed, anaesthetised even, to seeing military personnel and machinery in the Marvel universe, for instance. The very first image of the first Iron Man is of Tony Stark riding through Afghanistan with a convoy of army Hummers, rocking out to AC/DC. And like so many Marvel superheroes, he operates in a semi-official capacity, teaming up with military sidekicks such as his buddy Rhodey, and fighting alongside US forces as part of the quasi-military Avengers. Iron Man and Iron Man 2 were made with DoD cooperation, as were many other Marvel movies, until the relationship reportedly soured over The Avengers depicting the US military launching a nuclear strike on New York. Captain America, whose comic-book origins as a propaganda tool for the military were satirised in The First Avenger, began to take a more critical stance towards his government in subsequent Marvel movies, such as Winter Soldier. But fences were mended with Captain Marvel, focused on Brie Larson\u2019s exemplary air force pilot. The collaboration was so deep, the air force even launched a tie-in recruitment campaign targeted at women, with the slogan \u201cevery hero has an origin story\u201d. Military involvement now goes far beyond simply action movies. Other recent recipients of DoD assistance include reality TV cooking shows, Pitch Perfect 3 (in which, for some reason, the a capella girl group go on a tour of military bases, even performing onstage in camouflage) and the climate-change satire Don\u2019t Look Up! According to one estimate, the DoD has collaborated on 2,500 movies over the decades, and its involvement is not quite as transparent as claimed. In his 2004 book Operation Hollywood, the journalist David Robb detailed how \u201cthe Pentagon has been telling film-makers what to say \u2013 and what not to say \u2013 for decades\u201d, listing examples from Tomorrow Never Dies to Star Trek IV to Lassie. In 2012, the British journalist Tom Secker, who runs the Spy Culture website, began filing freedom of information requests for DoD-Hollywood communications, and has amassed tens of thousands of pages of documentation, including annotated drafts of film scripts, to back up such claims. \u201cThey might claim they\u2019re relatively open about this, but they\u2019re not,\u201d says Secker. They\u2019re open in as much as that they have an involvement in Hollywood, but they\u2019ve never ever voluntarily published a set of their own script notes. And they\u2019ve done everything they can to try to cover them up.\u201d Secker has too many examples to list. In the original Iron Man script submitted to the Pentagon, for example, Tony Stark was against the arms dealers, including his own father, complaining that \u201cthe technology I\u2019m trying to save lives with is being twisted into some truly destructive weapons\u201d. In the eventual film, Stark becomes an arms dealer to the US military. In the 2014 version of Godzilla, a Japanese character\u2019s reference to his grandfather surviving Hiroshima was excised: \u201cIf this is an apology or questioning of the decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that will be a showstopper for us,\u201d say the Pentagon\u2019s notes. Instead, Godzilla, a monster inspired by US atomic bombing, is revived by a nuclear weapon and wades into battle alongside US military ships and jets. Scripts seeking to address contentious aspects of military history were either heavily altered or denied entirely. In movies dealing with institutional racism or sexism, such as 1995\u2019s The Tuskegee Airmen, stories were altered to make the culprit a single \u201cbad apple\u201d, rather than the institution itself. \u201cThey always say something vague, like: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just that we need a feasible depiction of military life,\u2019\u201d says Secker. \u201cIn practice, what that means is, anything to do with war crimes, sex crimes, mental health problems, military corruption, just goes.\u201d Film-makers have confirmed this. Oliver Stone\u2019s requests for assistance with his two Vietnam movies, Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July, were turned down by the DoD several times. Neither story was flattering towards the US military \u2013 Platoon depicts instances of drug abuse, racism and soldiers murdering Vietnamese civilians and each other; Born on the Fourth of July deals with postwar PTSD. But both stories were arguably \u201caccurate\u201d \u2013 respectively adapted from Stone\u2019s own wartime experiences, and those of Vietnam vet Ron Kovics. \u201cThe whole ethos of that office at the Pentagon is they\u2019re supposed to provide accuracy to the film-makers and they do the opposite,\u201d says Stone in Theaters of War, a new documentary on Pentagon-Hollywood relations. \u201cThey provide inaccuracy and lies.\u201d Many of cinema\u2019s most powerful anti-war movies have foregone the DoD\u2019s terms \u2013 The Deerhunter, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now, Dr Strangelove, Three Kings, Thirteen Days, Jarhead. Stone, incidentally, was offered the chance to direct Top Gun. He turned it down. When the original Top Gun came out, the humiliating defeat of the Vietnam war was still fresh in the mind. As such, it functioned as a slick corrective: an apolitical story set in peacetime, foregrounding cool imagery, carefree youth and only the briefest of skirmishes with an unspecified foreign adversary. Could the same be said of Top Gun Maverick? Again, it comes at the tail-end of an era of problematic US military intervention, this time in Iraq and Afghanistan. And again, it is a story with no political baggage or actual war to kill the vibe. It almost goes without saying that the navy\u2019s cooperation with the makers of Maverick was just as high as with the original Top Gun. A \u201cproduction assistance agreement\u201d between the DoD and Paramount obtained by Secker includes an agreement to \u201cweave in key talking points\u201d. Both the military and the entertainment sides seem to be just fine with such an arrangement, but civilians are largely in the dark. Traditionally, the military\u2019s role has been defending the US against such evils as state propaganda and control of culture, but today it\u2019s more difficult to know where to take the fight."

            "date": "2022-05-11T15:56:42Z",
            "content": "The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin\u2019s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. If Russia attempts to annex the Kherson region it would make a peace agreement more unlikely, as Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Russia\u2019s withdrawal to prewar positions was a precondition for any successful negotiation. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. The annexation call was made on Wednesday by Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military administration Russia put in place to run Kherson in late April. Russia occupied Kherson in March and seized its city council building in late April. \u201cThe city of Kherson is Russia; there will be no the KNR [Kherson People\u2019s Republic] on the territory of the Kherson region, there will be no referendums,\u201d said Stremousov in a televised briefing. \u201cIt will be a single decree based on the appeal of the leadership of the Kherson region to the president of the Russian Federation, and there will be a request to make [Kherson] into a full-fledged region of the Russian Federation.\u201d Stremousov previously said that Kherson would begin using the rouble currency, a move seen as creeping integration into Russia. Russian officials who have visited Kherson have promised not to abandon the region. \u201cRussia is here to stay forever,\u201d said Andrei Turchak, secretary general of Russia\u2019s ruling United Russia party, while visiting Kherson last week. \u201cThere should be no doubt about it. There will be no return to the past.\u201d But similar requests for annexation from territories such as the Russian-controlled Donetsk People\u2019s Republic have languished for years, as the Kremlin has dangled integration while seeking to put pressure on Kyiv. Putin began his new war in Ukraine by announcing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, territories with local administrations also controlled by Russia. While there have been rumours they could hold new referendums to demand accession into Russia, that has not yet taken place. Local leaders say their model outcome is that of Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 after a referendum under a puppet government. But few Russians have a similar attachment to the Kherson, Donetsk, or Luhansk regions, or want to see them as part of the Russian Federation. Turchak gave a careful answer when asked if Kherson would become part of Russia: \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. In any case, the status will be determined by the residents,\u201d he said. That view was echoed by the Kremlin on Wednesday, with its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying any appeal should be \u201cdecided by the residents of the Kherson region \u2026 and residents of the Kherson region should also determine their fate\u201d. He also said the decision would have to be vetted by lawyers and legal experts to be \u201cabsolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea\u201d. Analysts have said that the call for annexation without a referendum indicated the weakness of the Russian position in those regions. Russia \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel stable on occupied areas, they can\u2019t afford even fake referendum as in 2014. No local support at all,\u201d wrote Maria Zolkina, a political analyst at Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based thinktank. Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, vowed that the Kherson region would be recaptured before any annexation could take place. \u201cThe invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play,\u201d said Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser."

            "title": "Sudan security forces clash with protesters against military coup",
            "date": "2022-05-24T11:17:58Z",
            "content": "Security forces in Sudan have mounted a fierce crackdown in recent days to crush remaining unrest, six months after a coup that brought a military regime to power in the unstable strategic country. Police fired teargas and shotguns at protesters as thousands took to the streets in the capital, Khartoum, and twin city of Omdurman on Monday. The violence followed a similarly harsh response to demonstrations over the weekend. In all, 113 people have been injured and one killed in recent days, according to doctors. Ninety-six protesters have been killed since the coup in October last year, and more than 1,500 detained. Security forces have carried out a wave of arrests targeting the resistance committees, a network of informal associations that have organised most of the protests. Nazim Siraj, a high-profile pro-democracy campaigner known for organising medical assistance to injured protesters, was detained on Sunday. \u201cIn the last few days, they have increased the arrests. Two from our [resistance] committee were taken at the weekend. There have been lots of other people taken. We are keeping a low profile these days,\u201d said Yousef Abdallah Adam, a 35-year-old painter and decorator who leads a pro-democracy \u201cresistance committee\u201d in south Khartoum. Legal representatives said 80 people associated with the protest movement had been detained in less than two weeks. Many have been dispersed to prisons around the country, often hundreds of miles from their homes. \u201cThe authorities believe the wave of arrests will have an impact on the momentum of the protests but the resistance committees will continue to exercise their right to peacefully protest despite the pressure on them,\u201d said Osman Basri, of the Emergency Lawyers\u2019 Association in Khartoum. \u201cThey will not stop until they achieve a civilian government\u201d. The October coup came two and a half years after the 2019 popular uprising that led to the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir and derailed Sudan\u2019s move from a power-sharing arrangement to democracy. It prompted massive protests, with huge crowds in streets in cities across Sudan denouncing both the military takeover and a subsequent deal that reinstated the prime minister, Abdullah Hamdok, but sidelined the pro-democracy movement. Hamdok resigned in January, saying he was unable to work with the military. Though protests this weekend were the largest for some time, the pro-democracy movement is struggling to mobilise big crowds. In Omdurman, hundreds of mainly young people gathered on Shaheed Abdul Azim Street throughout the afternoon carrying flags, banging drums and chanting protest songs. They blocked traffic with rocks and burning tyres. Some wore plastic helmets or protective glasses. Many had been injured in previous demonstrations and the mood was defiant. \u201cI was protesting against Bashir, against the army rule afterwards, against the coup too. We are many and we will win,\u201d said Momin Ahmed, 27, who has yet to regain the full use of an arm after being shot earlier this year. Ijlal Syed Bushera, 43, said the protest movement would win eventually. \u201cEven if more are killed and they drive trucks over us we be here until we achieve the goals of the revolution,\u201d Bushera told the Guardian. After two hours, police moved in, firing teargas and charging with vehicles to disperse the unarmed protestors who ran down side streets, coughing and streaming tears. Activists admit the crackdown and holidays during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have made it harder to organise large protests, but also say they have switched tactics away from mass rallies to focus on smaller, localised demonstrations. Observers say the unrest that eventually ousted Bashir after 30 years in power started with small but repeated protests but grew as the economy plunged in the last months of the Islamist autocrat\u2019s rule. The military seizure of power in October prompted international donors, including the US and the World Bank, to pause significant amounts of economic assistance and debt relief to Sudan. Economic chaos threatens, with millions of people already facing a severe shortage of food and inflation soaring. Earlier this week, the US government warned American businesses and individuals against dealing with businesses owned by the Sudanese state or controlled by the military. The new advice \u201cshows the costs of the Sudanese military failing to cede power to a credible, civilian-led transitional government\u201d, US officials said. The recent crackdown has been condemned by international and regional powers. The African Union and the United Nations mission in Sudan appealed to authorities \u201cto stop the violence, release all detainees, including members and leaders of the resistance committees, stop all arrests \u2026 lift the state of emergency and [conduct] credible investigations \u2026 into all violent incidents\u201d. The governor of Khartoum state, Ahmed Othman Hamza, praised the role of security forces in maintaining security and stability. The Central Committee of Sudan Doctors said injuries in recent days have been caused by live ammunition, stun grenades, stones and moving vehicles. They included limb fractures, bullet wounds, and breathing difficulties from teargas."

Over the years many parents questioned the place of drama in the curriculum, saying: \u201cI do not want my child to go on stage.\u201d I would then explain that the purpose of drama in schools was not to produce the actors of tomorrow, but rather to give every student the opportunity to explore a wide range of issues. The hope and intention was to help young people to grow in self-confidence and to enable them to express their opinions in a thoughtful, articulate and challenging fashion. Perhaps it was this aspect that worried the authorities. All the world may be a stage, but there are those who are only happy if we stick to an acceptable script; they do not want too many hecklers. Catherine Griffin Dolwyddelan, Conwy \u2022 Dr Readman (quoting Mark Rylance) was so right regarding the teaching of drama in schools. It should be noted that the favouring of Stem subjects to the detriment of humanities in our universities is also cause for concern. Staff in various English, history, theology and archaeology departments have recently been threatened with redundancy. Lecturers feel that it is only a matter of time before these departments close for good and non-Russell Group institutions revert to technical colleges. Many vice-chancellors come from a business background and run their universities as such, preferring to spend money on property rather than on scholarship and deny working-class students (who may have a limited choice of universities) the opportunity to study the arts.

            "date": "2022-05-20T05:00:41Z",
            "content": "The cost of decommissioning the UK\u2019s seven ageing nuclear power stations has nearly doubled to \u00a323.5bn and is likely to rise further, the public accounts committee has said. The soaring costs of safely decommissioning the advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs), including Dungeness B, Hunterston B and Hinkley B, are being loaded on to the taxpayer, their report said. Failures in the government\u2019s investment strategy for the fund, which was set up to pay for the decommissioning, have led to the taxpayer topping it up by an additional \u00a310.7bn in just two years. The nuclear power stations are owned by EDF Energy and provide much of the UK\u2019s nuclear power-generated electricity, which makes up 16% of the energy mix. But the stations are nearing the end of their lives and are scheduled to stop generating electricity during this decade. The government has recently agreed that once the stations have been defuelled by EDF, which involves the removal of all the spent fuel from the reactor core and cooling ponds, ownership of the stations will be transferred to the government\u2019s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to complete decommissioning. \u201cThe pace at which the stations can be defuelled could have a big impact on the costs, between \u00a33.1bn and \u00a38bn depending on the time taken,\u201d the inquiry report said. \u201cSuccessful defuelling will depend on all parties being ready and working together, including the NDA being ready to receive and dismantle the volume of fuel arriving at Sellafield. Any delays in the defuelling process could result in costs increasing substantially. \u201cThe handover agreement does not appear to sufficiently \u2018incentivise cost efficiency and ensure a smooth transfer of defuelled stations to the NDA\u2019.\u201d The public accounts committee also said it had concerns over whether the NDA had the capacity to take on the seven AGR stations in addition to its other responsibilities, which includes decommissioning the older Magnox reactors. It will cost the UK taxpayer \u00a3132bn to decommission all the UK\u2019s civil nuclear sites and the work will not be completed for another 120 years, according to latest estimates. Boris Johnson has pledged to build eight nuclear power stations in eight years. But the UK has no facility for permanently and safely storing the waste from past, present or future nuclear power stations. Most is currently stored at Sellafield, one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. Nuclear Waste Services, an arm of the government, is seeking a site to build a geological deposit facility deep underground for all the UK\u2019s nuclear waste. MPs on the public accounts committee said in their report on Friday the government must learn lessons from the rising costs of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors and be clear how the decommissioning of proposed new nuclear stations would be funded. The seven stations were sold by the government to EDF in 2009, with the later agreement that the French company would remove the fuel from the stations when they closed, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority would take on the decommissioning of the sites. But the cost of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors that began to close last year, plus Sizewell B, has more than doubled from \u00a312.6bn in 2004-05 to \u00a323.5bn in 2020-21, the public accounts committee report said. \u201cThere remain significant uncertainties that will need to be managed to prevent further increases in costs and ease pressures on the fund,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe cost of defuelling will depend on the stations not closing significantly earlier than planned and how quickly they can be defuelled once electricity generation ceases.\u201d There was significant risk that the cost of decommissioning the seven AGRs would rise further, the report said. The public accounts committee, in a previous report, said the cost of decommissioning the older Magnox reactors \u2013 which were the first generation of UK nuclear stations \u2013 had increased by billions of pounds because of uncertainty over the condition of the sites and how to tackle the decommissioning. The PAC report said the closure of seven nuclear stations by 2028 would have a significant impact on energy production, but EDF has said there can be no extensions to the life of the reactors while the UK waits for new generating capacity to come online. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2022 to refer correctly to Hunterston B power station, not \u201cHunstanton B\u201d."

Dmitry Kiselyov, a pro-Kremlin presenter on Channel One known as \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s mouthpiece\u201d, on Monday showed a video of an underwater missile wreaking apocalypse on Ireland and the UK. Russia could \u201cplunge Britain into the depths of the sea\u201d using an unmanned underwater vehicle called Poseidon, he said. \u201cThe explosion of this thermonuclear torpedo by Britain\u2019s coastline will cause a gigantic tsunami wave up to 500 metres high. Such a barrage alone also carries extreme doses of radiation.

Irish politicians condemned the report. Neale Richmond, a legislator with the ruling Fine Gael party, called for the expulsion of Russia\u2019s ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov. Billy Kelleher, an MEP, tweeted: \u201cTime to tell Russian government that this wild language is simply unacceptable to us.\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and naval exercises off Ireland\u2019s coast have stirred debate in Ireland about the state\u2019s military neutrality and feeble defence forces.

            "content": "The Democratic Unionist party is under mounting pressure to accept the result of Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly election even if, as polls suggest, Sinn F\u00e9in emerges as the biggest party. In a televised party leaders\u2019 debate on Tuesday night, Jeffrey Donaldson faced criticism over his threat to paralyse the formation of a new executive at Stormont after the election on Thursday. Donaldson has said the prospect of Sinn F\u00e9in becoming the biggest party is \u201ca problem\u201d and that the DUP would not enter into a power-sharing government unless the Northern Ireland protocol is ditched. Other party leaders and the BBC studio audience rounded on him in the debate, saying such a DUP boycott would stymie a new government and cripple efforts to tackle the cost of living and healthcare crises. An opinion poll on Wednesday ratcheted up the pressure on Donaldson by showing the DUP tied with the Alliance party on 18%, behind Sinn F\u00e9in on 26%. Controversy over the post-Brexit protocol, which puts a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, has convulsed the DUP and alienated unionists who accuse it of weakening the region\u2019s position in the UK. Donaldson has sought to claw back support by taking a hard line on the protocol and billing the DUP as a bulwark against Sinn F\u00e9in becoming the biggest party and nominating Michelle O'Neill as first minister, which would be a symbolic breakthrough for Irish nationalism. A deputy first minister post has equal power but less prestige. Repeatedly asked in the debate whether the DUP would form an executive, Donaldson said he would turn up at Stormont but would not revive power sharing until the protocol had been dealt with. \u201cOf course I am committed to leading the DUP into executive but we must deal with the protocol,\u201d he said. O\u2019Neill said not having a government post-election would be \u201cabsolutely unfathomable\u201d and accused the DUP of holding the region to ransom. \u201cWhilst the rest of us want to put money in the people\u2019s pockets and deal with the cost of living crisis, the DUP are telling people their identity is under threat,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. Naomi Long of Alliance, Doug Beattie of the Ulster Unionists and Colum Eastwood of the Social Democratic and Labour party also assailed Donaldson for prioritising the protocol over bread-and-butter issues. Donaldson, quoting figures from a Kantar price tracker, said the cost of food in Northern Ireland was now 4% higher than in Great Britain, dairy 8% higher and chilled convenience foods 19% higher. \u201cThat\u2019s the protocol. That\u2019s why it needs to be sorted,\u201d he said. Manufacturing Northern Ireland said figures from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showed regional inflation was consistently higher in Northern Ireland between January 2020, when Brexit was agreed, up to October 2021, when it fell behind the rest of the UK. Donaldson\u2019s assertion did not convince the studio audience: when asked if they agreed, just one person raised their hand."

            "date": "2022-05-28T14:15:47Z",
            "content": "In the sparkling azure waters of Antigua, the gleaming \u00a395m superyacht Alfa Nero could be seen at anchor last week by sightseers enjoying the Caribbean coastline. But few of the tourists who spotted its sleek black hull would have appreciated that it was quite a find. Since the invasion of Ukraine, the superyacht, which is linked to the Russian billionaire Andrey Guryev, has vanished off the global tracking maps used to locate marine traffic. An investigation by the Observer this weekend reveals it is one of at least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned oligarchs which have \u201cgone dark\u201d on ocean tracking systems. The owners of these yachts will almost certainly realise they are at risk of being targeted in a global hunt for the assets of Russia\u2019s super-rich. At least 13 such vessels with a total value of nearly \u00a32bn have already been impounded since the invasion of Ukraine, from southern France to Fiji. In the latter case, the superyacht Amadea, allegedly linked to the gold billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, was seized on behalf of the US. Analysts report an increase in Russian-linked yachts which are turning off the automatic identification system (AIS) equipment used for tracking large vessels. The system can be turned off for legitimate reasons, but experts believe some vessels want to avoid detection. An analysis by the Observer of AIS data compiled by the maritime and aviation market intelligence firm VesselsValue reveals other superyachts which have \u201cgone dark\u201d for more than a month include: \u2022 The 72-metre (238ft) superyacht Clio, linked to industrialist Oleg Deripaska, which sailed from the Indian Ocean to Turkey after the invasion. Its last transmitted location was on 18 April in the Black Sea, within range of the Russian ports of Sochi and Novorossiysk. \u2022 The 70-metre Galactica Super Nova, linked to the oligarch Vagit Alekperov, the sanctioned former president of Lukoil. The last transmitted location of the vessel was on 2 March off the Croatian coast. \u2022 The 140-metre Ocean Victory, linked to the sanctioned oligarch Viktor Rashnikov, which last transmitted its location at anchor in the Maldives on 1 March. One member of crew on a superyacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the UK told the Observer last week: \u201cWe were told to turn off the AIS. We removed the screws on the power plug and pulled it out.\u201d There are about 9,300 superyachts on the seas, worth more than \u00a350bn, according to industry data. An estimated 10% of that fleet is owned by Russians. One of the first superyachts to be impounded was the 86-metre Amore Vero, linked to the oil tycoon Igor Sechin, which was seized by customs officers at a shipyard at La Ciotat, near Marseille, on 2 March. Italian authorities also impounded the 143-metre Sailing Yacht A on 12 March in Trieste. It is believed to be owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Andrey Melnichenko. He was sanctioned by the UK on 15 March. Melnichenko\u2019s other superyacht, the futuristic \u00a3240m Motor Yacht A, has disappeared from global tracking system. Its last confirmed location was on 10 March in the Maldives. The last recorded location of the Alfa Nero on AIS was in the Caribbean on 3 March, when it was anchored at Philipsburg in Sint Maarten. The yacht is operating on a skeleton crew and has put its tender, the Alfa Fish, into storage. Guryev, 62, a Russian who made his fortune with the Russian fertiliser giant PhosAgro, is reported by maritime sources to be the owner of the vessel. He was revealed to have bought London\u2019s largest private residence, the 25-bedroom mansion Witanhurst, for \u00a350m in 2008. He has regularly enjoyed sailing on the Alfa Nero. The vessel is also used by his family, including his son (also Andrey) and his son\u2019s wife, Valeria, who studied at the London College of Fashion and once reportedly stated on Instagram that she was \u201ctoo pretty for work\u201d. Like many yachts, it is owned via an opaque offshore structure, and Guryev has denied being the owner. Other yachts which have not been tracked by AIS for more than a month include the Galactica Super Nova, which has a glass-bottomed swimming pool with a waterfall. It left Tivat in Montenegro on 2 March and promptly disappeared off the system. The Clio, linked to Deripaska, sailed more than 3,000 miles after the invasion, from the Maldives, through the Suez Canal, across the Mediterranean and into the Bosphorus, gateway to the Black Sea and its Russian ports. In the Clio\u2019s case, one reason it may have gone dark could be the perilous situation in the Black Sea arising from the war. Other yachts which have not transmitted a confirmed location via AIS for at least a month include the My Sky, linked to the cigarette tycoon Igor Kesaev, which last reported its location in the Maldives on 30 March. The Maldives has no extradition treaty with the US, and at least five yachts linked to Russian owners have headed for its waters since the invasion. Other vessels, including two owned by Roman Abramovich, have headed to Turkey. Under maritime rules, AIS should always be in operation when ships are under way or at anchor. All vessels of 300 gross tonnage and upwards must be fitted with it. A cruising vessel will typically transmit its location frequently, but it can turn the system off when in port. The data is relayed by radio receivers and satellites. Sam Tucker at VesselsValue said: \u201cThere are some vessels where we would be previously getting a signal every few minutes from transponders and we are now seeing gaps of months. It\u2019s very likely that some have flicked off the switch and gone into stealth mode.\u201d None of the sanctioned oligarchs linked to the six superyachts suspected of turning off their AIS responded to a request for comment."

            "date": "2022-05-26T09:00:00Z",
            "content": "When the US federal government\u2019s pandemic health emergency declaration expires, millions of Americans are at risk of losing healthcare coverage through Medicaid with potentially devastating consequences. According to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an estimated 5.3 million to 14.2 million could lose their Medicaid coverage when the Covid-19 public health emergency ends on 15 July if it is not extended. The analysts cited the wide range due to uncertainty on how states will respond to the end of continuous enrollment and how many people will lose coverage as a result. Medicaid enrollment is estimated to reach 110.2 million people by the end of fiscal year 2022, with enrollment expected to decline significantly when continuous enrollment ends. Dylan Brown of New Jersey is disabled and relies on Medicaid for a home aide he requires around the clock to be able to get out of bed, dress and feed himself. He constantly worries about losing his Medicaid and Social Security disability insurance due to income and asset eligibility requirements and is very concerned about losing Medicaid when continuous enrollment ends. \u201cAs I\u2019ve been learning, trying to maintain my eligibility, you get a different story every time and you just have to hope one of them is right. And I\u2019ve sort of been learning, none of them are really right,\u201d said Brown. Without Medicaid, he would have to rely on his parents, who work full-time, to provide the care he needs and pay out of pocket for care to the extent his family could afford it. These options, Brown argued, aren\u2019t feasible as he is planning to start law school this fall at Rutgers University, and his parents shouldn\u2019t have to uproot their lives to help him function, which is the responsibility of Medicaid. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a cutoff date. There\u2019s no reasonable argument for not giving disabled people the care they need to survive,\u201d added Brown. \u201cRegardless of what you\u2019re feeling on whether people should have free healthcare, the disabled need it. There are no alternatives for us. It\u2019s Medicaid or bust, and when the Medicaid rules are this convoluted and hard to keep track of, it almost feels like a full time job just keeping my benefits.\u201d During the pandemic, the federal government required states to continuously enroll Medicaid recipients into the program, providing $100.4 bn in new funds to cover the costs of doing so, halting coverage gaps and loss of eligibility for those who rely on healthcare coverage through Medicaid. The current pandemic health emergency declaration is set to expire in mid-July. It is expected to be extended again, but an extension date has yet to be set by the US Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cMedicaid provided invaluable coverage to individuals during the pandemic. And there\u2019s evidence that it helped insulate people from loss of coverage that is associated with job losses, especially in the early stages of the pandemic,\u201d said Dr Eric T Roberts, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cNow, we face this unwinding of those provisions and a lot of confusion to beneficiaries and the public about how individuals will navigate that process and the schedule on which they will be required to do so. I think the great concern is that people lose their coverage without really knowing it, until they need it.\u201d Roberts said policymakers need to address these problems, as Medicaid determination and redetermination is complex already. Those complexities are magnified when states have to start conducting those determinations on such a large scale without the proper administrative and navigational assistance and resources in place. \u201cThere is already a significant amount of administrative complexity to navigate Medicaid from the beneficiaries\u2019 perspective and that can uniquely disadvantage people who have greater difficulty just navigating the healthcare system in general, the most vulnerable,\u201d added Roberts. Federal government subsidies to make healthcare plans more affordable on the insurance marketplace are expected to end on 31 December 2022, making health insurance plans more expensive, possibbly resulting in more Americans losing health insurance coverage because they can\u2019t afford it. Zachary Fusfeld of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a PhD candidate in epidemiology at Drexel University, is anticipating the loss of his Medicaid coverage when continuous enrollment ends, because his university stipend increase will put him over the income limit. A type one diabetic who suffers from other illnesses, Fusfeld said he will have to rely on his student healthcare and pay out of pocket for copays on medications, medical supplies, and doctor visits when his Medicaid coverage ends later this year, the costs of which are not affordable and not covered by his pay increase. He recently required surgery on his ankle and is worried about affording the physical therapy he requires, though he noted there are many people who are facing the loss of Medicaid and don\u2019t have any sort of supplemental insurance coverage as he does. \u201cI\u2019m really worried that I\u2019m just not going to be able to properly manage my health and life in a way that I can stay as healthy as I need to be,\u201d said Fusfeld. Chris Bergh of St Louis, Missouri, relies on Social Security disability insurance for income and Medicaid for medical coverage. He\u2019s concerned about the risk of losing medical coverage through Medicaid when the pandemic emergency is lifted. \u201cI\u2019m at risk of losing coverage because I lost track of a piece of mail and the instructions in the letter were unclear about how I was supposed to proceed,\u201d said Bergh. He has repeatedly attempted to call Medicaid\u2019s service hotline, but hasn\u2019t been able to get through to speak to an actual person. Without Medicaid, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see his doctors, afford his prescription medicine, or get dental care. \u201cI think they make this system harder than it has to be, in the hopes of weeding people out, just like other public assistance programs,\u201d added Bergh. \u201cI\u2019m on social security so I have a fixed income and don\u2019t make enough to cover the out of pocket cost of these things and still be able to eat and do other things.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-07T20:00:09Z",
            "content": "When Jill Robards\u2019s 79-year-old husband had a stroke, the gaps in the health system were stark, she says. Flagged for discharge from Dubbo hospital without her knowledge, her husband was sent in a taxi to their local hospital which had no doctor at the time. He was sent home three days later by a doctor who saw him via Telehealth, back into 80-year-old Jill\u2019s care, without having received physiotherapy. \u201cIt seemed like there was a breakdown in how things should\u2019ve worked,\u201d she says, sitting in the kitchen of her central west New South Wales cattle farm. Robards is at pains to state she is not upset with the hospital or the staff, but the system. \u201cThe doctors and nurses are doing their best, but they\u2019ve got to get rid of the patients to make room. And that\u2019s where the system falls down,\u201d she says. Healthcare staff across the NSW central and far west regions say the strain of under-resourcing is causing patients to be palmed from hospital to hospital, jeopardising the communities\u2019 health. \u201cWe\u2019re getting people just bouncing back,\u201d says Tina Robinson, who was a nurse at Warren multi-purpose health service at the time of speaking to Guardian Australia. \u201c[Health problems] that should be dealt with properly aren\u2019t getting done the way they should,\u201d she says. A scathing report handed to the NSW government on Thursday, after the state inquiry into healthcare in regional, rural and remote regions, found the health system is \u201cfailing\u201d rural communities, contributing to poorer health outcomes and \u201cinferior access to hospital services\u201d compared to people living in metro areas. From 2020 to 2021, the western NSW local health district had the highest number of emergency department presentations in the state. Potentially avoidable deaths, which measures deaths among the community rather than in the hospital system, were also 43% higher than the rest of the state from 2011-2016, according to the latest data. Warnings ignored Dr Aniello Iannuzzi, a doctor at Coonabarabran hospital, said the lack of healthcare workers and under-resourcing of rural health services in the region is increasing transfers of patients to Dubbo hospital. \u201cWe\u2019re sending more and more patients to Dubbo because our staffing and resources are so bad that we don\u2019t feel it\u2019s safe to keep them in our hospital,\u201d he says. Sacha, a nurse at a hospital in the region who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Dubbo hospital \u2013 which helps service communities as far as five hours away \u2013 hasn\u2019t been resourced to deal with this influx, discharging patients \u201cnot because it\u2019s the best time for them to leave, but because they have significant pressures on their beds\u201d. \u201cAnd then that reverberates out on to the multi-purpose health services, and other procedural hospitals.\u201d Robinson and Sacha say they frequently warn Dubbo hospital when they don\u2019t have the staff or resources to adequately care for a patient being discharged to their health facilities, but this is often ignored. This pressure of under-resourcing in rural areas has reverberated to Orange medical health service, another regional hospital in the area. It wrote in its submission to the inquiry that the demand on its hospital \u2013 as a result of smaller hospitals not retaining suitably qualified GPs \u2013 was not accurately predicted or modelled. A spokesperson for the western NSW local health district said it was developing a plan to consider how three communities in the central west \u2013 Wellington, Dubbo, and Narromine \u2013 can have their health needs met by future funding, taking into account population demand. They said since 2016, the NSW and federal governments had invested more than $305m in the redevelopment of Dubbo hospital, increasing its capacity to care for patients. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The number of transfers to Dubbo hospital has remained steady across recent years, and the facility safely managed increased pressure from the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the spokesperson. \u201cIn some rural areas, it is difficult to sustain 24/7 coverage of the local hospital as there are not enough GPs or doctors willing to undertake work as a visiting medical officers to provide a safe roster with no gaps,\u201d the spokesperson said. They added the federal government is responsible for ensuring patients have access to primary care and GPs. \u201cWhen GP visiting medical officers are unavailable, an alternative is for a locum doctor to provide services for the hospital. Locums and visiting medical officers can be difficult to source, even with generous remuneration arrangements in place,\u201d they said. \u2018Pressure on the nurses\u2019 Healthcare workers say the reliance on Telehealth and nurses as the mainstay of care in some rural health services in the region is adding to the stress on the system. \u201cIt\u2019s putting a lot of pressure on the nurses,\u201d says Robinson, who had just finished an 18-hour shift at the time of speaking to Guardian Australia. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a doctor on call and we get a triage one \u2026 we\u2019re doing everything under a camera. So we\u2019re doing like the whole resuscitation without a doctor, we\u2019re even shocking people,\u201d she says. If the patient needs to see a doctor face-to-face, Robinson says they\u2019re sent to Dubbo hospital. Mark Burdack, CEO of the Rural and Remote Medical Service \u2013 a charity providing medical services in the central and far west \u2013 is critical of the way Telehealth is being used \u201cto replace local GPs in rural hospitals\u201d rather than as a tool to support existing doctors with low acuity healthcare. A spokesperson for the western NSW local health district said the use of Telehealth has increased during the Covid pandemic, \u201cHowever, virtual care is not a replacement for local doctors.\u201d They added that virtual care plays an important role in health facilities to support local clinicians care for patients around the clock as close to home as possible, reducing the need for patients and carers to travel. Since the start of this year, Robinson says four nurses, and now herself, have left due to exhaustion and disenfranchisement with how the system is run. As the only nurse in child and family health at Warren multi-purpose service at the time of speaking to Guardian Australia, she worries what this will mean for the health of mothers and their children in her community.

            "title": "Are Canadians being driven to assisted suicide by poverty or healthcare crisis?",
            "date": "2022-05-11T09:30:30Z",
            "content": "After pleading unsuccessfully for affordable housing to help ease her chronic health condition, a Canadian woman ended her life in February under the country\u2019s assisted-suicide laws. Another woman, suffering from the same condition and also living on disability payments, has nearly reached final approval to end her life. The two high-profile cases have prompted disbelief and outrage, and shone a light on Canada\u2019s right-to-die laws, which critics argue are being misused to punish the poor and infirm. In late April, the Spectator ran a story with the provocative headline: Why is Canada euthanising the poor? But medical and legal experts caution that oversimplified media coverage of the cases fail to capture the realities of the system \u2013 and warn that sensationalist coverage of a handful of \u201cextreme\u201d cases ignores a larger crisis in the country\u2019s healthcare systems. In February, a 51-year-old Ontario woman known as Sophia was granted physician-assisted death after her chronic condition became intolerable and her meagre disability stipend left her little to survive on, according to CTV News. \u201cThe government sees me as expendable trash, a complainer, useless and a pain in the ass,\u201d she said in a video obtained by the network. For two years, she and friends had pleaded without success for better living conditions, she said. Now a second case has emerged with several parallels: another woman, known as Denise, has also applied to end her life after being unable to find suitable housing and struggling to survive on disability payments. Both were diagnosed with multiple chemical sensitivity (MCR), a condition in which common chemicals, such as those in cigarette smoke and laundry detergents, can trigger nausea, blinding headaches and in extreme cases, anaphylactic shock. Both had also argued that specialized housing \u2013 where air flow is more controlled \u2013 would ease their debilitating symptoms. Unable to work, they each received $1,169 per month \u2013 placing them well below the poverty line in Canada\u2019s most populous and expensive province. For activists, the cases have come to represent Canada\u2019s failure to care for its most vulnerable citizens \u2013 and raised questions about how assisted-suicide laws are applied. But experts caution the cases are also being used by groups opposed to medical assistance in death (Maid) in an attempt to scale back legislation \u2013 rather than looking at how governments can improve people living with disabilities. \u201cInadequate housing is not one of the eligibility criteria for medical assistance in dying. While somebody\u2019s living circumstances may contribute to their suffering, it does not constitute the grievous and irremediable medical condition, which must exist,\u201d said Chantal Perrot, a physician and Maid provider. Perrot said that while housing could have helped, it was only a part of a broader struggle against the chronic condition. \u201cThe only treatment really for that is avoidance of all triggers. That\u2019s pretty much impossible to do in ordinary life. So better housing can create a temporary bubble for a person \u2013 but there\u2019s no cure for this,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do this work because we believe in people\u2019s right to an assisted death. It\u2019s not always easy to do. But we know that patients need it and value it. We live with the challenge of the work, in part because it is important to alleviate that suffering.\u201d When Canada introduced legislation on assisted suicide in 2016, advocacy groups raised fears that vulnerable populations could be targeted, or that physicians would be forced to override the oaths they\u2019d taken to protect patents. \u201cMany of the slippery-slope arguments that were made initially never happened,\u201d said Hillary Ferguson, a bioethicist at Dalhousie University. \u201cThere were fears that the floodgates would open and all these people would be accessing Maid or even forced upon them. But that\u2019s not been the case.\u201d Last year, lawmakers revised the criteria for MAID after the country\u2019s supreme court ruled that a previous version of the law, which excluded people with disabilities, was unconstitutional. The issue is once again before a special joint parliamentary committee tasked with deciding whether to expand access to consenting children and those with mental illness. Jocelyn Downie, a professor of law at Dalhousie and expert in end-of-life policy, said there are extensive guardrails in the system to protect Canadians. \u201cYou have to meet rigorous eligibility criteria. And being poor and not having a home, or a home that is suitable for you, does not make you eligible,\u201d said Downie. Cases that involve a chronic condition are often time-consuming because clinicians are working to exhaust all other options to ease the suffering of their patients, she said. Downie said that the cases do highlight societal failures \u2013 but not with the country\u2019s assisted dying laws. \u201cListen to what people living with disabilities have been asking for years,\u201d she said, pointing to investments in accessible housing and transportation. Instead of fighting over the law, which lawmakers are unlikely to repeal given a string of supreme court cases upholding the right to physician assisted death, Downie said a greater emphasis should be on disability supports and services and mental health supports. \u201cThe reality is, it\u2019s a small number of people who qualify for Maid. But investments in mental health and disability resources would go so far to help so many more people live their lives.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-17T12:35:33Z",
            "content": "North Korea stands on the brink of a Covid-19 catastrophe unless swift action is taken to provide vaccines and drug treatments, experts have said, as the number of people reported to have fallen ill rose to almost 1.5 million. The isolated country reported another big rise in new cases of what it continues to refer to as \u201cfever\u201d on Tuesday, days after it admitted it had identified Covid-19 infections for the first time since the start of the global pandemic. It recorded 269,510 additional cases and six more deaths, bringing the total number killed to 56 since late last month. About 1.48 million people have become ill with the virus since the first case was reported last Thursday and at least 663,910 people were in quarantine, according to official figures. The outbreak is almost certainly greater than the official tally, given a lack of tests and resources to monitor and treat the sick. A significant Covid-19 outbreak could unleash a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, where the economy has been battered by the pandemic-enforced closure of its border with China \u2013 its main trading partner \u2013 natural disasters, and years of international sanctions imposed in response to ballistic missile tests. The regime is not thought to have vaccinated any of its population and does not have access to antiviral drugs that have been used to treat Covid-19 in other countries. Its hospitals have few intensive-care resources to treat severe cases, and widespread malnourishment has made the population of 26 million more susceptible to serious illness. \u201cIt looks really bad,\u201d said Owen Miller, a lecturer in Korean studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University. \u201cThey are facing the rampant spread of Omicron without protection from vaccines, without much \u2013 if any \u2013 immunity in the population and without access to most of the drugs that have been used to treat Covid elsewhere.\u201d Offers of outside help have so far been met with silence. Instead, there is concern that the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, may be willing to accept a large but \u201cmanageable\u201d number of cases and deaths to avoid opening his country up to international scrutiny. Since it reported its first cases last week, North Korea\u2019s propaganda machine has portrayed the virus as an enemy that can be defeated through lockdowns, quarantine and greater vigilance. The state-run KCNA news agency has reported the delivery of unspecified drugs \u2013 \u201cthe elixir of life\u201d \u2013 to pharmacies by army medical units, and public health campaigns calling for mask-wearing and social distancing. But testing levels are far below what is needed to form an accurate picture of the outbreak and to quickly identify and isolate patients. Some observers speculated that authorities were deliberately underreporting cases to ease the pressure on Kim. North Korea has carried out just 64,200 tests since the start of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization, compared with 172 million in the neighbouring South. \u201cWe were talking about a 0.1% fatality rate for Omicron in South Korea, but that\u2019s going to be significantly higher in North Korea, possibly even reaching 1%, although it\u2019s difficult to make accurate predictions at this point,\u201d said Jung Jae-hun, a professor of preventive medicine at Gachon University. Kim, who says the outbreak is causing \u201cgreat turmoil\u201d, finds himself having to balance public health measures with efforts to revive the crumbling economy. A ruling party member in North Hamgyong province said people were still going to work and markets remained open, reported the Japan-based Asia Press. \u201cThere are no bans on going outside. However, we\u2019ve been ordered to double mask,\u201d the unidentified official told the website, which receives information from citizen journalists equipped with contraband Chinese mobile phones. \u201cPeople are going to factories and to their places of work as normal. The authorities don\u2019t want work to be disrupted. People get fever checks when they go to and from work.\u201d The official said people were more concerned about being locked down and prevented from working than catching Covid-19. \u201cPeople are worried about how to survive.\u201d Some initially interpreted North Korea\u2019s admission that it was battling the virus \u2013 after two years of denying it had found a single case \u2013 as a plea for help. But it has already refused millions of vaccine doses via the UN-backed Covax scheme, while South Korea says it has yet to receive a response to its offer this week of vaccines, drugs and medical staff. \u201cI\u2019m sure the North Koreans will still be very wary of accepting major international aid and going back to the situation of the 1990s, when there were multiple different aid agencies operating in the country and this was felt by the leadership to be humiliating and potentially destabilising,\u201d Miller said, adding that the regime was more likely to turn to China for medical aid. The Omicron variant has caused significantly fewer deaths and serious cases than previous strains in countries with high vaccination rates, proper medical services and previous exposure to Covid-19. But that pattern is unlikely to be repeated in North Korea, said Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Korea University College of Medicine in Seoul. \u201cNorth Korea has many vulnerable people who don\u2019t have strong immune systems,\u201d he said. \u201cIts official inoculation rate is zero and it has no Covid-19 treatment pills.\u201d Without urgent international help, Kim added, \u201cNorth Korea may end up with the pandemic\u2019s worst death and infection rates in the world for its population size.\u201d Wires in Seoul contributed reporting. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 May 2022. The testing figures for North Korea and South Korea relate to the total number of tests carried out since the start of the pandemic, not the number of people tested as an earlier version said."

            "content": "As the virus accelerates its evolution, the humans capitulate. For two and a half years, Covid-19 has been outrunning our response, getting more and more transmissible, reaching a level of infectiousness that few pathogens have ever attained. Instead of taking a stance of getting ahead of the virus, and outsmarting it, people have succumbed. In recent months, we experienced a striking jump in transmissibility when the Omicron (BA.1) variant became dominant, with at least a threefold increase in reproductive number beyond Delta. Despite the hope that this might be reaching the upper limit of the virus\u2019s spreadability, we quickly transitioned to a BA.2 wave, with at least another jump of about 30% transmissibility, and now we are heading, in the United States, to a dominant subvariant known as BA.2.12.1, which is another 25% more transmissible than BA.2 and already accounting for close to 50% of new cases. This surely constitutes a meaningful acceleration of the virus\u2019s evolution. There have been thousands of variants over the course of the pandemic, but only five major variants, affecting large populations of people, received Greek letter designations (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron). Each of these previous variants had numerous sub-lineages, or mutations that might be considered relatives of the main variant but had no functional consequence \u2013 they did not increase transmissibility or pathogenicity. But with Omicron, we have already seen multiple subvariants with heightened infectiousness \u2013 not just BA.2, BA.2.12.1, but also BA.4 and BA.5, which are leading to a new wave in South Africa. As we watch the virus strikingly improve its ability to find new or repeat hosts, you would think it would be considered an urgent call for action. But instead, there has been a public perception that the pandemic is over, while at the same time, public health agencies are adopting the policy that we must \u201clive with Covid\u201d. No, we don\u2019t have to live with Covid, because the Covid we are seeing now is deeply concerning. While there has not been a surge in hospitalizations, they are clearly on the increase, with more than a 20% rise in the United States over the past two weeks. The proportion of people getting hospitalized and dying among the vaccinated, as compared with the unvaccinated, has substantially increased. As have the deaths: during the Delta wave in the United States, vaccinated individuals accounted for 23% of the deaths, whereas this nearly doubled to 42% during the Omicron wave. Many of these hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated people can be attributed to lack of a booster shot or the substantially waned effectiveness that sets in by four months after a booster. Moreover, a major misconception is that the vaccines are holding steady to protect against severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths. They are not. When a booster was given during the Delta wave, it fully restored protection against these outcomes, to the level of 95% effectiveness. But for Omicron, with a booster (or second booster), the protection was approximately 80%. While still high, it represents a major, fourfold (lack of effectiveness of 55% v 20%) dropdown. Accordingly, the confidence that our vaccines, directed to the original strain from 2019, are highly protective from severe illness is exaggerated. No less are the clear signs that the durability of such protection is reduced. All of this is tied to the marked evolution of the virus, and we yet lack any data on vaccine effectiveness versus the BA.2.12.1 variant, soon to be dominant here. With the prospect of more noxious variants ahead, it is unfathomable that we now surrender. No more funding from the government. The only new vaccine in the hopper is an Omicron booster, but since that is based on the BA.1 variant, it may not provide much protection against what we are seeing now (BA.2.12.1 has reduced cross-immunity) or where the virus will be come this summer, when that vaccine may become available. We even face a shortage of vaccines in the months ahead. Rather than giving up, it is time to double down on innovations that have a high likelihood of anticipating the further evolution of the virus and facilitating the end of the pandemic. First on the list is the development of nasal vaccines that are variant-proof. A nasal spray that induces mucosal immunity would help to block transmission, for which we have minimal defense now from the hyper-transmissible Omicron family of variants. Three such nasal vaccines are in late-stage clinical trials, but unlike the shots, there has not been any Operation Warp Speed or governmental support to expedite their execution or success. Next, with so many candidate drugs that have promise, is to speed these clinical trials. Recall that Paxlovid is the most rapid small molecule (pill) program in history \u2013 less than two years from design of the molecule to the completion of definitive randomized trials showing high efficacy and its commercialization. Why hasn\u2019t such aggressive pursuit been applied to so many other antivirals, which include pills, inhaled nanobodies and ACE-2 decoys? The concept of a pan-\u03b2-coronavirus or pan-sarbecovirus vaccine is alluring and has been pursued by academic labs throughout the world over the past two years. Tens of broad neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been discovered, which have high likelihood of protecting against any future variant. But there is nearly a void of developing and testing a vaccine based on these bnAbs. Such vaccines are clearly in our reach, but the lack of investment in a high priority and velocity initiative is holding us back. A combination of nasal or oral vaccines, more and better drugs, and a variant-proof coronavirus vaccine would likely catalyze a definitive pandemic exit. The public perception that our vaccines are \u201cleaky\u201d is true, but it\u2019s off-base to assign the fault to the vaccines, which have saved millions of lives around the world. It the virus\u2019s accelerated evolution \u2013 that it\u2019s sneaky \u2013 and has become more formidable over time that is at the root of our problem now. We can outsmart and finally get ahead of the virus if we don\u2019t submit to fatigue instead of rugged perseverance, and to foolishness rather than intelligence.

            "title": "A million have died of Covid-19 in America. How did this happen? | Ross Barkan",
            "date": "2022-05-18T10:10:47Z",
            "content": "One million have died from Covid-19 in the United States, a catastrophic milestone that was reached despite the wonders of modern science and the wealth that courses through this country. More than two years into the pandemic, it is hard to shock people any longer. One hundred thousand deaths, it seemed, attracted far more attention. How did we get it here? How much of this mass death was preventable? These are questions that we will be sorting out for many years to come. There are no simple answers. In order to have a fighting chance in the next pandemic, though, it\u2019s incumbent to consider just what went horrifically wrong. First, it must be noted that America, among advanced nations, was not alone in enduring terrible loss from Covid. Both the United Kingdom and Italy have comparable death rates. Multiple waves have overwhelmed other European nations with superior healthcare apparatuses. Taming a pandemic is incredibly difficult and few countries emerged unscathed. Given America\u2019s vast size and decentralized governance structure\u2014federalism guarantees 50 states can often act like 50 nations\u2014a zero-Covid approach would have been unfeasible. Some liberals looked longingly to New Zealand, an island nation smaller than New York City, for guidance, though even the Kiwis eventually gave up on such radical lockdowns. China is currently trying to stamp out Covid by imprisoning millions of their own citizens in their homes and restricting travel abroad. The Covid death rate remains low, but the social repercussions of such severe policies will be felt for the rest of the decade, as more affluent Chinese citizens consider fleeing a country that has no regard left for their civil liberties. Still, there are clear failures unique to the United States. The aforementioned federalism made national public health messaging and decision-making exceedingly difficult. Donald Trump, deeply unhinged and ignorant, was the worst president possible to sit atop such bureaucracy. With little federal guidance, individual governors, mayors, and county executives were on their own to set policy, flailing about against a new virus few truly understood. Some, like Jay Inslee in Washington and London Breed in San Francisco, rose to the occasion, initiating well-timed early lockdowns and placing rational public health officials at the forefront of their pandemic responses. Others, like Andrew Cuomo in New York, failed miserably, dithering until it was too late. From the beginning of the pandemic, public health messaging was deeply muddled, with various epidemiologists and self-appointed experts, along with government officials, taking to the internet to offer conflicting advice. In February 2020, as Covid was beginning to spread in the United States, mainstream media outlets and a sizable number of officials were telling Americans to actively avoid wearing masks. The rationale \u2013 save high-quality masks for healthcare workers \u2013 did not justify telling ordinary people to ignore their common-sense and the long history of masking during the flu pandemic of 1918. The early months of the pandemic produced other nonsensical policies from experts who should have known better. Quickly, scientists learned Covid was airborne, yet parks and other outdoor spaces remained shuttered for months. While the virus was ravaging New York, playgrounds in the Midwest had red tape thrown around them. Few states, liberal or conservative, emphasized the need for proper ventilation in public and private buildings. More outdoor events, coupled with mask-wearing, could have ushered a faster return to normalcy as Americans were educated about the importance of proper airflow. A hundred years ago, scientists and doctors knew it was better to treat flu-ravaged patients outside. Some municipalities even pursued outdoor schooling. For reasons unclear, these lessons were lost to time. The vaccine era brought more failure. Public health experts either didn\u2019t understand Covid would produce variants or misled Americans on the nature of the Moderna, Pfizer, and J&amp;J vaccines. Those that first took vaccines were led to believe that Covid would simply stop spreading once they were vaccinated and all pandemic-era precautions could be ended. Dr Anthony Fauci and others told the vaccinated they could cluster unmasked without any fear that Covid would infect them anew. What vaccines did do remarkably well was prevent people from going to the hospital. But they were never pitched this way \u2013 rather, many believed they were magic potions that would make Covid disappear \u2013 and the surge of breakthrough infections in the summer and fall of 2021 further sowed distrust. Fauci, who had once called Covid a pandemic of the \u201cunvaccinated,\u201d couldn\u2019t plausibly say this any longer when the Omicron variant was tearing through highly vaccinated locales like New York. Right-wing misinformation doomed older Americans in Republican-leaning counties. Though Trump himself was a booster of the vaccines because they were developed under his administration, it was Joe Biden administering them, and Republican demagogues turned on the products of Operation Warp Speed. Conspiracy theories, fueled by the right, undercut trust in the vaccines. Conservatives rushed to unproven treatments. The deadly Delta wave in 2021 came for the Republican-dominated states that wrongly believed Covid was simply a problem for the big liberal cities. Rural counties suffered mightily. Other lessons from the pandemic do not fit neatly into the narratives of the left or the right. Few Democrats want to remember it was Kamala Harris, during a vice presidential debate in 2020, who said she\u2019d hesitate to take a vaccine if Trump were president. Months later, she would be taking doses from the very vaccines she was foolishly attacking for political points. Right-wingers can\u2019t acknowledge that fewer Americans would have probably died if Trump had never been president. It\u2019s possible, too, that vaccine uptake in America would have been more widespread if greater options were offered and effective treatments were prioritized. Both Moderna and Pfizer rely on mRNA technology not traditionally used in vaccines; their novelty bred conspiracy-minded thinking, especially on the right. With J&amp;J\u2019s vaccine effectively off the market\u2014the FDA strictly limited it because of a risk of a rare clotting condition\u2014only mRNA vaccines are widely available until Novavax\u2019s vaccine, which uses conventional protein technology, is greenlit later in the summer. In retrospect, it would have been beneficial to have a proven pharmaceutical giant like Pfizer producing a conventional vaccine to entice a broader range of Americans. With new variants and future pandemics inevitable, Congress must authorize far more in federal funding for proper preparedness. Research must never cease\u2014particularly into medical treatments for Covid and other pandemic strains\u2014and local health departments should be properly supported. Hospital capacity must be expanded wherever possible, especially in the wake of so many ICU facilities, in small towns and big cities alike, rapidly filling up during various waves. One million people should never have to die from another pandemic. Not in America, a country built to do so much better. Ross Barkan is a journalist based in New York City.

            "title": "Hepatitis cases rising among children globally but cause remains a mystery",
            "date": "2022-05-23T06:00:10Z",
            "content": "A dangerous and mysterious illness continues to spread among children, and so do questions over what\u2019s causing it, including possible links to Covid-19. But it\u2019s too soon to tell what is behind the cases, experts say. More than 600 cases of hepatitis with no known cause have been identified around the globe since October 2021, and many of the cases are in previously healthy children now stricken with severe illness. The UK has the highest number of identified cases, with 197, while the US has 180 cases, most of which have been severe enough to require hospitalization. Although more cases are being recognized, the cause is still a medical mystery. \u201cThe playing field is changing on an hour-to-hour basis,\u201d said Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor in medical microbiology and infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba and co-author of a new commentary on the status of these cases. \u201cInch by inch, we\u2019re starting to figure out what this problem is,\u201d Kindrachuk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we have all those pieces of the puzzle yet to say, \u2018OK, this is what we think is going on.\u2019\u201d While mild liver inflammation isn\u2019t uncommon among children, severe inflammation like this is. Normally the UK has eight to 10 liver transplants each year, but is has already passed those numbers, with 11 in only three months. Globally, 26 patients \u2013 15 in the US \u2013 have required liver transplants. Nearly half of the deaths \u2013 five out of 11 so far \u2013 have occurred in the US, although the nation accounts for only one-third of identified cases. The first cases in the US were reported in Alabama, but after the CDC issued a nationwide alert, cases were found in 36 states and territories. Blood tests reveal the severe liver inflammation isn\u2019t caused by the usual culprits, including the hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E. Several possible causes are being investigated. This could be a new virus that hasn\u2019t yet been unidentified. Or it could be an existing virus, or existing viruses grouped together, causing new symptoms. One of the top viruses under consideration is adenovirus, a common family of viruses detected in the bloodstreams of many patients \u2013 especially the variant 41, which usually presents as a stomach bug. But the liver tissues that have been examined so far don\u2019t show signs of adenovirus, and it\u2019s unusual for this virus to cause hepatitis. It\u2019s not unheard-of to discover rare effects from common viruses. In 2012, another common virus, an enterovirus, was found to cause a very rare condition known as acute flaccid myelitis. These very rare conditions emerge when there is a high rate of cases, which could be the case with adenovirus \u2013 UK health officials, who track the virus, found a five-year high of cases in young children this winter. Another cause could be long-term effects from Sars-CoV-2. In some cases, the children with hepatitis tested positive for Covid, but in others, there was no documented history of a Covid infection. Covid infections have been widespread in children, and many of the patients are too young to be vaccinated against Covid. The CDC estimates that 75% of American children have had the virus. There are already links between Covid and liver problems. Unusual liver function, including the possibility for hepatitis after Covid infection, has been documented in children and adults throughout the pandemic. Italian researchers raised the alarm about a possible Covid link to hepatitis in May 2021, after seeing a 10-year-old boy with liver problems during a Covid infection. Brazilian researchers also documented Covid-induced hepatitis in an immune-compromised child in September 2021. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a dangerous inflammatory syndrome associated with Covid, may also injure the liver, research shows. Acute hepatitis is a leading sign of MIS-C, researchers found in August 2020. One three-year-old girl was previously healthy, and she had a mild bout of Covid. But three weeks later, she developed hepatitis and acute liver failure, according to a new study published this month. New research is building on this possible link with the recent hepatitis cases. Indian researchers posted a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed or published yet, on 9 May highlighting a rise in pediatric hepatitis cases after asymptomatic Covid cases. Out of 475 children who tested positive, 37 had symptoms of hepatitis \u2013 and they recovered well with treatment. Another large new preprint study compared the liver function of thousands of children who tested positive for Covid with kids who had other respiratory illnesses. \u201cChildren with Covid have a significantly higher risk\u201d of abnormal liver function, said Rong Xu, professor of biomedical informatics at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and co-author of the preprint study. And, worryingly, these issues persisted for at least six months, she said. But that doesn\u2019t mean the hepatitis being seen now is linked to Covid. \u201cFor this study, we just found the association\u201d of Covid and liver issues, she said. The next step would be seeing whether the children who have abnormal liver function after Covid subsequently experience other negative outcomes. It could be that weakened immune systems, battered by Covid or other viruses, make the children more susceptible to hepatitis. Another researcher has proposed that Covid could create outsized immune reactions to other pathogens long after the initial infection. This study, like others, is one link in the chain, experts said, but not a smoking gun. \u201cWe\u2019re always taking pieces of the puzzle and slowly building them together,\u201d Kindrachuk said. \u201cAll these things have to be put on to the list of potential causal agents, and now we\u2019ve got to try to do the difficult part, which is to say, \u2018What is it?\u2019\u201d Whether the cause is traced to an adenovirus, the coronavirus, some combination of the two, or another culprit entirely, the research emerging points to possible long-term effects of viruses, especially as they spread widely and reveal rare side-effects. Covid, for instance, has been shown to affect hearts, brains, lungs, livers and kidneys long after the initial infection ceases \u2013 and even in mild cases. \u201cI really worry about the long-term effects of Covid-19 on multiple organ systems of children,\u201d Xu said. The good news is that we know how to prevent cases of this and many other viruses, by employing masks, improving ventilation, washing hands, providing sick leave, vaccinating everyone who is eligible, and more, Kindrachuk said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have all the answers for what\u2019s going on right now. But what we do have, certainly, is information on mitigation measures and protective measures that can reduce the incidence of infection.\u201d"

            "content": "As regular life resumes in fits and starts, Royal Mail is feeling the squeeze. This is partly because everybody\u2019s squeezed, but partly because deliveries are down , and from this it would seem that the new normal is steadily returning to the old normal. If you have observed the younger generation over the past two years, you\u2019d think times had changed for ever. Teenagers and twentysomethings see a five-day delivery estimate as a breach of their human rights. I\u2019ve seen a look of mild bafflement cross my kids\u2019 faces when they order something on Amazon and it doesn\u2019t arrive immediately, as if they were dealing not with a complex delivery chain but a magic lamp. For the rest of us, those pandemic years during which there was an actual cardboard shortage because we were sending and receiving so many parcels were more mixed. Did our online shopping habits bring us closer to our neighbours? Maybe for a while, as we took in each other\u2019s parcels and made like characters in a Richard Scarry book, but there was always the question: \u201cWhen will this go too far? When will next-door have had an absolute bar of my repeat dishwasher tablet order? When will the smiling fade?\u201d There was something unsettling about the galloping consumption, typified not by Royal Mail, but by Amazon. Midway through the pandemic, I ordered a fishing net from there which came in a box the size of a coffin. It begged the question, if you ordered a coffin, what size box would that come in? Would it be as big as your house? Resituating my shopping back to the actual shops was quite soothing, as it protected me from the realities of its waste and needlessness, which was a bit of a, ahem, paradox. The whole move to online shopping reminded me of the move from cash to credit cards. It was a simple enough switch, but would it change our attitudes in a more profound way? Would we lose our bearings and just spend indiscriminately? Or would the joy seep out of the process, so that we stopped buying stuff and, sooner or later, stopped wanting it? Neither, it turned out; we just adapted to a new reality, just as we adapted to the reality of carrying the sum of human knowledge in a phone. Back when we assumed that deliveries were the new normal, the mirroring prediction was that high streets would decline. It had implications for capital, playing out now in the confected new culture war of \u201cback to the office or not?\u201d, which is a proxy for \u201cprotect commercial landlords or not?\u201d But it also raised questions about what on earth would happen to our high streets if we could not shop in them. Would defunct department stores become a hub for civic activism or, more likely, table football? Or would they just inevitably wither into dereliction until someone turned them into flats? Early signs from where I live are that everything that previously went bust is now a bar. The real mistake in all post-Covid predictions was to assume that because the changes were vast and sudden in 2020, then the change back would be similarly abrupt. Because we all moved instantly to shopping online, we would stay like that for ever, or move back en masse. All that acclimatisation to pandemic life, away from large groups of people and towards smaller ones, away from the office, towards the home office with the set-dressed Zoom background, away from the conference and the meeting towards the screen, it would all either be maintained as a seismic change, or it would reverse dramatically. That was the only way to give meaning to what was happening; that at least it might teach us something about how we\u2019d prefer to live. In fact, the thing we like the least is sudden, major change. My young \u2019uns are still averaging about three parcels a week I\u2019d say. All nonsense, like a single gel pen or a tiny jewellery hook. We inch back to normality via a series of minute decisions about how much cardboard we\u2019d ideally like to dispose of, and how many neighbours we might bother to retrieve our parcels each week. If \u2013 for many of us \u2013 the answer is none, a painful home truth for Royal Mail will at least unfurl slowly. Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist"

            "title": "Environmental toxins are worsening obesity pandemic, say scientists",
            "date": "2022-05-19T15:51:33Z",
            "content": "Chemical pollution in the environment is supersizing the global obesity epidemic, according to a major scientific review. The idea that the toxins called \u201cobesogens\u201d can affect how the body controls weight is not yet part of mainstream medicine. But the dozens of scientists behind the review argue that the evidence is now so strong that it should be. \u201cThis is critical because the current clinical management of obese patients is woefully inadequate,\u201d they said. The most disturbing aspect of the evidence is that some chemical impacts that increase weight can be passed down through generations by changing how genes work. Pollutants cited by the researchers as increasing obesity include bisphenol A (BPA), which is widely added to plastics, as well as some pesticides, flame retardants and air pollution. Global obesity has tripled since 1975, with more people now obese or overweight than underweight, and is increasing in every country studied. Almost 2 billion adults are now too heavy and 40 million children under five are obese or overweight. \u201cThe focus of the clinical people is on calories \u2013 if you eat more calories, you\u2019re going to be more fat,\u201d says Dr Jerrold Heindel, lead author of one of the three review papers, and formerly at the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. \u201cSo they wait untill you get obese, then they\u2019ll look at giving you diets, drugs, or surgery. \u201cIf that really worked, we should see a decline in the rates of obesity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t \u2013 obesity continues to rise, especially in children. The real question is, why do people eat more? The obesogenic paradigm focuses on that and provides data that indicate that these chemicals are what can do that.\u201d Furthermore, the scientists say, the approach offers the potential to prevent obesity by avoiding exposure to pollutants, especially in pregnant women and babies: \u201cPrevention saves lives, while costing far less than any [treatment].\u201d Strong evidence The evidence for obesogens is set out by more than 40 scientists in three review papers, published in the peer-reviewed journal Biochemical Pharmacology and citing 1,400 studies. They say these chemicals are everywhere: in water and dust, food packaging, personal hygiene products and household cleaners, furniture and electronics. The review identifies about 50 chemicals as having good evidence of obesogenic effects, from experiments on human cells and animals, and epidemiological studies of people. These include BPA and phthalates, also a plastic additive. A 2020 analysis of 15 studies found a significant link between BPA levels and obesity in adults in 12 of them. Other obesogens are pesticides, including DDT and tributyltin, former flame retardants and their newer replacements, dioxins and PCBs, and air pollution. Several recent studies link exposure to dirty air early in life to obesity. The review also names PFAS compounds \u2013 so-called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d due to their longevity in the environment \u2013 as obesogens. These are found in food packaging, cookware, and furniture, including some child car seats. A two-year, randomised clinical trial published in 2018 found people with the highest PFAS levels regained more weight after dieting, especially women. Some antidepressants are also well known to cause weight gain. \u201cThat is a proof of principle that chemicals made for one thing can have side effects that interfere with your metabolism,\u201d said Heindel. Other chemicals with some evidence of being obesogens included some artificial sweeteners and triclosan, an antibacterial agent banned from some uses in the US in 2017. How it works Obesogens work by upsetting the body\u2019s \u201cmetabolic thermostat\u201d, the researchers said, making gaining weight easier and losing weight harder. The body\u2019s balance of energy intake and expenditure through activity relies on the interplay of various hormones from fat tissue, the gut, pancreas, liver, and brain. The pollutants can directly affect the number and size of fat cells, alter the signals that make people feel full, change thyroid function and the dopamine reward system, the scientists said. They can also affect the microbiome in the gut and cause weight gain by making the uptake of calories from the intestines more efficient. \u201cIt turns out chemicals dumped in the environment have these side effects, because they make the cells do things that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have done, and one of those things is laying down fat,\u201d said Prof Robert Lustig at the University of California, San Francisco, and lead author of another of the reviews. The early years of child development are the most vulnerable to obesogens, the researchers wrote: \u201cStudies showed that in utero and early-life exposures were the most sensitive times, because this irreversibly altered programming of various parts of the metabolic system, increasing susceptibility for weight gain.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got four or five chemicals that also will cause transgenerational epigenetic obesity,\u201d said Heindel, referring to changes in the expression of genes that can be inherited. A 2021 study found that women\u2019s level of obesity significantly correlated with their grandmothers\u2019 level of exposure to DDT, even though their granddaughters were never directly exposed to the now banned-pesticide. \u201cPeople need to know that [obesogenic effects] are going on,\u201d Lustig said. \u201cBecause it affects not just them, but their unborn children. This problem\u2019s going to affect generation after generation until we get a hold of it.\u201d Cause and effect Directly proving a causal link between a hazard and a human health impact is difficult for the simple reason that it is not ethical to perform harmful experiments on people. But strong epidemiological evidence can stack up to a level equivalent to proof, such as with tobacco smoking and lung cancer. Lustig said that point had been reached for obesogens, 16 years after the term was first coined. \u201cWe\u2019ll never have randomised control trials \u2013 they would be illegal and unethical. But we now have the proof for obesogens and obesity.\u201d The obesogen paradigm has not been taken up by mainstream researchers so far. But Prof Barbara Corkey, at Boston University School of Medicine and past president of the Obesity Society, said: \u201cThe initial worldview was that obesity is caused by eating too much and exercising too little. And this is nonsense. \u201cIt\u2019s not the explanation because all of the creatures on Earth, including humans, eat when they\u2019re hungry and stop when they are full. Every cell in the body knows if you have enough food,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething has disrupted that normal sensing apparatus and it is not volition. \u201cPeople who are overweight and obese go to tremendous extremes to lose weight and the diet industry has fared extremely well,\u201d Corky said. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that doesn\u2019t work. When the medical profession doesn\u2019t understand something, we always blame patients and unfortunately, people are still being held responsible for [obesity].\u201d Lustig said: \u201cGluttony and sloth are just the outward manifestations of these biochemical perturbations that are going on beneath the surface.\u201d Super-sized How much of the obesity pandemic may be caused by obesogens is not known, though Heindel said they will have an \u201cimportant role\u201d. Lustig said: \u201cIf I had to guess, based on all the work and reading I\u2019ve done, I would say obesogens will account for about 15% to 20% of the obesity epidemic. But that\u2019s a lot.\u201d The rest he attributes to processed food diets, which themselves contain some obesogens. \u201cFructose is a primary driver of a lot of this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt partitions energy to fat in the liver and is a prime obesogen. Fructose would cause obesity even if it didn\u2019t have calories.\u201d A small 2021 trial found that an ultra-processed diet caused more weight gain than an unprocessed diet, despite containing the same calories in the meals offered to participants. Cutting exposure to obesogens is difficult, given that there are now 350,000 synthetic chemicals, many of which are pervasive in the environment. But those known to be harmful can be removed from sale, as is happening in Europe. Heindel said prospective mothers in particular could adjust what they eat and monitor what their children play with in their early years: \u201cStudies have shown modifying diets can within a week or so cause a significant drop in several obesogens.\u201d Lustig said: \u201cThis cause is very pervasive and pernicious, and it\u2019s also lucrative to a lot of [chemical] companies. But we must address it rationally.\u201d To do that, the \u201cknowledge gap\u201d among doctors, regulators and policymakers must be addressed, the scientists said. \u201cIt\u2019s time now that [obesity researchers and clinicians] should start paying attention and, if they don\u2019t think the data is strong enough, tell us what more to do,\u201d said Heindel, who is organising a conference to tackle this issue. Corkey is yet to be fully convinced by the obesogen paradigm, but said the concept of an environmental toxin is probably the right direction to go in. \u201cIs there proof? No, there is not,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult problem, because the number of chemicals in our environment has just astronomically increased. \u201cBut there\u2019s no alternative hypothesis that to me makes any sense and I would certainly challenge anyone who has a better, testable idea to come forth with it,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause this is a serious problem that is impacting our societies enormously, especially children. The problems are getting worse, not better \u2013 we\u2019re going in the wrong direction as it stands.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2022. An earlier version referred to a small 2021 trial that found an ultra-processed diet caused more weight gain than an unprocessed diet, and said that both diets contained the same calories. To clarify: the meals offered for both diets contained the same calories, but participants could choose how much of each meal they consumed."

            "date": "2022-05-14T07:00:02Z",
            "content": "From his perch in the orchestra pit of the Oberammergau stage, Christian St\u00fcckl nods and points to his players above, trying to offer them helpful instructions as their dress rehearsal to a half-full house of mainly local people gets under way. \u201cIt is hard to believe we\u2019ve got this far. I keep waiting for something to go wrong, but apart from a couple of older men forgetting their lines there\u2019s really nothing to complain about,\u201d the director says at the end of the five-and-a-half-hour show. The villagers of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps are in a state of excitement. Their \u201cpassion play\u201d \u2013 which in 1633 their forebears vowed to God they would stage every 10 years if they were spared further deaths from the plague (they were) \u2013 is back again after having been thrown off its usual schedule by two years owing to the latest pandemic. Depicting the life, persecution, death and resurrection of Jesus, the 42nd season of what is believed to be the oldest continuous running amateur theatre production in the world will open on Saturday with a 103-performance run until October. The play is the village\u2019s raison d\u2019etre. It is taken for granted that almost every one of the 5,200 residents who is eligible, from babies to nonagenarians, plays a part either on or off the stage. All children are allowed, as is anyone who has lived in the village for 20 years or more. \u201cThe last time we had to delay was 100 years ago, due to the Spanish flu, as well as deaths and injuries from the first world war, after which it was rescheduled for 1922,\u201d St\u00fcckl says. \u201cPandemics and the passion play have a certain tradition.\u201d Despite misgivings over whether it would be able to go ahead, the usual decree went out on Ash Wednesday last year, forbidding male participants from cutting their hair or shaving their beards until the production closed the following October. \u201cIt was hard for us to believe until recently that it would actually go ahead as the coronavirus infection rate had exploded, but most of us stuck to the rules and didn\u2019t cut our beards in the hope it still would,\u201d said Werner Richter, a taxi driver who has taken part in every production since 1970. His grandchildren are among the 400 youngsters on stage and his son, Andreas, a former Jesus and a psychologist by profession, has one of the lead roles as the high priest Caiaphas. About 400 players who had signed up to take part in 2020 were forced to drop out, some due to changing life plans, others owing to their refusal to be vaccinated or to take a daily test. The Catalan donkey Sancho, on whose back Jesus was due to ride into Jerusalem, has gone into retirement, replaced by the younger Aramis. \u201cBut luckily we have continuity where it matters, as most of those in the 42 lead roles have stuck with it,\u201d St\u00fcckl says. The pandemic aside, his main challenge ever since becoming director at the age of 24 in 1990 has been to retain the existing but ageing audience while pushing the boundaries of the conservative Bavarian Catholic perspective he has often viewed as limited. He describes his biggest mission as trying to rid the passion play of the antisemitic view that Jews were collectively responsible for the death of Jesus, for which it was especially instrumentalised in the Nazi era with Hitler visiting twice. \u201cWe are in constant and deep dialogue with religious representatives now,\u201d St\u00fcckl says. In 2010 he depicted Jesus lifting the Torah as the choir sang a version of the Jewish prayer Shema Yisrael, considered a high point of the play by participants and spectators. This year there is a new musical setting in Hebrew of Psalm 22 (\u201cMy God, My God, Why have you forsaken me?\u201d) by the music director Markus Zwink, which is to be released internationally on a recording of the entire two-hour soundtrack for the first time. The cast is also more diverse this year than it has ever been, including refugee children and Muslim actors in lead roles. In the context of the play\u2019s history this is a radical move, and St\u00fcckl points out the storm that erupted in 1990 when he let a Protestant on to the stage for the first time \u2013 triggering a petition by the local priest that 1,800 people signed, hoping to push the director out. He is also working on how to boost the role of women (married women over 35 were unable to take part until a court ruling 32 years ago). \u201cThe production is very overladen with men,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut then it is a very male-laden story.\u201d He has considerably expanded the time spent on the stage by Jesus\u2019s mother, Mary, as well as Veronica, who wipes his face, and Mary Magdalene, considered to be his closest female follower, and he has introduced the role of Pilate\u2019s wife, previously mentioned only by a male servant who voiced her objection over Jesus\u2019s treatment. In his dressing room backstage at the 5,200-seat theatre, 41-year-old Frederik Mayet, who alternates playing Jesus with another actor, shows some of his props and aids. There is a climbing belt that fits beneath his loin cloth and keeps him fastened safely to the cross during the crucifixion scene, and a menacing-looking crown of thorns with blunted spikes. Outside, leaning against the wall, is the three-metre grey wooden crucifix itself, all 90kg of it, which he must carry. \u201cIt is as heavy as it looks,\u201d he jokes. For Mayet \u2013 whose family first participated in the play in 1890 and whose children, three and eight, are with him on stage \u2013 the perennial question, as it is for most Oberammergauers, is how to ensure the play remains relevant. \u201cAs a community our passion for the play and our courage to believe in it is unabated,\u201d he says. \u201cFundamentally the story for me is less about the theological details and more about emphasising its relevance to our experience of being human.\u201d Mayet also played Jesus in 2010. \u201cBut now the world is a different place,\u201d he says, referring in particular to the effects of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, the increasing displacement of people and mounting ecological disaster. This time his Jesus is \u2013 under St\u00fcckl\u2019s direction \u2013 \u201cmore political, more angry, someone looking for social justice.\u201d He has sought inspiration, he says, everywhere he can find it. It is thanks to the entrepreneur excursion salesman Thomas Cook, who discovered the play for himself in 1880 and began selling passion play package tours, that it has such a big following abroad. Its single biggest set of fans are from the US. But this year the war in Ukraine has already put off tens of thousands of Americans, who have cancelled their trips to Europe. To make up the shortfall, the call has gone out to Germans to come to discover the play. Otherwise the focus in the village is on getting through unscathed to October. The biggest dread, widely voiced, is that both Jesuses go down with coronavirus at the same time. St\u00fcckl says when it is over he will go on retreat to an ashram in India, \u201chappy to get Jesus out of my head\u201d. Janina Nowotka, a hairdresser, says she\u2019ll be waiting for the queues of men outside her salon. \u201cThey are desperate to get their hair cut by then,\u201d she says. \u201cThey come in and are given a beer and the mood is jovial and festive. And those that can\u2019t wait just stand on the street and lop each other\u2019s hair off.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-17T10:00:04Z",
            "content": "Inspired by the Crossed comic book series, this enigmatically titled gorefest directed by Rob Jabbaz is perhaps the bleakest cinematic response yet to the pandemic. As a mysterious virus descends upon an overcrowded Taipei filled with crammed apartments and packed subway cars, the infected morph into rabid monsters who are slaves to their basest instincts. Sweeping through the city like a crimson wave, gruesome acts of violence \u2013 including stabbings, sexual assaults and cannibalism \u2013 are made even more horrifying by their sheer randomness. The dam of civilisation is broken, and the darkness of humanity oozes through the cracks like a festering wound. In the age of \u201celevated horror\u201d where the roots of dread often function as a metaphor for intangibles \u2013 such as emotional trauma \u2013 or social issues, it is refreshing when terror takes on a more immediate, visceral form, like someone thrusting the tip of an umbrella into an eye socket. There is a loose narrative thread here as a pair of young lovers struggle to communicate with each other amid the carnage, though their tragic separation serves more as an excuse for the film to revel in increasingly sadistic set pieces with astonishing inventiveness. Unencumbered by a need to explicitly spell out any overarching message (a noble aspiration that nevertheless dampens many modern horror films) The Sadness accentuates gore\u2019s tactile yuckiness, utilising practical effects in a fashion that recalls retro exploitation flicks. A castration sequence sees bits of flesh visibly flying about the screen, a stylistic flourish that is at once tongue-in-cheek and genuinely revolting. The recurring dependence on sexual violence as a shock tactic is, however, a desensitising misstep. Nevertheless the assured command of style situates Jabbaz as an impressive new voice in horror cinema. \u2022 The Sadness is available now on Shudder."

            "date": "2022-05-06T15:38:28Z",
            "content": "It was proclaimed moribund, if not doomed, just a year ago. But now, is business class air travel taking off again? British Airways\u2019 owner IAG, forecasting a return to profit this year, said that a strong recovery in business bookings was driving the recovery. In a world where half the City can no longer be bothered to get on the Northern line to return to the office, and bankers begrudge the cost of a train from Surrey, how can airlines claim to be pulling this off? There are a couple of things to note. Firstly, not all the premium seats are necessarily occupied by passengers travelling solely for work. Plenty of holiday companies, from the travel giant TUI to BA itself, have reported that more affluent customers, who kept earning and in some cases amassed hefty savings while forced to stay at home during the pandemic, are now blowing a lot more on a holiday \u2013 even as the cost of living crisis hits many. But work trips are also returning. The bigger, multinational firms may have adopted Zoom for many internal meetings, with long-term effects for airlines. Most assume there will be far fewer of the kind of flights simply for, say, a European managing director to touch base with a boss in a US global headquarters. However, many small and medium firms say they cannot do business that way, particularly in terms of winning new clients or sealing contracts. That isn\u2019t necessarily just to the benefit of the likes of IAG, with wide-body planes and business class cabins: in short-haul, easyJet has claimed to steal a march among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) whose budgets may be ever tighter. BA\u2019s boss, Sean Doyle, confirms that the SMEs were the first to return, but the bigger corporations are now booking, with banking and finance leading the charge to the skies. Accountancy and consultancy are close behind, and sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals are now coming back. Speaking as owner IAG announced quarterly results, Doyle said business traffic was 2.5 times higher in March than it was in January, and was now back to 65%-70% of 2019 levels. The lucrative transatlantic routes remain the focus, with bookings coming in from both ends \u2013 still led by leisure, but for business, \u201cmomentum is building\u201d. There are clear barriers still to a full recovery: strict Covid entry policies deter or prohibit flights to some key Asian business destinations, especially China, Hong Kong and Japan. The climate crisis is pushing companies to burnish their environmental credentials, and curbing their own air travel is an obvious way to reduce their carbon footprint. But conferences are going back \u201creal world\u201d rather than online, and many employees will be desperate to see the world after being cooped up for two years. Arguably the pandemic has made business travel more feasible: working remotely has proved that staff do not need to be in the office to be productive. Rather than just whizzing home after a packed schedule, staff can conduct more of their normal duties while staying abroad longer \u2013 potentially more palatable to both the firm and the business traveller. Good news for BA, if bad news for the passengers upgrading their holiday \u2013 the front of the cabin, says Doyle, is looking ever more like 2019 all over again."

            "content": "For refusing to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, three US air force academy cadets won\u2019t be commissioned as military officers, though they will receive college degrees, a spokesperson for the school said Saturday. Academy spokesperson Dean Miller said in a statement that the three cadets in question won\u2019t be commissioned as air force officers \u201cas long as they remain unvaccinated,\u201d though they would get their bachelor\u2019s of science degrees. The military branch had not decided yet whether to require the trio to reimburse the US for education costs in lieu of service, Miller said. A fourth cadet who had initially turned down the shot providing protection against Covid-19 ultimately got vaccinated and would graduate with an officer\u2019s commission, Miller added. The air force academy didn\u2019t identify any of the cadets who were denied officers\u2019 commissions. The statements from Miller were a reminder that the air force\u2019s was the only US military academy as of now who was preventing its cadets from being commissioned as officers because of vaccine refusals. Each of the 1,000 cadets who graduated from the US army\u2019s academy at West Point, New York, on Saturday had been vaccinated and would be commissioned. Meanwhile, officials at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, told the Associated Press that none of its Navy or Marine Corps graduates would be blocked from their commissions due to vaccine refusal when their commencement ceremonies occur in the coming weeks. The air force\u2019s graduation ceremony is scheduled for Wednesday. Chosen as keynote speaker was US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who made Covid-19 vaccines mandatory for military service members and academy students last year. Austin reasoned that the vaccine was key to keeping the military healthy and ready for action, noting that service members have previously been required to get more than a dozen vaccines for illnesses such as measles, mumps and rubella. Though Congress members, military officials, members of the public and unsuccessful litigation have questioned whether requests to be exempt from the mandate have been treated fairly, the vast majority of military members have been vaccinated against Covid-19 at least once. About 99% of those actively serving the Navy, and 98% of the air force, Marine Corps and Army have gotten at least one shot, officials have said. Nonetheless, the air force last year had to discharge at least 27 people who refused to get the Covid-19 shot and were believed to be the first service members to be dismissed for disobeying Austin\u2019s vaccine mandate."

            "content": "The UK health secretary has promised to deploy more members of the vaccine taskforce to a new group set up to fix the acute shortage of hormone replacement therapy products for menopausal women, after holding crisis talks with HRT manufacturers and pharmacies. At a meeting with drugmakers such as Aspen Pharmacare, Novartis, Novo Nordisk Pfizer, Theramex and representatives from community pharmacies, Sajid Javid said the government would \u201cleave no stone unturned in our national mission to boost supply of HRT\u201d. Also present was the director general of the vaccine taskforce and recently appointed HRT supply tsar, Madeleine McTernan. She is spearheading a new HRT supply taskforce that will implement lessons learned from the rapid rollout of Covid-19 vaccines to improve the HRT supply chain. Some members of the vaccine taskforce will be redeployed to support this work. She described Thursday\u2019s discussions as \u201ccollaborative and constructive\u201d, as manufacturers outlined the steps they were taking to boost supply, and shared their thoughts on wider solutions including improved communications. Javid tweeted after the meeting: The women\u2019s health minister, Maria Caulfield, said: \u201cI know HRT can be a lifeline for women suffering from severe menopause symptoms. We are doing everything in our power to make sure women can continue to access the HRT they need to continue living their life, unrestricted by the menopause.\u201d The National Pharmacy Association said it was looking forward to \u201cworking closely with government to help find a long-term solution to ensure good supply is available for our patients\u201d. Its director of corporate affairs, Gareth Jones, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that something is being done to grip the matter. The overarching issue is one of supply failing to keep up with the rapidly rising demand in this country. \u201cAs experts in medicines, pharmacists should be given greater flexibility to take decisions at the point of care to manage supplies. This includes the authority to amend prescriptions or share stock among pharmacies when to do so could help maintain supplies.\u201d Soaring demand for HRT products among British women going through menopause has led to months of supply shortages and stories of women struggling to sleep or work effectively after being unable to obtain their prescriptions. Some describe the surge in demand as the \u201cDavina effect\u201d after a documentary fronted by the TV presenter \u2013 Davina McCall: Sex, Myths and the Menopause \u2013 that was broadcast on Channel 4 in May last year prompted thousands to seek prescriptions. Javid has rationed supply, imposing \u201cserious shortage protocols\u201d on 29 April to limit the dispensing of Oestrogel, Ovestin cream and Premique Low Dose to three months\u2019 supply per person to \u201ceven out\u201d the distribution. The government knew about the supply shortages as far back as October, according to Tina Backhouse, the UK manager for women\u2019s health at Theramex, but ministers were focused on dealing with the Covid pandemic. Prescriptions for HRT have more than doubled in England over the past five years, according to NHS data."

            "date": "2022-05-24T05:11:24Z",
            "content": "The New South Wales government is looking to make flu vaccinations free amid \u201cunprecedented\u201d demand on ambulance services and ongoing hospital delays caused by influenza, Covid and furloughed staff. The state\u2019s health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced on Tuesday the government was seeking to implement a similar scheme to the one being offered in Queensland. Hazzard said vaccines were crucial amid fears this year\u2019s flu season could be worse than in 2017, when there were 1876 more deaths than expected in NSW, which the ABS largely attributed to the severe influenza season. \u201cThis flu season could be every bit as bad, if not worse,\u201d Hazzard warned. Health officials are particularly concerned about soaring numbers of flu cases while the state continues to battle Covid-19, as well as consistently high levels of medical staff furloughing and \u201cunprecedented\u201d demand on emergency and ambulance services. Hazzard said the NSW scheme would probably look like Queensland\u2019s, where flu vaccines will be free for the next month. \u201cWe\u2019re working with our colleagues in the pharmacy area and also GPs to look at how we might be able to achieve that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll make some announcements on that over the next few days \u2026 and hopefully, we will be able to follow a similar path.\u201d He reminded people over 65, pregnant women and people with some medical conditions that the flu jab was already free for them and widely available. Over the week ending last Sunday, 1,125 people presented to NSW hospitals with flu-like illnesses. Of those, 150 were admitted to hospital and six were taken to intensive care. Meanwhile, the number of incoming triple zero calls has reached record levels, the NSW ambulance commissioner, Dr Dominic Morgan, said. \u201cThe amount of cases that NSW ambulance has been going to is genuinely in the unprecedented category,\u201d he said. \u201cOur paramedics are very challenged, but they turn up every day to do the right thing by the community. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a matter of record that our patients that have some less severe conditions are actually not getting the experienced officer that they need, which prompts me to come out today and ask the community to do their bit.\u201d In April, 116,000 calls were attended by ambulances in NSW \u2013 only slightly down from 119,000 in January, a big increase on the pre-Covid average. The rise in flu cases has led some pathology providers to now include influenza testing as part of regular Covid PCR tests, according Prof Dominic Dwyer, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney. \u201cWith the PCR tests that the laboratories are doing, they\u2019re now moving from a Covid-only test to a test that gives you influenza results, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) results, and also a Covid result,\u201d Dwyer said. \u201cWe\u2019re working towards that in both the public and private sector.\u201d He welcomed the foreshadowed move to free flu shots. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIf they make it free, that\u2019s the sort of thing that helps you with any vaccine.\u201d About 2,500 NSW healthcare workers have been furloughed at a time in recent weeks. The NSW Health secretary, Susan Pearce, said the issue was \u201csignificant\u201d and was making it even harder to get on top of elective surgeries that were delayed during the Omicron Covid wave. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, warned that otherwise healthy children had died in previous flu seasons and urged parents to take it seriously, including continuing to wear masks on public transport."

From 30 May about 1.5 million more people aged 16 to 64 will be eligible for the fourth dose, the interim health minister, Katy Gallagher, announced on Wednesday. However, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) has not given the green light for healthy people who do not have a risk factor for severe disease to receive a second booster. This includes healthcare workers and pregnant women who do not have other risk factors. On 25 March Atagi extended fourth covid vaccinations for the highest risk groups: people aged 65 years and above, residents of aged care or disability care facilities, the severely immunocompromised and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 50 years or above. Atagi\u2019s updated advice recommended a fourth dose four months after the third dose for people aged 16 to 64 who have: \u201cA medical condition that increases the risk of severe Covid-19 illness; and people with disability with significant or complex health needs or multiple comorbidities which increase risk of poor outcome from Covid-19\u201d. The latter \u201cparticularly\u201d included Down\u2019s Syndrome or complex multisystem disorders, Atagi said. Medical conditions that qualify include: immunocompromising conditions; cancer; inflammatory conditions; chronic lung, liver, cardiac or neurological diseases; diabetes; severe chronic kidney disease; severe obesity or being severely underweight. Atagi said people who had had three doses had a \u201crelatively preserved protection\u201d but a fourth dose could provide \u201ca further increase in the level of protection against severe disease and death\u201d. People who were eligible for the winter dose but had had a recent infection of Covid-19 should delay their winter booster until three months after their infection, it said. Despite world-beating health results in the first two years of the pandemic and a high vaccination rate for the two primary doses, Australia is experiencing an increase in Covid cases and deaths. Australia has had 5,939 deaths this year compared with just 2,239 over 2020 and 2021. According to the World Health Organisation, 53.2% of Australians have received a booster, trailing some other developed countries including Singapore and South Korea. Gallagher told reporters she was advised there were \u201cno supply issues\u201d. The advice did not support extending fourth doses to healthy people \u201cbut it remains under review\u201d, Gallagher said. During the election campaign Labor promised to consider a renewed push to curb Covid, including more advertising to support booster vaccinations, while the Coalition talked down the need for extra measures."

            "content": "Children who spend more time engaged in adventurous play involving an element of risk have fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, according to research that found the effect was more pronounced among children from lower income families. The study set out to test theories that adventurous play \u2013 climbing trees, riding bikes, jumping from high surfaces, or playing out of adult sight \u2013 offers learning opportunities that help build resilience in children and protect mental health. Researchers surveyed two samples of parents of children aged five to 11 \u2013 427 parents in Northern Ireland and a nationally representative group of 1,919 parents in England, Wales and Scotland \u2013 and asked them about their child\u2019s play, their mental health before the pandemic and their mood during the first Covid-19 lockdown. They found that children who spent more time playing adventurously outside had fewer \u201cinternalising problems\u201d, which are characterised as anxiety and depression, and were also more positive during the first lockdown. The effects were relatively small but consistent after factoring in a range of demographic variables, including a child\u2019s sex and age, as well as parents\u2019 employment status and mental health. The larger sample also found the association was stronger for children from lower income families than their peers from wealthier backgrounds. As a result, the study\u2019s authors are calling on planning authorities to ensure that every child, especially those from disadvantaged families who cannot pay for additional, organised adventure experiences, has free access to a safe space for adventurous outdoor play close to their home. The study, Child\u2019s Play: Examining the Association Between Time Spent Playing and Child Mental Health, published in the journal Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development, comes at a time when child psychologists are worried that children have less opportunity for adventurous play out of sight of adults, that Covid has limited play, and that playgrounds have become sanitised because of fears of litigation. Helen Dodd, professor of child psychology at the University of Exeter, who led the study, said: \u201cWe\u2019re more concerned than ever about children\u2019s mental health, and our findings highlight that we might be able to help protect children\u2019s mental health by ensuring they have plentiful opportunities for adventurous play. \u201cThis is really positive because play is free, instinctive and rewarding for children, available to everyone, and doesn\u2019t require special skills. We now urgently need to invest in and protect natural spaces, well-designed parks and adventure playgrounds, to support the mental health of our children.\u201d In July, one of Europe\u2019s biggest indoor children\u2019s play centres is to open in Wetherby, in Yorkshire, promising a new and challenging experience for children. The \u00a33.5m Playhive at Stockeld Park features a series of themed and interconnected adventure zones in a doughnut-shaped building with a 10-metre (33ft) tower at its centre. Its creator, Peter Grant, said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the usual soft play scene, but one that truly inspires imaginations. The idea is children of all ages can do most of it, but some of it is more challenging for older children.\u201d Belinda Kirk, an explorer, mother and author of the Adventure Revolution: the life-changing power of choosing challenge, welcomed the University of Exeter findings on adventurous play. \u201cThere is this incredibly normal instinct to want to protect your children, which I have in bountiful amounts. But we live in a world that is so obsessed with physical safety that we\u2019ve forgotten to balance it with mental health. We\u2019ve prioritised physical safety or physical health over mental health, so we\u2019re not letting kids fall down and learn to pick themselves up again, and therefore build up coping mechanisms and resilience.\u201d Previous research found that primary-age children are not allowed to play outside on their own until they are two years older than their parents\u2019 generation. While their parents were allowed to play outside unsupervised by the age of nine on average, today\u2019s children are 11 by the time they reach the same milestone. Family adventures for free 1 Go for a walk in the dark. Take a torch to make it more fun. \u201cDoing it at night makes it all the more exciting, because even environments you know, like a footpath near your house, feel different. It smells different, the wildlife\u2019s different, it\u2019s a proper adventure,\u201d says Kirk. 2 Go for a night cycle. 3 Explore woods alone or with a friend. 4 Camp out overnight. \u201cSleeping out under the stars is a hugely exciting thing,\u201d says Kirk. \u201cEven just in your back garden.\u201d 5 Go swimming or paddling in a river or lake. 6 Go geocaching. It\u2019s a treasure hunt. Just get the app, create an account, choose your geocache from the millions available \u2013 there are more than 8,000 in London alone \u2013 and off you go. 7 Climb a mountain or a local hill. \u201cSummiting your first mountain is a wonderful thing to do,\u201d says Kirk. \u201cIt could be Snowden, with your parents, or a hill near your house.\u201d 8 Try out new skills on a skateboard, roller skates or a bike. 9 Create an obstacle course inside or outside. 10 Do a source-to-sea river walk. Choose from the 220-mile long Severn Way from mid-Wales to the Bristol Channel for the very ambitious, or the 71-mile Ribble Way, or 42-mile Sussex Ouse Valley Way among others."

The MHA was designed for the detention of people who are mentally unwell and at risk of harm to themselves or others by virtue of a defined mental disorder, to enable them to have treatment. It is scandalous that people with autism and learning disabilities are detained when there is no evidence of mental disorder. The disproportionate number of black people being detained and subject to community treatment orders has been evident for many years, yet the inequities remain, with little evidence of serious change. This remains a shocking indictment of the processes of detention. The involvement of those detained to have a greater say in treatment preferences is welcome. However, without serious attention to the crisis in access to mental health services, the quality of many services and the unsafe staffing levels, the services will be hard pressed to act on these preferences.

            "content": "As a secondary school teacher, sadly I am utterly unsurprised to read how many children are being treated for mental health problems in England (Record 420,000 children a month in England treated for mental health problems, 22 May). While your article detailed several supposed causes of increased mental health problems among young people, it strikes me how little it addresses the glaring gap of mental health support and provision in schools. I\u2019ve worked in four state secondary schools in England over the last decade, and in each one the waiting list for students to see an in-school mental health nurse \u2013 if there is one at all \u2013 has been months\u2019 long. Students simply don\u2019t bother turning to in-school services for help. Students often turn to teachers and support staff in their hour of need. Of course, we do our very best, but with staff shortages, funding cuts and teacher burnout, there simply aren\u2019t the bodies required to support students in the way they need and deserve. I, like so many colleagues, never resent being the person that students turn to, but teachers are not mental health professionals. If Ofsted were to value mental health provision in schools as highly as, say, academic attainment scores, might schools\u2019 financial priorities realign? Name and address supplied \u2022 Your article highlights the acute need for government-funded counselling support in every secondary school, academy and further education college. This is something we\u2019ve long campaigned for. Many children and young people are in distress, but aren\u2019t always able to access timely support from local NHS services. Funded school counselling is vital now to ease the strain on those services, to support our children and young people before they reach crisis point, and to help the many more who may be suffering in silence. We recently surveyed school staff about the impact of school counselling, with 86% saying it\u2019s helped improve attendance, 73% saying it\u2019s helped improve students\u2019 behaviour, and 72% saying it\u2019s helped improve students\u2019 academic attainment. School counselling is a non-stigmatising and effective form of early intervention for reducing psychological distress. It has a positive effect on confidence, resilience, sense of self-worth, family relationships, friendships, school attendance and academic achievement. Government funding is urgently needed to provide more school counsellors to offer life-changing support for young people in need. Martin Bell Head of policy and public affairs, British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy \u2022 I am a piano teacher, and as someone who has worked on the peripheries of education all my life, I see the ill effects of an exam-obsessed education system, particularly at this time of year. Children are subjected to continuous pressure to \u201csucceed\u201d in exams. This means not just taking public exams, but the buildup of endless mock exams. All my teenage pupils have been adversely affected, either temporarily stopping what is a cherished hobby of a lifetime before their exams start, or abandoning lessons altogether, to have the time to prepare for GCSEs/A-levels. Should we still be surprised at the massive rise in children\u2019s mental health problems? Stephen Baron London \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2022-05-18T18:35:00Z",
            "content": "The lead singer of New Order has attacked \u201cludicrous\u201d NHS waiting lists for mental health support, as he spoke out about his anguish at being unable to help his former bandmate Ian Curtis in the days before he took his own life 42 years ago. Speaking at a suicide prevention event in parliament, Bernard Sumner \u2013 who was a member of the post-punk band Joy Division, whose singer, Curtis, killed himself at home in Macclesfield on 18 May 1980 \u2013 described the suicide of a friend\u2019s daughter who had been told she would have to wait 18 months for help. \u201cYou can\u2019t go on a waiting list if you are thinking of killing yourself. It\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d Sumner said. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait 18 months. You need help straight away.\u201d There are 1.6 million people on NHS waiting lists for mental health services, with health leaders estimating a further 8 million cannot get specialist help because they are not considered sick enough to qualify. Sumner was speaking alongside the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and a health minister, Gillian Keegan, at an event exploring how suicide rates could be cut. It was introduced by Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons, who was close to tears when he talked about the suicide of his daughter. \u201cWe know there are massive waiting lists,\u201d said Keegan, who also spoke about how she had lost a younger cousin to suicide. \u201cI worry about it every day.\u201d She said the government was working to train 27,000 more mental health professionals, and provide more mental health support in schools and suicide prevention policies that particularly target high-risk groups, including men aged 45 to 55, new mothers and people leaving the military. Suicide rates in England and Wales have remained stable in recent years at between 10 and 11 deaths per 100,000 people, based on deaths registered by coroners following inquests into unexpected deaths. In 2020, 5,224 suicides were recorded, three quarters of which were by males. The suicide rate is markedly lower now than it was in the early 1980s when Curtis died, when there were around 14 suicides for every 100,000 people. Sumner described how Curtis had stayed with him for a fortnight before he died in 1980. \u201cI tried every night to talk him out of it,\u201d Sumner said. \u201cHe agreed with me but he was on a mission. It was going to happen. I don\u2019t know what more we could have done.\u201d Only 23, Curtis was married with a young daughter, but his marriage was heading for divorce. He had depression and epilepsy and had made an earlier attempt to take his life. Sumner called for mental health professionals who are helping people at risk of suicide to start communicating with their families who may not know about the issues, in a challenge to current patient confidentiality rules. Keegan responded: \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy because of the age of consent, and if someone doesn\u2019t want you to be involved, but more family involvement will help in many cases.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "Spending time in the great outdoors is good for your mental health, according to a growing body of research. For example, getting out and about in forests and parks has been shown to increase happiness and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. But are the benefits universal? A review paper notes that most studies in this field look at rich, white, western populations, and scientists say this results in an incomplete picture of the health benefits. Carlos Andres Gallegos-Riofr\u00edo, of the University of Vermont\u2019s Gund Institute for Environment, whose findings have been published in Current Research in Environmental Sustainability, says indigenous populations like those he studies in South America have different relationships with nature to other people. He says it is important to learn how their mental health is affected by this different rapport. Gallegos-Riofro and colleagues at the University of Vermont examined 174 peer-reviewed studies from the last decade and found more than 95% of research was conducted in high-income western nations of the US, Europe and east Asia. Only 4% of studies looked at nations of medium income, such as India, and no low-income countries featured in the studies. Only one study took place in Africa and one in South America. Of the participants whose ethnicity was known, most were white. Rachelle Gould, a researcher at University of Vermont\u2019s Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with the existing findings, those findings are important, but we have reason to believe they may not apply to the entire population. In order to allow this work to influence sustainability action and to move us towards sustainability, we need to know which of these effects are universal and which are culturally specific.\u201d Making this distinction can lead to fair policy changes, Gould says. The study builds on the concept of \u201cWeird psychology\u201d, a term coined by the evolutionary biologist Joseph Henrich. The acronym refers to how experiments that focus mainly on college students from western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (Weird) parts of the world cannot allow scientists to draw universal conclusions about human behaviour. \u201cThis research strikingly demonstrates a massive bias in the sampling of global populations towards those that are Weird,\u201d said Henrich, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThis limits our ability to generalise about the phenomenon under investigation.\u201d Henrich said it would be useful to expand research to include more diverse populations and use culturally sensitive tools adapted to the people being studied."

            "content": "Sri Lanka\u2019s prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has resigned after months of protests over the country\u2019s deepening economic crisis, as once-peaceful protests turned violent and at least five people were killed in clashes. Turmoil began to engulf the country on Monday following violence at a major protest site in Colombo, where pro-government supporters attacked peaceful demonstrators and police responded with teargas and water cannon. The violence quickly spread across the country. Houses and vehicles of several pro-Rajapaksa politicians and the residence of Mahinda Rajapaksa were set on fire. A nationwide curfew was imposed but five were killed and almost 200 injured. In one incident just outside of Colombo, a politician from the ruling party opened fire on anti-government protesters blocking his car, killing a 27-year-old, and then later took his own life. According to police, another ruling party politician opened fire on protesters in the southern town of Weeraketiya, killing two and wounding five. Mahinda Rajapaksa had been asked to resign by his brother, the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, at a special meeting on Friday, in an attempt to appease demonstrators who have been taking to the streets in their thousands since March. Protesters have been calling for both members of Sri Lanka\u2019s powerful Rajapaksa political dynasty to be removed from office for mishandling the economy and plunging the country into the worst financial crisis since independence. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was president for a decade between 2005 and 2015, had reportedly been resistant to stepping down, but on Monday submitted his letter of resignation to the president. \u201cMultiple stakeholders have indicated the best solution to the present crisis is the formation of an interim all-party government. Therefore, I have tendered my resignation so the next steps can be taken in accordance with the Constitution,\u201d he wrote. The resignation is the latest concession made by the Rajapaksas in the face of protracted anger and protests. The president recently agreed to repeal an amendment to the constitution which had concentrated power in his hands and hand power back to the parliament. Other members of the Rajapaksa family who had previously held seats in the cabinet have also stepped down, with the president the only remaining member of the political family still in power. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, known widely as Gota, has repeatedly said he will not resign as president, despite the clarion call of the protests being \u201cGota go home\u201d. The resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa means the government will be dissolved. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who remains as the executive, is expected to invite members of all political parties to form a cross-party cabinet, described as a \u201cunity government\u201d, in an effort to implement some political stability amid the widespread anti-government unrest. The Rajapaksas have largely controlled Sri Lankan politics for two decades, but the economic crisis has rattled their grip on power in the face of mass unrest from those who had previously been supporters of their brand of chauvinist nationalist politics, which pandered to the country\u2019s Sinhalese Buddhist majority. Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign reserves have dropped so low that the country cannot afford to import basic essentials, leading to shortages of fuel, food and medicines. People have been forced to endure daily power cuts of up to 10 hours, fuelling mass protests across the country since March. Over the weekend, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, the second in recent weeks, in a bid to regain control over the streets. However, Monday marked a violent shift in the demonstrations when hundreds of pro-government supporters gathered outside the prime minister\u2019s residence in Colombo and urged Mahinda Rajapaksa not to resign. The group, some armed with sticks and wooden bars, then launched an attack on an anti-government protest camp nearby, with police reportedly looking on as the clashes began. Police deployed teargas and water cannon, and around 180 were taken to hospital with injuries. Army and paramilitary troops were deployed to the site and a curfew was declared in the area. The incident was a catalyst for violence which spread first through the city and then across the country, as the homes and cars of several lawmakers, including Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s residence in the city of Kurunegala were set on fire. Gotabaya Rajapaksa tweeted: \u201cStrongly condemn the violent acts taking place by those inciting &amp; participating, irrespective of political allegiances. Violence won\u2019t solve the current problems.\u201d However, many were quick to point out that the attacks had been prompted by Rajapaksa supporters. The US ambassador to Sri Lanka condemned \u201cthe violence against peaceful protesters today, and [called] on the government to conduct a full investigation, including the arrest and prosecution of anyone who incited violence\u201d. The economic situation in Sri Lanka remains dire, with the country virtually bankrupt. It has already defaulted on its billions in foreign loans and is in discussions with the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan and financial assistance to get the country back on its feet."

            "content": "Voters in Lebanon have gone to the polls in the first national election since a disastrous economic collapse and an explosion that wrecked the Beirut waterfront in 2020, amid low expectations that the leaders they hold responsible will face a serious challenge to their stranglehold on the country. A number of civil society candidates lined up against an entrenched ruling elite with pledges to change a political landscape in which feudal lords and their networks have enriched themselves since the end of the civil war. The chances of a real breakthrough appeared slim as the polls closed on Sunday evening, with the most likely outcome being a return to some form of the status quo, where power is apportioned along established sectarian lines, with existing control structures barely diluted. In the run-up to the election, the former prime minister and leader of Lebanon\u2019s Sunni Muslim community, Saad Hariri, had urged a voter boycott, and many of his followers appeared to pay heed, with low turnout in Sunni parts of the country amid a modest turnout nationwide. Many polling stations were without electricity and some were short on ballot papers, in a microcosm of the country\u2019s continuing disintegration under fuel and power shortages, and hyperinflation as the local currency continues to lose value. At some polling centres, there was no shortage of the precious commodity of fresh dollars, which had been used to lure the support of last-minute voters, particularly families who had arrived with multiple members. \u201cThey have to give me something,\u201d said one woman at a west Beirut polling station. \u201cWhat else am I going to get from these people?\u201d At another polling station in the Keserwan region, one voter, Joseph Karam, 41, said he had considered voting for civil society candidates, but had decided to cast his ballot for the Lebanese Forces, a civil-war-era party that has been resurgent in recent years and has won the patronage of Gulf states for its willingness to confront Lebanon\u2019s dominant political bloc, Hezbollah. A total of 718 candidates from 15 electoral districts were running for seats in the 128-member parliament. Going into the poll, Hezbollah and its allies retained 71 seats. Their support base was expected to hold firm against a handful of secular Shia candidates and a push by mainstream parties backed by western states. The Lebanese Association for Democratic Elections said its delegates had been forced to withdraw from two polling stations after threats by Hezbollah supporters and their allies in the Shia Amal group. While fistfights were reported at some booths, and there were claims of harassment by rival blocs at other locations, the poll seemed to have defied predictions of more serious unrest. \u201cThe issue now is counting these ballots,\u201d said Anwar Habib, a voter from the southern city of Sidon. \u201cThis is not a secure process. Hezbollah and Amal will do anything they can to win.\u201d Preliminary results were expected by Monday. Weeks of political horse-trading are then expected before a government is formed."

The 67-year-old retired businessman, living in Sri Lanka\u2019s Gampaha district, has always relied on a drug to keep at bay his hereditary nervous condition, which makes him dizzy and unable to walk. But since his prescription recently ran out, he cannot get another supply. The drug is simply not available in Sri Lanka any more. \u201cI am afraid that I might become paralysed because there is no one to care for us,\u201d he said fretfully. \u201cMy wife and I do everything alone. We split the household chores and manage it between ourselves. My wife has a knee problem and she can barely walk.\u201d Sri Lanka\u2019s financial crisis, its worst since independence, is swiftly becoming an alarming health crisis. The government\u2019s coffers have fallen to their lowest levels on record and last week the country was forced to default on its international loans for the first time in its history. Without crucial foreign currency, Sri Lanka has been unable to import the essentials: food, fuel \u2013 and medicine. Sri Lanka imports more than 80% of its medical supplies. Now almost 200 medical items are in shortage, including 76 essential, life-saving drugs, from blood-thinners for heart attack and stroke patients to antibiotics, rabies vaccines and cancer chemotherapy drugs. Essential surgical equipment and anaesthesia is running out so fast that the decision was made this week for only emergency surgeries, mostly heart and cancer patients, to go ahead. All routine surgeries \u2013 anything from hernias to swollen appendixes \u2013 have been put on hold. Some government hospitals have been instructed to only admit emergency patients. \u201cUltimately, people are definitely going to die,\u201d said a doctor in Colombo who had been told not to speak to the media. She described how the hospital was so low on certain drugs they had to instruct families of patients to go out to pharmacies and try to buy it themselves. \u201cThere have been incidents where the family members have gone around looking for drugs and by the time they\u2019ve come back with the drug, it\u2019s been too late and the patient has died,\u201d she said. The doctor said the shortages were getting worse. \u201cI\u2019m worried about pregnant mothers because soon I don\u2019t know whether we will have enough drugs to perform cesarian sections,\u201d she said. Cancer drugs, which are notoriously expensive to import, have been particularly badly hit by shortages in recent weeks, and the responsibility to source them has fallen on the heads of oncologists themselves. They have been putting out global appeals for donations, and writing letters to private supporters, organisations and governments, to ensure cancer treatments are not delayed. Dr Buddhika Somawardana, an oncologist at Colombo\u2019s largest cancer hospital, described the \u201cgreat stress\u201d he and other doctors were under as essential cancer drugs began to run out over a month ago or stopped being available at all. \u201cOne of the drugs we give patients undergoing chemotherapy, which boosts their blood count so they aren\u2019t liable to serious infections, is not available any more,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, we managed to get donation of 80,000 vials. But that will not last very long.\u201d He added: \u201cSomehow, thanks to donations, we have mostly been managing without any huge issues. But we had to postpone some chemotherapy, which may have detrimental effects on the cancer outcome.\u201d Somawardana said the crisis was placing a huge \u201cfinancial and psychological burden\u201d on cancer patients, who were having to source and pay vast sums for their own medicines to continue their treatment, previously free and easily accessibly in hospitals under Sri Lanka\u2019s lauded universal healthcare system. Cancer doctors too were feeling the pressure of having to be the ones both to appeal for global drug donations, as well as treat their patients. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how long we will be able to go on like this,\u201d he said. Ruvaiz Haniffa, a doctor in Colombo, expressed his frustration that doctors had \u201cseen this coming as early as January\u201d but little had been done by authorities to set up backup plans to ensure no medicines ran short, even as the country\u2019s foreign reserves began to deplete to worryingly low levels. \u201cWe are facing great ethical dilemmas as doctors,\u201d said Haniffa. \u201cWe used to have a very efficient health system. But at the moment, it has become ineffective. More people will die, which is not acceptable.\u201d He said his patients were being forced to find their own drugs and pay prices over 40% higher, if they could find them at all. Haniffa said many of his patients were having to choose between medicine or paying for the school tuition for their children or fuel to take them to work. Haniffa said he feared for the long-term impacts on the life expectancy of Sri Lankans. \u201cWith the kidney disease and the diabetes and the hypertension we are not treating now, it causes long term damage,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in five years, we will see strokes go up, heart attacks go up, neurological problems go up, cancers go up.\u201d With the newly appointed prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, warning recently that the situation would \u201conly get worse\u201d and that Sri Lankans are facing tough months ahead, those without medicines said they faced an uncertain future. On Sunday, India delivered 25 tonnes of medical supplies to the country while France donated some essential equipment, but most working in the healthcare system say Sri Lanka can not rely on donations for ever. Among those riddled with anxiety was Sushantha Weerasuriya, 42, who has struggled to get hold of his epilepsy medicine, travelling long distances to track a few pills down. Even when he manages to find the medicines, they have become almost impossible for him to afford, totalling 10,000 rupees (\u00a322) in May. But as soon as he stops taking the medication, he begins to have regular seizures, which cause him to lose consciousness and being unable to work. \u201cIf I am without it for five days, then the condition will return and continue non-stop, which I really fear,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the primary breadwinner of my family and I have to support my wife and four-year-old daughter. But when the condition comes, I cannot work. If the medication completely stops then my family\u2019s livelihood is in danger,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-05-01T05:00:15Z",
            "content": "Living standards are set to fall at their fastest rate since records began in the mid-1950s. Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that real household incomes will fall by 2.2% this year, as energy and food prices increase but wages fail to keep pace with rising bills. The impact will not be felt equally. For some, it will barely register. For other families, it will mean difficult decisions about what to cut back on. For others still, it will be profound, stretching precarious budgets in which there is already no give, forcing impossible choices between essentials such as putting food on the table and keeping the heating on, and sharpening the fear of the unexpected outlay that can trigger a debt spiral from which there is no escape. One estimate suggests lower-income households will face a drop in income of \u00a31,300 this year. Last week, the latest thinking from ministers on how to address this crisis in living standards trickled into the headlines after a cabinet \u201cbrainstorming\u201d meeting. Grant Shapps, the transport minister, proposed moving car MOTs from once a year to once every 24 months, saving a one-car household a paltry \u00a323 a year, at the risk of jeopardising road safety. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, suggested increasing the maximum number of children an early-years worker can be responsible for in order to modestly reduce the cost of childcare. Others around the table reportedly suggested unilaterally scrapping tariffs on food imports, which would weaken Britain\u2019s hand in trade negotiations, and scrapping government commitments to reduce carbon emissions, a move that would create significant long-term economic and environmental costs for the UK. The shallow suggestions reveal the government\u2019s desperation to give voters the impression it is taking action to address these harsh economic circumstances, but without spending any money. They are not serious policies, but fodder for press releases before the local elections. Britain is experiencing a prolonged economic malaise. Wages have been mostly stagnant since the financial crisis, productivity has barely grown since then and sits 15% below the United States, Germany and France, and external shocks \u2013 the self-inflicted pain of leaving the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, and the war in Ukraine \u2013 have sent prices rocketing. There are no shortcuts to increasing living standards. Any approach has to be three-pronged. First, economic policy needs to target rising productivity and to ensure the spoils are shared evenly with employees through increased wages, particularly for those in low-paid work. One of the reasons in-work poverty rates have risen is that there are too many jobs that simply do not pay enough to enable people, particularly those with children, to ensure a minimum standard of living. That can be achieved only by narrowing the growth gap between London and the south-east and the rest of the country. It would take, at the very minimum, a radical rebalancing of government investment in transport, infrastructure and skills away from the richest regions of the country, which already receive more investment per capita, towards the poorest. Brexit has only made this task harder; it is forecast to significantly reduce exports and to increase regional inequalities over the long term. Second, the real-terms cuts to benefits and tax credits of the past decade for low-income families with children must be reversed. In an economy with significant amounts of low-paid work, there will always be a need for government to redistribute income towards low-income parents. Yet successive Conservative chancellors have reduced the value of benefits and tax credits over time, with some families losing the equivalent of thousands of pounds a year from their household budgets, while delivering expensive income tax cuts that have disproportionately benefited more affluent households. This is another key reason why in-work poverty rates have increased and why, in a country as rich as ours, there are people, including those in work, relying on food banks to feed their children. The support that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced to help families with energy bills is too thinly spread, including across households for whom it is not critical, leaving the poorest families horribly exposed. Last, the government needs to implement structural reforms to tackle the high cost of living. The most important of these is housing, the costs of which erode too much of people\u2019s pay cheques in one fell swoop. The UK has never built enough housing without significant public sector investment into social housing; yet social housebuilding levels have dropped dramatically since the 1980s, leaving the social housing stock to dwindle as a result of demolitions and the right to buy. This has pushed more and more people who have little hope of ever buying their own home into an overpriced private rented sector. Britain urgently needs a programme of public investment in housebuilding to create more affordable homes for rent. These are long-term economic reforms that require sustained investment. Even if put in place immediately, they will take time to fully deliver for the economy. Yet this is a government that swings from crisis to crisis, with little willing or capacity to plan for the next decade and a dearth of ideas to address Britain\u2019s very real and structural economic problems. This lackadaisical approach will probably consign us to years more of sluggish growth that drives increasing numbers of families with children into poverty."

            "content": "The wild ride on the US stock markets continued on Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points as investors worried about a looming recession. All of the major US markets fell sharply, with the S&amp;P closing down 4%, its largest fall since June 2020, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq losing 4.7%. On Tuesday markets had rallied following positive news about consumer spending and signs that China was relaxing its strict Covid-19 lockdowns. Just a day later concerns about an economic slowdown triggered a wide-ranging sell-off. The sell-off began after Target said supply chain costs and inflationary pressures had cut into its profits and customers were buying fewer higher-margin items such as kitchen appliances, televisions and furniture. The retailer\u2019s announcement came a day after Walmart said its profit had also been hit by higher costs. The latest news from Target led to a sell-off for retailers including Amazon, BestBuy, Costco and Dollar General. Investors are increasingly concerned that rising inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to tackle it by sharply hiking interest rates, will trigger a recession. The concerns are affecting markets all over the world with the ASX200 in Sydney dropping 1.75% on Thursday in the wake of the Wall Street action. Stocks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul were all braced for losses later in the day. Target\u2019s management expects inflation to add $1bn to its fuel and freight costs this year and sees little sign of those costs easing throughout 2022. Gas prices topped $4 a gallon in every state this week for the first time. \u201cThroughout the quarter, we faced unexpectedly high costs, driven by a number of factors, resulting in profitability that came in well below our expectations, and well below where we expect to operate over time,\u201d said Target\u2019s chief executive, Brian Cornell. The sell-off was broad-based. Tech companies including Apple, Meta and Tesla fell sharply, as did the makers of household goods and grocery stores including Kroger and Procter &amp; Gamble. General Motors and American Airlines fell along with banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Stocks have been struggling to pull out of a slump over the last six weeks as concerns pile up for investors. Trading has been choppy on a daily basis and any data on retailers and consumers is being closely monitored by investors as they try to determine the impact from inflation and whether it will prompt a slowdown in spending. A bigger than expected hit to spending could signal more sluggish economic growth ahead. The Fed is trying to temper the impact from the highest inflation in four decades by raising interest rates. On Tuesday, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, told a Wall Street Journal conference that the US central bank will \u201chave to consider moving more aggressively\u201d if inflation fails to ease after earlier rate hikes. Investors are also concerned about global growth as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine puts even more pressure on prices for oil and food while lockdowns in China to stem Covid-19 cases worsens supply chain problems. The United Nations is significantly lowering its forecast for global economic growth this year from 4% to 3.1%. The downgrade is broad-based, which includes the world\u2019s largest economies such as the US, China and the EU. Associated Press contributed to this story"

            "content": "Global markets fell sharply on Monday as fears over rising inflation and a slowdown in China\u2019s export growth fuelled worries about the health of the world economy. Stocks in Asia-Pacific markets, Europe and the US all dropped into the red as investors fretted that global growth is weakening, at a time when central banks are raising interest rates to rein in surging inflation. In London, the FTSE 100 fell to its lowest level in eight weeks, down 2.32% or 171 points to 7,216 at the close of trading on Monday, with mining companies among the fallers. Japan\u2019s Nikkei had closed down 2.5% earlier on Monday. Stocks slid after China\u2019s export growth hit a near two-year low of 3.9% a year in April, down from 14.7% in March. Imports were flat, as China\u2019s Covid outbreaks cut demand and disrupted manufacturing. Analysts said the slowdown showed that the world\u2019s second largest economy was suffering from the lockdowns in big cities such as Shanghai, which have affected factory production and snarled up logistics chains. \u201cTwo of the biggest concerns are supply chains and the impact of inflation, including higher interest rates. As a result of severe Covid lockdowns, China\u2019s export growth is at a two-year low,\u201d said Mihir Kapadia, the chief executive of Sun Global Investments. \u201cThe supply chain disruptions will in turn impact earnings of companies around the world, and thereby their stocks.\u201d European markets fell to a two-month low, down 2.9% at the close of trading. In New York, the S&amp;P 500 index dropped 3.2% on Wall Street \u2013 its lowest point in a year - after its worst streak of weekly losses in more than a decade. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4.29% as investors once again sold off once-hot tech stocks. Commodities weakened, with copper prices hitting their lowest since mid-December in London at $9,160 (\u00a37,440) a tonne. Aluminium, zinc, nickel, lead and tin prices also dropped, on concerns that China\u2019s restrictions are hitting manufacturing output. Emerging market stocks hit their lowest level since June 2020, as China\u2019s slowing economy added to pressures from rising global interest rates, and the ongoing disruption from the Ukraine war. The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, warned on Saturday that China\u2019s employment situation was \u201ccomplex and grave\u201d, and called on government departments and regions to prioritise measures to support and retain jobs. That reinforced worries that China\u2019s lockdowns are having a serious economic impact. US government bonds were also hit by fresh selling, which drove up the yield, or interest rate, on the 10-year Treasury note to the highest since November 2018. Yields rise when prices fall. The US dollar reached a fresh 20-year high, lifted by expectations of further sharp increases in US interest rates this year to tackle rising inflation, which is running at 8.5%. \u201cThere\u2019s no stopping the mighty US dollar,\u201d said Marios Hadjikyriacos of the brokerage XM. \u201cStress in equity markets, worries about a synchronised global economic slowdown, and the relentless grind higher in US yields continue to drive up demand for the reserve currency.\u201d Risky assets such as cryptocurrencies were also hit. Bitcoin fell to its lowest level since July 2021, dropping below $32,700. It has lost half its value in the last six months."

            "content": "Simon Jenkins largely misses the point in analysing Britain\u2019s housing situation (Michael Gove is right about one thing: building more homes won\u2019t solve anything, 13 May). Yes, it is true that many owners are underoccupying their homes, but he devotes one cursory sentence to our desperately inadequate social housing provision, and none at all to the large and growing private rented sector. For 40-plus years, our governments have persisted in the absurd notion that the market, with a little help from housing associations, would supply our housing needs. The result is that there is a chronic shortage of affordable housing everywhere, particularly for rent. And the private rented sector in the UK, unlike elsewhere, suffers from tenant insecurity, unregulated rents and poor conditions \u2013 while receiving huge benefit subsidies that add nothing to physical provision. In contrast to our widespread owner underoccupation, many UK households, especially renters, suffer overcrowding, and our modern housing has woeful space standards. Market developers will never address the shortage, since they benefit from the inflated prices and margins that it produces. Steve Smart Malvern, Worcestershire \u2022 In his largely sensible article, Simon Jenkins fails to mention the physical inefficiency of much of London\u2019s housing. We live in a lovely Georgian terrace with ideal proportions but thin, jerry-built Victorian walls \u2013 hopeless conservers of heat. The conservation area and listed-building status prevent us from adding the type of stoneware cladding that can retain the attractiveness of the area while making it possible to install heat pumps, for example. Joined-up thinking is lacking, as usual. Ken Baldry London \u2022 Simon Jenkins makes some good points about housing taxation, but it\u2019s not enough to suggest that the countryside of the north is sufficiently alluring to promote social mobility. The best economies, such as Germany, have many city \u201chubs\u201d to ensure both an even spread of population and, more importantly, wealth. If London wishes to retain its position as a leading financial centre, then it must lose everything else. Thus parliament, which is crumbling anyway, must move to Birmingham. Manchester, already a media hub, would gain further investment. Other areas of the economy would be established in different parts of the country. This represents a true version of levelling up, which of course will not even start under this government. Alan Gent Cheadle, Cheshire \u2022 Simon Jenkins is right to point out that the housing crisis is linked to the failure of levelling up, but does not explore how both are related to wider policy failures. One important factor is the shift away from secure employment. In the past, people taking up a job somewhere other than their current home might expect to stay for long enough to put down roots. Now that most jobs are temporary, people increasingly do not move to where they work but commute, an arrangement that reduces their ability to contribute to social and cultural life either where they work or where they live. This phenomenon particularly affects small or medium-sized towns with limited job opportunities. Margaret Dickinson London \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2022-05-30T17:30:04Z",
            "content": "Winter has come. And with it, the A-Leagues\u2019 season has come to a close. Western United\u2019s 2-0 victory over Melbourne City in Saturday\u2019s grand final provided the final chapter for the 2021-22 campaign as John Aloisi\u2019s side won a championship in just their third season, going a long way towards establishing them as a true player in Melbourne\u2019s ALM scene. It was a significant upset \u2013 a buoyant Aloisi observed post-game that oddsmakers had lost \u201ca shitload\u201d on the result \u2013 and provided a suitably unforeseen ending to a season that started off with so much anticipation and promise but rapidly descended into a desperate fight to keep above water. Between Covid and wild weather, the league was forced to reschedule 113 of its 226 fixtures, serving as an unwitting beta-tester for sporting competitions thrust into an environment in which the Omicron variant irrevocably destroyed the bubble that had previously surrounded dressing rooms. In the face of the subsequent fixture crunch, prevailing trends of pragmatism were magnified. Off the pitch, with broader trends across Australian sport already showing a downturn in attendances, all but the most loyal fans appeared to give up on the process of trying to keep up. It should come as no surprise that one of the priorities of league administrators, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL), this offseason is the early delivery of a fixture list they hope will not change. Against this backdrop, the self-inflicted wounds and growing pains that came with a new broadcaster in Channel 10/Paramount became magnified. Improvements on that front have been promised by the APL, who have no actual control over the platforms, but the presence of adverts during play, even in Saturday\u2019s grand final, does not augur well. Ultimately, as the dust settles, it is apparent that for all the APL\u2019s grandiose plans for their first full season in charge, they were quickly cast aside as a series of calamities befell the leagues. As conversations at APL Towers turned from aspirational to existential, first, second and third priorities shifted towards simply ensuring that full ALM and ALW seasons could be delivered. Stabilise the patient, and then get to the underlying issue. Effectively, this is what makes predicting the trajectory of the ALM moving forward so difficult. Clearly, things have not been good enough. The need to attract more eyeballs to the game and increase the number of bums on seats is undeniable and there is an urgent need to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the loyal fans who have become increasingly jaded. There is also the matter of improving the on-field action, ostensibly the object from which everything else flows. Unfortunately, the very nature of that means it cannot be regulated or legislated by external forces. But no analysis of the APL\u2019s first year can fail to acknowledge the cataclysmic effect of Covid. The pandemic, in effect, provides the ultimate get out of jail free card. Even if one had no faith in the APL\u2019s ability to improve the situation moving forward, a chance to work without the spectre of Covid hanging overhead needs to be provided; a genuine opportunity for them to deliver on the promises that accompanied their ascension to power. And there are bright sparks there that can be built upon. There are heroes, highly entertaining games and exciting young talent. Perhaps that\u2019s what makes United such fitting champions. Like the APL, they are an entity that has promised the world but delivered much less. The club\u2019s still unrequited promise of a privately owned and operated stadium in Tarneit continues to serve as a millstone around their neck and for all the positive stories that can be drawn from their exploits, they cannot be what they are supposed to be without it. Australia has one of the longest off-seasons in the world, but the modern football ecosystem is one of constant activity, making it difficult to savour and reflect on what has come before. As meritorious and worthy of celebration as United\u2019s title win was, it will quickly give way to further speculation surrounding their home. More broadly, the post-season will be dominated by talk of high-profile sugar hits, the desperate need to professionalise A-League Women, the re-establishment of a youth league and much more. And if the APL (and Football Australia) is taking requests, a roadmap to greater connections to the rest of the game wouldn\u2019t hurt. The 2022-23 season looms as critical for the APL. It has to get it right. But much like champions, the basis for success will be formed during the off-season."

            "date": "2022-05-20T23:01:03Z",
            "content": "Pharmacists will be allowed to offer alternative hormone replacement therapy products if the original prescription is out of stock, under new rules aimed at tackling the ongoing shortage. The relaxing of normal prescribing rules, announced by the government\u2019s HRT supply taskforce, comes amid shortages of HRT products that have left some women travelling across the country to access medicines. It follows calls, highlighted by the Guardian, by pharmacists to be allowed to dispense substitute versions of medicines without having to contact the prescriber \u2013 normally a GP \u2013 for permission each time. Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, said: \u201cWe are working to ensure HRT is available for everyone who needs it and I am pleased to see suppliers continuing to increase the supply of some products which is a testament to the collaborative approach being taken.\u201d \u201cMeetings with suppliers are ongoing and we\u2019re taking decisive action to manage HRT supply issues and reduce any delays \u2013 this includes issuing further SSPs so that women are able to access the medication they need.\u201d Under the Serious Shortage Protocols (SSPs) announced by Javid, pharmacists will be able to offer patients another product to relieve their symptoms if their normal HRT is out of stock. At the end of April, the government issued three SSPs to restrict dispensing for Oestrogel, Ovestin and Premique Low Dose to three months\u2019 supply to help relieve pressure in the system. The two new further SSPs are for Lenzetto transdermal spray and Sandrena gel, which will also be put on a three-month supply. Under the rules, all these items can generally be substituted for transdermal patches. Prof Claire Anderson, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, welcomed the news, saying that the short term measure would help women access supplies of HRT medicines which are difficult to get hold of. \u201cThe advice on which HRT product to substitute with another has been drawn up by experts and women can be confident they will receive what\u2019s appropriate for them,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen should talk to their pharmacist if they have any concerns about their HRT medicines.\u201d However, she added that the bureaucracy involved in completing the SSP process for each patient is \u201cquite burdensome\u201d and said that it would still be essential to resolve the underlying HRT shortage as soon as possible. \u201cUltimately we\u2019d like to see a change in the law which makes the whole process easier and quicker for both pharmacists and patients,\u201d she added. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, welcomed the move: \u201cThis is really sensible. Pharmacists generally know their drugs. They often make those switches in other areas where the laws allow it. They should be allowed to do this for HRT and it will save a lot of bother for women.\u201d There have been acute shortages of some HRT products, which are used by about 1 million women in the UK to treat symptoms of the menopause. The number of HRT products prescribed in England has more doubled in the last five years, contributing to stocks running low, while manufacturers have also reported supply problems. Thousands of menopausal women have struggled to access medication, which has led to some resorting to buying medicines online or even sharing medication with friends. In the new announcement, the government said there had been recent further deliveries of the popular products Oestrogel, Ovestin and Premique Low Dose. Premique now has good availability, it said, while the manufacturers of Oestrogel and Ovestin are working to increase UK supply. Head of the HRT supply taskforce, Madelaine McTernan, said: \u201cI am very encouraged by the constructive engagement across the sector and enthusiasm with which suppliers and pharmacists are looking to work with us to meet this challenge. \u201cFocusing both on measures that ensure we can use stocks most efficiently whilst also ensuring supply is increased is critical.\u201d"

Johnson and his ilk created the conditions from which low productivity, increasing inequality, and inflation have emerged. Further, there are plausible arguments that the global capitalist system is a good breeding ground for international pandemics, xenophobic nationalism and economic and military imperialism. The domestic contribution to inflation has the same ideological roots. Because the private sector is seen as omniscient, quantitative easing meant that the state created fiat money, but allowed the financial sector to allocate it. The financial sector did, but not to the growth of productivity. Their best profits lay in subsidising asset prices, notably housing; and what do you expect from static productivity and loose cash? Couldn\u2019t be inflation, could it? Underlying all this is the old lie: that the sum of self-interested economic decisions is the common good. Johnson et al are not the victims of circumstances. They are apologists for and advocates of the global economic systems that are now wreaking widespread havoc. Chickens may be coming home to roost, but they\u2019re not going to the right address.

            "content": "Consumers in Great Britain carried on spending last month despite the highest inflation rate in 40 years, providing high street and online retailers with a surprise boost. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there was a 1.4% monthly jump in retail sales in April but said the trend was still weak and that part of the increase might be down to people staying in to save money. Heather Bovill, the ONS deputy director for surveys and economic indicators, said: \u201cApril\u2019s rise was driven by an increase in supermarket sales, led by alcohol and tobacco and sweet treats, with off-licences also reporting a boost, possibly due to people staying in more to save money. \u201cClothing sales had a strong month, especially online, with some retailers suggesting consumers were purchasing clothes for summer holidays and weddings.\u201d Over the three months to April \u2013 considered a better guide to the underlying trend than one month\u2019s data \u2013 retail sales fell by 0.3% on the previous quarter. The ONS said the trend had been down since last summer. Even so, the rise in spending came as a surprise to the City, which had expected the arrival of higher national insurance contributions and the new energy price cap to lead to consumer belt-tightening last month. The consensus among economists was for a 0.2% drop in retail sales. Earlier this week, the ONS reported the annual inflation rate jumped from 7% to 9% in April, while the latest snapshot of consumer confidence from GfK showed the mood at its gloomiest since its records began in 1974. David Baker, the chief investment officer at the auditing and accounting firm Mazars, said: \u201cApril\u2019s retail sales figures beat expectations by some distance and reverse a recent trend of falling sales. \u201cThe reading contradicts recent consumer confidence data and suggests that near full employment and the ability of consumers to tap into savings accrued during the pandemic may be preventing shoppers becoming overly cautious despite the cost of living challenges associated with high levels of inflation.\u201d Nicholas Farr, an economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe unexpectedly strong 1.4% month-on-month rise in retail sales in April suggests that the cost of living crisis hasn\u2019t caused consumer spending to collapse and means that the economy may have a little more momentum than we thought.\u201d The ONS said the volume of retail sales in the latest three months was just over 4% higher than before the coronavirus pandemic first affected the UK economy in early 2020. Over that period, the percentage of sales online has increased from 19.9% to 27%."

            "content": "Unemployment rising. Inflation above 10%. Energy prices soaring. Living standards squeezed. The message from the Bank of England was crystal clear: the 1970s are back. The word stagflation was not to be found in the 100-plus pages of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy report. Yet a period of weak growth and rapidly rising prices is precisely what the Bank says is in store for the UK. The current post-lockdown bounce will be short-lived and, in a real blast from the past, the economy will be driven into recession to bring inflation under control. Nor is the pain likely to be over quickly. The economy is expected to contract by 0.25% in 2023 and remain weak in the next two years. Unless things take a marked turn for the better, the next general election will take place against a backdrop of weak growth and lengthening dole queues. Just as in the 1970s, the Bank says external factors are mainly to blame. In 1973, it was the Yom Kippur war that led to 25% inflation by mid-1975. This time it is the war in Ukraine. The Bank is pencilling in another 40% increase in the energy price cap in October, taking the average annual household bill to \u00a32,800. There may be arguments about whether the UK is technically heading for recession because the Bank is not forecasting two consecutive quarters of falling output \u2013 but it will certainly feel like it. Living standards are about to take their biggest hit in decades. In another echo of yesteryear, sterling took a dive on the currency markets after the Bank\u2019s interest-rate decision. Six months ago, the Bank thought inflation would peak at 5%. It now believes it will top out at just over 10%, easily the highest level since Threadneedle Street was granted operational independence 25 years ago. The Bank says there is little it can do to prevent the harm to household budgets and company profit margins caused by rising global energy profits, and that its task is to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target while minimising the damage to the economy. Confronted with the dilemma of whether to worry more about the risk of recession, or of inflation becoming embedded, the Bank has opted for a middle course, raising interest rates by a quarter point to 1% \u2013 their highest level since early 2009. But the vote was not unanimous: three of the nine members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) wanted a half-point increase. Having been too optimistic about the economy in the past, the Bank may now be too gloomy. There are two reasons for that. The first is that Threadneedle Street\u2019s forecasts are based on what the financial markets think will happen to interest rates \u2013 and given the prospect of prolonged stagnation, the current City belief that borrowing costs will peak at 2.5% looks much too high. The Bank says it would result in inflation falling to 1.3% \u2013 well below its target \u2013 in three years\u2019 time. Two MPC members think it is possible no further tightening will be needed. The second reason is that it is hard to envisage the government watching the economy slide into recession without doing something to alleviate the pain. The Bank has upped the pressure on Rishi Sunak to act \u2013 and act big."

            "date": "2022-05-24T12:08:06Z",
            "content": "The owner of Wagamama, Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s and Chiquito expects food and drink inflation to reach as much as 10% this year, double the rate predicted just two months ago, as the war in Ukraine disrupts supply chains. The Restaurant Group, which operates about 400 outlets, said it was working with its supply chain to offset the cost rises but warned \u201cthis remains a volatile inflationary market\u201d. The latest warning on costs came after TRG said in March that the soaring cost of gas and electricity would add \u00a36m-\u00a37m to its expenses this year. The company also flagged rising wage costs as the economy nears full employment with well over 1m vacancies in the UK. One beneficiary of higher wages was Andy Hornby, the group\u2019s chief executive, who was paid \u00a31.2m, up from \u00a3518,000 a year before, as he collected his first annual bonus after more than two years in charge. The pay rise was criticised by the Institutional Voting Information Service, as it came in a year that TRG collected \u00a310.9m in government grants and \u201csignificant\u201d furlough payments, according to the group\u2019s annual report. Almost a third of TRG\u2019s voting shareholders registered their disquiet about executive pay with votes against the group\u2019s remuneration report at the annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. The update from TRG highlights the scale of inflation confronting businesses and consumers as it emerged a standoff between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak was delaying measures to help people through the cost of living crisis. Brands such as bakery chain Greggs and bootmaker Dr Martens have said prices are on the up because of the rising cost of raw materials, energy and labour. Despite the blows from higher costs, TRG said it continued to expect to meet full-year profit forecasts, as \u201crobust\u201d trading in its Wagamama restaurants and pubs and a better than expected recovery in its train station and airport outlets offset the higher than anticipated inflation. Sales at established Wagamama outlets rose 11% in the six weeks to 15 May and 6% at pubs, although this marked a slowdown from the previous three months as prices rose to reflect a return to 20% VAT compared with a special pandemic rate of 12.5% before 1 April. Underlying sales at the group\u2019s travel concessions slid 11% in the six weeks, but this was an improvement on a 26% decline in the previous three months. The company, which permanently closed about 200 restaurants during the pandemic, said it planned at least eight new Wagamama restaurants this year and three specialist delivery kitchens as well as three new pubs. \u201cThe continued strength of trading of these businesses has reinforced our belief in their long-term rollout potential,\u201d the company said in a statement."

            "date": "2022-05-23T08:31:05Z",
            "content": "B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher has said it is managing inflationary pressures amid \u201cresilient demand\u201d for DIY despite the cost of living crisis in the UK and other markets. The retailer, whose other UK brand is the hardware trade supplier Screwfix, said sales had remained at elevated levels seen during the coronavirus pandemic, and that it was confident enough about its outlook to launch a \u00a3300m share buyback. During the first coronavirus lockdowns Kingfisher\u2019s sales soared as customers were mainly stuck at home but DIY stores were permitted to stay open to allow people to carry out essential maintenance. In a trading update on Monday, Thierry Garnier, the Kingfisher chief executive, said the company had retained a \u201csignificant proportion of the increased sales during the pandemic\u201d. Like-for-like sales in the February to April quarter were 16% above the same period in 2019 at \u00a33.2bn, although they dropped back by 5.8% overall compared with the boom in 2021. UK and Ireland sales were down by 14% compared with the year before, but were up nearly 17% on 2019, with kitchen, bathroom and storage products among the bestsellers at B&amp;Q. Kingfisher\u2019s share price gained 2.8% on Monday morning, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100. The company expects DIY demand to be resilient in the coming months despite the expectation that consumer spending will drop as household budgets are squeezed by inflation, particularly in energy prices which have soared in part because of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Garnier has previously argued that \u201chome improvement is not a bad place to be in a crisis\u201d. Kingfisher said it was \u201cmindful of the heightened macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty that has emerged since the start of the year\u201d, but added that it will look to increase its market share. It left profit guidance unchanged at \u00a3770m for the full financial year. One of the big challenges across B&amp;Q and Screwfix since the pandemic has been managing the disruption to supply chains and related increases in costs. The company argues that its scale means it has a strong negotiating position with suppliers, and it also allows it to offer lower prices in its own-brand ranges. Garnier said: \u201cWe continue to effectively manage inflationary and supply chain pressures. As a result, our product availability is now very close to \u2018normal\u2019 levels across all our banners, and we continue to deliver value for our customers through our own exclusive brands and competitive prices.\u201d Kingfisher recently raised the wages of its lowest-paid staff at B&amp;Q and Screwfix by 6.5% and 5.4% respectively."

            "content": "Boris Johnson has said the UK is \u201cnot necessarily\u201d heading for a recession after his chancellor announced a \u00a315bn package to help people deal with rising energy bills and inflation. Despite experts warning of trouble ahead for the economy and the government bringing in emergency measures to help out struggling households, the prime minister sounded an upbeat note about Britain\u2019s financial prospects in an interview with Bloomberg TV. \u201cThere are ways forward for the UK that are incredibly exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we make sure that we have a proactive approach to talent from abroad \u2013 we want to control immigration but allow the talent that we need to come in \u2013 we fix our energy supply issues, we fix the issues in the UK labour market. \u201cOne of the incredible things about the economy right now is that unemployment is at its lowest level since I was two years old.\u201d He acknowledged there would be a \u201cdifficult period\u201d ahead but said he was confident energy prices would start coming down. Asked if the UK was heading for a recession, he answered: \u201cNot necessarily at all.\u201d Johnson\u2019s economic optimism has been wrong in the past when he gave an interview last year saying inflation fears were \u201cunfounded\u201d. It has since hit 9% and there are worries it could be in double digits by the end of the year. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, launched a package of measures on Thursday designed to tackle soaring fuel bills amid the cost of living crisis, but the measures have proved controversial with Conservatives MPs who would rather have seen tax cuts. Speaking in a round of broadcast interviews on Friday, Sunak said he remained a \u201cfiscal conservative\u201d. He also did not rule out further emergency relief next year. The package of relief was more ambitious than predicted but Sunak was quick to insist he had not changed his politics. \u201cFirst and foremost, I\u2019m a fiscal conservative; I believe it\u2019s incredibly important that I manage the country\u2019s finances responsibly,\u201d he said on Friday morning. \u201cThat means, after suffering the shock we did, to get our borrowing and debt levels back on a sustainable trajectory.\u201d Asked if he would be prepared to introduce a further emergency package in future, with fresh borrowing and taxes, he said: \u201cPeople can judge me by how I\u2019ve acted over the last couple of years. \u201cI\u2019ve always been prepared to respond to the situation on the ground, what\u2019s happening to the economy, what families are experiencing and making sure we\u2019ve got policies in place to support them through that. \u201cIn terms of \u2018Is it one-off, what\u2019s happening next year?\u2019, I\u2019d go back to what I said earlier. I do want people to be reassured and confident that we will get through this. We will be able to combat and reduce inflation, we have the tools at our disposal and after time it will come down.\u201d Commenting on the fact that every household across the UK would receive a \u00a3400 grant to help cope with the rapidly rising energy costs, including wealthy individuals such as himself, the chancellor said he would be donating his to charity and encouraged others who did not need it to do the same. He told Sky News: \u201cI am sure, like me, you can also give that money to charity if you don\u2019t need it.\u201d He said second homes would account for only 1-2% of payments, adding that he had not wanted to use council tax to give the money to households because of the risk that it penalised families in larger homes who were cash poor. Sunak denied the shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 suggestion that he had implemented a Labour policy, telling BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\u201d Labour proposed a windfall tax on energy companies five months ago. He also denied the package was brought forward to generate positive headlines after Sue Gray\u2019s report exposed a culture of \u201cbacchanalian\u201d parties in Downing Street. Despite a turbulent few weeks, where he has been fined for breaching Covid rules and his family\u2019s finances have come under scrutiny, Sunak said he was not planning to resign. He told the BBC: \u201cNo. I am fully committed to helping get the country through what are some challenging months ahead and build a brighter future for the people that I\u2019m very privileged to represent. \u201cAnd, as you saw yesterday, I have the same energy and verve I\u2019ve always had for this job and I\u2019ll keep at it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-12T06:40:01Z",
            "content": "Pressure is mounting on the government to deliver an emergency summer mini-budget after recession fears were heightened by a surprise contraction in the economy in March. Evidence that the cost of living crisis was biting even before the arrival last month of dearer energy bills and higher taxes led to a sharp selloff in shares and a drop in the pound\u2019s value to a two-year low against the US dollar. The Labour party, the TUC and the British Chambers of Commerce all pressed for urgent action from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, following the release of official figures showing a marked drop in consumer spending in March. Boris Johnson pledged that the government would \u201cdo things\u201d in the short term to ease the squeeze on living standards without providing any hint about what the measures might be. His pledge came amid growing speculation that the economy would fall into recession \u2013 two successive quarters of negative growth \u2013 over the coming months. According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK economy contracted by 0.1% in March after flatlining in February. Services, which account for about 80% of gross domestic product, contracted by 0.2%, with retail sales down by 1.4% and spending on cars collapsing by more than 15%. Production, which includes manufacturing, also fell by 0.2%, while construction bounced back by 1.7% after the disruption caused by Storm Eunice in February. The economy grew by 0.8% in the first three months of 2022, but only because activity rebounded strongly in January after the lifting of restrictions imposed in late 2021 to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity International, said: \u201cAny momentum the UK economy had as it emerged from the pandemic appears to be ebbing away. Numbers can be revised but it\u2019s clear the UK faces a serious fight to avoid recession this year.\u201d Paul Dales, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cIt now seems likely that GDP will contract in the second quarter. And with the full hit of the cost of living crisis yet to be felt, the chances of a recession have just risen. Even so, with price pressures still strengthening, the Bank of England may have no choice but to add to the woes of households by raising interest rates further.\u201d Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, said the figures for gross domestic product would increase the public\u2019s worries and urged the chancellor to produce an emergency mini-budget, a call echoed by the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cAnything less than coming back urgently with an emergency budget to help ease the pressure from the cost of living crisis is a failure by this Conservative government,\u201d Reeves said. Responding to the weaker-than-expected growth figures, Sunak said: \u201cThe UK economy recovered quickly from the worst of the pandemic and our growth in the first few months of the year was strong, faster than the US, Germany and Italy, but I know these are still anxious times. \u201cOur recovery is being disrupted by Putin\u2019s barbaric invasion of Ukraine and other global challenges but we are continuing to help people where we can.\u201d In the City, the FTSE 100 index closed 114 points lower at 7,233 \u2013 a drop of more than 1.5% \u2013 while the pound at one stage dropped below $1.22 against the US dollar and was trading at levels last seen during the early months of the pandemic. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: \u201cThe economy barely kept its head above the water during a volatile start to the year, but times look set to get that bit tougher. \u201cCost pressures and rising prices have tightened their grip, with both businesses and households feeling the pinch. The end result is a weaker economic outlook.\u201d Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cThe UK economy grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and is now clearly above pre-pandemic levels, although growth in the latest three months was the lowest for a year.\u201d"

            "content": "The wild ride on the US stock markets continued on Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points as investors worried about a looming recession. All of the major US markets fell sharply, with the S&amp;P closing down 4%, its largest fall since June 2020, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq losing 4.7%. On Tuesday markets had rallied following positive news about consumer spending and signs that China was relaxing its strict Covid-19 lockdowns. Just a day later concerns about an economic slowdown triggered a wide-ranging sell-off. The sell-off began after Target said supply chain costs and inflationary pressures had cut into its profits and customers were buying fewer higher-margin items such as kitchen appliances, televisions and furniture. The retailer\u2019s announcement came a day after Walmart said its profit had also been hit by higher costs. The latest news from Target led to a sell-off for retailers including Amazon, BestBuy, Costco and Dollar General. Investors are increasingly concerned that rising inflation, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to tackle it by sharply hiking interest rates, will trigger a recession. The concerns are affecting markets all over the world with the ASX200 in Sydney dropping 1.75% on Thursday in the wake of the Wall Street action. Stocks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul were all braced for losses later in the day. Target\u2019s management expects inflation to add $1bn to its fuel and freight costs this year and sees little sign of those costs easing throughout 2022. Gas prices topped $4 a gallon in every state this week for the first time. \u201cThroughout the quarter, we faced unexpectedly high costs, driven by a number of factors, resulting in profitability that came in well below our expectations, and well below where we expect to operate over time,\u201d said Target\u2019s chief executive, Brian Cornell. The sell-off was broad-based. Tech companies including Apple, Meta and Tesla fell sharply, as did the makers of household goods and grocery stores including Kroger and Procter &amp; Gamble. General Motors and American Airlines fell along with banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Stocks have been struggling to pull out of a slump over the last six weeks as concerns pile up for investors. Trading has been choppy on a daily basis and any data on retailers and consumers is being closely monitored by investors as they try to determine the impact from inflation and whether it will prompt a slowdown in spending. A bigger than expected hit to spending could signal more sluggish economic growth ahead. The Fed is trying to temper the impact from the highest inflation in four decades by raising interest rates. On Tuesday, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, told a Wall Street Journal conference that the US central bank will \u201chave to consider moving more aggressively\u201d if inflation fails to ease after earlier rate hikes. Investors are also concerned about global growth as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine puts even more pressure on prices for oil and food while lockdowns in China to stem Covid-19 cases worsens supply chain problems. The United Nations is significantly lowering its forecast for global economic growth this year from 4% to 3.1%. The downgrade is broad-based, which includes the world\u2019s largest economies such as the US, China and the EU. Associated Press contributed to this story"

GW Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders is worried that inflation could be even higher than the Bank\u2019s latest forecasts. Last week, the Bank predicted the inflation could hit 10% before the end of the year, the highest level since 1982, as it lifted interest rates by a quarter-point to 1%. But in a speech this afternoon, Saunders warned that the cost of living squeeze on British households from high inflation could be bigger and last for longer than expected. That\u2019s why he was one of three policymakers to vote for a half-point rise, he explains. Here are the key points from Saunders\u2019 speech, at a Resolution Foundation event. Inflation, and key measures of longer-term inflation expectations, are uncomfortably high. Alongside large gains in prices of energy and consumer goods, domestic inflation pressures have been rising in recent quarters, evident in trends in capacity strains, longer-term inflation expectations, underlying pay growth and services inflation. The strength of external costs is eroding real incomes and is likely to cap real spending. But, by creating a long period of above-target inflation, these external cost increases also may exacerbate the rise in inflation expectations and hence, with the tight labour market, could make it harder to ensure domestic inflation pressures return to a target-consistent pace. Against this backdrop, the MPC has recently raised rates by nearly 100bp. At our most recent policy meeting, most MPC members (including myself) judged that, based on our updated assessment of the economic outlook, some degree of further tightening in monetary policy may still be appropriate in the coming months. I put considerable weight on risks that, unless checked by monetary policy, domestic capacity and inflation pressures would probably be greater and more persistent than the central forecast in the recent Monetary Policy Report. As a result, my preference has been to move relatively quickly to a more neutral monetary policy stance. Wall Street has joined the selloff, with the S&amp;P 500 index opening 1.7% lower and the Nasdaq Composite down 2%. Here\u2019s Robin Brooks, chief economist at the IIF, on the rising recession risks: Over in Mexico, inflation has hit a 21-year high. Consumer prices climbed by 7.68% in the year to April, the fastest since 2001, amid the global cost of living squeeze. China\u2019s covid-19 lockdowns, rising inflation and the war in Ukraine are all driving recession fears, says Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments. Two of the biggest concerns are supply chains and the impact of inflation including higher interest rates. As a result of severe Covid lockdowns, China\u2019s export growth is at a two-year low. Year-on-year export figures slowed to 3.9%, while imports remained on par. The supply chain disruptions will in turn impact earnings of companies around the world, and thereby their stocks. Rising inflation is also leading to sharply higher interest rates and higher bond yields and this is undermining asset prices leading to falls in stocks, bonds and alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. With consumer inflation at an all-time high, along with rising energy prices, the cost of living crisis threatens to spill over into a larger recession in Europe and the US.\u201d Worries about higher interest rates are also hitting stocks, according to Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at bond giant PIMCO. Ivascyn warned (via Reuters) that central banks such as the US Federal Reserve are determined to bring down inflation by tightening policy. \u201cWe see recession risk over the next 12 to 18 months to be as high as about 30%. \u201cOne of the key reasons for that is the Fed and other central banks appear dead set on getting inflation under control.\u201d AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says worries about Russia are also pushing markets down: \u201cThe continuing impact of Beijing\u2019s zero-Covid policy in China and concerns about the Fed\u2019s next moves are helping to pile the pressure on markets. \u201cThe impact of Chinese restrictions was reflected in export growth hitting two-year lows in April \u2013 in effect back where we were near the start of the pandemic. \u201cAnd investors are getting an unnerving reminder of the current geopolitical risks as Russian President Vladimir Putin leads anniversary celebrations in Moscow to mark the Soviet victory against the Nazis in the Second World War. \u201cThis show of strength, as Russia displays its military arsenal, belies the weakness of the country\u2019s position; isolated and stuck in a grinding conflict in Ukraine. However, it certainly sharpens focus on the wider threat the nuclear power can still pose. Airline passengers are continuing to suffer disruption today. Travellers at Manchester and Birmingham Airport have both reporting huge queues due to delays at security, leading some to miss their flights, as airports struggle to cope with increased demand. One passenger, Bob Black, tweeted that there were thousands queuing to get through security at Birmingham: At Manchester Airport, traveller Ryan Hoey reported that the security queue stretched outside the Terminal building there too. Airports have blamed several factors, including the time it takes for new ground staff to pass security clearance, staff sickness, a lack of Border Force officials and the spike in demand for travel following the end of the UK\u2019s coronavirus restrictions. After a volatile morning, European stock markets are all deep in the red. The Stoxx 600 is down around 2%, with losses in London (where the FTSE 100 is down 1.8%), Frankfurt (-1.85%) and Paris (-2.2%). Marios Hadjikyriacos of XM says: The shellacking in equity markets shows no signs of abating, with the combined forces of rising interest rates, slowing global growth, and a furious race to cut leverage wreaking havoc on Wall Street. The tech-loaded Nasdaq lost 1.4% on Friday and futures point to another round of pain when the market reopens today. China remains committed to its zero-covid strategy despite growing signs that the economy is starting to crack. Authorities in Shanghai tightened lockdown rules again over the weekend, fueling worries around slower domestic growth and persistent global inflation as supply chains remain under strain. Bitcoin has now hit its lowest level since July 2021, as traders ditch riskier assets. Bitcoin has extended its earlier losses to hit the $32,700 mark for the first time in nearly 10 months. Darshan Bathija, chief executive of Singapore-based crypto exchange Vauld, said (via Bloomberg): \u201cIn light of fears of rising inflation, most investors have taken a risk-off approach -- selling stocks and cryptos alike in order to cut down risk.\u201d The oil price has dropped too, on concerns that demand will be hit by China\u2019s lockdowns. Brent crude has fallen 2% to $110 per barrel, as economic worries trump the G7\u2019s pledge to phase out imports of Russian oil. Cryptocurrencies are also being hit by the selloff. Bitcoin has dropped by 8% today to its lowest level since late January, at around $33,300 -- around half its value six months ago. Saxo\u2019s Strategy Team say: The week is off to a rocky start as risk aversion continues to hang over global markets after a rally attempt Friday in the US barely managed to avoid new lows for the cycle in the S&amp;P 500. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index did slip to new lows, however, and is well into bear market territory, down some 25% from the top last November. US dollar strength continues to suggest general liquidity conditions are poor, and risk-sensitive Bitcoin trades near the lows for the year. The selloff is gathering more pace, with the FTSE 100 now down 1.4% at a new seven-week low of 7282 points, down 105 points this session. Mining companies are still among the fallers, such as Glencore (-5.5%) and Rio Tinto (-4.3%) with growth worries also hitting packaging firm DS Smith, and chemicals group Croda. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says a \u2018bearish sentiment\u2019 is hitting stocks, with China\u2019s export slowdown (see opening post) adding to the anxiety. Asian markets were softer overnight on some weak Chinese data and the broad failure last week to survive the Fed\u2019s rate hike. China export growth slowed to 3.9% in April from a year earlier, compared with the 14.7% a year before. Lockdowns and the bottleneck at ports means this is probably going to worsen, too. Chinese PPI inflation data this week should be watched closely as a leading indicator for global consumer inflation. EasyJet plans to remove seats in some of its planes this summer as part of a strategy to cut the number of staff it needs. Employers across the economy have complained of difficulty recruiting staff at the salaries they are willing to pay, and airlines are struggling to meet the increased demand as international travel restarts in earnest after Covid-19 lockdowns. Airlines are required by law to provide one member of cabin crew for every 50 seats. By removing the final row of six seats on its smallest plane, the A319, easyJet will cut the number of passengers it can carry from 156 to 150, therefore limiting its requirement to three rather than four cabin crew. Emerging market stocks have dropped to their lowest in 22 months, hit by the strong dollar and fears of a global slowdown. China\u2019s yuan has dropped to a near 19-month low against the US dollar today. April\u2019s slowdown in export growth has reinforced concerns that China\u2019s Covid-19 lockdowns across the country are taking a toll on economy. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says the markets have woken up with quite the hangover: Chinese trade data saw softness in both imports and exports, which isn\u2019t very surprising under the circumstances but didn\u2019t help risk sentiment at the start of the week. Nor did further Covid restrictions. The yuan and equity indices fell, and as US Treasury yields continue to edge higher, the bears took charge. Back in the markets, the US dollar has hit a 20-year high against rival currencies. China\u2019s Covid lockdowns, accelerating global inflation and the worsening economic outlook have all boosted demand for the US currency as a haven, as Bloomberg explains here. Higher interest rate rises are also lifting the dollar, with the Federal Reserve committed to a series of half-point rates hikes in coming months (on top of last Wednesday\u2019s 50bp hike). Investor morale in the euro zone has tumbled to its lowest level since June 2020 as the Ukraine war pushes Europe towards a recession. The Sentix index of investor confidence fell to a near two-year low in May, the third monthly drop in a row, The index dropped to -22.6 in May from -18.0 in April, weaker than expected. Investors were gloomier about the current economic situation, and the economic outlook. Sentix managing director Manfred Huebner warned that: The global economy is facing a \u201cperfect storm\u201d. The report warns that \u201cThe recession is becoming visible\u201d in the euro area, as the Ukraine conflict and the sanctions on Russia hit the economy. Huebner explains: The sanctions against Russia are having an effect, on enemies and friends alike. Last month, the \u201cfirst mover\u201d economic index clearly pointed the way towards recession. At the beginning of May, the downturn deepened further. Europe is hit particularly hard. The overall Eurozone index drops to -22.6 points. And for Germany we report an alltime low in economic expectations. In other words: it\u2019s coming thick and fast. Morrisons has reportedly beaten the owners of Asda in the race to buy McColl\u2019s, the struggling convenience store chain that is expected to be put into administration as soon as Monday morning. The bid from Morrisons is due to be announced as the preferred bidder for McColl\u2019s, despite an improved offer from EG Group, owned by the Issa Brothers, according to Sky News. McColl\u2019s is to be sold via a pre-pack administration, after the Scotland-based retailer\u2019s lenders declined a request to restructure its debt. That sparked a bid battle for the London-listed company, which employs 16,000 people across 1,100 shops in the UK. Morrisons, Britain\u2019s fourth biggest grocer, already has a supply agreement with McColl\u2019s, to which it provides a range of products under the Safeway brand. Morrisons was bought out by the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice last year. Sky News are reporting that Morrisons has won the battle to seize control of convenience store chain McColl\u2019s, beating petrol forecourts operator EG Group. Morrisons tabled a last-gasp counterbid for McColl\u2019s Retail Group over the weekend. McColl\u2019s announced on Friday that it would call in administrators after rescue talks failed, putting the future of its 1,100 shops and 16,000 staff into doubt. PA Media has more details: Forecourt giant EG - whose owners also run supermarket giant Asda - had been favourites to complete a rescue deal for McColl\u2019s. However, it is understood that both EG and Morrisons both tabled late improved offers prior to the administrators\u2019 Sunday 6pm deadline for offers. It is understood that EG has bowed to pressure to look after McColl\u2019s pension liabilities, in a move that means that its 2,000 members will avoid a cut of up to 20% to their promised pensions over their lifetimes. Trustees for the McColl\u2019s pension schemes have called on the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng to do whatever he can to ensure pension scheme members are well protected. Morrisons\u2019 early approaches had reportedly been rejected by lenders who preferred EG\u2019s offer to instantly repay more than 160 million in debts from McColl\u2019s. It is believed that Morrisons has now said it will also repay the lenders in cash. UK stock have fallen further into the red, as anxiety over the economic outlook rise. The FTSE 100 has touched its lowest level since mid-March, down 55 points or 0.75% at 7,333 points. Technology investor Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust is the top faller, down 4.5%, as US tech stock continue to be hammered by the prospect of higher interest rates. Property website Rightmove are down 4% after announcing its chief executive officer, Peter Brooks-Johnson, is stepping down. Mining stocks are under pressures, with China\u2019s export slowdown threatening demand for commodities. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: All the major European bourses are under pressure with the FTSE 100 trading below 7,400, driven by weakness in the miners with stocks like Anglo American, Rio Tinto and Fresnillo trading at the bottom of the basket following China\u2019s softer trade data. China\u2019s trade sector accounts for around a third of GDP with the slowdown in exports pointing to a deceleration of international demand with sharp declines from the EU and US as inflation and the cost-of-living take their toll. Meanwhile domestically, China is dealing with the fallout from lockdowns, with factory activity and supply chains under pressure as Beijing pursues its draconian zero covid tolerance mission at the expense of its own economy. Metal prices have dropped, as the drop in China\u2019s export growth raised worries about future demand. Reuters has the details: Benchmark three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was down 1.8% at $9,250 a tonne, its lowest since December 15. LME aluminium slipped 1.3% to $2,804 a tonne, its lowest since January 4. The most-active June copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange ended daytime trading down 1% at 71,440 yuan ($10,633.17), after dropping to its lowest since March 16. Wall Street is on track for fresh losses, with the S&amp;P 500 index down 1% in the futures market: European countries should consider seizing Russia\u2019s frozen foreign exchange reserves to help fund the cost of rebuilding Ukraine, the EU\u2019s top diplomat has suggested. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign policy, told the Financial Times that it would be logical to use Russia\u2019s reserves, $300bn of which were frozen after the Ukraine war began. Borrell pointed out that the US had taken control of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of assets belonging to the Afghan central bank for humanitarian aid, and to compensate victims of terrorism - so the same principle could apply with Ukraine. Borrell told the FT: \u201cI would be very much in favour because it is full of logic. \u201cWe have the money in our pockets, and someone has to explain to me why it is good for the Afghan money and not good for the Russian money.\u201d But as the FT points out, the idea of seizing Russian foreign exchange reserves would be a dramatic move that would probably alarm other governments with fraught relations with the EU and its partners. Here\u2019s the full story: The UK government expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine, my colleague Joanna Partridge explains. The new package of restrictions includes \u00a31.4bn of UK import tariffs \u2013 border taxes paid by buyers on goods shipped from Russia \u2013 that will affect imports of platinum, palladium and other products including chemicals from Russia. The international trade department said Russia was highly dependent on the UK for exports of the precious metals, which will be subject to additional 35 percentage point tariffs. The government will also ban the export of more than \u00a3250m of goods in sectors where the Russian economy is most dependent on UK products, including key materials like chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. More here. The pound has hit a new two-year low against the US dollar. Sterling has dropped another half a cent to $1.226, the weakest since June 2020, extending its recent slide against the strengthening dollar. The pound tumbled last Thursday when the Bank of England predicted the economy would stagnate for two years as the cost of living crisis hit growth. As John Hardy of Saxo Bank explained last week: The UK is in the vanguard of economies that are beset with stagflationary risks, having been impacted on the supply side by the spike in energy prices that began even before the war in Ukraine and due to many Brexit-linked labour supply shortages. The Bank of England said that the UK population is suffering the second largest drop in living standards since 1964. European markets have also opened in the red, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 down 0.5%, adding to last Friday\u2019s drop. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 slipped at the open, down 0.2%, as China\u2019s lockdowns (and the impact on trade) add to investors\u2019 concerns about a recession. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cThe week has got off to a negative start for the UK\u2019s market, a result of poor sentiment coming from the US and China. In the US, the trend has been negative for weeks, but had started to look brighter, before comments from the Bank of England at the end of last week about weak economic growth applied the brakes to momentum. Anxiety is stemming from the Fed\u2019s next moves, with uncertainty creeping in about the scale and speed of interest rate hikes. All this comes at the same time as China grapples with ongoing lockdowns and the prevailing economic storm these entail. We saw Chinese export growth slow to two-year lows in April. That said, there have been tentative hints that China is stepping away from its blanket zero-Covid policy, which may mean an easing of the very tough conditions in the all-important production lines in the country. Shares have dropped in most Asia-Pacific markets after China\u2019s export growth hit its lowest since June 2020, early in the lockdown. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the selloff, falling 2.5%, while China\u2019s CSI 300 has dropped almost 1%, Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 is down 1.2%, and Souh Korea\u2019s KOSPI is down 1%. Investors are worried that central bankers will keep raising interest rates to cool inflation even as the world economy slows. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, explains: Given the unsettled backdrop of the Ukraine War and China\u2019s economic woes, it is challenging for the Fed to aggressively raise interest rates without dropping the US economy into a sinkhole Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Recession worries are swirling again this morning as China\u2019s Covid-19 lockdowns, the Ukraine war, and the cost of living crisis all threaten the global recovery. China\u2019s exports growth has tumbled to a two-year low, as the curbs introduced to battle Covid has hit factory production, disrupted supply chains and weakened domestic demand too. Exports slowed to 3.9% year-on-year in April, the weakest since June 2020. Imports growth was flat (and imports from the US dropped by 1.2%), as cities such as Shanghai were shut down to fight virus outbreaks. April\u2019s data shows the impact of China\u2019s latest Covid restrictions, including the tight lockdown in Shanghai which have lasted six weeks, disrupting the operations of companies including Tesla and Apple. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, says weakening foreign demand hit China\u2019s exports, suggesting rising prices are now hitting consumer spending, \u201cThe sharpest falls were in shipments to the EU and U.S., where high inflation is weighing on real household incomes. The declines were also especially pronounced in electronics exports which suggest a further unwinding of pandemic-linked demand for Chinese goods.\u201d Russia continues to be slammed with fresh sanctions over the war in Ukraine, which is now in its 75th day. Overnight, the UK has announced \u00a31.7bn of fresh sanctions on Russia and Balarus, including hiking tariffs on its lucrative platinum and palladium imports. Last night, the G7 group of advanced economies pledged to phase out or ban the import of Russian oil, in a \u201ctimely and orderly fashion\u201d (so no fixed date yet). The G7 added: \u201cWe will work together and with our partners to ensure stable and sustainable global energy supplies and affordable prices for consumers.\u201d Also coming up today The future of UK convenience store chain McColl could be decided today, as administrators weigh up rival bids from Morrisons and EG Group. Sky News reported yesterday that Morrisons had lodged an improved offer with McColl\u2019s lenders, which said on Friday it would call in administrators, putting 16,000 jobs at risk. Michael Saunders, one of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee members, gives a speech later on \u2018taking the right path\u2019, (days after the BoE warned the UK was on a path towards recession). The agenda 7.45am BST: French trade balance for March Noon BST: Mexican inflation report for April 2pm BST: Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders speech on \u2018Taking the right path\u2019"

            "content": "Barrister Lincoln Crowley QC will become the first Indigenous judge to preside over an Australian superior court, after he was appointed to the supreme court of Queensland. Colleagues said Crowley, a well-regarded barrister and former crown prosecutor who was made Queen\u2019s Counsel in 2018, had broken a significant barrier for First Nations people. \u201cIt has taken a long time for Indigenous people in Australia to be appointed to any superior court and it\u2019s very significant that Lincoln Crowley is the first such appointment,\u201d said Tony McAvoy, who in 2015 became the first Indigenous Australian appointed senior counsel. \u201cIt is a matter of some significant shame and embarrassment for the legal professional in Australia that there are not more First Nations judicial officers through all levels of the court. \u201cI have watched Lincoln rise through his career and he\u2019s always struck me as a very compassionate person and a fantastic lawyer and it comes as no surprise to me that the attorney-general of Queensland has appointed him to this position.\u201d Crowley, a Warramunga man, grew up in Charters Towers, near Townsville, and studied law at James Cook University. He told the Townsville Bulletin in 2018 he was expelled from a private school in year 11 after a run-in with a teacher. \u201cThe deputy principal called me into the office one day and said to me: \u2018Your family is Aboriginal aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re the type that end up in jail\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was picking on me and trying to put me down, basically saying I had no prospects in the future and that\u2019s where I was going to end up. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018you wait and see, mate\u2019.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning At that point, Crowley said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know anyone who had been to university, I didn\u2019t know anything about law nor have any connection to it.\u201d After graduating, Crowley worked as a solicitor-advocate for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service. He was called to the bar in 2003 and has worked in Sydney and Brisbane. Crowley has acted in several high-profile cases, including as the crown prosecutor of insider-trader Oliver Curtis, and Omar Succarieh, an Islamic bookshop owner who was convicted of foreign incursion charges. He was senior counsel assisting the disability royal commission. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said Crowley\u2019s appointment was historic and \u201chopefully the sign of many more to come\u201d. The state\u2019s attorney-general, Shannon Fentiman, said it was a \u201chistoric day\u201d. \u201cThe importance of ensuring that our judicial officers represent the diversity of our community cannot be understated,\u201d Fentiman said. \u201cThis appointment is significant, not only for First Nations Queenslanders but for the Queensland justice system.\u201d"

            "title": "The Guardian view on the Covid inquiry: looking for justice | Editorial",
            "date": "2022-05-08T17:25:06Z",
            "content": "Only by learning from the past\u2019s mistakes can we hope to avoid repeating them. That is why public inquiries have become part of the machinery of the British state and society. Live inquiries include those on the Grenfell Tower fire, the Manchester Arena attack, undercover policing, and child sexual abuse. Scrutiny of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 response and its glaring failures is anxiously awaited. That 20,000 responses to a consultation on the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference have poured in from bereaved families, frontline workers, their representatives and others indicates the strength of interest and feeling. Heather Hallett, who will chair the inquiry, has yet to feed back to ministers. But if the process is to gain people\u2019s confidence, its terms should be adjusted to reflect the public response. The many social injustices thrown into brutally sharp relief by the pandemic must be a strong focus of any meaningful investigation. So politicians, as well as Lady Hallett, should be worried that the leaders of several black, Asian and minority ethnic groups do not believe that the effects of race and racism will be given sufficient weight. In a letter, they have called for an examination of racism to be a \u201cspecific programme of work\u201d, rather than subsumed under a broad commitment to look at disparities relating to protected characteristics, which also include disability, age, pregnancy and maternity. Other inequalities besides racial ones require scrutiny. And racial inequalities overlap with other issues, notably economic marginalisation. But the letter writers have a strong case. Much higher rates of death and illness, as well as the uneven impact of the disruption to education and many other areas of life, are likely to add up to a long-term effect on race equality, they note. Their complaint also raises a wider question about public inquiries more broadly. The retired judges who lead these processes are, while far from representative of the population, experienced public servants with a degree of independence. When bureaucracies are implicated in wrongdoing, an inquiry can \u2013 as has been proved in the past \u2013 be an effective way to get at the truth and ensure some measure of accountability and improve practice in future, potentially saving lives. But if the Covid-19 inquiry is to deliver results in a reasonable timeframe, Lady Hallett will have to decide where to focus. The scope of the task before her is vast. The list of topics to be covered includes many of the key decisions taken by the UK government over the past two years, as well as scrutiny of the health and care system. The job now is to decide on priorities, and in doing so to build trust with the families and communities for whom the inquiry has the deepest significance. Following last month\u2019s high court ruling that the government\u2019s instruction to discharge people from hospitals into care homes without testing them for Covid was unlawful, finding out how this dreadful decision was reached must be high on the list. Pandemic policymaking will be explored in other places too. Parliament has a role to play, while the sociology professor and journalist Gary Younge has proposed that the links between racism and Covid could be discussed at public meetings. None of these mechanisms will be sufficient on its own. Their effectiveness will depend on how much public and political will can be mobilised behind them. Lady Hallett\u2019s next moves are crucial."

            "date": "2022-05-26T05:32:01Z",
            "content": "At 1.30pm on Friday 8 July, Kimonti Carter will learn whether he must spend the rest of his life in prison \u2013 or if American justice allows for the possibility of redemption. Carter was riding in a car with fellow gang members in 1997. One told him to shoot at a car in the next lane, mistakenly believing that it belonged to a rival gang. Carter fired several shots, killing Corey Pittman and injuring two other passengers. Just over 18, he was tried as an adult, convicted of aggravated first-degree murder and sentenced to 777 years, 77 months and 77 days\u2019 imprisonment. Since Washington state has no parole system, it effectively locked him up and threw away the key. But instead of yielding to hopelessness, Carter has dedicated his life behind bars to working as a teacher, mentor and founder of a groundbreaking prisoner-led higher-education programme. At a resentencing hearing at Pierce county superior court in Tacoma, Washington, on 8 July, he will ask to be set free. \u201cHe never thought he was getting out and so he decided to make the most of his grieving by doing something so he can prevent things from happening,\u201d says Gilda Sheppard, who interviewed Carter for her documentary, Since I Been Down. \u201cThere\u2019s always a possibility of change. I have to think that.\u201d Filmed over 12 years, Since I Been Down paints a stark portrait of a predominantly white state, Washington, whose prison population is overwhelmingly Black. It shows Tacoma, near Seattle, as scarred by drugs and lack of investment in housing, education and employment. With opportunities scarce, gangs offer a seductive sense of identity. One former gang member recalls: \u201cI got addicted to being feared.\u201d Sheppard, who teaches at a liberal arts college in Tacoma, says: \u201cIt\u2019s like Everytown USA. It has been a victim of gentrification, a legacy of people not being able to have bank loans, or any kind of loans, to rehabilitate their homes. As a result, these neighbourhoods become infested with public health issues. Disinvestment in communities and education and employment comes with gentrification.\u201d In 1993 Washington became the first state in the US to pass a \u201cthree strikes\u201d policy, which mandates life in prison without parole for people thrice convicted of certain offences, from robbery to assault to murder. The consequences were devastating for a generation. By the end of 2020, Black people, representing 4% of the state\u2019s population, accounted for 38% of those sentenced under the law. Speaking via Zoom from her home in Seattle, Sheppard reflects: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the three strikes and you\u2019re out but a culture of punishment that you see in many different urban communities, particularly Black, brown and poor communities. Tacoma, Washington, is a visual metaphor for the legacy of those things.\u201d This was the era of moral panic and so-called \u201ctough on crime\u201d policies across America that targeted Black \u201csuper-predators\u201d, including three-strikes laws that sent young people to prison for life. President Bill Clinton signed a national crime bill now widely blamed for giving the US the highest incarceration rate in the world. Mary Flowers, an anti-racism organiser, says in the film: \u201cThis country is based on fear. When you have a country that is based on or has grown out of colonisation and slavery, people don\u2019t rest easy. That\u2019s why everyone needs to be armed in this country to protect what they have, because what they have was stolen.\u201d But this is also a documentary about resistance and reinvention. For more than a decade Sheppard has been teaching sociology classes in Washington state prisons through the Black Prisoners\u2019 Caucus, which started half a century ago and is now in a dozen prisons across Washington. She was surprised by the inmates\u2019 academic discipline and engagement. \u201cI taught this concept of sociological imagination that looks at a person\u2019s biography and how history informs that biography,\u201d Sheppard recalls. \u201cI was getting all this brilliant analysis and I was like, \u2018I\u2019m supposed to impart this. You all know this! Where\u2019s the scaffold for this political and creative thinking?\u2019 \u201cSo then I went to a summit of the Black Prisoners\u2019 Caucus talking about youth violence, legislative process; they brought representatives, senators, the head of the department of corrections, some victims that could and other people in the community, their families, and I thought to myself, as James Baldwin said, to be an artist is to be a lover. \u201cIf I love you, I have to show you things that you don\u2019t see. I didn\u2019t see this and I dare say I\u2019m not sure a lot of people saw who we are imprisoning in our culture of punishment, even with the triumphs and redemptive possibilities of these men and women in prison. I just wanted to share that in my art.\u201d In 2013 Carter and the caucus created a programme called Taking Education and Creating History (Teach) in which prisoners teach literacy, maths and language courses to one another. It includes white inmates and is now at three Washington prisons. Carter now teaches algebra, financial literacy, interpersonal communication and African studies. Sheppard witnessed how the initiative gives incarcerated people a sense of purpose, self-possession and hope. \u201cWhen you meet one member of a community that has been shut off and wants to maintain those views of fear and hate and all those things, but that one member of that community gets a little bit of light, it\u2019s hard to stop that light from shining. I\u2019m not talking about optimism. I\u2019m talking about real work.\u201d She was particularly struck by a \u201chealthy thinking\u201d class \u201cto understand that to have education is not enough. What is your perspective? Who are you looking at as the good guys and the bad guys? Does history repeat itself or do people repeat history? \u201cIn those classes I heard from different incarcerated folks from their heart and soul about their families, how they could cry together, going deep into remorse. One guy said his son wanted to come to prison so he could be with him. Or there\u2019s one white guy who says, \u2018I got seven kids. I don\u2019t want to be like this. I want to change the way I\u2019m thinking,\u2019 Oftentimes prison is not a place where you can reflect. But these prisoner-initiated programmes realise what is needed in a person\u2019s life and oftentimes they would invite some of the staff. \u201cWhen they go and hear these guys talking, they can\u2019t help but listen a little bit. I am not naive to think that everybody\u2019s going to change, but maybe a member of that community has something else that they haven\u2019t looked at, and who knows what they can do?\u201d Carter, a leader in the Black Prisoners\u2019 Caucus, emerges as the documentary\u2019s central protagonist. Sheppard came to admire his \u201ccompassionate leadership and vision\u201d, she says. \u201cHe would look at situations, but also imagine what was possible, hence his development of Teach across race lines. He\u2019s remorseful but his remorse is not in a kind of grieving that\u2019s only filled with tears but a kind of grieving that\u2019s filled with activity. \u201cJust the other day, my film was shown at a juvenile facility, Green Hill school \u2013 young men between the ages of 16 and twentysomething \u2013 and they were very quiet afterwards. Kimonti Carter calls in sometimes when I\u2019m doing these post-screening discussions and it was the most amazing discussion you could ever hear. He\u2019s devoted his life to this.\u201d In 2006 Carter spoke at the Black Prisoners\u2019 Caucus justice reform summit, apologising to the family of Pittman and taking responsibility for his crime. His life sentence was based on arbitrary legal technicalities. If he had been on the street instead of inside a moving vehicle at the moment he opened fire, or if he had been just six weeks younger when he committed the crime, he would probably now be a free man. Yet the lack of a parole option meant he was told that, irrespective of how he behaved in prison, he would never be released. Sheppard reflects: \u201cYou\u2019ve been held accountable. You did the time. But not only did you do the time, you helped to redeem so many other people who were in prison, across race lines.\u201d Carter\u2019s sentence was finally vacated after the Washington supreme court ruled that mandatory life sentences without parole are unconstitutional for people aged 18 to 21, not just those under 18. At his hearing on 8 July, Carter will ask a judge to resentence him to \u201ctime served\u201d, amounting to the 25 years that he has been imprisoned already. This would allow the 43-year-old to be released immediately. In one scene of the film, Carter is seen hosting a caucus meeting. Wearing white T-shirt and beige trousers, with pen behind ear and notebook in hand, he tells fellow inmates: \u201cNot only do you have to make a commitment but you have to make a choice: if I still want to continue living the life that got me here or I want to try to live a better life, right? We can never become somebody different but we can become a better version of who we are.\u201d Since I Been Down is now available on Sundance Now or to rent digitally in the US with a UK date to be announced"

            "date": "2022-05-20T05:00:42Z",
            "content": "A new clean air law is starting out in parliament after the Green party peer Jenny Jones won first place in the House of Lords ballot for private members\u2019 bills. Named Ella\u2019s law, as a tribute to nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah who died from asthma induced by air pollution, the bill would establish a right to clean air and set up a commission to oversee government actions and progress. It would also join policies on indoor and outdoor air pollution with actions to combat our climate emergency, and include annual reviews of the latest science. Jones said: \u201cHaving a nice environment isn\u2019t just a matter of ecology and science, it is a question of social justice. The clean air (human rights) bill would enshrine the human right to healthy air precisely and explicitly in UK law. A suitable date for the government to put it into law would be before the 70th anniversary of the Great Smog later this year\u201d. The UK\u2019s first Clean Air Act also began as a private member\u2019s bill, introduced by the handlebar moustached Tory MP Gerald Nabarro. Nabarro\u2019s bill was triggered by a Ministry for Health report that estimated a death toll of about 4,000 people due to the weeklong London smog of 1952, a death rate greater than the Victorian cholera outbreaks and the worst periods of the blitz. Politically, Jones and Nabarro are poles apart but Jones\u2019s bill comes at a time when about 4,000 Londoners die from breathing polluted air each year. UK annual deaths are estimated to be between 28,000 and 36,000, and globally it is about 7 million. Since Nabarro\u2019s bill, thousands of research studies have explored the health harm from air pollution, or, viewed from a different angle, the benefits that could come from cleaner air. Dr Maria Neira, the World Health Organization (WHO) director for public health, environmental and social determinants of health, said: \u201cThese days we have overwhelming evidence that air pollution harms health, more than enough evidence to justify actions to reduce exposure. You can imagine the incredible number of lives we will save.\u201d Improving air pollution saves money from reduced absence from work and less cost to the NHS. In parallel to Jones\u2019s bill, the government is asking for views on its own targets for particle pollution in England. These targets for 2040 match the guidelines that were set by the WHO in 2005. Additionally, it is proposed to reduce average particle pollution by 35%. According to government analysis, the benefits from these actions would be five times greater than the money than spent cleaning our air."

            "date": "2022-05-25T23:51:12Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden signed an executive order he promised would usher in the \u201cmost significant police reform in decades\u201d on Wednesday, the second anniversary of the murder of George Floyd. With Congress deadlocked, Biden said he was using the powers of the presidency to advance his campaign promises and deliver police accountability and reform \u201cthat is real and lasting\u201d. Biden was joined at the White House for a signing ceremony by Floyd\u2019s family as well as relatives of Breonna Taylor, who was killed when police executed a no-knock warrant at her apartment in 2020. In remarks preceding the signing, Biden praised them for their efforts to push for change even as they grieve. \u201cIt\u2019s not about their death but what we do in their memory that matters,\u201d he said. The executive order signed on Wednesday directs federal agencies to revise use-of-force policies, banning tactics such as chokeholds, restricting practices like no-knock warrants and promoting de-escalation techniques. It also calls for the creation of a new national standard for accrediting police departments; establishes a national database to track police misconduct; further restricts the transfer of military equipment to police departments; and requires agencies to implement new tools to screen for inherent bias among officers as well as recruits, including those who promote unlawful violence or harbor white supremacist views. The order, the president said, was \u201ca measure of what we can do together to heal the very soul of this nation, to address profound fear and trauma, exhaustion that particularly Black Americans have experienced for generations\u201d. When the ceremony concluded, Biden invited Floyd\u2019s young daughter, Gianna, to sit in his chair and handed her the pen he had used to sign the order. Remarking how tall she\u2019d grown since the last time he saw her, Biden turned to the audience and recalled that Gianna told him the first time they met: \u201cMy daddy is gonna change the world.\u201d Biden began his remarks by addressing the massacre of 19 children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re here today for the same purpose \u2013 to come together and say, \u2018Enough,\u2019 \u201d he said. Wednesday\u2019s action, which will apply to more than 100,000 federal law enforcement officers, reflects the delicate balance Biden has sought to strike on policing after promising to do \u201ceverything in my power\u201d address racism and excessive use of force. Civil rights groups and racial justice activists have pushed him to fulfill his pledge while Republicans, seizing on concern over crime, have sought to cast Democrats as soft on crime. Floyd was killed on 25 May 2020, when a white Minneapolis police officer pinned his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. Floyd, who was Black, was handcuffed and pleading that he couldn\u2019t breathe. His death ignited a national movement against racial injustice and dramatically shifted long-held views on racism and policing. But translating the outcry into legislative action has proved elusive for Democrats, who narrowly control both chambers of Congress. Last year, the House passed legislation named in Floyd\u2019s honor. But negotiations stalled in the evenly divided Senate, where 60 votes are needed to pass most legislation. Speaking before Biden on Wednesday, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, said Senate Republicans who opposed the legislation \u201cwalked away from their moral obligation\u201d to address an issue that \u201ccaused millions of Americans to march in the streets\u201d. White House officials said the order had been finalized after more than 100 hours\u2019 work and as many meetings with stakeholders including law enforcement officials, lawmakers, civil rights and civil liberties groups and families of victims of police violence. The resulting order is far narrower in scope than was initially sought, but civil rights leaders \u2013 and some major police groups \u2013 welcomed the policies. \u201cWe know full well that an executive order cannot address America\u2019s policing crisis the same way Congress has the ability to but we\u2019ve got to do everything we can,\u201d Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, who attended Wednesday\u2019s signing ceremony, said in a statement. \u201cThere\u2019s no better way to honor George Floyd\u2019s legacy than for President Biden to take action by signing a police reform executive order.\u201d Derek Chauvin, the officer who pinned Floyd to the ground with his knee, was convicted of murder and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison. Three other former officers were convicted in federal court of violating Floyd\u2019s civil rights. The order applies only to federal agencies. Biden does not have direct authority over state and local agencies. But White House officials said the order incentivizes law enforcement agencies at every level to participate in the national police registry and to adopt the new accountability standards and de-escalation policies established by the order. Democrats are navigating a complicated political landscape on the issue of policing and crime with less than six months before the midterm elections. Republicans have sought to blame Democrats for rises in violent crime in some cities, a dubious claim that they tie to calls made by activists after Floyd\u2019s death to slash police funding. As a candidate and as president, Biden has denounced efforts to \u201cdefund the police\u201d, repeating, to the frustration of some in his party, that departments need more funding, not less. But with election day looming, Republicans have used those calls to accuse Democrats of being When a draft version of the order was leaked earlier this year, some law enforcement groups found some of the language objectionable. Particularly offensive to them, according to a February report in the New York Times, was a reference to \u201csystemic racism\u201d within US criminal justice. A White House official said the text had been revised and improved based on input from stakeholders but would not say if the document made explicit reference to systemic racism. The official said the order \u201cdoes not hide from the truth that we need reform in policing and in our larger criminal justice system, and that includes addressing systemic racism\u201d. The final version of the order Biden signed on Wednesday did use the contested term, making clear reference to racial disparities across policing and the criminal justice system which were explicitly identified as consequences of \u201csystemic racism\u201d. The order said: \u201cIt is time that we acknowledge the legacy of systemic racism in our criminal justice system and work together to eliminate the racial disparities that endure to this day. Doing so serves all Americans.\u201d"

            "content": "At a time when we\u2019re woefully short of GPs, it beggars belief that new recruits are potentially being blocked from working by bureaucratic visa rules (NHS risks losing GPs to \u2018nonsensical\u2019 immigration rules, Priti Patel told, 18 May). The BMA has consistently called for reforms to the currrent system, whereby international GPs who complete their training in the UK after three years are unable to get a visa and work in a GP practice unless it has registered as a licensed sponsor. Only after five years\u2019 residence in the UK do graduates receive indefinite leave to remain, meaning a visa is unnecessary. With around 40% of all GP trainees estimated to be international medical graduates, and bureaucratic barriers discouraging practices from becoming sponsors, this potentially means a significant number of newly qualified doctors who could be providing care to thousands of patients are unable to do so. For some, this will mean taking jobs elsewhere in the NHS, but others will choose to leave the country, which will not only deprive patients of care, but also be a waste of the taxpayer money spent training them. There are a number of simple solutions to this. For example, sponsorship could be moved to an umbrella body with overarching responsibility \u2013 meaning newly qualified GPs could work at any practice, or the five-year residence rule could be reduced to three years in recognition of the desperate need to increase the workforce. The government has an opportunity to harness the skills of a significant number of doctors to deliver the care that patients so desperately need.

            "date": "2022-05-24T17:30:13Z",
            "content": "Labor\u2019s Tony Burke has said he is \u201cdetermined to fix\u201d how parliament works as crossbench MPs submit long lists of demands to boost their voice and influence. More crossbench questions in question time, abolishing Dorothy Dixers, and guaranteed debates and votes on private members\u2019 bills are some of the most common requests from returning crossbench MPs. The crossbench of seven will expand to at least 15 after the Greens gained seats in Brisbane and independents captured heartland Liberal seats. But Labor is still on track to form a narrow majority. Burke, who is likely to become leader of the house in the 47th parliament, has already met the independent MP Helen Haines to discuss the ideas, many of which are drawn from an Australia Institute research paper to reform Australia\u2019s democracy. Haines was a member of the parliamentary committee which proposed reforms to question time in the last parliament, ideas that she said \u201cwent nowhere\u201d. She said Dorothy Dixers \u2013 prepared questions and answers \u2013 should be banned, along with those asking about \u201calternative approaches\u201d, which are used to invite stump speeches bashing opposition policies. \u201cThey\u2019re a waste of space \u2026 and the general public hate them,\u201d she said. Haines wants a minimum of four crossbench questions in question time, a \u201cproportional increase\u201d, and one day of private members\u2019 business a week. The independent MP also wants a minimum notice period before the government puts its own bills to a vote, with a \u201cgenuine opportunity to have prior consultation and propose amendments\u201d, including more crossbench input into committees. Those and new rules preventing legislation being introduced and passed in the same sitting could result in \u201cbetter legislation and a more effective way to work\u201d, she said. Haines said the requirement for an absolute majority to suspend standing orders should be changed to a simple majority: \u201cWe saw how that operated during Covid, we could well have had an integrity commission if not for that rule.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Burke said: \u201cThe Australian people have made clear they want integrity in government and in the parliament itself. \u201cIn the last term in particular the House of Representatives became a farce. I\u2019m determined to fix that and I\u2019m having conversations across the parliament to that end.\u201d The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, who will be joined by at least two more Greens MPs, for Griffith and Ryan, and potentially four, said: \u201cMPs outside the government should have the right to have their issues progress through parliament. \u201cPrivate members should have the right to take their matters to a vote, that happened in 2010 in the power-sharing parliament and it led to some significant reforms.\u201d Bandt said in the last parliament Liberal backbenchers were \u201cprepared to defect \u2026 to support debate on an anti-corruption commission\u201d but the government had refused to allow a vote on the bill. He said there was \u201ca lot to be said\u201d for removing the requirement for an absolute majority to suspend standing orders, noting that the crossbench had been \u201cexcluded from pairing arrangements\u201d and pairs between the \u201cold parties\u201d made it difficult to reach that threshold. Bandt said he wanted to end the practice of starting sitting days with the Lord\u2019s prayer and to display First Nations flags in the chambers. The incoming independent MP for North Sydney, Kylea Tink, said parliament should shift from \u201ca staged show to what it was designed to, be a chamber for robust debate and discussion\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about ensuring all communities are heard equally \u2013 whether you voted for someone sitting in government or not \u2026 just because one major party is in government, I don\u2019t think that should kill consensus-seeking,\u201d she said. Tink said that, watching from the outside, question time was a \u201cdissatisfying experience\u201d, full of \u201cjeering and yahooing\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like anything was addressing real questions people had,\u201d she said. The incoming independent MP for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, said it was \u201cimportant the parliamentary process evolves\u201d to give newly elected independents a voice to represent their communities. \u201cIf Anthony Albanese means what he says about inclusivity, he needs to reflect on how that should play out on the floor of parliament,\u201d she said. The independent MP for Warringah, Zali Steggall, said with one-third of Australians voting for independents or minor parties, the parliament has a \u201crecord-breaking crossbench\u201d. \u201cThe outcome of the election signals a move away from us v them, blue-team v red-team politics, and this has the potential to transform our political discourse, bring back respectful debate and make petty wedge politics a lesser force in the formation of policy.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-14T20:00:10Z",
            "content": "Mereana Richards has spent almost a decade providing warm beds, showers and hot meals to locals in Port Hedland \u2013 in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara region \u2013 who have had too much to drink. As the coordinator of a sobering-up service, run by an Indigenous-led not-for-profit, Richards runs the centre that is a safe haven for alcohol-affected locals. \u201cSometimes they are legless, sometimes they don\u2019t want to listen or have a shower or do anything,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can come in drunk and play up and use it as an excuse to not remember the rules.\u201d The eight-bed centre in the town of about 14,000 people is run by the Bloodwood Tree Association. Bloodwood provides a range of accommodation, employment and alcohol treatment services to at-risk Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But there are strict rules, including a requirement that people shower upon arrival, and a zero-tolerance approach to violent behaviour. \u201cI just tell them if they don\u2019t want to behave themselves, they can stay away,\u201d says Richards, who has been assaulted three times at the centre. Sobering-up services are scattered across Western Australia \u2013 where public intoxication was decriminalised in 1990 as a result of the interim report of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. The commission found the offence disproportionately affected Indigenous people. Decades later, Victoria and Queensland remain the only jurisdictions to still have a specific offence for public drunkenness. The Andrews government last year passed the landmark reform to decriminalise the offence \u2013 but has now pushed back the official repeal, citing Covid-related pressures on the health system that have caused a delay in establishing trial sobering-up centres. That reform was prompted by the high-profile death of 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day, who was arrested in December 2017 after being found drunk on a train travelling from Castlemaine to Melbourne. She later died in hospital from head injuries sustained in a prison holding cell. In Day\u2019s case, police officers told a coronial inquiry she had been detained for her own protection and in order to sober up. The coroner found the welfare checks by the two officers responsible for her care were inadequate and did not comply with police guidelines. The coroner\u2019s findings said Day\u2019s death was \u201cclearly preventable\u201d had she not been arrested and placed in police custody \u2013 and recommended the state abolish the offence of public drunkenness. Victoria is now grappling with the transition to a new way to deal with the issue that diverts public intoxication from the criminal justice system and into the health sector. This will probably involve Aboriginal-controlled community organisations \u2013 working alongside alcohol, drug and other health services \u2013 being the alternative pathway for people found drunk in public. An expert group, commissioned by the government in the wake of Day\u2019s death to make recommendations for reform, said Victorian police should only be able to detain an intoxicated person in \u201cstrictly limited circumstances\u201d \u2013 and only be responsible for transporting them when there were no other available options. Feedback from a pilot program will help crystallise the wider rollout of a health-based response when the decriminalisation comes into effect, which Guardian Australia understands will be in November next year. The government will aim to establish the four trial sites \u2013 funded with an investment of $26.4m \u2013 by the middle of the year. In establishing a public health response, the Victorian government will be forced to find a compromise between the state\u2019s powerful police union, which says police have a vital role to play in protecting the community from intoxication, and Indigenous advocacy groups. Indigenous groups argue police must take a back seat, pointing to numerous deaths in custody since the 1991 royal commission and the disproportionate impact policing has on their communities. The Police Association of Victoria previously warned that decriminalising public drunkenness before having a replacement system to deal with the issue was \u201cdangerous virtue signalling\u201d. Despite the government committing to establishing sobering-up centre trials, the union says the government\u2019s approach to reform has \u201cfailed to deliver clarity to the community about the way that the reform will be implemented and how the community will be protected from alcohol-fuelled offending\u201d. \u201cPolice remain entirely unsure about what tools they will be given to properly protect Victorians and deal with public drunkenness, of which 8,269 alleged incidents are recorded on average each year,\u201d a union spokesperson said. The latest figures from the state\u2019s crime statistics agency show there were 2,984 drunk and disorderly offences recorded last year. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service argues police should not be involved in a heath-based response or should have their involvement \u201cheavily constrained\u201d. \u201cAboriginal voices and health experts must lead the design of the health model,\u201d VALS\u2019s chief executive, Nerita Waight, tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThese reforms will make the community safer because people will get the health support they need. The reforms will particularly make Victoria safer for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who continue to be over-policed and over-incarcerated.\u201d Balancing the police\u2019s role in dealing with public intoxication is rarely clear cut. In Western Australia, despite decriminalisation, police have the power to apprehend someone intoxicated in public to protect them from themselves or others, or stop them from causing damage to property. In New South Wales, where \u201cpublic drunkenness\u201d was officially decriminalised in the late 1970s, it continues to be criminalised via police\u2019s move-on powers, University of NSW law professor Luke McNamara argues. \u201cSometimes people treat the moment of formal decriminalisation as some kind of magic moment where the criminal justice system is no longer involved,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not actually an accurate story in terms of how we should understand the relationship between criminal law, police and public intoxication.\u201d Intoxication-specific move-on powers for police were introduced in 2007 and expanded in 2011. Failure to comply with move-on orders is an offence that can lead to detainment. \u201cIt\u2019s important to think about all the other ways in which the police might have capacity to engage their powers to address public intoxication, and to make sure that none of those are being used in a way which is inconsistent with the new, appropriate health-based response,\u201d McNamara says. The health-based response will see health services like drug and alcohol treatment centres working alongside Aboriginal organisations. But while the Victorian Ambulance Union supports the reform, its general secretary, Danny Hill, says \u201ca lot of work\u201d is needed to ensure a health-based model does not strain a system that is already overburdened. A Victorian government spokesperson says local outreach teams would provide on-the-ground support for anyone affected by alcohol as part of the reform. \u201cThe new health model will promote therapeutic and culturally safe pathways to assist people who are drunk and will include outreach services and sobering-up services \u2013 making sure people are in a safe place where they can receive appropriate support,\u201d the spokesperson says. In Port Hedland, Richards credits the local police and ambulance services, who work with Bloodwood\u2019s service, in providing support to the local community \u2013 relationships she admits are easier to maintain in a small town. \u201cThe beauty of it is because we are all normally serving the same people, it\u2019s like one big circle. They go from one service to the other. We\u2019re all trying to help them,\u201d Richards says."

            "date": "2022-05-04T09:00:03Z",
            "content": "Jesus Figueroa Cacho, a certified nursing assistant of the Sacramento, California area, has worked in the nursing home industry for about 25 years. She consistently works 16 hour long shifts, 60 to 80 hours per week, often working through breaks and not getting paid overtime because she works night shifts and overtime accrual resets at 1am every day, in the middle of her shifts. Figueroa Cacho said her facility is severely understaffed, often with just two nurses to care for about 50 patients. \u201cI come home exhausted, I have to drive 40 miles to come to work. This is by choice because I love my residents, I love my work, but I have two hours just to get home, and have very little time to sleep before I have to get right back to work,\u201d said Figueroa Cacho. During the Covid-19 pandemic, her employer had staffing help from the national guard and staffing agencies, but that contributed to many workers quitting as they were paid much more than permanent staff, who receive just above minimum wage. \u201cWe would like to address poverty level wages. If I don\u2019t work 16-hour shifts, I can\u2019t pay my rent,\u201d said Figueroa Cacho. \u201cI have a son in college. My son was denied last semester because I didn\u2019t have enough funds to pay for his school. This is devastating. We need to be paid for our work.\u201d Now the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 2015, which represents 400,000 nursing home and home care workers in California, the largest long-term care union in the US, is advocating for a proposal to create a statewide Quality Standards Board to oversee the state\u2019s nursing home industry in the wake of the pandemic that has decimated staffing in the industry. The board would include 16 seats, with 10 seats from state agencies, two workers, two seats representing advocates and families, and two representing employers. The board will have authority to set minimum standards for wages, benefits and working conditions for the nursing home industry in California. It follows similar pushes to establish industry oversight boards with worker representation in the fast-food industry in California and the nail salon industry in New York. According to April Verrett, president of SEIU Local 2015, the board, which was proposed by the union with the California state senator Henry Stern and assembly member Miguel Santiago, is being advocated for inclusion in the next California state budget, which is currently undergoing hearings in the state legislature before the next fiscal year begins on 1 July. \u201cOur members are wanting to make sure that we address a longstanding crisis in our state\u2019s nursing homes as it relates to making sure the quality of care is what residents in the facilities deserve, that families can count on, and that we once and for all get to the root cause of why people leave this industry,\u201d said Verrett. Verrett added: \u201cThey want to make sure that as we approach how we fix this crisis, workers have a seat at the table so they\u2019re able to be a part of creating real solutions so we have a long-term care system that provides the highest-quality care for residents, but also ensures that the workforce receives the dignity, respect and the compensation they deserve.\u201d A poll conducted by the union of workers in the nursing home industry found half of nursing home workers are likely to leave their job within the next year, citing severe staffing shortages and low pay. In 2020, there was a turnover rate of over 50% in California\u2019s nursing home industry. The skilled nursing industry in the US has lost 241,000 jobs since the pandemic began, 15.2% of the industry\u2019s total workforce, During the pandemic, nursing homes were among the hardest hit by infections and deaths for residents and workers, accounting for 31% of all Covid deaths in the US as of 30 June 2021. According to SEIU Local 2015, more than 82,000 nursing home workers in California contracted Covid-19 during the pandemic, and 247 workers died. \u201cThe Quality Standards Board is one of the best things for a long time coming because it gives ordinary workers an opportunity to sit on such a board who has real life experience in what happens in these fields,\u201d said Robert Oriona, a nursing home worker in the Los Angeles, California, area. Oriona noted his nephew makes more than he does working in fast food, and his employer has offered measly wage increase proposals of 1.5% that will be canceled out when the minimum wage in Los Angeles increases in July 2022 to about $16 an hour. He also frequently experiences verbal and physical abuse from residents who don\u2019t have enough staff to properly care for them, faulty equipment and poor benefits. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for help. Patient minimums, better wages, better benefits, and we need everyone out there to know what goes on in these facilities,\u201d added Oriona. Charisma Elok, a rehab assistant for seven years at a nursing home in the Los Angeles area, cited that staff at her facility had dwindled during the pandemic, amid Covid outbreaks, low pay and short staffing She had to fight to be paid after contracting Covid on the job early on in the pandemic, has worked with inadequate personal protective equipment, and her facility often can\u2019t handle the number or type of patients they admit due to understaffing and not having the properly trained staff to care for patients with high needs, such as residents suffering from dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s. \u201cThese nursing homes, they look at patients as dollar signs on their head, because why are you accepting a patient that you cannot provide adequate quality of care for?\u201d said Elok."

            "content": "UK banks and insurers will end up shouldering nearly \u00a3340bn worth of climate-related losses by 2050, unless action is taken to curb rising temperatures and sea levels, the Bank of England has warned. The numbers emerged from the Bank\u2019s first climate stress tests on seven of the UK\u2019s largest lenders. These involved three climate scenarios over a 30-year period, covering physical and transition risks, including one in which governments fail to take further steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in average temperature rises of 3.3C, and a 3.9-metre rise in sea levels. The regulator found that without early action, companies would suffer a surge in loan and mortgage defaults, investment losses, and climate-related lawsuits \u2013 particularly for insurers \u2013 worth \u00a3334bn across the UK\u2019s 19 largest banks and insurers by 2050. \u201cClimate change will inevitably drive losses for banks and insurers \u2013 even in a scenario where governments around the world take swift and early action to bring us to net zero,\u201d Sam Woods, deputy governor for Prudential Regulation and chief executive officer of the Prudential Regulation Authority, said. While banks are likely to survive the Bank of England\u2019s worst case climate scenario, delayed transition efforts \u2013 in which governments and industry wait until 2031 to take action \u2013 banks alone would still suffer \u00a3110bn worth of collective losses. That is roughly twice the rate of pre-Covid losses recorded by the seven lenders tested in the Bank of England\u2019s climate stress tests: NatWest, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, the UK arm of Santander, and Nationwide building society. \u201cThe first key lesson from this exercise is that over time, climate risks will become a persistent drag on banks\u2019 and insurers\u2019 profitability, particularly if they don\u2019t manage them effectively,\u201d Woods added. \u201cWhile they vary across firms and scenarios, overall loss rates are equivalent to an average drag on annual profits of around 10-15%.\u201d While the regulator has been praised for the climate stress stests, the Bank of England has come under fire for so far refusing to publish data for individual firms, and stopping short of introducing immediate capital requirements, which would make it more expensive to offer loans and services to fossil fuel companies and carbon-intensive projects. Threadneedle Street has, however, not ruled out releasing individual results in the future, or considering how they may impact capital requirements. The Bank plans to use the initial reports to inform how it supervises each company. The Bank of England is one of the few central banks to have conducted climate stress tests, alongside the European Central Bank and Banque de France."

            "content": "Vanuatu\u2019s push for the international court of justice to protect vulnerable nations from climate change has received the backing of 1,500 civil society organisations from more than 130 countries, as it heads toward a crucial vote at the UN General Assembly later this year. In 2021 Vanuatu announced its intention to seek an advisory opinion by the international court of justice on the rights of present and future generations to be protected from climate change. If it succeeds, the ICJ\u2019s advisory opinion - although non-binding - carries legal weight and moral authority which experts say could help shape international law. The opinion could also influence domestic and regional courts and tribunals when addressing issues relating to climate change. Vanuatu is trying to build support for its motion ahead of the UN General Assembly later this year, at which it needs to secure at least 97 votes, in order for the matter to be referred to the ICJ. The alliance, announced on Friday, represents more than 1,500 civil society organisations (CSOs) from across the globe, including preeminent climate groups from the Pacific: Climate Action Network - International, Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Oxfam in the Pacific, 350 Pacific, Pacific Islands Climate Action Network and Vanuatu Climate Action Network. An independent observer of Vanuatu\u2019s campaign said the alliance could put pressure on other nations to support Vanuatu\u2019s initiative. \u201cIt throws the weight of these CSOs behind the initiative, which will put pressure on other states to support the initiative. There have been similar proposals before, which have been driven by other Pacific countries, like Palau in 2011, which have been derailed by pressure from rich countries, such as the United States,\u201d said Fleur Ramsay, a Pacific islander lawyer specialising in climate and environmental law with the Environmental Defenders Office. Vanuatu has engaged a Pacific law firm, Blue Ocean Law, to represent them in their campaign for the advisory opinion and has retained external counsel to assist with the development of the legal strategy, including lawyers from the UK, the US, France, Canada, Greece, India, Switzerland and Fiji. Joseph Sikulu, Pacific Director of 350.org said the alliance was an extension of the important advocacy Pacific island nations have been doing on climate change for many years. \u201cThe Pacific has already shown that governments and civil society can work together to achieve impactful change; the 1.5 degree benchmark being ingrained into the Paris Agreement is a testament to that. Through this alliance we hope to continue to weave together advocacy at all levels to build momentum behind the Vanuatu Government\u2019s push for this Advisory Opinion.\u201d Vanuatu is one of the countries most affected by the climate crisis, with a combination of climate risks that include sea level and temperature rises, as well as extreme weather events including cyclones, storm surges, landslides, flooding and droughts. It is also among Pacific nations at the forefront of the climate fight. Vanuatu has been a vocal proponent in limiting temperature rise from global warming to 1.5C. The Pacific nation launched an online data modelling tool to perceive and prepare for potential impacts of rising tides and storm surges. It is are also experimenting with crossbreed crop varieties to identify climate resilient crops including taro. Vanuatu ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016 and is one of 43 nations on the Climate Vulnerable Forum. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, Vanuatu prime minister Bob Loughman said: \u201cThe dire consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored, and the science linking climate change to past and present emissions of greenhouse gases is now beyond question. Climate change is driving sea level rise, desertification, disease redistribution, floods, unprecedented \u2018heat domes\u2019, cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events.\u201d"

            "content": "New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has met US president Joe Biden to discuss shared concerns about China\u2019s growing influence in the Pacific, as well as extremism and dealing with the aftermath of mass shootings. The two leaders spoke for more than an hour, with Biden saying Ardern\u2019s leadership on issues like climate change, violence and extremism was of international importance. \u201cYour leadership has taken on a critical role in this global stage,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt really has \u2013 galvanising action on climate change; the global effort to curb violence, extremism, and online, like happened in Christchurch.\u201d For New Zealand, the visit was a significant one \u2013 the first time a prime minister had visited the Oval Office since 2014. It comes at a time of heightened tensions in the Pacific region, where New Zealand is looking to shore up relationships amid a push by China to sign Pacific Island nations on to new security and economic pacts. But the two leaders\u2019 different experiences with mass shootings, gun control and extremism also loomed large. Ardern\u2019s trip coincided with the aftermath of the Buffalo and Uvalde mass shootings. The prime minister\u2019s own history on gun control \u2013 banning most-semi-automatic weapons in the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings, which killed 51 in 2019 \u2013 made the issue an unexpected focus of her trip, especially for Americans frustrated by a lack of legislative action on gun control. On mass shootings, Ardern said, \u201cOur experience, of course, in this regard, is our own. But if there\u2019s anything that we can share that would be of any value, we are here to share it.\u201d Biden spoke at some length about the grief that followed the shootings in New York and Texas, as he struggles to push a reluctant Congress to tighten gun laws. \u201cThere\u2019s an expression by an Irish poet that says, \u2018Too long a suffering makes a stone of the heart.\u2019 Well, there\u2019s an awful lot of suffering. I\u2019ve been to more mass shooting aftermaths than, I think, any president in American history, unfortunately. \u2026 So much of it is preventable, and the devastation is amazing,\u201d he said. He spoke about his recent experience of spending hours speaking to Texas survivors and those who had lost loved ones, and said he wanted to speak with Ardern about her own conversations in the wake of the Christchurch attacks \u2013 including the Christchurch call, an international effort to curb online violent extremism. \u201cI want to work with you on that effort. And I want to talk to you about what those conversations were like, if you\u2019re willing,\u201d he said. After the meeting, Ardern said: \u201cWhile in New Zealand we know we have more work to do on the issue of gun crime, we can share what we have learned through the changes we made.\u201d For New Zealand, the highest priorities was discussing trade, climate, and the security of the Indo-Pacific region, where China has become an increasingly muscular player. Biden emphasised that the US wanted to build relationships and \u201cwork together\u201d in the region. \u201cI want to emphasise the last point you made: \u201cworking together\u201d\u2026 We are not coming to dictate or lay down the law \u2026. We have more work to do in those Pacific islands,\u201d he said. Ardern said following the meeting that the conversation \u201ccame at a critical moment\u201d and the two leaders \u201crecommitted to working together, and alongside others, in the pursuit of peace and stability, and in defence of the international rules-based order\u201d. Senior administration officials said the pair had spoken for significantly longer than expected \u2013 scheduled for an hour, the meeting ran to 90 minutes. The pair also discussed the war in Ukraine, and trade partnerships, with Ardern urging Biden to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP)."

            "date": "2022-05-22T08:45:48Z",
            "content": "When Scott Morrison won Australia\u2019s federal election in 2019, it seemed like the country would never emerge from the climate wars that had begun a decade earlier. Morrison had taken the prime ministership late in 2018 after conservatives in the ruling Liberal-National Coalition deposed Malcolm Turnbull, in part, for his attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia\u2019s energy sector. After taking the top job, Morrison went on to weaponise climate action , falsely branding a modest policy by the Labor opposition to impose new vehicle emissions standards as a \u201cwar on the weekend\u201d. While electric vehicles are largely uncontroversial in Britain and other countries, Morrison\u2019s stylised \u201cwar\u201d was potent hyper-partisan politicking in a sprawling continent where electric vehicles are viewed through a prism of range anxiety. When he won in 2019, Morrison, a pentecostal Christian, characterised his victory as a \u201cmiracle\u201d. But the victory ultimately triggered a fundamental realignment in the Australian electorate. The harbinger of that realignment was Tony Abbott \u2013 the arch-conservative who once compared reducing carbon emissions to primitive people killing goats to appease the volcano gods \u2013 losing his blue-ribbon northern Sydney seat in the 2019 contest. The Coalition had perfected a formula of weaponising climate action effectively in the regions and outer suburbs of Australia. But while Labor was routed in that territory, centre-right progressive voters in capital cities were becoming frustrated with Morrison and the Coalition\u2019s failure to get serious about the existential problem of global heating. Electoral pressure began to mount on moderate Liberals in Australia\u2019s cities, and that pressure translated into a lobbying campaign by many government MPs to convince Morrison to adopt a target of net zero by 2050. Morrison was also under pressure from key allies including Boris Johnson and Joe Biden to make that mid-century commitment at the Glasgow climate conference in 2021. Morrison signed up to the 2050 target, but the Liberal\u2019s junior partner in the Coalition, the National party, refused to allow him to increase Australia\u2019s medium-term emissions reduction target \u2013 a weak target that had attracted significant international criticism. In a half-pregnant pivot, Morrison also declined to produce credible policy mechanisms to deliver emissions reduction. Morrison \u2013 a master of soundbite politics \u2013 had hoped to neutralise the growing city-based disaffection with slogans. The Coalition would make the transition to low emissions with technology, not taxes. But his failure to repent for past reckless behaviour infuriated many voters. Those voters parted ways with Morrison\u2019s government in Saturday\u2019s election, voting for a swathe of climate-focused independents in Liberal held seats. Understanding he was facing a \u201cteal wave\u201d (the new independents styled themselves in teal, adding a tinge of green to the Liberal party\u2019s traditional blue), Morrison attempted to emulate an Australian version of Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d strategy. During this year\u2019s contest, Morrison pursued Labor seats in the outer suburbs and regions, hoping gains would offset a loss of six seats. But the strategy backfired. The government lost the six seats, and several city electorates besides \u2013 and Labor will return to power in Australia for the first time in nearly a decade with a comprehensive electoral mandate to end the climate wars. The National party held its seats, but suffered negative swings in coal country in Queensland, and failed to pick up a Labor-held coal seat in the New South Wales Hunter Valley that it had poured resources into; and after two climate-focused independents ran creditable campaigns in regional Australia, two safe National party seats have been rendered marginal. The Coalition is shellshocked by the size and speed of Saturday\u2019s electoral rout, and the Liberal party will enter a period of soul-searching as moderates and rightwingers jostle about what lessons the party should learn from the visceral rebuff. Should the Liberal party seek to represent urban professionals, or should that constituency be left to Labor, Greens and the teal disrupters? As well as the backlash about climate action, Morrison also managed to alienate professional women with his inept handling of a cultural reckoning triggered by explosive allegations about the rape of a young Liberal staffer in the office of a junior defence minister in 2019. While the Liberal and National parties engage in soul-searching, Labor is returning to government in Canberra. The new Labor government will be led by Anthony Albanese, an urban progressive from inner-city Sydney. Albanese will be in Tokyo by Tuesday for his first meeting with Biden, and the leaders of Japan and India. The Labor leader is a parliamentary veteran. He was a senior minister in the last Labor government helmed by Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and was chief parliamentary tactician during the 43rd parliament, where Gillard lacked a working majority in either the House of Representatives or the Senate. He is a leftwinger who grew up with a single mother in council housing. He\u2019s an inclusive figure, who values empathy in his leadership style, but wary of being typecast as a firebrand, he also speaks the language of aspiration and opportunity. He comes to power in challenging times. Inflation and interest rates are rising, Australians are battling high petrol prices. Housing in the major cities has become unaffordable for a generation of young Australians. Australians have voted overwhelmingly for change and Albanese comes to government with a progressive agenda. But in Australia, like the rest of the world \u2013 events define prime ministers as much as their policy wish-lists."

            "content": "The Qatar World Cup is failing to live up to promises on reducing its carbon footprint, a new report has warned, creating another problem for the tournament. Organisers have claimed that the 32-team showpiece will be the first \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d World Cup, meaning any emissions would be limited and offset. However Carbon Market Watch (CMW), a not-for-profit organisation which works closely with the European Union, has examined the organisers\u2019 plans and says projected emissions have likely been underreported, with the footprint created from building seven new stadiums of particular concern. \u201cIt would be great to see the climate impact of Fifa World Cups being drastically reduced but the carbon neutrality claim that is being made is simply not credible,\u201d said Gilles Dufrasne of CMW, author of the analysis. \u201cDespite a lack of transparency, the evidence suggests that the emissions from this World Cup will be considerably higher than expected by the organisers, and the carbon credits being purchased to offset these emissions are unlikely to have a sufficiently positive impact on the climate.\u201d Central to CMW\u2019s complaint is its calculation that carbon emissions created by the new stadiums could be as much as eight times higher than the figures contained in Qatar\u2019s analysis. The CMW report claims the hosts have made a calculation which spreads a stadium\u2019s carbon footprint over its entire lifetime, something the report describes as \u201cproblematic\u201d. \u201cThese stadiums have been constructed specifically for the World Cup,\u201d CMW said. \u201cFuture extensive use of so many stadiums in such a small geographical space is uncertain, especially when considered against the fact that Doha had only one major stadium before it was awarded the World Cup.\u201d Further criticisms related to plans to absorb emissions with a large-scale \u201ctree and turf nursery\u201d. The CMW report claims this idea is \u201cnot credible\u201d because any absorption is \u201cunlikely to be permanent in these artificial and vulnerable green spaces\u201d. It also questions the carbon credit system Qatar plans to use to offset remaining emissions at the end of the event. The new format, known as the Global Carbon Council (GCC), was originally authorised by Qatari authorities and has different criteria to other established credit systems. It is being used in relation to only two other projects worldwide and has sold 130,000 credits. A minimum of 1.8 million are expected to be sold to the World Cup. A spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee, responsible for the delivery of the World Cup, said the country\u2019s commitment to a carbon-neutral World Cup should be \u201crecognised, rather than criticised\u201d and that the CMW criticisms were \u201cspeculative and inaccurate\u201d. It said that many trees from the nursery were endemic to the region, drought tolerant and would be replanted around stadium areas after the tournament. The GCC credit system, it said, was approved by a number of bodies, including the International Civilian Aviation Organisation, a UN agency. Fifa disputes the CMW analysis, saying it is not appropriate to calculate stadium emissions based only on their use at the World Cup and that \u201cdetailed legacy plans and business models\u201d for stadiums\u2019 use after the tournament are in place. \u201cThe organisers have pledged to measure, mitigate and offset all Fifa World Cup 2022 greenhouse gas emissions, while advancing low-carbon solutions in Qatar and the region,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThus, at no point has Fifa misled its stakeholders, as is claimed by the report. \u201cFifa is fully aware of the risks that mega-events pose on the economy, the natural environment and on people and communities. [It] has been making efforts to tackle those impacts and use opportunities that arise to mitigate the negative impacts and maximise the positive impacts of its iconic tournament.\u201d"

            "content": "Many of the UK\u2019s top scientists working on carbon capture technologies do not believe they will be developed and scaled up in time to reach net zero and limit global heating to 1.5C. Experts speaking at a Greenhouse Gas Removal Hub event in London warned that these techniques, including direct air capture, biofuels, biochar, afforestation and enhanced weathering, are not a silver bullet and should make up just a fraction of the efforts to decarbonise. Event organisers polled attendees (mostly scientific researchers, plus a handful of government officials and journalists) on whether they believed the carbon removal targets would be met. Of the 114 who voted, 57% said they were \u201cnot confident\u201d the UK would meet the 2030 goals in the net zero strategy of 5m tonnes of engineered greenhouse gas removal, and 30,000 hectares a year of tree planting; 25% said they were quite confident, and 11% said there was no chance. The scientists are taking part in a \u00a370m government-funded competition to find the best ways to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. These technologies are due to begin removing vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2030, with the hope being that the winning methods could be scaled up and ready for market in two years\u2019 time. The government appears, on the whole, to be confident that carbon capture methods will be developed fairly rapidly. The Department for Transport has stated, for example, that greenhouse gas removal (GGR) technologies will enable Britons to take \u201cguilt-free flights\u201d by the end of next year, but those involved in the programme were less optimistic. But when shown a press release from the government declaring that these technologies will enable net zero flights by 2023, Prof Mark Taylor, the deputy director of energy innovation at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), seemed sceptical. He told the Guardian: \u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case. We\u2019ve got to get people to believe this can work, but maybe that claim is a little bit cheeky.\u201d Gideon Henderson, the chief scientist at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: \u201cGGR is hard and expensive. And we cannot afford to see it as a surrogate to compensate for continued emissions in sectors that can be decarbonised. It is not an excuse not to decarbonise, so we must drive down emissions anyway.\u201d By far the most popular technology based on applications to the programme was direct air capture. This process involves removing carbon from the air, usually using giant fans, and heating it to a very high temperature. This carbon can then be stored in geological formations or combined with hydrogen to create synthetic fuels. While ministers like this idea, those leading the programme believe it may not be the answer, due to the energy intensity required and how expensive it is. Taylor said: \u201cPeople see it as having the biggest market, there\u2019s been funding from American companies \u2013 it feels like a silver bullet, there are lots of people who like it. Ministers like it because they think: \u2018Oh, that sounds easy, you can take it out the air and that\u2019s it.\u2019 And that\u2019s the thing that gets investment. \u201cI\u2019m very much on the fence as to whether it is the best solution. It\u2019s very, very expensive. So some of the other technologies may emerge as winners, but the good thing about our competition is we pick the best one.\u201d The Guardian approached BEIS for comment. Greenhouse gas removal methods being trialled with UK funding Afforestation Henderson said this is the \u201cposter child\u201d of GGR, because \u201ceveryone seems to love it, and it\u2019s nice to have more trees\u201d. However, he said trees \u201care not a panacea\u201d because of the amount of land they need, which is taken out of food production, which then causes tensions with food security. There is also a tension between woodland, which has more biodiversity benefits but is slower growing, and forests, which grow quickly and lock in more carbon sooner. Storing in soil While storing carbon in soil is a popular method, according to Henderson there are concerns over how long the carbon can be stored in the soil and how it is measured. If the soil begins to release carbon again shortly after it is stored, this could cause problems, especially if it is not being measured effectively and counted in net zero targets. He explained: \u201cI think that if we see significant financial resources coming into this area to incentivise storing soil carbon without being able to measure it, and being sure of its permanence, there\u2019s a risk of continued emission from storage which isn\u2019t permanent or sufficiently well measured.\u201d Enhanced weathering Dropping tiny rock particles into the sea in order to cause chemical reactions that lock carbon in the ocean is potentially a very exciting technology, but it is in an earlier stage than many of the other carbon capture methods. It has interesting potential, as the ocean stores carbon in higher concentrations than in the air. There is even hope that it could help to reverse ocean acidification. However there are also concerns that the process could upset the delicate balance of the oceans. Direct air capture The idea of a machine that can suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and stick it permanently in rocks is a very attractive one, and it is perhaps unsurprising that this is the most popular technology for scientists trying to solve this problem. But it is currently a very energy intensive process. Taylor explained: \u201cWe need to use energy to extract the CO2, the pure stream CO2 from the solid, so what we\u2019re looking for an integration that can drive down the costs of DAC, and particularly drive down the cost of extracting the CO2 and the energy costs of extracting the CO2. Because at the moment, there\u2019s no point in capturing CO2 from the air and then using natural gas to run a heat process to extract a pure CO2 stream.\u201d Biofuels While Henderson pointed out that this is carbon storage that is already happening at some scale in the UK, and could be \u201ca really potent form of greenhouse gas removal\u201d, there are concerns over biodiversity and pressure on land use. This is because growing the crops often creates a monoculture, and this land is taken out of production for food. Biochar Biochar is a stable, long-lived, charcoal-like product produced from heating biomass in the absence of oxygen. It is carbon-rich and can be applied to land to sequester CO2 in soils for an extended period of time. This could be relatively easy and cheap, but there are concerns as to how long the carbon would be stored, and whether it would have any negative impacts on the soil. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 May 2022. References to \u201cadvanced weathering\u201d were changed to enhanced weathering, and detail was added about poll participants."

The study from Element Energy, which has worked for the government and the climate change committee in the past, says instead of focusing on such unreliable future developments, ministers should work to reduce the overall number of flights and halt airport expansion over the next few years. The report, released on Monday, was commissioned by the Aviation Environment Federation (AEF) and comes as five regional airports are in the process of seeking approval to expand. In addition, Gatwick and Luton have announced they will be submitting major applications later this year, while Heathrow has not abandoned its plans for a third runway. AEF\u2019s policy director, Cait Hewitt, said the findings showed the government\u2019s plan amounted to \u201csitting back and allowing both airports and emissions to grow in the short term while hoping for future technologies and fuels to save the day\u201d. \u201cThese expansion plans will generate millions of tonnes of additional CO2 each year,\u201d she added. \u201cUntil the government sets out a realistic net zero trajectory for the sector, and the industry is on track to outperform it, additional airport capacity should be off the agenda.\u201d The government\u2019s jet zero initiative was launched two years ago and is part of a raft of policies that aim to get UK emissions to net zero by 2050. Boris Johnson announced the proposals, declaring a goal of a commercial transatlantic flight that produces no carbon emissions by 2025, a claim that was widely dismissed by experts as a gimmick. The report adds weight to concerns about the viability of the government\u2019s plans, stating that it is unclear how the Department for Transport would \u201cdeliver the technological improvements\u201d it was relying on in terms of sustainable fuel and aircraft efficiencies. It concluded that ministers should instead aim to reduce the number of flights now \u2013 halting airport expansion plans, expanding carbon pricing and taxing frequent flyers and kerosene. Hewitt said: \u201c[There is] a need for action now, including ruling out airport expansion and limiting demand, to ensure aviation makes a fair contribution to cutting emissions by 2035 and is on a pathway to net zero by 2050.\u201d A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cWe are anti aviation emissions, not anti-flying - we must reduce emissions from aviation whilst retaining our ability to fly. \u201cOur analysis suggests that the aviation sector can achieve Jet Zero without the Government needing to intervene directly to limit aviation growth, with net zero targets achieved by focusing on new fuels and technology, with knock-on economic and social benefits, rather than capping demand.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-11T16:44:09Z",
            "content": "Lawmakers in the European parliament have called for a faster reduction in car pollution to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles in Europe. Last year the European Commission proposed an end to new cars powered by petrol or diesel by 2035, as part of its far-reaching green deal, the EU response to the climate crisis. In a vote on Wednesday, the European parliament\u2019s environment committee backed that 2035 target, but said carmakers should meet an interim goal of a 20% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 to speed up the shift from petrol and diesel. In a blow to green campaigners, an amendment proposing a target of a 75% reduction in emissions by 2030 was rejected. The vote is not final, but a crucial step ahead of negotiations between MEPs and ministers from the 27 EU member states. Carmakers currently have to ensure that their average fleet of new cars emits no more than 95 grams of C02 a kilometre. The equivalent target for vans is 147g CO2/km. The European parliament argued that carmakers need tougher short-term targets to reduce emissions \u201cto accelerate the update of zero-emission vehicles\u201d. To this end, MEPs proposed interim targets for 2025 and 2030. The commission had proposed a 55% reduction for cars and 50% for vans by 2030. Phasing out petrol and diesel cars is seen as a crucial component in cutting pollution from transport, the only economic sector where emissions have been rising. Road transport accounts for 20% of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and fuels toxic air pollution. Cars and vans are the single largest source of nitrogen dioxide pollution, linked to the deaths of 40,400 people in the EU a year, according to the European Environment Agency. The car industry is also one of the EU\u2019s biggest employers, supporting 14.6m direct and indirect jobs including manufacturing, sales and transport services. The proposals for tighter regulations are being closely watched by EU governments. To avoid economic hardship, the MEPs have urged the EU executive to create a special fund to help small and medium-sized firms that are dependent on manufacturing parts for internal combustion engine vehicles. Pascal Canfin, the centrist French MEP who chairs the environment committee, told reporters before the vote that a \u201cjust transition fund\u201d totalling several billion euros would be needed. He said the sum was \u201cnot huge\u201d for the EU, but necessary to support firms that faced \u201ca massive shift of their business model\u201d. The UK has promised to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, although hybrid models can still be produced until 2035, a significant concession for the car industry. The EU\u2019s CO2 and cars regulation is one of a dozen proposals that make up the EU\u2019s green deal. Other elements include an expansion of renewable energy, an overhaul of the EU emissions trading scheme that caps industrial pollution and a heavily criticised forest protection strategy. All the legal proposals must be agreed by the European parliament and EU council of ministers before coming into force, making the coming months a crunch period for the union\u2019s green ambitions. In a sign of the political divisions over the EU green agenda, the CO2 and cars vote passed via a left-liberal-green coalition with 46 votes in favour, while 40 MEPs from the centre-right and nationalist parties voted against, and two abstained. The text will be voted on by the full European parliament in June. Campaigners urged the EU to set more demanding emissions-reduction targets to speed up the transition to electric vehicles by the end of the decade. \u201cThe EV boom will falter for the next 10 years unless lawmakers step in with an interim target in 2027 and a more ambitious goal in 2030, \u201c said Alex Keynes at Transport and Environment. \u201cWithout it, Europe may not sell enough zero-emissions cars to meet its own 2030 goals as well as those of many EU countries.\u201d"

            "content": "Britain\u2019s cybersecurity unit has reported a record crackdown on internet scams after tackling more than 2.7m attempted frauds last year, a near-fourfold increase on the figure for 2020. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), an arm of the GCHQ spy agency, said the interrupted scams included fake celebrity endorsements and bogus extortion emails. It stressed, however, that the increase in detection reflected aggressive targeting by the unit rather than an increase in scams. Lindy Cameron, the NCSC\u2019s chief executive, said one foiled scam involved a fraudster attempting to impersonate her. \u201cWe know that scammers will go to great lengths, and indeed my name has been used to try to trick people, but as we continue to expand our defences we can see the tangible impact this is having,\u201d she said. The scams were tackled under the agency\u2019s active cyberdefence programme, which targets high-volume attacks on members of the public, companies and organisations. The attacks include phishing campaigns in which the victim is tricked, often via email, into downloading malware or handing over their login details. Covid-19 triggered a surge in NHS-related scams, the NCSC said. It removed more than 1,400 NHS-themed phishing campaigns last year, an 11-fold increase on 2020, including fake messages about vaccine rollouts and certificates. The attempted Cameron scam was a fake email purporting to be from the NCSC chief informing the recipient that the unit had prevented \u00a35m of their money from being stolen and that they should reply with personal information to get it back. The fake celebrity endorsements included a \u201cspecial report\u201d, published on a fake BBC news page, with the headline \u201cJeremy Clarkson gives British people the opportunity to make millions from home\u201d, illustrated with photos not of the former Top Gear host but of the This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield instead. The other type of scam targeted aggressively by the NCSC last year, bogus extortion emails, involve falsely claiming a victim\u2019s email has been hacked and saying they need to pay money. Scam adverts will be included in the scope of the forthcoming online safety bill, meaning that the largest social media platforms will be required to prevent paid-for fraudulent adverts appearing on their sites. This includes adverts carrying fake celebrity endorsements."

            "date": "2022-05-15T15:15:51Z",
            "content": "The use of Pegasus spyware to target Catalan independence leaders and Spanish politicians \u2013 including the prime minister \u2013 has plunged Spain into a \u201ccrisis of democracy\u201d and national security that can be tackled only with an independent investigation, a leading cybersecurity expert has warned. Last month, researchers at the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab revealed that at least 65 individuals connected with the Catalan independence movement had been targeted with spyware between 2017 and 2020. A fortnight later, the Spanish government announced that the phones of the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and the defence minister, Margarita Robles, had been hacked with Pegasus in May and June last year. Although the Spanish government attempted to defuse the row by sacking the country\u2019s spy chief, Paz Esteban, earlier this week, the twin scandal is refusing to fade away. Ron Deibert, the director of the Citizen Lab, said he had been shocked to discover Pegasus being used against political targets and their families as well as against lawyers and journalists in what was meant to be \u201can ostensibly democratic\u201d society. According to its makers, the Israeli NSO Group, the spyware is sold only to governments to help them track criminals and terrorists. Deibert told the Guardian that firing Esteban did not come close to addressing the disturbing questions raised by recent revelations. \u201cRemoving the intelligence chief looks to me like putting someone forward as a sacrificial lamb,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t answer any of the questions of who purchased the spyware, who authorised it, how was the justification given to go after people who are clearly not legitimate targets by any reasonable international standard, and involving gross violations of privacy rights. If the intent is to make this move and hope that the issue goes away, I think that\u2019s inadequate.\u201d The Citizen Lab chief said last month\u2019s report underscored the urgent need for the setting up of an independent commission that had the authority to investigate what had happened and to suggest reforms to prevent it from happening again. \u201cI think that\u2019s even more necessary now in light of the dramatic findings that the prime minister and the defence minister\u2019s own phones were hacked with Pegasus,\u201d said Deibert. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? If I was a Spanish citizen, I would be demanding that there be such an impartial inquiry. But it seems like that\u2019s maybe not going to happen.\u201d A fortnight ago, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE) joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed as an internal investigation by Spain\u2019s national intelligence centre was already underway, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman. Deibert, who was in Spain this week, said he had been surprised by the complacency he had encountered and disappointed that many people in the country appeared to have no problem with the targeting of the Catalan leaders. For many in Spain, the regional independence movement \u2013 which attempted a unilateral, illegal bid to secede in October 2017 \u2013 remains a direct challenge to the \u201cindissoluble unity\u201d of the country that is enshrined in the constitution. For Deibert, however, the issue transcends national politics. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling people that if they draw the conclusion that this is a Catalan issue and they can maybe dismiss it as such, or put it in a little box and frame it that way, they\u2019re grossly mistaken,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me what this illustrates is that you have this extraordinarily powerful surveillance technology \u2013 and a market that\u2019s supplying it that\u2019s almost entirely unregulated \u2013 being used by governments, as this case illustrates, that are unaccountable and have major public accountability and oversight problems. And so this is really a crisis of democracy \u2013 that\u2019s the way I think about it \u2013 in Spain.\u201d Deibert also hit back at suggestions that the Citizen Lab\u2019s investigations were biased and had been compromised by the fact that one of its researchers, Elies Campo, had himself been targeted using spyware because of his apparent links to the independence movement. Deibert said Campo had been the victim of a \u201cfrankly baseless and really outrageous smear campaign\u201d. He also said that he had been deeply troubled to discover that Campo\u2019s father, a prominent doctor, had been targeted on his official hospital-issued phone, which would have contained sensitive medical information. Deibert said he rejected any suggestions that the Citizen Lab was politically motivated or somehow beholden to the Catalan independence movement. \u201cWe\u2019re not a company, we never do commissioned research, we\u2019re impartial, and we\u2019re a university-based research group that\u2019s run and supervised by me, the principal investigator, who manages every aspect of this project from beginning to end,\u201d he said. While the Spanish government has refused to speculate on who may be responsible for targeting the phones of S\u00e1nchez and Robles, referring only to \u201cillicit\u201d and \u201cexternal\u201d attacks, fingers have been pointed in the direction of Morocco, which was engaged in a tense diplomatic standoff with Spain when the hacks took place. A data leak at the heart of the Pegasus investigation revealed more than 200 Spanish mobile numbers were selected as possible targets for surveillance in 2019 by an NSO Group client believed to be Morocco, but Morocco has denied spying on any foreign leaders using Pegasus, and has said reporters were \u201cincapable of proving [the country had] any relationship\u201d with NSO. Deibert said that, while he had no information on those attacks, there were two possible scenarios: that it was a foreign government, possibly Morocco; or that it was a \u201crogue domestic agency\u201d operating against the state. \u201cGiven what I\u2019ve seen in Spain, that\u2019s an entirely plausible scenario,\u201d he said. \u201cBoth cases \u2013 both hypotheses \u2013 point towards the urgent need for an independent, impartial inquiry.\u201d"

For all the detailed news on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, please consult our global war blog here. Here are the main events that occurred today: The White House is making efforts to communicate that Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell may disagree on what the problems are at the root of America\u2019s repeated mass shootings, but the US president can still call the Senate majority leader a \u201crational Republican\u201d and try to find common ground on gun violence.

Joe Biden has been speaking at the White House with Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, ahead of their mini-summit.

Kentucky Republican McConnell, and many Republican leaders, including in Texas where the small city of Uvalde is devastated by last week\u2019s school shooting, continually hone in on mental health issues and a need for more school security. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted that: \u201cWe are the only country that is dealing with gun violence at the rate we are, so what\u2019s the problem here? The problem is with guns and not having legislation to deal with something that\u2019s a pandemic here.\u201d Biden spoke at length yesterday outside the White House, as he returned from Delaware the day after he\u2019d visited Uvalde, about how the idea of 18-year-olds legally being able to buy military-style assault rifles in the US - the weapons used in the Uvalde massacre and the racist attack on a supermarket in a majority-Black neighborhood of Buffalo, New York, days before - made no sense. Jean-Pierre noted that Republicans\u2019 insistence on mental health and \u201chardening schools\u201d and away from great gun control are \u201ctwo things he [Biden] does not agree on [with McConnell].\u201d But she added: \u201cBut I think there is a way potentially for the Senate to come together and legislation to come together, they need to.\u201d A group of Senate Democrats and Republicans are currently discussing on Capitol Hill the potential for a bipartisan \u201csignificant package\u201d of measures, according to Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy. But indications are that any such bill will include a collection of more minor measures, not sweeping change such as an assault weapons ban, freshly urged upon by US vice president Kamala Harris on Saturday when she attended the last funeral for the 10 people killed in Buffalo. Karine Jean-Pierre says Biden is \u201cconsidering\u201d more executive actions on gun reforms following the mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, but did not give details of what they might be. She confirmed that the president, and a White House team, is also discussing legislation with lawmakers: He\u2019s calling on Congress to act. He\u2019s hopeful, he wants to make sure there\u2019s action. The President has done everything he can from from the federal government. We are looking at other executive actions that we could possibly do. But it\u2019s not up to him alone. He cannot do this alone. Congress needs to act. White House economic adviser Brian Deese followed the band to report on Joe Biden\u2019s lunchtime meeting with the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, and treasury secretary, Janet Yellen. \u201cI get to go home and tell my kids that BTS opened for me,\u201d he jokes. Deese says Biden underscored that he respects the independence of the federal reserve and will give the fed the space and independence it needs to tackle inflation. \u201cIt\u2019s a global challenge,\u201d Deese says of inflation. \u201cIt\u2019s hitting American families and creating anxiety and economic hardship. He [Biden] gets this\u201d. But he says because of Biden\u2019s economic achievements, and US economic strengths including a robust jobs market, few countries are better placed for the challenge ahead. He predicts the recovery moving forward will look different than it has so far. \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon and we have to move and shift to stable and resilient growth,\u201d Deese adds, noting that the recovery since the Covid-19 pandemic has been at a furious pace. Soaring gas and food prices remain Biden\u2019s top economic priority, Deese says. \u201cHe\u2019s focused on the right policy decisions and choices. We have to address this issue, we need some help working with Congress\u201d. An interpreter has now kindly informed us what the BTS band members were saying. [Update: The speed of the English interpretation after the band had finished speaking meant I was unable to report with certainty which comments should be attributed to which band members. My colleague David Smith, who attended the briefing in person and had access to an official transcript, later wrote this outstanding piece on the BTS visit which gives you the fuller picture.] Jungkook, although it might have been J-Hope, said: \u201cToday is the last day of AA and NHPI heritage month (Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander), we join the White House to stand with the AA and HPI community and to celebrate\u201d. The interpreter has raced through the names, and this blogger can\u2019t determine if he said Jimmy or Ji-min, so either Kim Seok-jin (known as Jinny) or Park Ji-min said: \u201cWe were devastated by the recent surge of hate crimes, including Asian American hate crimes, [it\u2019s time] to put a stop on this and support the cause. We\u2019d like to take this opportunity to voice ourselves once again\u201d. Another band member who probably was Jungkook said: \u201cWe still feel surprised that music created by South Korean artists reaches so many people around the world, transcending languages and cultural barriers. We believe music is always an amazing and wonderful unifier of all things\u201d. The band were hustled out as reporters shouted questions to them in vain. The seven members of K-pop band BTS are flanking White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, wearing black suits and looking more like a security detail than pop stars. \u201cIt is a great honor to be invited to the White House to discuss important issues of anti-Asian hate crimes, Asian inclusion and diversity,\u201d the first band member says in perfect English. A second band member steps up and speaks in Korean, as do the others, one by one. There seems to be no interpreter, but they look very earnest in what they\u2019re saying. The English-speaking band member returns: We thank President Biden and the White House for giving us this important opportunity to speak about these important causes and remind ourselves of what we can do as artists. One of the most extraordinary White House press briefings in recent memory is about to get under way, with South Korean K-pop band BTS set to take the podium with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. The popular music combination is in town to meet with Joe Biden and discuss \u201cthe need to come together in solidarity, Asian inclusion and representation, and addressing anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination\u201d. You can watch it live here. There\u2019s been reaction to the acquittal earlier today of Michael Sussmann, a lawyer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, who was accused of lying to the FBI. Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse in Washington DC, Sussmann said he \u201ctold the truth to the FBI, and the jury clearly recognized that with their unanimous verdict today\u201d. Sussmann was accused of concealing from the FBI that he was working for the Clinton campaign when he met with the bureau\u2019s general counsel James Baker in September 2016 and handed over documents purporting to show links between the rival campaign of Donald Trump and Russia. Sussmann added: \u201cDespite being falsely accused, I am relieved that justice ultimately prevailed in this case\u201d. In a statement, special counsel John Durham, who was appointed three years ago to search for government misconduct during the investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s campaign, effectively investigating the investigators, said he and his team were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the verdict. \u201cWhile we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury\u2019s decision and thank them for their service,\u201d Durham said. \u201cI also want to recognize and thank the investigators and the prosecution team for their dedicated efforts in seeking truth and justice in this case\u201d.

Trey Ganem, his son Billy and their team at SoulShine Industries of Edna, Texas, donated, constructed and painted 19 caskets in three days. \u201cWe\u2019re creating the last thing that the parents can ever do for their child,\u201d Ganem told NewsNation.

Here\u2019s where things stand in the US: US supreme court clerks may be required to release their phone records as the investigation into who leaked the Roe v Wade opinion draft widens. A lawyer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, Michael Sussmann, was acquitted Tuesday of lying to the FBI when he pushed information meant to cast suspicions on Donald Trump and Russia in the run-up to that election. Joe Biden has been speaking at the White House with Jacinda Ardern, the New Zealand prime minister, ahead of their mini-summit. The US president is meeting with Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, today to discuss the economy in the US and globally, and what steps can be taken to ease inflation and lower prices. Biden is calling the issue his \u201ctop domestic priority\u201d. An emergency gun reform package, the Protecting Our Kids Act, will be presented to the House judiciary committee on Thursday as politicians grapple with the aftermath of mass shootings in New York and Texas this month that killed 31 people, including 19 elementary school children. In an unprecedented move, US supreme court clerks may be required to release their phone records as the investigation into who leaked the Roe v Wade opinion draft widens. The possible mandated release of private cell records and signed affidavits, reported by CNN, is reportedly causing some clerks to consider retaining legal counsel. The leaked draft on abortion, which was first published by Politico on 2 May, sparked outrage across the nation as it appeared to show that the conservative majority on the court is prepared to roll back federal abortion protections. In the following weeks, an investigation into who leaked the draft has intensified. The chief justice, John Roberts, has met with the clerks in a group, but it is unclear whether any individual interviews have taken place. The request for phone records is the most significant development in the investigation to date, with legal observers noting that the intrusion could cause the clerks to seek counsel.

The jury in the case of Michael Sussmann deliberated on Friday afternoon and Tuesday morning before reaching its verdict, the Associated Press said. The case was the first courtroom test of special counsel John Durham since his appointment three years ago to search for government misconduct during the investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. The verdict represents a significant setback for Durham\u2019s work, the AP says, especially since Trump supporters had looked to the probe to expose what they contend was sweeping wrongdoing by the FBI. In the indictment filed in September 2021, Sussmann was accused of falsely telling FBI general counsel James Baker in September 2016 that he did not represent any client when he met him to give the bureau white papers and other data files containing evidence of questionable cyber links between the Trump Organization and a Russia-based bank. The indictment alleged that in fact Sussmann had turned over this information not as a \u201cgood citizen\u201d but rather, as an attorney representing a US technology executive, an internet company and Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Trump is suing Clinton, the Democratic National Committee and other people and entities tied to the investigation of Russian election interference in 2016, claiming they attempted to rig the election he won.

The president recalled his visit Sunday to Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman murdered 19 children and two teachers exactly one week ago. Biden told Ardern: There\u2019s an expression by an Irish poet that says \u2018too long a suffering makes a stone of the heart\u2019. Well, there\u2019s an awful lot of suffering. I\u2019ve been to more mass shooting aftermaths than I think any president in American history, unfortunately, and so much of it is preventable. The devastation is amazing. People sat in a room, about 250 in a large room with me, for almost four hours.... nobody left, they waited until the very end. Their pain is palpable. Biden thanked Ardern for New Zealand\u2019s \u201csignificant support\u201d in efforts to isolate Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, and said the two leaders had \u201ca lot to talk about\u201d. Footnote: the poem Biden was (mis)quoting is Easter, 1916 by William Butler Yeats. The exact line is: \u201cToo long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart. O when may it suffice?\u201d Recent revelations that Democratic West Virginia senator Joe Manchin quietly made millions from his coal business could come back to haunt him as he eyes a run for re-election. Chris McGreal reports: Nancy Hilsbos, a former coalminer living in the West Virginia county that Senator Joe Manchin calls home, barely noticed the nondescript office block she passed almost daily. The property, at the top of a rise on the road out of the small city of Fairmont, bears a large sign: \u201cManchin Professional Building\u201d. Nameplates announce the offices of accountants, financial advisers and insurers. But there is no mention of the most profitable and influential company registered at the address \u2013 the Democratic senator\u2019s own firm, Enersystems. Manchin was recently revealed to have quietly made millions of dollars from Enersystems over the past three decades as the only supplier of a low grade coal to a high-polluting power plant near Fairmont. That came as news to Hilsbos and just about everyone else in the city. \u201cWhat surprised me was that we didn\u2019t know it. One of the most shocking things was that I\u2019ve driven by that place thousands of times in the last 30 years and I had no idea that\u2019s where his business operation was headquartered because there\u2019s no sign,\u201d said Hilsbos. \u201cI wonder why he\u2019s not prouder of what he\u2019s done. Why doesn\u2019t he have a big sign that says Enersystems?\u201d In 2020, Manchin earned nearly half a million dollars from the company, and $5.6m over the previous decade. But Hilsbos, who worked underground for 13 years and was also a union activist, is less bothered by the senator keeping the source of his wealth shielded than by what else may have been hidden from view. For years, Manchin has justified voting against curbs on the burning of fossil fuels and other measures to tackle the climate crisis on the grounds that they were bad for West Virginia, whose economy and culture are rooted in coal mining. Last year, he used his vote in a hung US Senate to block President Biden\u2019s $3.5tn economic plan in part because he said he was \u201cvery, very disturbed\u201d that its climate provisions would kill the coal industry. But after the revelations that Manchin has made what most West Virginians would regard as a fortune from the Grant Town power plant, Hilsbos was left wondering if US climate policy, and by extension the global response to the crisis, has been held hostage to the senator\u2019s financial interests. Read the full story: We don\u2019t usually celebrate birthdays here in the blog, but we\u2019re prepared to make an exception for the Lincoln Memorial, which on Monday reached the grand old age of 100. Dedicated in May 1922 to celebrate the 16th president Abraham Lincoln, the monument has taken on far more significance over the last century. We couldn\u2019t put it any better than the National Parks Service in its description of the memorial, taken from an NPS website page celebrating the centenary: As one of the most recognized buildings in the world, the Lincoln Memorial has become a symbol of the United States of America, a backdrop for national celebrations and the nation\u2019s pre-eminent stage for the rallies and demonstration, particularly those for civil rights. The Washington DC memorial has seen plenty of presidents come and go since the time of Warren G Harding, the 29th US president who was in the White House when it was dedicated. The most recent changeover was, of course, Donald Trump\u2019s succession by Joe Biden, courtesy of his November 2020 defeat that he continues to argue. Trump used the monument as a political prop during his single term of office. Let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane to May 2020 and recall how \u201cDishonest Don\u201d was made to look small by positioning himself in front of the colossal structure, as told by Guardian US columnist Richard Wolffe. Peter Navarro, a top White House adviser to Donald Trump, revealed in a court filing on Monday that he had been ordered to testify before a federal grand jury and produce to prosecutors any records concerning January 6, including communications with the former president. The grand jury subpoena to Navarro, which he said was served by two FBI agents last week, compels him to produce documents to the US attorney for the District of Columbia and could indicate widening justice department action ensnaring senior Trump administration officials. Navarro\u2019s disclosure about the subpoena came in a 88-page filing that seeks a federal court to declare the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack unlawful in a desperate move to stop a potential contempt of Congress indictment for defying the panel\u2019s subpoena. The grand jury subpoena appeared to be part of a case to hold Navarro in contempt rather than pertaining to the justice department\u2019s criminal investigation into the Capitol attack, though the exact nature of the justice department subpoena was not immediately clear. But the new filing, reviewed by the Guardian, that Navarro will submit to the US district court for the District of Columbia, is not expected to succeed beyond causing a nuisance and potentially delaying the justice department from moving on a contempt indictment. The filing is seeking the court to rule that the select committee is not properly constituted and therefore illegal, because the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, refused last year to appoint some Republican members put forward by the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy. Since the panel supposedly lacks a Republican minority \u2013 despite the presence of Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger \u2013 its subpoenas are unenforceable, the suit argues, and therefore his non-compliance with his subpoena is immaterial and should mean the justice department cannot act on a referral for contempt of Congress. Read the full story: Soaring inflation is on Joe Biden\u2019s agenda today as he turns his attention back to what he\u2019s calling his \u201ctop domestic priority\u201d. The president will meet Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, early this afternoon to discuss the economy in the US and globally, and what steps can be taken to ease inflation and lower prices. According to Politico, the meeting with Powell, the first since he was re-confirmed by the Senate a week ago to serve a second term in charge of the central bank, is part of a month-long White House effort to talk up Biden\u2019s economic successes. It began with an op-ed penned by Biden in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, in which he laid out a plan for tackling high prices: I ran for president because I was tired of the so-called trickle-down economy. We now have a chance to build on a historic recovery with an economy that works for working families. The most important thing we can do now to transition from rapid recovery to stable, steady growth is to bring inflation down. That is why I have made tackling inflation my top economic priority. Polls show economic concerns are the single biggest issue facing voters as November\u2019s midterm elections approach, and Biden\u2019s ratings are at the lowest levels of his presidency, according to FiveThirtyEight. Inflation reached the highest level in more than 40 years last month, and although it has eased slightly since, consumers are still paying record high gas prices, which surpassed $4.62 today for the first time, the AAA said. Biden has blamed Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine for what he calls \u201c[Vladimir] Putin\u2019s price hike\u201d. Powell has said interest rates could rise by a half percentage point in June and July to help cool inflation. Ahead of today\u2019s meeting, the Associated Press said, Biden promised not to interfere in the Fed\u2019s decision-making, but suggested that he and Powell are aligned on addressing inflation. On Friday, Biden will deliver remarks on the May jobs report, highlighting \u201cthe remarkable progress we\u2019ve made in getting Americans back to work \u201c. Texas leaders are under growing pressure to increase gun control measures in the face of data indicating the state leads the US in mass shooting deaths, while Republicans have steadily eased restrictions on weapons and cut mental health spending. As the funerals of the 19 children and two teachers begin on Tuesday in the tiny, devastated southern Texas city of Uvalde, a week after a shooting at Robb elementary school, state Democrats \u2013 and some Republicans \u2013 are demanding a special legislative action. Right-leaning Republican governor Greg Abbott has been asked to convene a special legislative session to weigh legislation, with state senate Democrats calling for increasing the age for buying any gun to 21. They also want to mandate background checks for all gun sales, and regulate civilian ownership of high capacity magazines, the Austin ABC affiliate KVUE reported. They are also calling for \u201cred flag\u201d legislation that would permit the temporary removal of guns from persons who present an \u201cimminent danger to themselves and others\u201d and are urging a law to require a \u201ccooling off\u201d period when buying a gun. \u201cWe have to do something, man,\u201d Democratic state senator Roland Gutierrez, whose district covers Uvalde, said to Abbott at a press conference. \u201cYour own colleagues are telling me, calling me, and telling me an 18-year-old shouldn\u2019t have a gun.\u201d Read the full story: An emergency gun reform package will be presented to the House judiciary committee on Thursday as politicians grapple with the aftermath of mass shootings in New York and Texas this month that killed 31 people, including 19 elementary school children. The eight-piece Protecting Our Kids Act, as Democrats are calling it, includes raising the minimum age of purchase for assault weapons to 21, background checks for \u201cghost\u201d guns, and stricter requirements for safe gun storage. There would also be new federal offenses for the sale, manufacture or possession of high-capacity magazines; and for the trafficking and straw purchases of weapons. It doesn\u2019t include an outright ban on assault weapons, which many gun reform activists have called for following the massacres in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. But Democrats behind the push, which is taking place during congressional recess, say they\u2019re not ruling it out. According to Punchbowl, Nancy Pelosi plans to bring the measures for a House vote next week, and the speaker is confident she has the votes to pass them. Achieving the necessary 60 votes in the Senate, however, is unlikely given Republicans\u2019 traditional hostility to gun law reform, but Pelosi and her leadership team felt they had to act after the mass killings, both committed by teenagers with legally-held weapons. Separately, bipartisan talks between senators on gun controls will take place over Zoom today, with Texas Republican John Cornyn leading negotiations for his side. On Monday at the White House, Joe Biden expressed his hope that \u201crational Republicans\u201d including Cornyn and senate minority leader Mitch McConnell could finally help get something done on gun reforms: I think things have gotten so bad that everybody is getting more rational about it. At least that\u2019s my hope. Here\u2019s my colleague Lauren Gambino on the challenge of getting gun reform legislation through a bitterly divided Congress: Good morning, and welcome to Tuesday\u2019s US politics blog. We begin with some breaking news, courtesy of Punchbowl\u2026 the House judiciary committee has called an emergency meeting for Thursday to try to progress what\u2019s being called an omnibus package of gun control measures in the wake of this month\u2019s mass shootings in Buffalo, New York; and Uvalde, Texas. The eight-piece Protecting Our Kids Act covers a range of restrictions including raising the minimum age of purchase for assault weapons to 21, background checks for \u201cghost\u201d guns and stricter requirements for gun storage. Punchbowl says. What it doesn\u2019t include: an assault weapons ban, although Democrats say they\u2019re not ruling that out. And because the package stands little to no chance of reaching the required 60 votes in the Senate, thanks to Republican opposition, some Democrats want it split into individual bills. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators will meet over Zoom to talk about gun reforms today. What we\u2019re also watching: Joe Biden meets with Jerome Powell, chair of the federal reserve, and treasury secretary Janet Yellen this afternoon as he turns his attention back to the inflation crisis. The White House has launched a month-long campaign to talk up his administration\u2019s economic achievements, according to Politico. Biden will meet New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern at the White House this morning. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will host a briefing at 2.30pm. South Korean K-pop band BTS will visit the White House at 3pm to discuss with Biden \u201cthe need to come together in solidarity, Asian inclusion and representation, and addressing anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination\u201d."

            "title": "Russian hackers targeting opponents of Ukraine invasion, warns GCHQ chief",
            "date": "2022-05-10T08:58:16Z",
            "content": "Russian hackers are seeking to target western countries supporting Ukraine in its efforts to resist Moscow\u2019s invasion, the head of GCHQ has said. Jeremy Fleming, the director of the British spy agency, said in a speech on Tuesday morning that while fears of a fully fledged online war between Russia and Ukraine had perhaps failed to materialise, there remained \u201cplenty\u201d of cyber activity as part of the conflict. As well as affecting Ukraine directly, there had been \u201csome spillover of activity affecting other countries\u201d, Fleming said, and evidence that Russian actors were trying to escalate the conflict further afield. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen indications that Russia\u2019s cyber operatives continue to look for targets in countries that oppose their actions,\u201d the GCHQ chief said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have increased our efforts to ensure UK businesses and government urgently improve levels of cyber resilience.\u201d Fleming did not provide extra evidence, but last month, Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Agency, an arm of GCHQ, joined forces with its US counterpart, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in producing an advisory notice warning against a potential Russian escalation. At the time they warned there was a risk some Russian criminal hackers \u201chave recently publicly pledged support for the Russian government\u201d and that they could be willing to engage \u201cin retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government or the Russian people\u201d. Russia has been accused of staging more than 200 cyber-attacks on Ukraine since launching its invasion on 24 February, according to an analysis from Microsoft, targeting government agencies and media companies with hacking attempts or destructive malware designed to disable systems. Fleming said the UK, in conjunction with the US and other allies, was engaged in continuing \u201cto support Ukraine in shoring up their cyber defences\u201d \u2013 a recognition that the country is the frontline of what could yet spread into an international cyber conflict. Last month, Ukraine said Russian hackers had tried to take out the country\u2019s power grid, and came close to cutting off power for about 2 million people using a variant of the Industroyer malware. Although these attacks were aimed at Ukraine, there remains the risk that such malware could spread uncontrolled. In 2017, Russian state actors launched the NotPetya malware against Ukrainian companies, but it spread indiscriminately around the world, affecting a string of western companies and even some Russian corporations. Western spy agencies have previously said that attack was also conducted by operatives from the GRU, or main intelligence directorate of the Russian army. Fleming also used his speech to highlight that the National Cyber Force (NCF), a new offensive hacker group, run jointly by GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence, was involved in tackling cybercrime. \u201cThrough the NCF we are actively undermining the cybercriminals\u2019 assumption that they can act with impunity on the internet. We have disrupted criminals, making it clear that they are being observed, and going after their ability to profit from illegal activities,\u201d he said. The NCF activities have included actions to prevent cybercriminals \u201cfrom profiting from their crimes\u201d \u2013 though it was not spelled out how \u2013 and \u201cdenying them access to their cyber tools and malware\u201d which are used to carry out attacks. Later this month, Fleming added, Suella Braverman, the attorney general, would set out further details on how far the NCF can go in its efforts to maintain national security. She would \u201cset out the government\u2019s latest legal views on the responsible use of cyber capabilities\u201d, he said."

            "title": "Security warnings at UK nuclear facilities hit 12-year high as inspections fall",
            "date": "2022-05-26T09:47:29Z",
            "content": "The number of formal reports documenting security issues at the UK\u2019s civil nuclear facilities has hit its highest level in at least 12 years amid a decline in inspections, the Guardian can reveal. Experts said the news raised concerns about the regulator\u2019s capacity to cope with planned expansion in the sector. A total of 456 incident notification forms documenting security issues at UK nuclear facilities were submitted to the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) over 2021, according to information obtained by the Guardian and the investigative journalism organisation Point Source. This is 30% higher than the 320 reports filed during the whole of 2020 and more than double the 213 reports that were filed in 2018. Reported incidents include physical security issues, such as unauthorised people gaining unsupervised access to secure areas, as well as cybersecurity issues such as attacks by malicious software. Dr Paul Dorfman, the chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group and a former secretary of the government\u2019s committee examining radiation risks of internal emitters (Cerrie), said operators and the regulator needed to take action to address the rise in reported incidents. \u201cThe higher number of security issues that we are seeing documented at nuclear facilities is extremely concerning,\u201d he said. \u201cThese figures seem to show a relaxation in security standards when it comes to the operation and regulation of sites that have the potential to cause great human and environmental harm. \u201cWhen the stakes are so high, it is important that ONR takes all these security incidents seriously, looks at why they happened, tries to address the relevant issues, and reduces the number of incidents that are occurring.\u201d Dorfman added: \u201cThe broader picture raises significant concerns about ONR\u2019s technical and human capacity to regulate and monitor what is potentially a very risky industry. \u201cThis is especially concerning in the context of the UK\u2019s ageing nuclear fleet as well as the new-build plans the government is currently pushing.\u201d The recent rise in reported security incidents comes ahead of a planned large-scale expansion of the UK\u2019s civil nuclear sector. Last month, Boris Johnson said nuclear was \u201ccoming home\u201d when he unveiled plans for eight new reactors in the UK. Johnson has set a target of 25% of electricity coming from nuclear. That means increasing capacity from 7GW to 24GW by 2050, a process that will be overseen by a new body, Great British Nuclear. During 2021, there was an increase in the number of \u201cmoderate\u201d security incidents reported, according to the data obtained from the ONR using freedom of information legislation. Over the year, a total of 42 security incidents documented were rated as \u201cmoderate\u201d. This is up from the 24 moderate incidents reported in 2020 and is the highest number recorded in at least 12 years. Moderate is the second-most severe category and is described by the ONR as an incident where there has been \u201ca significant departure from expected standards\u201d. The rising number of reported security incidents comes amid a decline in the number of security inspections carried out by the regulator. There are concerns that during 2021 the frequency of nuclear security inspections carried out by the ONR may have fallen to its lowest level in at least four years. Data obtained in a separate freedom of information request shows that in 2021, up to 17 December, just 136 security inspections had been carried out by the ONR, down from the full-year figure of 144 in 2020 and 169 in 2019. Information security inspections are among the types to have seen the biggest decline, with only 40 carried out in 2021 up to 17 December, down from 74 over the whole of 2020. Dorfman said this was particularly worrying, given the growing risk of cyber-attacks on nuclear infrastructure. \u201cThere is no question that nuclear is operating in an increasingly dangerous and unstable world where the threat of state-sponsored or non-state cyber-attacks is increasing,\u201d he said. In a statement, the ONR said: \u201cWe welcome the increase in reported events as our analysis indicates that this reflects improvements in security awareness and culture across the industry. The vast majority of reported events (80-90%) are minor breaches of security arrangements, which have been proactively reported to us.\u201d The regulator also said it believed its engagement with nuclear operators had increased over recent years despite the decline in official inspections. It added: \u201cThe data we provided under freedom of information law relates only to on-site compliance inspections and does not include other assessment work. This separate regulatory scrutiny, which is not represented in the data, is essential to ensure site security arrangements comply with the law and includes site visits to reinforce regulatory judgments.\u201d"

            "content": "On a recent visit to a family farm in rural Illinois, thousands of miles away from the front lines of the grinding war in Ukraine, Joe Biden lashed out at his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, blaming him for destabalizing global food supplies and driving up the cost of groceries at home. Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine, Biden explained after a tour of the farm\u2019s fields and grain bins, has dramatically reduced food exports from the warring nations that together supply more than a quarter of the world\u2019s wheat, causing food prices to spiral. \u201cRight now, America is fighting on two fronts,\u201d the president said. \u201cAt home, it\u2019s inflation and rising prices. Abroad, it\u2019s helping Ukrainians defend their democracy and feeding those who are left hungry around the world because Russian atrocities exist.\u201d With less than six months before the midterm congressional elections, Biden is talking about the economy \u2013 a lot. It is the top issue on voters\u2019 minds and, worryingly for Democrats, one of the biggest political liabilities for the president and his party. Despite a streak of steady job growth and low unemployment, Americans are deeply pessimistic about the state of the economy. Inflation, running at nearly its fastest rate in four decades, has become inescapable. Gas prices have surged to record highs as many families struggle to afford the basic necessities like food and rent. Now economists are warning of possible recession. Compounding matters, a shortage of baby formula has left parents in one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries scrounging to feed their infants. Amid the national tumult over the economy, Biden\u2019s approval ratings have fallen sharply, dipping to the lowest point of his presidency \u2013 39% \u2013 this month, according to the latest AP-NORC poll. The visit to the Illinois farm was part of a wider effort by the White House to reset the narrative around the economy after months of unyielding criticism from Republicans, who have used inflation as a political cudgel against Biden. In recent days, Biden has sought to tell a textured story about the economy, one that concludes with the sharp warning that as bleak as it can seem now, the alternative \u2013 Republican control of Congress \u2013 would be much worse. In his telling, the administration pulled the nation back from the brink of economic catastrophe with a massive stimulus bill and mass vaccination campaign that saved lives and livelihoods during the depths of the pandemic. Two years on, there is much more to do. Naming inflation as his \u201ctop domestic priority\u201d, Biden has touted the administration\u2019s efforts to put the economy on a sturdier path by strengthening the nation\u2019s supply chains, cracking down on price gouging and releasing oil from the strategic reserve. Under mounting pressure in recent weeks, he invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up baby formula production and launched \u201cOperation Fly Formula\u201d to rush shipments into the US from overseas. Yet those actions, he charged, are being undermined by Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, which has sent fuel and food prices soaring; new Covid-19 lockdowns in China that are straining supply chains anew; alleged price-gouging by oil companies; and an \u201cultra-Maga\u201d Republican party intent on obstructing the president at every turn. Biden says he understands Americans\u2019 frustration with rising costs and the slow pace of progress in Washington \u2013 so deeply, in fact, he could \u201ctaste\u201d it. But electing Republicans, he argued, would not ease their troubles. \u201cAmericans have a choice right now between two paths, reflecting two very different sets of values,\u201d Biden said. He charged that the Republican party, still in the thrall of Donald Trump, had no serious plan to tackle inflation and was instead more focused on fighting issues such as banning textbooks from classrooms. In a press release, the Republican National Committee accused Biden of being \u201cdesperate to blame anyone but himself for the worst inflation in 40 years\u201d. \u201cBut,\u201d it added, \u201cthe American people know he is responsible.\u201d For Democrats who hold narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, asking voters for two more years of unified government in Washington is a risk that Biden himself acknowledged. Voters historically punish the president\u2019s party in the midterm elections. And this cycle, Democrats have struggled to energize their base, deflated over the party\u2019s failure to pass Biden\u2019s sweeping agenda, designed to remedy longstanding economic challenges. At the same time, Democrats are struggling to persuade independent and moderate Republicans voters who recoiled from Donald Trump in 2018 and 2020. Whether Democrats can change voters\u2019 attitudes on the economy weighs heavily on their prospects. Public opinion surveys have consistently found that voters have more trust in Republicans to handle the economy and inflation than Democrats. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that only 28% of Americans approved of the job Biden was doing to tackle inflation, while 68% disapproved. The same poll showed that 50% of Americans believe Republicans were better able to handle the economy. Just 36% said the same about Democrats. The political headwinds against them, Democrats believe they have found an opening that will undercut Republicans\u2019 advantage. A plan written by Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, would require all Americans to pay some income tax, including families that don\u2019t earn enough to owe taxes now, and would require Congress to reauthorize all federal legislation every five years. Biden recently used his bully pulpit to elevate Scott\u2019s 11-Point Plan to Rescue America, which he attacked as an \u201cextreme\u201d vision for the country. Many Republicans, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, have distanced themselves from the proposal. Downplaying the disagreement, the White House said it was the only comprehensive plan Republicans have put forward for the midterm elections. \u201cThis is not the last you\u2019ve heard from us about chairman Scott\u2019s tax plan that will raise taxes,\u201d Jen Psaki, in her last week as White House press secretary, said. In a withering response, Scott called Biden unfit for office and challenged him to a debate. \u201cJoe Biden can blame me all he wants,\u201d the Florida senator said. \u201cHere\u2019s the truth: he\u2019s the president of the United States, Democrats control the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats\u2019 agenda is hurting American families and no amount of spin can change that.\u201d A polling memo by Navigator Research, a Democratic messaging group, underscores why the party is seizing on Scott\u2019s plan. It found that the proposal, when described as a plan that would \u201craise taxes\u201d on millions of working-class families and potentially threaten entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, was deeply unpopular, even among Republican voters. And when contrasted with the Democrats\u2019 economic agenda, voters\u2019 views of Biden and his party on the economy improved. Isaiah Bailey, an advisor to Navigator Research, said it was incumbent on Democrats to make voters aware of these dueling visions for the country. \u201cUnpopular positions are only politically meaningful when they permeate public consciousness,\u201d Bailey said. He added that Democrats must demonstrate that they are trying to deliver on their promises, even in the face of Republican opposition and procedural challenges like the filibuster. \u201cDemocrats really need to look like fighters,\u201d he said. Maria Cardona, a veteran Democratic strategist who has urged her party\u2019s leaders to talk more about the economy with more urgency and empathy, agreed. \u201cFor way too long Republicans have gotten away with blaming Democrats, pointing the finger and talking about Biden\u2019s policies,\u201d she said. With so much at stake this fall, including the push to ban abortion if the supreme court overturns Roe v Wade, as is expected, Cardona said it was imperative that Democrats draw a clear contrast with the opposition party. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that we are not taking advantage of the moment in time, when handing over control of Congress to the Republican party is more dangerous for the future of our democracy and for the well-being of our citizenship than it has been in at least a generation,\u201d she said. Surveys suggest that voters broadly understand \u2013 and support \u2013 the decision to impose sanctions on Russia, even if there are consequences for their pocketbooks. And many cite the ongoing pandemic as a leading cause of the nation\u2019s economic woes. Yet there are signs dissatisfaction with the president\u2019s economic leadership is hardening. \u201cIt does not blunt their desire to have you produce a solution,\u201d said Patrick Gaspard, president and chief executive of the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington. \u201cThey\u2019re clear on what the causation is but also clear that they want this president, this Congress, to solve the problem.\u201d A president\u2019s ability to tackle inflation is limited. That power rests largely with the Federal Reserve. Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, said there are indications that the president\u2019s efforts to shore up the nation\u2019s supply chains are taking root. One of the best steps the White House can take, she said, is to \u201cnot create additional hurdles for monetary policymakers\u201d. \u201cLet monetary policy run its course,\u201d she said, adding that on that front she believes \u201cthey\u2019re doing the right things there\u201d. Aiming to cool the economy, the central bank recently approved the sharpest rise in interest rates in more than 20 years. But Jerome Powell, fresh from being confirmed by the Senate for a second term as chair of the Federal Reserve, acknowledged the challenge of attempting to control inflation without tipping the US economy into a recession. Ahead of Biden\u2019s visit to Illinois, the White House received a dash of good news in an otherwise discouraging report: inflation slowed for the first time in months, though the annual rate remained high. But speaking at a fundraiser in Chicago later that day, Biden acknowledged the difficulty of the task ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard because inflation is going to scare the living hell out of everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a problem we have to deal with. In the meantime, we can\u2019t take our eye off all that could happen if we do not prevail.\u201d David Smith contributed to this report"

            "content": "The Bank of England will intensify its squeeze on the economy over the coming months as it seeks to bring down the highest inflation rate in 40 years, its chief economist has warned. Noting that Threadneedle Street was facing its toughest challenge since being granted independence in 1997, Huw Pill said \u201cfurther work needs to be done\u201d to bring the annual inflation rate back to the government\u2019s 2% target. Inflation soared to 9% in April as the rising cost of gas and electricity pushed household energy bills to record levels and the escalating cost of food and transport also contributed to the surge in the cost of living. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee has raised borrowing costs at its last four meetings but Pill used a speech in Cardiff to signal further increases were needed to prevent high inflation from becoming embedded in the economy. \u201cIn my view, we still have some way to go in our monetary policy tightening, in order to make the return of inflation to target secure,\u201d Pill said. The Bank\u2019s latest forecasts for the economy envisage the annual inflation rate rising above 10% in the Autumn \u2013 a forecast Pill admitted did not make \u201cpretty reading\u201d. Pill added the impact of high inflation on the low-income households made it all the more important for the Bank to act. \u201cThese are difficult times for many people, especially for the less well off, who spend a higher proportion of their income on energy and food, where recent price rises have been most significant. \u201cCurrent challenges are thus a salutary reminder of the importance of price stability as an anchor for wider economic stability, and a bulwark to sustaining people\u2019s livelihoods, especially for those on lower pay and fixed incomes.\u201d The Bank cut official interest rates to a record low of 0.1% during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 but has since pushed them up to 1%. Pill said the risks of knock-on effects from high inflation were \u201cobvious\u201d and it was now time to remove emergency support for the economy and move back to a higher level of interest rates. \u201cIt is the need for a continuation of this transition in monetary policy that led me to support the 0.25 percentage point hike in bank rate at the May MPC meeting. And, even after this hike, I still view that necessary transition as incomplete. Further work needs to be done.\u201d Pill said there was a tension between two opposing forces. On the one hand, inflation was \u201cclearly too high\u201d, unemployment low and wage growth inconsistent with hitting the inflation target. On the other, hefty global rises in the cost of food and fuel were eating into consumer spending power. \u201cLooking beyond the shorter term, UK inflation is set to fall as global commodity prices stabilise, bottlenecks in global supply chains ease, and domestic inflationary pressure dissipates as the real income squeeze opens up a margin of economic slack,\u201d Pill said."

            "date": "2022-05-30T07:00:22Z",
            "content": "Inflation in the UK has hit its highest level in 40 years, particularly thanks to the dramatic rise in energy and food prices. This fact has provoked panic among some commentators and policymakers that Britain is about to relive the inflationary turbulence of the 1970s, and has prompted Rishi Sunak to announce a last-minute \u00a315bn \u201ccost of living package\u201d partly funded by a one-off tax on energy companies. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has already been the subject of outrage for suggesting that workers should show \u201crestraint\u201d in their pay demands, to prevent an upward spiral in wages and prices as seen in the 1970s. Right now, with inflation at 9% and employers expecting to increase pay this year by just 3%, Bailey should be able to relax on that front. Inflation aside, the differences between Britain\u2019s economy of 2022 and that of 40 years ago are stark. In 1982, unemployment hit a postwar record, at more than 3 million, as manufacturing employment plummeted. Today, Boris Johnson boasts of record low unemployment. Trade union coverage was still over 50% in 1982; today, it\u2019s less than half that, and almost half of that again in the private sector. The inability of most workers to negotiate collectively for wage increases is one of the principal reasons why Bailey sounded so out of touch, and why comparisons with the 1970s miss the mark. We are not witnessing a rerun of the 1970s and early 80s. But there are other reasons to consider the relationship between the crisis now facing Johnson\u2019s government and that which confronted Margaret Thatcher in her first term in office. Put simply, the crisis today is a legacy of how that previous crisis was handled. It is worth remembering that inflation represented the dominant economic policy challenge through most of the 1970s. It was inflation that prompted the historic reckoning by Jim Callaghan at the 1976 Labour party conference, heralding the end of the Keynesian consensus: \u201cWe used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession, and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists.\u201d Politicians and experts disagreed over the solution to inflation, but the urgency of finding one was widely accepted. In the political imagination of the 1970s new right that emerged from thinktanks on both sides of the Atlantic, the problem of inflation was tied up with a whole host of broader social and moral crises: overpowerful unions, an excessively generous welfare state, the weakening of entrepreneurship, family breakdown, disdain for capitalists. What all of these problems had in common, from this perspective, was a failure to respect the ultimate value of money. Britain would beat inflation by rediscovering its respect for property, hard work, fiscal discipline and responsibility. The medicine administered by Thatcher was socially devastating. The monetarist doctrine, originally developed by Milton Friedman, which held that governments should target the amount of money in circulation then set interest rates accordingly, caused interest rates to rise to such punitive levels that Britain entered the deepest recession since the 1930s. Inflation fell, eventually, but only after whole industrial regions, towns and cities had been dragged down with it. The collapse in trade union membership was as much an effect of the destruction of unionised jobs as it was of anti-union legislation. What is the significance of this today? Reflecting back on the upheavals of that time, many political economists have come to view monetarism as a deliberate political project that sought to re-establish the supremacy of asset owners and financial elites. After all, it was quite clear who suffered most from inflation, and who would benefit most from having it flushed out: creditors and the wealthy. It was only after Thatcher had strangled the life out of inflation (and much else besides) that the City and the housing market could begin their dramatic ascent that, aside from the wobbles of the early John Major years and the 2008 banking crisis, has continued ever since. Viewed this way, Thatcherism wasn\u2019t so much an unleashing of \u201centerprise\u201d or risk-taking, as its supporters have always claimed, but rather an unleashing of capital to chase the highest returns possible, regardless of any broader social or economic benefit. In his book Rentier Capitalism, the social and economic geographer Brett Christophers has shown that the central effect of Thatcherite reforms was to open up whole new income streams that owe little to productivity and a great deal to gaining a stranglehold over those who depend on rentiers. We can see this in the outsourcing specialists such as Serco and G4S that hover around government departments to secure lucrative long-term contracts, using legal muscle to protect themselves against any downside; in the descent by private equity funds on essential adult and children\u2019s care to extract abnormal profits, largely through squeezing an already disempowered workforce. We can see it in the way that house prices and rent have become entirely unmoored from wages. Rent-seeking extends well beyond the sphere of \u201cthe market\u201d, to extract revenue from \u2013 and raise the cost of \u2013 the basic necessities of life. According to orthodox economic theory, profit is the reward that a business or investor receives for taking a financial risk, including the risk of bankruptcy. But in a rentier economy such as Britain\u2019s, profits become guaranteed, while risks are eliminated by fair means or foul. The 2008 bailout of banks that had become \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d was emblematic of this kind of phoney capitalism, in which vast rewards are divorced from any genuine acceptance of risk. Similarly, now that the retail price of energy is effectively decided by Ofgem, the soaring profits of energy giants such as Shell have to be understood as official UK government policy, just as the house price inflation that followed Sunak\u2019s stamp duty holiday was. Although Sunak\u2019s one-off levy on energy firms ameliorates certain effects of rentier power, it does nothing to weaken the underlying shape of the economy. Some critics wonder if this economic model even counts as \u201ccapitalist\u201d any longer, seeing as it has abandoned the risky, productivity-enhancing investments that have long been seen as capitalism\u2019s hallmarks. Certainly, the liberal language of \u201ccitizens\u201d and \u201cconsumers\u201d, \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d sectors, feels inadequate to describe a cost of living crisis in which we are largely trapped in our payment obligations, living at the behest of businesses that have neither a political nor an economic incentive to serve our interests. The state, in Thatcher\u2019s view, had become captured by labour. Today, the problem is the opposite one: the state now protects certain forms of capital at every turn, to the point where many businesses, funds and wealthy elites have forgotten how it feels to lose. It may well be that much of today\u2019s inflation stems from geopolitical factors (war and Brexit), but until a government is elected to represent the economically vulnerable and take a stand against rentier power, merely living will remain a high-cost exercise for many. William Davies is a sociologist and political economist. His latest book is This is Not Normal: The Collapse of Liberal Britain"

            "date": "2022-05-13T05:01:23Z",
            "content": "Tony Blair has urged Keir Starmer to reject \u201cwoke\u201d politics and present a programme for government that is \u201cradical without being dangerous\u201d. A report published by the Tony Blair Institute analyses the impact of class on voting in the 2019 general election and beyond. Based on analysis by the veteran pollster Peter Kellner, it points to particular problems for Labour with two groups: the 26% of voters who fit into the formal definition of middle class; and the 12% who would be defined as working class by pollsters but consider themselves middle class. The first group voted 57% to remain in the EU, yet the Conservatives were 22% ahead with these voters in 2019, despite their central message being that they would \u201cget Brexit done\u201d. These voters, the former Labour leader suggests, are \u201cworried about issues like tax and economic competence\u201d. The second group, whom Blair calls the \u201caspirational working class\u201d, voted to leave the EU by a narrower 53% but backed the Conservatives over Labour by a 32% margin. In a punchy foreword, Blair claims of this latter group: \u201cA large number voted Conservative despite disagreeing with the party on Brexit. They thought Labour\u2019s far-left economic policy was a bigger threat than Brexit.\u201d Without what he calls the \u201cmillstone\u201d of Starmer\u2019s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, Blair claims Labour can win many of these voters back \u2013 and analysis of recent polling in the report shows a 12% swing to Labour among this \u201cblue-collar aspirational\u201d group. The former prime minister suggests they are social conservatives, and thus urges Labour to ensure it is on the centre ground on \u201cculture war\u201d issues such as transgender rights. Blair says the party should \u201cplant Labour\u2019s feet clearly near the centre of gravity of the British people, who want fair treatment for all and an end to prejudice, but distrust and dislike the \u2018cancel culture\u2019, \u2018woke\u2019 mentality.\u201d Labour has sometimes appeared to struggle with culture war issues. For example, Starmer and the party chair, Anneliese Dodds, were criticised recently for being unable to give a straightforward answer to the question: what is a woman? A clearer frontbench line has since been agreed, resulting in the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, telling an interviewer: \u201cMen have penises, women have vaginas, here ends my biology lesson.\u201d The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden has sought to capitalise on the party\u2019s discomfort, accusing Starmer in a recent speech of \u201ckowtowing to the cancel culture brigade\u201d and claiming: \u201cThe Corbynistas, they are still there.\u201d Starmer has been accused by some on the left of Labour of winning the leadership under false pretences by espousing key tenets of Corbynism during the campaign in 2020 and then moving towards the centre ground. Blair also calls on Labour to work on rebuilding its economic credibility, as he says the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has already begun to do. \u201cLabour must cure both its cultural and its economic aspiration problems. It must do the first to regain those voters who went Tory despite being traditional blue collar. These are the northern \u2018red wallers\u2019. But Labour must also do the second to have any realistic chance of winning,\u201d he says. He also warns Starmer against excessive caution \u2013 something the Labour leader is charged with by some colleagues. \u201cThe bane of progressive politics is to think the choice is between being voter-friendly and boring, or exciting and voter-repellent,\u201d he says. As an example of the kind of radical policy he would like to see, Blair suggests tackling concerns about illegal immigration by introducing biometric ID as a precondition for accessing work and public services."

            "date": "2022-05-07T07:00:27Z",
            "content": "Ujarneq Egede\u2019s farm sits among a cluster of compact houses and squat barns on the snowy slopes of Equaluit Ilua in southern Greenland. The journey from Narsaq, the nearest town, involves a 30 minute boat trip across the fjord, mooring on a sheet of ice and a snowmobile ride up to the farm. This is the biggest island in the world, yet Greenland\u2019s population is tiny \u2013 less than 57,000 of whom nearly 90% are Inuit, concentrated around the jagged coastline. The country\u2019s remoteness is extreme: there are no roads or railways between towns and settlements. Transport is only by boat, helicopter and propeller planes \u2013 ice, winds and storms permitting. Narsaq itself is a small town of about 1,300 people, where jobs revolve around fishing, farming, a slaughterhouse and summer tourism. Its population has fallen 25% since 1991. Meanwhile, on his farm, Egede grows potatoes and raises 750 sheep, huddled in barns during the winter and ranging across the grassy mountains throughout summer. To be a farmer in Greenland is to have a front row seat to the climate crisis. Egede tracks the changes \u2013 \u201csummer is sometimes really dry, other times there is too much rain. This winter was really late\u201d. Where once they could drive on the frozen fjord during winter, now that never happens, he says. It is not just climate that worries him, however. Egede\u2019s farm is in the shadow of Kvanefjeld, a proposed open-pit uranium and rare earth elements mine. Fearing what it may do to the surrounding environment and his farm, he was immensely relieved when plans for the mine were recently halted after the new government, elected in April 2021, banned uranium mining. But the threat still simmers. Egede is not sure it isover. This southern slice of Greenland, where the main sources of employment include farming, fishing and tourism, has found itself at the sharp end of a quandary the country is reckoning with: how to develop the economy without doing so at the expense of its environment and its people, who rely on the pristine Arctic landscape for their livelihoods. In its own, Greenland way, it is a microcosm of the dilemma facing huge parts of the world. Melting ice sheets and fast-warming temperatures make Greenland a totem for the climate crisis. But as the ice melts, ironically enough, opportunities arise: not only are raw materials easier to access but Greenland is becoming more accessible and tourist seasons are extending. The relatively young government came to power in April 2021 promising pro-environmental policies: it has pledged to join the Paris climate agreement and has banned new licences for oil and gas drilling. But Greenland\u2019s abundant minerals have attracted the attention of countries that are currently dependent on China and Russia for the raw materials needed to build the batteries and wind turbines of the low-carbon economy. Mining may mean Greenland could move away from its financial dependence on Denmark, which gives it a grant of 3.9bn Danish krone (\u00a3440m) every year, and towards eventual independence. In Narsaq, the Australian-based Greenland Minerals pitched the Kvanefjeld mine as a source of local opportunity. The pitch failed to impress many, including farmers such as Egede, and Naasu Lund, who lives with her husband and two children on a sheep farm in Inneruulalik, near Narsaq. Lund was part of the anti-mine group Urani? Naamik (Uranium? No). Farmers thought they would be forced to move from farms that had been in their families for generations, says Lund, who also runs horse riding tours from her hydropowered farm. The biggest concern was the tailings pond holding the mining waste, she says, which would remain there for ever. People feared it could spill in Greenland\u2019s fierce weather, reaching the fjord in minutes. Urani? Naamik protested \u2013 at public consultations, through local campaigning and finally through votes. And it worked. \u201cThis is the first time I can sit in my home and think about a future that is not involved with mining,\u201d Lund says. Whether the mine is over is uncertain, however. Greenland Minerals has launched arbitration proceedings to \u201cclarify the company\u2019s position and to protect our shareholders\u2019 considerable investment in Kvanefjeld\u201d, according to a spokesperson, who added that a detailed environmental impact assessment had addressed all concerns about the mine. \u201cEven under the most extreme assumptions there would not be any exceedance of WHO drinking water standards resulting from dispersal of tailings material during foehn winds [strong gusty winds].\u201d While Greenland\u2019s government may be saying no to uranium, it is open to other mining and the warming climate may make projects more feasible. \u201cMineral deposits are exposed that had previously been under ice,\u201d says Josephine Nymand of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. In March, Kobold Minerals, which has investment from Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, and the UK-based Bluejay Mining announced they would begin exploring for nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals. Bo Stensgaard, the CEO of Bluejay Mining, says the project will operate to the \u201chighest standards\u201d environmentally and benefit Greenlanders through jobs and training. But there is no timeframe for when mining might start. Herein lies the problem, says Lill Rastad Bj\u00f8rst, associate professor at Aalborg University \u2013 there is a lot of talk but \u201cclose to nothing is happening\u201d. Greenland currently has only two mines, one producing rubies and another anorthosite. Despite claims about how Greenlanders benefit from mining, \u201cat the moment, there might be people who benefit from this development, but it\u2019s not the people living in Greenland\u201d, Bj\u00f8rst says. Could tourism be the answer? \u201cWe advocate for tourism,\u201d says Idrissia Thestrup, of Visit Greenland, \u201cbecause we believe by preserving nature, we can actually avoid taking the resources in the land and potentially destroying landscapes.\u201d Tourism was one of the country\u2019s fastest growing industries until Covid lockdowns brought it to a shuddering halt. But 2022 will be a boom year, says Henrik Ebbe Nielsen, a tourism teacher at Campus Kujalleq, in Qaqortoq, south Greenland\u2019s largest town. Qaqortoq alone expects to see an estimated 41 cruise ships this summer, spilling up to 47,000 tourists on to its winding, pavement-less streets. Visitor numbers may be boosted further by an airport expansion project. Qaqortoq will get a brand new airport, with construction starting this spring, and new runways will allow larger, international planes to land in the capital, Nuuk, and Ilulissat, a town famed for its iceberg-calving glacier and dog sledding. But bigger airports mean more aeroplanes, more emissions and more tourists. In some areas, \u201cthe local landscape is very much affected by too many tourists already\u201d, says Bj\u00f8rst. Thestrup says framing Greenland\u2019s airport growth as a climate problem ignores its tiny contribution to the climate crisis and its extreme remoteness. But she acknowledges the need to tread carefully. \u201cWe want tourism to be a driver for economic growth but we want to do it at a pace that respects the nature and culture of our destination.\u201d Greenland\u2019s prime minister, M\u00fate B Egede, recently set out his vision for a \u201cresilient economy\u201d, one that would ultimately phase out fossil fuels. Alongside fishing, rare earth mining and tourism, he predicts a future for far less tested industries, including using Greenland\u2019s abundant hydropower resources with captured CO2 emissions to create green fuels for export. \u201cAs the \u2018face\u2019 of climate change,\u201d he wrote in an editorial, \u201cGreenland wants to lead by example.\u201d For now, the country is trying to plot a path towards increased economic freedom, while staking its claim for climate leadership. It is a path filled with uncertainty, especially as the climate crisis starts to alter people\u2019s way of life, but uncertainty is something Greenlanders are used to. \u201cYou cannot sit down and cry, it doesn\u2019t help, you have to just adapt,\u201d Lund says. \u201cWe can do it right,\u201d she adds. \u201cGreenland is a very sustainable country but it\u2019s also the Arctic \u2013 nature doesn\u2019t fix itself very fast after being destroyed, you have to be careful, it\u2019s very fragile.\u201d Travel support for this piece was provided by the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY"

            "date": "2022-05-19T09:15:15Z",
            "content": "It was little more than a year ago that US officials were publicly rubbishing the prospect of engagement with Venezuela\u2019s President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who they described as a \u201cdictator\u201d. \u201cHis repression, corruption and mismanagement have generated one of the most dire humanitarian crises this hemisphere has seen,\u201d the state department spokesperson, Ned Price, declared in February last year. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t expect any contact with Maduro any time soon.\u201d Yet 2022 appears to have heralded a new dawn for Washington-Caracas ties, as geopolitical shifts caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and political deadlock in the economically devastated South American country prompt a major policy rethink from members of Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u2013 and offer Venezuela\u2019s authoritarian leader a once improbable political lifeline. On Tuesday, the US announced a gentle easing of the economic sanctions it has spent years using to push for political change in Venezuela \u2013 including against a nephew of its first lady \u2013 a move senior members of Maduro\u2019s government celebrated. \u201cVenezuela hopes that these decisions by the United States of America will pave the way to the total lifting of the illegal sanctions which affect our entire people,\u201d the country\u2019s vice-president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, tweeted in English as the news emerged. Simultaneously, her brother, another top Chavista called Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, shared a photograph of himself shaking hands with the chief negotiator for Venezuela\u2019s opposition, Gerardo Blyde, signalling the reactivation of stalled talks designed to bridge the country\u2019s toxic political schism. \u201cCongratulations!\u201d tweeted Marcelo Ebrard, the foreign minister of Mexico, where those negotiations were happening until their suspension last October after the extradition of the Maduro ally Alex Saab to the US. Some see Washington\u2019s change of heart as a direct consequence of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine. In March, days after Russia\u2019s onslaught began, senior US officials flew to Caracas for their first encounter with Maduro representatives in years. That visit was partly motivated by a US desire to increase oil production in Venezuela \u2013 which boasts the world\u2019s largest proven reserves \u2013 in order to restrain global oil prices, which have soared as a result of Putin\u2019s war. Christopher Sabatini, a Chatham House Latin America expert, said the war in Ukraine had also prompted a rethink in Caracas, which desperately needed new markets for its oil as well as access to western refineries, banking systems and investment. \u201cIt\u2019s true that oil prices have gone up with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine but, because of sanctions, Russia is now increasing the sale of its oil to China, which was Venezuela\u2019s principal market,\u201d he added. Yet Sabatini believed Washington\u2019s shift had been planned well before Putin\u2019s invasion and reflected the US\u2019s realization that the Trump-era \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy \u2013 by which harsh sanctions were used to try to topple Maduro and replace him with the young opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 had failed. \u201cIt is a demonstration that the US and much of the international community bet on a solution that simply hasn\u2019t worked,\u201d Sabatini said. \u201cThat\u2019s anathema to some people in the US Congress. It\u2019s anathema to some elements of the Venezuelan opposition who always hoped and dreamed for some sort of cathartic collapse of the government and the fleeing of Maduro and his cronies. But clearly Maduro has hung on, [albeit] at a huge cost to his country \u2026 and now the US has to [engage].\u201d Representatives of Venezuela\u2019s mainstream opposition, and the rival government Guaid\u00f3 created when his campaign to unseat Maduro started in January 2019, now accept dealing with their foe is the only way forwards as the country heads towards its next scheduled presidential election in 2024. Speaking to the Guardian during a recent tour of Europe, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Isadora Zubillaga, admitted: \u201cThe reality is that we must talk. We were not able to wipe them out and they were not able to wipe us out either. That negotiation process must include discussion of the lifting of sanctions and penalties.\u201d However, Zubillaga warned the west against boosting what she called a Putin-led autocratic coalition by offering too many concessions to Maduro. \u201cThe Maduro regime is sustained by the international alliance, including countries like Iran, Russia, Cuba and China. If Maduro is helped, so is Putin,\u201d Zubillaga said. A senior US administration official said that it would calibrate its sanctions policy depending on the behaviour of Maduro\u2019s administration and whether \u201cambitious, concrete and irreversible\u201d steps towards free and democratic elections were achieved at talks. Members of the US right denounced the loosening of sanctions, which include allowing limited contact between the US oil giant Chevron and Venezuela\u2019s government. \u201cBiden continues his effort to appease anti-American communist dictators,\u201d tweeted the Republican senator Marco Rubio, one of the cheerleaders for Trump\u2019s bungled anti-Maduro drive. A Wall Street Journal editorial condemned Biden\u2019s \u201cdance with a Latin dictator\u201d. Others expressed cautious optimism that, while there would be no overnight solutions to Venezuela\u2019s profound economic, humanitarian and political crises, the return of negotiations \u2013 and incentives for Maduro and others around him to offer concessions \u2013 was a step towards a democratic transition. Geoff Ramsey, the director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America, said: \u201cThe only feasible transition is a pacted transition which is going to require some level of negotiations with political, military and economic elites. \u201cWhat we are seeing is a recognition of that reality. I don\u2019t think that means that the US or other actors of the international community are ignorant or naive about the difficulties that lie ahead,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the problem in Venezuela were simply a lack of dialogue we would have seen the crisis solved years ago.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-10T17:54:39Z",
            "content": "Beijing has accused Washington of \u201cpolitical manipulation\u201d and attempting to change the status quo after the US state department quietly amended its website to remove a line stating it did not support Taiwanese independence. In a delicate geopolitical balancing act, the US has long acknowledged, but not supported, China\u2019s claim to Taiwan under its version of the \u201cone China principle\u201d. However, experts say that policy has been eroded as Beijing has become more assertive. In testimony to the Senate on Tuesday, the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, said China was seeking the military capability to be able to conquer Taiwan, even if the US intervened. \u201cIt\u2019s our view that they are working hard to effectively put themselves into a position in which their military is capable of taking Taiwan over our intervention,\u201d Haines told the Senate armed services committee. She said she would only talk in closed session about how long the US estimated that would take. Haines added that US intelligence estimated Beijing \u201cwould prefer not to have to use military force to take Taiwan. They prefer to use other means.\u201d In an updated page on the state department\u2019s online \u201cfact sheet\u201d Washington last week removed some key lines from the 1979 US-PRC joint communique. It included a line saying \u201cthe US recognised the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is a part of China\u201d. The line saying the US \u201cdoes not support Taiwan independence\u201d \u2013 which appeared in a previous version published on 31 August 2018 \u2013 has also been removed from the website. The new version said the US \u201ccontinues to encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan\u201d. It added: \u201cThe United States has a longstanding one-China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three US-China joint communiques, and the six assurances.\u201d Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China and has vowed to take it back, with force if necessary. On Tuesday, a spokesperson at the American Institute in Taiwan \u2013 the US\u2019s de facto embassy on the island \u2013 said Washington\u2019s commitment to Taipei was \u201crock solid\u201d, and that it \u201ccontributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region\u201d. On the same day, Beijing criticised the change. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, called the edit \u201can act of political manipulation and an attempt to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which will backfire and the US itself will get burned\u201d. The edits took place on 5 May, the state department\u2019s website showed. The latest fact sheet on Taiwan begins with the line that \u201cas a leading democracy and a technological powerhouse, Taiwan is a key US partner in the Indo-Pacific\u201d. The state department also said that the US and Taiwan \u201cshare similar values, deep commercial and economic links, and strong people-to-people ties\u201d. It is not immediately clear if recent changes to the fact sheet reflected the Biden administration\u2019s latest policy on China. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, was scheduled to deliver a major speech last week laying out the government\u2019s framing on China. The activity was cancelled because of Blinken\u2019s Covid test results. Tensions between Washington and Beijing over the island of Taiwan have continued to increase since Biden became US president last year. In January, Qin Gang, the Chinese envoy to the US, said the two countries could face a \u201cmilitary conflict\u201d over the future of Taiwan, in an unusually explicit reference to the prospect of war."

            "title": "Australia election: 10 lessons UK politics can learn",
            "date": "2022-05-24T10:45:41Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s Labor party has come to power, pushing the conservative Coalition out of office for the first time in almost a decade. Voters also delivered big wins for the Greens and a group of independents promising action on climate change. Here are 10 takeaways for political strategists in the UK to consider. Well-crafted campaigns defeated rightwing populism \u2026 Well-organised, targeted campaigns on progressive issues triumphed in Australia over negative, dog-whistle campaigns built around conservative leveraging of \u201cculture war\u201d issues. The result on Saturday was a repudiation of the hard right, after scare campaigns on issues such as refugees backfired on Scott Morrison\u2019s Liberals. \u2026 but rightwing populism endured Nevertheless, the Coalition took 35% of the national vote, and fringe parties \u2013 Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation and the Trumpist Clive Palmer\u2019s United Australia \u2013 managed nearly 10% of the national vote between them. A low-key policy offer worked for the centre-left \u2026 Safety first proved to be a winning formula for Anthony Albanese, who moderated a lot of his policy offering to avoid a repeat of Labor\u2019s defeat in 2019 when it over-promised on economic and tax reform. Albanese\u2019s low-key, low-risk performances on the campaign trail proved to be more palatable than Morrison\u2019s self-confessed \u201cbulldozer\u201d style. \u2026 but this was no Labor landslide On first preference votes Labor support dropped from the previous election from 33.34% to 32.8%. The Coalition share of first preference votes fell by 5.64 percentage points but was still higher than Labor. The right had a women problem Gender was another area where the Australian opposition was able to exploit the weakness and shortcomings of the Coalition government. Morrison\u2019s blokey, suburban dad image worked well for a time but his handling of a series of scandals involving his ministers and employees sent his rating among women crashing. In particular, his failure to deal with the allegation that a ministerial member of staff was raped by a colleague in a government office in Canberra dominated the news for weeks. His tin ear was never more glaring than when he admitted it had taken an intervention from his wife comparing how he might feel about it if it was one of his daughters who had been assaulted to make him understand the seriousness of the situation. Another hot-button issue on Australian doorsteps was Morrison breaking his promise to set up a federal anti-corruption commission amid growing concern over donations to political parties and the misallocation of public funds. Independents broke through The success of the so-called teal independents (a little bit green, a little bit blue) offered a template for targeting individual seats with well-focused, local campaigns. The victorious teals, who are mostly women, had their most notable wins in well-heeled inner-city areas of Sydney and Melbourne where Morrison\u2019s record on climate, sleaze and gender reversed decades of traditional backing for the Liberals. The climate crisis weighed on voters\u2019 minds The defeated rightwing coalition government thought \u201cordinary\u201d voters in the suburbs did not care about esoteric things such as emissions targets and renewable quotas. But when people were finding that their homes were successively on fire or underwater, they joined the dots and sent a message that this wasn\u2019t the case. The teal candidates were heavily backed by climate activists in their inner-city battlegrounds, and the Greens won at least three lower house seats, in what has been referred to as a \u201cGreenslide\u201d. Overall, the Greens took 12% of the national primary vote, up nearly 2 percentage points, suggesting environmental politics had appeal beyond university-educated urbanites. Murdoch\u2019s influence appeared to wane The triumph of Albanese and others was also a defeat for the Murdoch press, which campaigned ferociously against the progressive parties. News Corp Australia controls the biggest-selling papers in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, along with a host of other titles that gave the Coalition the soft-soap treatment while portraying Labor and the rest as unhinged radicals. That it did not work could be proof of Murdoch\u2019s waning influence in the social media age. Preferential voting system helped progressives Australia uses a preferential voting system that helped maximise the progressive vote to the benefit of Labor and the teal independents. For example, Labor\u2019s win in the prized inner-city Melbourne seat of Higgins came despite them losing the primary vote to the Liberals. But when the second preference of Greens voters was counted, Labor leapfrogged into first place. Local Covid politics also played a role The Australian election was influenced by a host of local factors but the impact of pandemic politics is particularly instructive. Tough Covid lockdowns by Labor state governments in Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland were heavily criticised by Morrison and his ministers. But if he thought it was a vote winner he was wrong because those attacks went down badly with the public. Western Australia, for example, historically a Coalition stronghold, swung by 11 percentage points to Labor."

            "date": "2022-05-26T04:00:03Z",
            "content": "It was a deal \u2013 rumoured to have been brokered at the exclusive island resort of Balesin \u2013 that set the course of the Philippines election. The children of two of the country\u2019s most powerful families agreed to join forces: dictator\u2019s son Ferdinand Marcos Jr would run to be president in an alliance with Sara Duterte, the tough-talking daughter of the populist incumbent, Rodrigo Duterte. Last week, they won a thumping victory. Marcos Jr secured 31 million votes, according to an unofficial count, thought to be the biggest mandate in decades. Sara Duterte, who ran to be vice-president, also won by a huge margin. The pair were backed up by a host of powerful political names including the former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who reportedly brokered their alliance, and the family of former president Joseph Estrada. The heavyweights grouped together to oppose the rival candidate, Leni Robredo \u2013 a reformist who wanted to pass an anti-dynasty law, and ultimately came second. \u201cWhen we look at the results in the numbers, that alliance worked,\u201d said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines, pointing to how the candidates combined their respective support bases in the north and south of the country. \u201cThey worked as a team and they were supported by all the traditional politicians.\u201d Political parties are weak in the Philippines, and it is instead influential families who struggle for power, using patronage, vote-buying, intimidation and, at times, violence to keep relatives in office. The clout of families can rise and fall \u2013 and rise again in the case of the Marcoses. Marcos Jr\u2019s father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr, ruled for two decades, including a period of martial law, where he had absolute power, before he was ousted by a popular uprising in 1986. Marcos Sr promised voters he would tackle the country\u2019s dynasties, but instead merely replaced elites with cronies. He plundered up to $10bn (\u00a38bn) and presided over rife rights abuses, where political opponents were tortured, arrested and disappeared. Campaign alliances aside, the Marcoses, said Aries Arugay, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, do not pair up and rule as co-equals. \u201cThe Marcoses rule by themselves.\u201d Marcos Jr\u2019s\u2019 recent announcement that he will appoint Sara Duterte to lead the Department of Education \u2013 and not defence, as was her preference \u2013 has raised eyebrows. In a statement, Duterte, a reserve officer, brushed off any suggestion she had been sidelined. \u201cI expect that people who want to see the new administration fail will fabricate intrigues about my loyalty,\u201d she said. Rodrigo Duterte, who was blocked by the constitution from seeking a second term, did not endorse Marcos Jr, who he previously called a spoiled child and weak leader. Instead, he has openly expressed frustration that his daughter Sara, who was leading opinion surveys last year, did not go for the top job. But for all his protests at his daughter\u2019s decision, Rodrigo Duterte himself fuelled the rise of the Marcoses, analysts say. He not only recommended a hero\u2019s burial for Marcos Sr in 2016 \u2013 a highly controversial decision that contributed to the whitewashing of history \u2013 but once described Marcos Jr as his preferred successor were he to stand down early. Throughout Duterte\u2019s term, the Marcos family was building its base, with online disinformation campaigns flooding social media with false stories portraying Marcos Sr\u2019s rule as a golden era. The Dutertes \u201callowed this because the Marcoses were doing the work that the Duterte administration was too lazy to do or did not have the time to do, which is to pummel the opposition\u201d, Arugay said. Such glorification of martial law also benefited Duterte\u2019s authoritarian style of leadership. \u201cWhat Duterte and his administration failed to see is that it empowered the Marcoses even further in return,\u201d he added. The power of Philippine dynasties has only increased in the decades since the ousting of Marcos, distorting democracy and worsening inequality. According to a 2019 study by Manila\u2019s Ateneo School of Government, about 80% of governors belonged to \u201cfat dynasties\u201d, meaning clans with two or more members in power at the same time \u2013 and up from 57% in 2004. Political families also held 67% of seats in the House of Representatives, and 53% of mayoral posts. \u201cWithout dynasty regulation called for by our constitution, and given [the] little effort to curb vote-buying, and mixed record of anti-corruption in the past six years \u2026 then it is clear to see how dynastic politicians can further concentrate power,\u201d said Dr Ronald Mendoza, who authored the study. The pandemic and unemployment also increases people\u2019s vulnerability to patronage, a longstanding problem in the Philippines, said Mendoza. Local media reported that, in the days after the election, stores in some areas sold out of mobile phones, and restaurants were busier than usual, with shoppers openly saying they had received money from politicians running for congress and provincial posts. The Commission on Elections told local media it had verified more than 100 cases of vote-buying, but did not believe such reports had affected the outcome of the vote. Unless Marcos Jr, with a huge mandate, alters the constitution, he too will be limited to one six-year term. Regardless, many more Marcoses are waiting in the wings. Marcos Jr\u2019s sister Imee is currently a senator, his cousin Martin Romualdez is poised to be the next house speaker, while his son Ferdinand Alexander, known as Sandro, was voted representative of Ilocos Norte, the family stronghold, last week. Rodrigo Duterte will leave office on 30 June but has noted with satisfaction that, alongside Sara, his two sons are also in politics: one is a congressman and another has become mayor of Davao city, the family\u2019s base."

            "title": "Vladimir by Julia May Jonas review \u2013 slippery sexual politics",
            "date": "2022-05-23T06:00:10Z",
            "content": "\u201cI ask this one thing:/let me go mad in my own way,\u201d opens the epigraph \u2013 taken from Sophocles\u2019s Antigone \u2013 of Julia May Jonas\u2019s debut novel. It unfolds in the wake of seven allegations of sexual misconduct against a female academic\u2019s husband, John (another professor at the same college), triggering, in turn, a slew of student signatures calling for his removal. The supposed \u201cmadness\u201d of the novel lies not only in the whipped-up condemnation of John, but in the narrator\u2019s slippery descent into her own murky infatuation. The arrival of debut author Vladimir, a suave, second-generation Russian, \u201cclearly a transplant from the city\u201d, as a professor amid this wreckage spells further disaster for the unnamed narrator, whose wry and shrewd voice steers this novel. Creating a quartet of entanglements, Vladimir brings wife Cynthia (and young daughter) in tow, whose deep, unexplained trauma and \u201chonourable depression\u201d elevates her in our narrator\u2019s eyes. While privately confessing to her husband\u2019s flings with students \u2013 and her own indifference (\u201cpower is the reason they desired him in the first place\u201d) \u2013 the protagonist first feels a spark between herself and Vladimir. Fifty-eight years old and railing against her perceived loss of sexual power, the narrator\u2019s desire for a father in his 40s plummets her into \u201ca pit, with no bottom\u201d. Rapt with longing and inspiration, she resumes her dormant, so far unsuccessful work as a novelist and, in a sardonic subversion of the male author and his muse, becomes \u201cengorged with the creative juice\u201d. Vladimir is peppered with subversions of this kind, from the narrator\u2019s early assertion that \u201cperhaps I am an old man more than I am an oldish white woman\u201d, since she is compelled by desire, to the introduction of her adult, androgynous, bisexual daughter Sid, emancipated from \u201cthe heterosexual prison\u201d. Yet Jonas portrays a world in which women, despite attempts to unshackle themselves, trip into knotty and constricting gender norms: though priding herself on an \u201cunconventional\u201d marriage, the narrator is engulfed by domestic labour, while it is her own body, not Vladimir\u2019s, and its faults with which she is preoccupied (the \u201clines in places I had yet to realise\u201d, breasts \u201cmore comical than globular, and which now, on a bad day, looked nearly phallic\u201d). Jonas, a playwright, artfully fashions a protagonist mired in contradictions that stack up as the narrative progresses. The novel is hemmed in by its central questions: the narrator\u2019s complicity in her husband\u2019s affairs, having initially \u201csuggested to John that he seek out other women\u201d (a late symptom of the free love movement that now backfires), as well as how consensual these relationships were. Arguments of female agency, sex positivity and what constitutes true trauma are wrung dry \u2013 it is the topic of female pain and its fetishisation in art, however, which Jonas illuminates. Among the novel\u2019s most disturbing passages are the narrator\u2019s recollected encounters with predatory professors and family friends, dismissed as little more than embarrassing. With its fervent \u201cembrace\u201d of \u201cthe I I I\u201d, its understated mundanity and poised restraint, Jonas\u2019s debut joins a swath of authors with nameless protagonists, among them Rachel Cusk and Amina Cain, and their interrogation of the female canon. There\u2019s a moroseness in the vein of Ottessa Moshfegh and Lisa Taddeo with which Vladimir dissects the boomer-millennial generational divide, shifting sexual politics and the changing constraints on language used by women \u2013 though what lets this intelligent, knowing portrayal of a woman\u2019s spiralling midlife crisis down is that the questions it seeks to answer are not as morally dubious as it seems to claim. The much-overstated 15-year age gap between Vladimir and the narrator is characteristic of the novel\u2019s concern about age-related power dynamics; Vladimir is snagged on whether the assumption that young women cannot consent to relationships with older men is anti-feminist, though its stilted attempt to give the title of victim or oppressor to each is where the novel loses its footing. \u2022 Vladimir by Julia May Jonas is published by Picador (\u00a312.99).

            "title": "Leonid Kravchuk, first president of Ukraine, dies aged 88",
            "date": "2022-05-10T20:49:29Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s first president Leonid Kravchuk, who agreed to give up his country\u2019s Soviet nuclear arsenal, the third-largest in the world, has died at the age of 88. \u201cSad news and a great loss,\u201d presidential aide Andriy Yermak said on Telegram, describing Kravchuk as \u201ca wise patriot of Ukraine, a truly historical figure in gaining our independence\u201d. Kravchuk led Ukraine as its Communist party boss in the waning years of the Soviet Union, and played a pivotal role in the demise of the USSR before holding the Ukrainian presidency from 1991 through 1994. He was a driving force in Ukraine\u2019s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and later that year joined leaders of Russia and Belarus to sign an agreement on 8 December 1991, which formally declared that the Soviet Union ceased to exist. As president, Kravchuk agreed to transfer remaining Soviet nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory to Russian control, in a deal backed by the US. He lost the 1994 presidential election to former prime minister Leonid Kuchma. In 2020 he returned to politics to try to negotiate a settlement as part of a \u201ccontact group\u201d for the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists had fought Ukrainian forces since 2014. Kravchuk had been in poor health and underwent a heart operation last year. Ukrainian Defence minister Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Twitter that with Kravchuk\u2019s signature to the 1991 agreement disbanding the Soviet Union \u201cthe Evil Empire disintegrated\u201d. \u201cThank you for the peaceful renewal of our Independence. We\u2019re defending it now with weapons in our hands,\u201d Reznikov wrote Tuesday. In a post on Telegram, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko paid tribute to Kravchuk, who served as president from 1991 to 1994, hailing him for his \u201ctalent, a strong character and knowledge\u201d. Kravchuk\u2019s death comes a week after that of the first president of post-Soviet Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich, who died aged 87 after treatment for Covid-19, according to his wife. After Shushkevich\u2019s death, Kravchuk was the last survivor of the three leaders who signed the 1991 deal. Russian president Boris Yeltsin died in 2007 aged 76. Since annexing Crimea from Ukraine and throwing its weight behind the 2014 separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has sought to cast doubt on Ukraine\u2019s statehood and falsely portray the country as an artificial construct of Communist rule \u2013 rhetoric that paved the way for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a televised address on 21 February , three days before the invasion, Putin blamed \u201chistoric, strategic mistakes\u201d by Communist leaders for having led to the collapse of the Soviet state. Ukraine \u201cturned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence\u201d, Putin said in an apparent reference to Kravchuk\u2019s time in office. Some participants in the historic 8 December meeting at a hunting lodge in the Belovezha forest, in what is now Belarus, pointed to Kravchuk as having played the main role in the demise of the Soviet Union. Ukraine had declared its sovereignty after an August coup by hardline Communist party members weakened Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s authority. A week before the Belovezha agreement, Kravchuk was elected president of Ukraine in a vote that also overwhelmingly approved its independence from Moscow. Participants in the Belovezha talks said Kravchuk rejected any efforts to keep the Soviet Union going with reforms. \u201cKravchuk was focused on Ukraine\u2019s independence,\u201d Belarusian leader Shushkevich, who took part in the talks and signed the deal, told The Associated Press in an interview last year. \u201cHe was proud that Ukraine declared its independence in a referendum and he was elected president on 1 December, 1991.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-05-25T17:21:35Z",
            "content": "Ferdinand Marcos Jr was flanked by his family, including matriarch Imelda Marcos, as he stood at the rostrum in the Philippines Congress to be proclaimed president-elect, marking the dynasty\u2019s return to the seat of power. Marcos Jr won almost 59% of votes in an election earlier this month, more than double that of his closest rival. His landslide victory followed a highly divisive campaign that was dominated by disinformation that sought to glorify the regime of his dictator father, Ferdinand Marcos Sr, who plundered as much as $10bn while in office, and presided over rife human rights abuses. Marcos Jr has not acknowledged or apologised for abuses that were perpetrated under his father. In comments made after the proclamation, he said he was humbled by the election result, stating: \u201cI promise you, that we may not be perfect, but we will always strive to perfection.\u201d Imelda, 92, who is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven corruption charges, was helped on to the platform to stand beside her son as his hands were raised by the senate president and speaker. Marcos was also accompanied by his wife, Liza Araneta-Marcos, his sisters Imee and Irene Marcos and son Joseph Simon Marcos. Imee Marcos, who is a senator, told CNN Philippines that she believed her family now had the opportunity to show what it \u201cstill can do for the country\u201d. She said: \u201cWhat\u2019s most important to us is of course our name, the family name that has become so controversial, and so difficult at times to bear. The legacy of my father is what we hope will be clarified at last.\u201d Imee Marcos told media that Imelda\u2019s health had improved rapidly following her son\u2019s election victory. \u201cShe is suddenly able to hear, walk, and her ailments. All her ailments suddenly went away. She is suddenly agile. She looks 29 years old, not 92,\u201d she said. Imelda, who has previously said it was her son\u2019s destiny to become president, was granted bail to appeal corruption charges due to her old age and health. The family\u2019s return to power has horrified both survivors of Marcos Sr\u2019s brutal regime, and those who fear the family will again use its power to enrich itself and crack down on opponents. Prior to the proclamation, protesters gathered at the Commission of Human Rights to denounce the election result. Police responded with water cannon to prevent the groups from marching to Congress. Marcos Jr faces ongoing legal challenges to his presidency, with campaigners arguing that he should have been barred from the presidential race due to a past conviction for failing to file his income tax returns. Two cases have reached the supreme court. Were the supreme court to rule against Marcos, it is possible that Sara Duterte, who ran in tandem with Marcos to be vice-president, could take the highest office. Sara Duterte, daughter of the outgoing president Rodrigo Duterte, was proclaimed vice-president-elect on Wednesday. She was not accompanied by any family members as she took to the rostrum. Her father had previously questioned her decision not to run for the presidency. Marcos Jr received more than 31m votes, out of more than 55m cast, while Sara Duterte won more than 32m. After the session, Marcos Jr asked for people to pray for him. \u201cWish me well. I want to do well because when a president does well, the country does well. And I want to do well for this country,\u201d he said. His term will begin on 30 June."

            "content": "North Korea, China, trade and security. When US presidents visit Japan, the summit agenda practically writes itself. Deciding what to give them to eat, though, is a different matter altogether. When the White House is occupied by someone with as unadventurous a palate as Donald Trump, the scope for showcasing the delicate flavours and aesthetic beauty of its cooking, or washoku, is limited. That was the case during Trump\u2019s first visit to Japan in 2017, when he and the then prime minister, Shinzo Abe, sat down to cheeseburgers and fries at a golf club \u2013 a choice that spurred a run on burgers at the Tokyo restaurant that made them. Treating presidents and their delegations to some of Tokyo\u2019s finest food \u2013 in a city with more Michelin stars than Paris \u2013 hasn\u2019t always gone to plan. In 1991, George HW Bush interrupted a Japanese banquet to vomit into the lap of his host, the then Japanese prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa. The incident, in which Bush fainted, was blamed on a bout of flu, not the food. There was greater success in 2014, when Barack Obama and Abe discussed trade at the world\u2019s best sushi restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro. Despite reports that Obama had failed to complete the 20-piece course, the owner\u2019s son, Yoshikazu Ono, said the president had polished off every morsel. \u201cHe seemed to like chu-toro [medium fatty tuna] very much because he winked when he ate it,\u201d Ono said. \u201cHe said three times, \u2018This is the best sushi I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u2019\u201d In 2002, Japan\u2019s maverick prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, eschewed a formal state dinner and instead introduced the teetotal George W Bush and first lady Laura Bush to the delights of an izakaya Japanese-style pub. Days before Biden\u2019s arrival in Tokyo on Sunday, the Asahi Shimbun reported that Japanese officials were fretting over how to combine Japanese cuisine with the president\u2019s penchant for the \u201cfood of the common folk\u201d. Biden is known to have a taste for ice-cream, and reportedly devoured two \u2013 chocolate chip, then vanilla and chocolate \u2013 in quick succession while chatting to US troops and their families at Osan airbase in South Korea at the weekend. Dinner at a restaurant serving okonomiyaki, a savoury pancake from Hiroshima, where the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has his constituency, was ruled out over \u201csecurity concerns\u201d, the Asahi said. Kishida and Biden, who is travelling without the first lady, Jill Biden, were due to dine at Happo-en, a traditional Japanese restaurant that serves multiple-course kaiseki banquets. The seafood-heavy menu for the two leaders includes simmered Pacific lobster \u2013 accompanied by dried sea-cucumber ovary \u2013 crab, squid and scallop and, in a nod to the guest of honour, a \u201cspecial gelato\u201d for dessert."

            "date": "2022-05-21T10:18:52Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden and his South Korean counterpart, Yoon Suk-yeol, have said they are considering expanding joint military exercises in response to the \u201cthreat\u201d posed by North Korea, a move that is expected to enrage the regime as speculation builds that it could conduct a nuclear test. Speaking in Seoul on the second day of his visit to South Korea, Biden said he was willing to meet North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, but only if he was \u201csincere and serious\u201d about dismantling his nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Yoon, a conservative who took office just 11 days ago, said he and Biden also discussed the timing of a possible deployment in the South of US \u201cstrategic assets\u201d \u2013 a term that typically refers to bombers, submarines and aircraft carriers \u2013 to deter North Korea. The two measures, if implemented, would mark an escalation in US and South Korean efforts to put on a show of force against Pyongyang, and an admission that nuclear talks started by Donald Trump are unlikely to be revived. Some intelligence officials believe the North could be preparing to conduct a nuclear test or ballistic missile launch \u2013 or possibly both \u2013 to coincide with Biden\u2019s five-day visit to South Korea and Japan. But the US president also struck a conciliatory note, repeating his offer to provide the North with vaccines as it battles an outbreak of Covid-19 that has made 2.4 million people sick and killed at least 66. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve offered vaccines, not only to North Korea, but China as well,\u201d Biden said at a joint news conference with Yoon. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to do that immediately. We\u2019ve gotten no response.\u201d The leaders said in a statement that their shared goal was the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula \u2013 a loose commitment Kim made at his first summit with Trump in 2018. But talks have been stalled since early 2019, when Trump and Kim failed to agree on how moves to dismantle the regime\u2019s nuclear arsenal should be met with sanctions relief. Biden and Yoon said they were committed to a \u201crules-based international order\u201d in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2013 wording that could provoke North Korea, which describes its nuclear arsenal as a deterrent against US \u201caggression\u201d. The country has long condemned joint US-South Korea war games as a rehearsal for invasion, while the allies insist they are purely defensive in nature. Yoon said he and Biden were in \u201clockstep\u201d on South Korea\u2019s security in the face of an increasingly unpredictable North. \u201cThere can be no compromise on security,\u201d he said. \u201cThe door to dialogue remains open if North Korea takes genuine steps towards denuclearisation,\u201d he said, adding that the regime would be rewarded with an \u201caudacious\u201d package of economic investment. There is, however, unease in Seoul over how much energy Biden is prepared to commit to the Korean peninsula when his focus is on his domestic agenda, midterm elections and the war in Ukraine. Biden only touched on North Korea in his remarks on Saturday, and some worry that the US could return to the days of \u201cstrategic patience\u201d, when Barack Obama waited for the regime in Pyongyang to demonstrate it was serious about discussing its nuclear arsenal. That laissez-faire approach has been blamed for giving Pyongyang the latitude to build a nuclear deterrent, despite years of UN-led sanctions. Speculation that international cooperation to address the Covid-19 outbreak in North Korea could help ease tensions and encourage dialogue has so far proved misplaced. The regime has ignored offers of medical assistance from the South and the US, and continues to shun the UN-backed Covax vaccination programme. However, reports suggest it is receiving medical supplies from China, its biggest trading partner. \u201cWe are very concerned about the Covid situation,\u201d a senior US administration official said on Saturday. \u201cWe are very sensitive to the fact that they appear to be facing a quite serious situation, and I think you\u2019ve seen we stand ready to work with others in the international community as needed to provide assistance.\u201d North Korea on Saturday reported almost 220,000 more cases of \u201cfever\u201d and one death, bringing the death toll to 66 since the regime admitted for the first time it was battling a Covid outbreak this month. But experts say the caseload and death toll is almost certainly higher. Biden began Saturday by laying a wreath at a cemetery in Seoul for South Korean soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean war, including those who fought alongside US forces. But he will not visit the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border that separates North and South Korea. Previous US presidents have visited the site, and Biden went as vice-president in 2013."

            "title": "Rwanda president suggests UK extradite genocide suspects after asylum deal",
            "date": "2022-05-16T13:32:50Z",
            "content": "Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, has suggested the UK extradite suspects wanted in the east African country for alleged roles in the 1994 genocide, after a controversial deal with the Home Office to process asylum seekers there. Speaking less than two weeks after the deal was announced, Kagame told an audience of diplomats in Kigali that included the British high commissioner he hoped \u201cthat when the UK is sending us these migrants, they should send us some people they have accommodated for over 15 years who committed crimes [in Rwanda]\u201d. \u201cWe sent case files [to the UK] and \u2026 investigated. These are clear case files. Instead of being accommodated there in that beautiful place of [the] UK, they should be in jail, either in the UK or here,\u201d Kagame said. The presence in the UK of five men alleged to have played an active and important role in the killing of more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and some moderate Hutus over three months in Rwanda in 1994 has been an irritant in relations with Kigali for many years. British judges have blocked extradition on the grounds the suspects would not receive a fair trial in Rwanda. Officials in Kigali have called for a trial in the UK instead. All five, aged between 61 and 69, came to the UK in the immediate aftermath of the genocide where they applied for asylum. They deny the allegations against them. The Home Office denied any link between the deal and the issue of extraditions. \u201cAny matters on extradition with Rwanda are not part of our migration and economic development partnership and to suggest otherwise would be completely wrong. This is an independent Metropolitan police inquiry and it would be inappropriate for us to comment further,\u201d a spokesperson said. However, the comments will raise concerns that the British government has made undisclosed promises to Kagame, or will find it more difficult to refuse pressure from Kigali on sensitive issues. Under the deal, Rwanda will be paid an initial \u00a3120m to receive asylum seekers who arrive illegally in the UK. The full details of the agreement have not been made publicly available. Weeks before the deal was announced, the government confirmed the appointment of Rwanda\u2019s new ambassador to the UK, after a delay of eight months. Johnston Busingye, Rwanda\u2019s long-serving justice minister, was named as the new envoy amid international scrutiny over the alleged \u201crendition\u201d and trial of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotelier credited with saving many lives during the genocide \u2013 portrayed in the film Hotel Rwanda. On 29 April, Busingye was received by the Queen at Buckingham Palace in a virtual audience. In his speech, Kagame denied the deal with the UK meant Rwanda was \u201cbuying and selling people\u201d. He said: \u201cNo, we don\u2019t do that kind of thing. We can\u2019t do that because of our core values \u2026\u201cWhen the UK approached us and because of a problem they have \u2026 we are happy to deal with that problem,\u201d Kagame told the diplomats. \u201cThere is nothing bad about this \u2026 There is nothing we cannot be transparent about.\u201d Kagame\u2019s reference to the five alleged genocide suspects may be embarrassing for the UK government and fuel criticism of the asylum deal. In 2019, ministers told parliament the government was \u201cnot shielding any war criminals\u201d and had spent \u00a33m \u201ctrying to get the right outcome\u201d on an investigation launched after the court rulings on extradition and requests from the Rwandan government. Last year, MPs formed an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on war crimes to \u201clook into matters relating to the presence of alleged Rwandan war criminals in the UK and the prosecution of those who participated in the Rwandan genocide\u201d. In April last year, Busingye, as minister of justice, pledged that \u201cRwanda does not seek revenge\u201d and that though extradition was denied, Rwanda had agreed to a trial by the UK courts. \u201cWe are still watching and waiting, waiting for the one signal that will show the genocide victims, in their lifetime, that finally there is commitment to bring these fugitives to justice,\u201d he said. Rusesabagina was tricked into returning to Rwanda in August 2020, in what amounted to an enforced disappearance, a serious violation of international law, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said at the time. He was later convicted of involvement in a rebel group blamed for deadly attacks in Rwanda. A 25-year jail sentence was upheld by Rwanda\u2019s court of appeal, a ruling his family says is in effect a death sentence for the ailing 67-year-old. In his speech to the diplomats, Kagame criticised those whose understanding of Rwanda\u2019s history was based on \u201ca movie\u201d, a reference to Hotel Rwanda. \u201cHe\u2019s a hero, people say \u2026 But what about the families of the victims, people who were lost [at] the hands of this person and the group he led?\u201d the president said. Kagame became head of state in 2000 after he and his rebel forces halted the genocide in 1994 after 100 days of killing resulted in about 800,000 deaths. He brought stability, security and economic growth to a shattered country but has also been accused of running a repressive, authoritarian state. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2022 to correctly refer to asylum seekers rather than refugees in one instance."
