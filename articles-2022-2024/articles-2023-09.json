            "content": "The Guardian US and the Chicago Project on Security and Threats (Cpost) at the University of Chicago are co-hosting an event on Tuesday focusing on dangers to democracy and anticipated threats to the 2024 election. The Guardian\u2019s Fight for Democracy project has been working with Cpost since June 2023, reporting on the project\u2019s Dangers to Democracy surveys which dive into Americans\u2019 views on political violence, conspiracy theories and threats to US elections. The first survey found that a staggering 12 million American adults, or 4.4% of the adult population, believe violence is justified to restore Donald Trump to the White House. The latest September survey found that Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy and the now mounting indictments against him are radicalizing Americans on both sides of the aisle to support violence to achieve political goals. More specifically, the survey found that 5.5% of Americans, or 14 million people, believe the use of force is justified to restore Trump to the presidency, while 8.9% of Americans, or 23 million people, believe force is justified to prevent Trump from being president. The Guardian is committed to reporting on these threats as the 2024 election approaches, including what election officials and other policymakers are doing to combat them, how voters may be affected, how misinformation might amplify them, and how the country could be better prepared to prevent another violent attack like what occurred on 6 January 2021. In the past few months alone, the Guardian has tracked Republican efforts to use conspiracy theories to oust Wisconsin\u2019s respected and bipartisan top election official, reported on various rightwing attempts to skew electoral maps to dilute the power of minority voters, and featured deep dives into the people trying to hold Trump and his allies accountable for attempting to steal the 2020 election. The Fight for Democracy team will continue to track these efforts and more as the next presidential election nears and threats become more pervasive, including publishing Cpost\u2019s latest findings. \u201cWe are now in the age of what I call \u2018violent populism\u2019 where violent ideas by a dedicated minority are moving from fringe to mainstream, creating an environment where incendiary political rhetoric can stimulate violent threats to our democracy,\u201d said Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who directs Cpost. The September survey found that Americans are more deeply distrustful of their democratic institutions and democratically elected leaders and more supportive of violence than in January 2023, when the survey about political violence was started, according to Pape. The survey has been assessing nine measures of antidemocratic attitudes, including the beliefs that elections won\u2019t solve America\u2019s fundamental problems and that political elites are the most corrupt people in the US. Eight of the nine measures are worse today than at the beginning of 2023, Pape said. Still, a vast majority of all Americans think Republicans and Democrats in Congress should make a joint statement condemning any political violence. \u201cWe need to lean into this finding with bipartisan cooperation among our frontline democratic institutions to safeguard democracy,\u201d Pape said. \u201cIf incendiary rhetoric stimulates political violence, calming rhetoric can diminish it.\u201d"

            "title": "Election denier Kari Lake of Arizona to announce run for US Senate seat",
            "date": "2023-09-28T16:06:55Z",
            "content": "The far-right Trump supporter Kari Lake still refuses to accept her defeat in the 2022 race for Arizona governor but will nonetheless run for US Senate next year. \u201cWe need to get a senator in there who is going to fight back and put America first,\u201d the Republican told the Wall Street Journal. A campaign announcement is expected on 10 October, NBC News reported. Lake\u2019s declaration sets up a three-way battle for a seat that could decide control of the Senate, currently held by Democrats 51-49. The incumbent, Kyrsten Sinema, is a former Democrat who now sits as an independent. The most likely Democratic challenger is Ruben Gallego, a congressman and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Lake lost last year\u2019s Arizona gubernatorial race to the Democrat Katie Hobbs, but refused to concede defeat, claiming electoral fraud. She told the Journal she would continue to fight that quixotic battle, saying: \u201cI\u2019m a mom, I can multi-task.\u201d The Journal also said Lake would head for Washington next week, to meet \u201cRepublicans across the ideological spectrum\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet them to show them that I\u2019m a very reasonable person who loves my state,\u201d she said. Lake has, however, attained national prominence from the far right of her party, seeing her name raised as a possible running mate for Donald Trump should he win the Republican nomination again next year. In California on Wednesday night, she performed surrogate duties for Trump at a primary debate that he skipped. Steve Daines of Montana, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which oversees candidate selection, told the Journal that Lake was \u201ca talented campaigner with an impressive ability to fire up the grassroots\u201d. Unmentioned \u2013 as in Lake\u2019s recent book, Unafraid \u2013 were Lake\u2019s documented donations to John Kerry and Barack Obama, and reported campaigning for the latter Democratic candidate for president, before she became an ardent Republican. Arizona\u2019s other sitting US senator, the former astronaut Mark Kelly, is a Democrat. But the state has become a key battleground in congressional and presidential elections. Sinema infuriated progressives by blocking voting rights reform, among other issues, before changing her affiliation last year. She has not yet announced a re-election run. A three-way race would almost certainly split the non-Republican vote. As the progressive strategist Rachel Bitecofer recently pointed out: \u201c91% of Arizona Republicans voted for Kari Lake in 2022 and they\u2019ll do so again in 2024. It\u2019s our vote that will split.\u201d That mirrors concerns at the presidential level about the possible impact of a third-party candidate on a likely Biden-Trump rematch. On Thursday, Axios pointed to a possible upside of a Lake candidacy: \u201cThe race will have implications in the presidential campaign and give President Biden an opportunity to run against the \u2018ultra Maga\u2019 mindset that Lake represents.\u201d A spokesperson for Gallego told the Journal that Lake\u2019s \u201cextremism should disqualify her from public office \u2013 and it will. Again.\u201d"

            "title": "TechScape: As the US election campaign heats up, so could the market for misinformation",
            "date": "2023-09-05T10:45:26Z",
            "content": "X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, announced it will allow political advertising back on the platform \u2013 reversing a global ban on political ads since 2019. The move is the latest to stoke concerns about the ability of big tech to police online misinformation ahead of the 2024 elections \u2013 and X is not the only platform being scrutinised. Social media firms\u2019 handlings of misinformation and divisive speech reached a breaking point in the 2020 US presidential elections when Donald Trump used online platforms to rile up his base, culminating in the storming of the Capitol building on 6 January 2021. But in the time since, companies have not strengthened their policies to prevent such crises, instead slowly stripping protections away. This erosion of safeguards, coupled with the rise of artificial intelligence, could create a perfect storm for 2024, experts warn. As the election cycle heats up, Twitter\u2019s move this week is not the first to raise major concerns about the online landscape for 2024 \u2013 and it won\u2019t be the last. Musk\u2019s free speech fantasy Twitter\u2019s change to election advertising policies is hardly surprising to those following the platform\u2019s evolution under the leadership of Elon Musk, who purchased the company in 2022. In the months since his takeover, the erratic billionaire has made a number of unilateral changes to the site \u2013 not least of all the rebrand of Twitter to X. Many of these changes have centered on Musk\u2019s goal to make Twitter profitable at all costs. The platform, he complained, was losing $4m per day at the time of his takeover, and he stated in July that its cash flow was still in the negative. More than half of the platform\u2019s top advertisers have fled since the takeover \u2013 roughly 70% of the platforms leading advertisers were not spending there as of last December. For his part, this week Musk threatened to sue the Anti-Defamation League, saying, \u201cbased on what we\u2019ve heard from advertisers, ADL seems to be responsible for most of our revenue loss\u201d. Whatever the reason, his decision to re-allow political advertisers could help boost revenue at a time when X sorely needs it. But it\u2019s not just about money. Musk has identified himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d and seems hell bent on turning the platform into a social media free-for-all. Shortly after taking the helm of Twitter, he lifted bans on the accounts of Trump and other rightwing super-spreaders of misinformation. Ahead of the elections, he has expressed a goal of turning Twitter into \u201cdigital town square\u201d where voters and candidates can discuss politics and policies \u2013 solidified recently by its (disastrous) hosting of Republican governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s campaign announcement. Misinformation experts and civil rights advocates have said this could spell disaster for future elections. \u201cElon Musk is using his absolute control over Twitter to exert dangerous influence over the 2024 election,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, head of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a disinformation and hate speech watchdog that Musk himself has targeted in recent weeks. In addition to the policy changes, experts warn that the massive workforce reduction Twitter has carried out under Musk could impact the ability to deal with misinformation, as trust and safety teams are now reported to be woefully understaffed. Let the misinformation wars begin While Musk\u2019s decisions have been the most high profile in recent weeks, it is not the only platform whose policies have raised alarm. In June, YouTube reversed its election integrity policy, now allowing content contesting the validity of the 2020 elections to remain on the platform. Meanwhile, Meta has also reinstated accounts of high-profile spreaders of misinformation, including Donald Trump and Robert F Kennedy Jr. Experts say these reversals could create an environment similar to that which fundamentally threatened democracy in 2020. But now there is an added risk: the meteoric rise of artificial intelligence tools. Generative AI, which has increased its capabilities in the last year, could streamline the ability to manipulate the public on a massive scale. Meta has a longstanding policy that exempts political ads from its misinformation policies and has declined to state whether that immunity will extend to manipulated and AI-generated images in the upcoming elections. Civil rights watchdogs have envisioned a worst-case scenario in which voters\u2019 feeds are flooded with deceptively altered and fabricated images of political figures, eroding their ability to trust what they read online and chipping away at the foundations of democracy. While Twitter is not the only company rolling back its protections against misinformation, its extreme stances are moving the goalposts for the entire industry. The Washington Post reported this week that Meta was considering banning all political advertising on Facebook, but reversed course to better compete with its rival Twitter, which Musk had promised to transform into a haven for free speech. Meta also dissolved its Facebook Journalism Project, tasked with promoting accurate information online, and its \u201cresponsible innovation team,\u201d which monitored the company\u2019s products for potential risks, according to the Washington Post. Twitter may be the most scrutinised in recent weeks, but it\u2019s clear that almost all platforms are moving towards an environment in which they throw up their hands and say they cannot or will not police dangerous misinformation online \u2013 and that should concern us all.

            "date": "2023-09-13T21:13:35Z",
            "content": "Mitt Romney, the only Republican to vote to convict Trump in the 2020 impeachment trial, said he would not be seeking reelection as Utah senator. In an interview with the Washington Post, he offered harsh criticism of Joe Biden and his own party, which he said \u201cis inclined to a populist demagogue message\u201d. A day after House speaker Kevin McCarthy announced a long-shot attempt to impeach Joe Biden, it became clear that Donald Trump has been in discussions with influential House Republicans to push the effort. Trump was in contact with Elise Stefanik, the third most senior Republican in the House of Representatives, and far-right representative Marjorie Taylor Greene in the lead-up to McCarthy\u2019s announcement. Attorneys for Hunter Biden filed a civil lawsuit in federal court against Garrett Ziegler, a former Trump White House aide over his alleged role in publishing online a trove of emails and images obtained from one of Biden\u2019s laptops. The White House sent a letter to US news outlets, urging them to \u201cscrutinize House Republicans\u2019 demonstrably false claims\u201d surrounding their impeachment inquiry into Biden. The memo, which was sent by Ian Sams, the White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations, and addressed to editorial leadership at media organizations. The federal judge overseeing Trump\u2019s classified documents case issued a protective order pertaining to classified evidence in the case, according a court filing. In the Georgia election subversion case, Trump waived his right to seek a speedy trial, according to a court filing. The move is in line with efforts he has taken in other cases to delay proceedings until after the November 2024 election. Eugene Peltola Jr, the husband of the Democratic Alaska congresswoman Mary Sattler Peltola, has died in a plane accident, a spokesperson said. Read more: A delegation of top tech leaders including Sundar Pichai, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altman convened in Washington on Wednesday for the first of nine meetings with US senators to discuss the rise of artificial intelligence and how it should be regulated. Billed as an \u201cAI safety forum,\u201d the closed door meeting was organized by the Democratic senator Chuck Schumer who called it \u201cone of the most important conversations of the year\u201d. The forum comes as the federal government explores new and existing avenues to regulate AI. \u201cIt will be a meeting unlike any other that we have seen in the Senate in a very long time, perhaps ever: a coming together of top voices in business, civil rights, defense, research, labor, the arts, all together, in one room, having a much-needed conversation about how Congress can tackle AI,\u201d Schumer said when announcing the forum. Several AI experts and other industry leaders are also in attendance, at the listening sessions, including Bill Gates; the Motion Picture Association CEO, Charles Rivkin; the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt; the Center for Humane Technology co-founder Tristan Harris; and Deborah Raji, a researcher at University of California, Berkeley. Some labor and civil liberties groups are also represented among the 22 attendees including Elizabeth Shuler, the president of the labor union AFL-CIO; Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers; Janet Murgu\u00eda, the president of UnidosUS; and Maya Wiley, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil &amp; Human Rights. While Schumer describes the meeting as \u201cdiverse\u201d, the sessions have faced criticism for leaning heavily on the opinions of people who stand to benefit from AI technology. \u201cHalf of the people in the room represent industries that will profit off lax AI regulations,\u201d said Caitlin Seeley George, a campaigns and managing director at Fight for the Future, a digital rights group. \u201cPeople who are actually impacted by AI must have a seat at this table, including the vulnerable groups already being harmed by discriminatory use of AI right now,\u201d George said. \u201cTech companies have been running the AI game long enough and we know where that takes us \u2013 biased algorithms that discriminate against Black and brown folks, immigrants, people with disabilities and other marginalized groups in banking, the job market, surveillance and policing.\u201d Read more: As he steps away from the Senate, Mitt Romney is critical of both Democrats and Republicans. Here are some of the key quotes from his interview with the Washington Post at a glance: Romney, a vocal Trump critic, condemned the increasing shift to the extreme right in the Republican party, saying: It\u2019s pretty clear that the party is inclined to a populist demagogue message. But he was also critical of Biden\u2019s record: Biden is unable to lead on important matters and Trump is unwilling to lead on important matters. In what seemed to be a veiled dig at Biden and Trump\u2019s age (80 and 77 respectively), Romney said he was stepping down to make way for a younger crop of leaders: He called for a new generation to \u2018step up [and] shape the world they\u2019re going to live in\u2019. And Romney, who was the only Republican to vote to convict Trump in the 2020 impeachment trial, said he worried that his party had veered too far right, and lost touch with young voters: I know that there are some in MAGA world who would like Republican rule, or authoritarian rule by Donald Trump. But I think they may be forgetting that the majority of people in America would not be voting for Donald J. Trump. The majority would probably be voting for the Democrats\u2026 Young people care about climate change\u2026They care about things that the MAGA Republicans don\u2019t care about. Attorneys for Hunter Biden filed a civil lawsuit in federal court against Garrett Ziegler, a former Trump White House aide over his alleged role in publishing online a trove of emails and images obtained from one of Biden\u2019s laptops. The 13-page suit, filed in federal court in California, accuses Ziegler of improperly \u201caccessing, tampering with, manipulating, altering, copying and damaging computer data that they do not own\u201d in violation of the state\u2019s computer fraud laws. The lawsuit describes in detail how Ziegler and 10 additional unnamed defendants allegedly obtained data belonging to Hunter Biden and disseminated \u201ctens of thousands of emails, thousands of photos, and dozens of videos and recordings\u201d on the internet, ABC News reported. Ziegler, a former aide to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, has emerged as one of the Biden family\u2019s most outspoken critics. Navarro himself has been convicted of contempt of Congress after he refused to cooperate with an investigation of the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The suit reads: Garrett Ziegler is a zealot who has waged a sustained, unhinged and obsessed campaign against [Hunter Biden] and the entire Biden family for more than two years. While Defendant Ziegler is entitled to his extremist and counterfactual opinions, he has no right to engage in illegal activities to advance his right-wing agenda. Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has continued his running-against-Trump-but-not-really campaign with a speech at the former US president\u2019s favourite Washington thinktank. The biotech entrepreneur, who made a splash at the first Republican debate last month, praised Trump several times during remarks at the America First Policy Institute, which spun out of the Trump administration. He also gave a shout out to Matt Gaetz, a congressman from Florida who endorsed Trump for 2024 and was among the guests. Ramaswamy declared his wildly unrealistic plan to slash a million government jobs if elected. In a turbo charged version of Trump adviser Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d, he would reduce the federal employee headcount by 75%, rescind a majority of federal regulations and shut down government agencies including the Department of Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The candidate theatrically tore down posters supposedly showing \u201cmyths\u201d to reveal supposed \u201ctruths\u201d about a president\u2019s power to take such action \u2013 an argument rejected by legal experts. \u201cDo we want incremental reform or do we want revolution?\u201d the candidate asked. I stand on the side of a revival of those 1776 ideals, on the side of yes, we created a government accountable to the people, not the other way around. Democrats reacted to the plans with scorn. The Democratic National Committee said in a press release: Ramaswamy\u2019s not the only MAGA Republican running for president who wants to gut support for federal law enforcement and public education as the GOP hopefuls continue racing to be the most extreme candidate in the field. Here\u2019s more from that Washington Post interview with Mitt Romney, in which the Republican Utah senator announced he would seek reelection in 2024. Asked how he sees a 2024 election rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Romney said \u201cit could go either way\u201d but that \u201cso much can happen between now and then\u201d. He added that talk by the centrist group No Labels of mounting a third party candidacy would be a mistake and only help to reelect Trump. Romney said he doubted the criminal charges pending against Trump, saying he believe people \u201cdon\u2019t respond to old news\u201d. Instead, he believed the investigation of Hunter Biden has the potential for political impact that could harm the president. Former vice president Mike Pence, who has been campaigning in Iowa, was forced to backtrack on earlier comments after House speaker Kevin McCarthy announced he would open an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden without a floor vote. On Monday, Pence said he did not think an impeachment inquiry should \u201cever\u201d be started unilaterally, as he praised McCarthy because he made it clear that if there is to be an impeachment inquiry, he would submit that to a vote on the floor of the Congress\u201d, NBC reported. Less than two days after he made those comments, Pence told a reporter he would have \u201cpreferred\u201d a vote on an inquiry but would defer to House Republicans, the Hill reported. He said: I want to respect Speaker McCarthy\u2019s authority and decision to be able to initiate an impeachment inquiry. The American people have a right to know whether or not President Biden or his family personally profited during his time serving as Vice President. Kevin McCarthy, the speaker of the US House, announced on Tuesday he is launching a formal impeachment inquiry into president Joe Biden \u2013 despite resistance from Republicans in the House and Senate, where an impeachment vote would almost certainly fail. The order comes as McCarthy faces mounting pressure from some far-right members of his chamber, who have threatened to tank his deal to avert a government shutdown by the end of the month if he does not meet their list of demands. According to McCarthy, findings from Republican-led investigations over the summer recess revealed \u201ca culture of corruption\u201d, and that Biden lied about his lack of involvement and knowledge of his family\u2019s overseas business dealings. McCarthy said during a brief press conference at the US Capitol on Tuesday: These are allegations of abuse of power, obstruction and corruption. And they warrant further investigation by the House of Representatives. Many of the allegations center on the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, during his father\u2019s term as vice-president. Republicans allege that Joe Biden improperly benefited from his son\u2019s foreign connections but, after several months, have produced no evidence. Watchdog groups say Republicans do not actually have evidence to back up their claims. McCarthy previously indicated an impeachment inquiry \u201cwould occur through a vote on the floor of the People\u2019s House and not through a declaration by one person\u201d, in a statement to rightwing Breitbart News earlier this month. But he declared the launch of an impeachment probe just a week and a half later, without a House floor vote, which likely means he does not have the support. GOP presidential hopeful Mike Pence was heckled during a campaign stop in Iowa earlier this week by a man who yelled: Get the fuck out of our country and the fuck out of Iowa! \u201cThank you,\u201d the former vice president responded, before addressing the others in attendance. I\u2019m going to put him down as a \u2018maybe\u2019. Utah Republican senator Mitt Romney is the sixth incumbent senator to announce plans to retire after the end of the term in 2025, AP reported. He joins Republican senator Mike Braun of Indiana, as well as Democrats Tom Carper of Delaware, Ben Cardin of Maryland, Dianne Feinstein of California and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Romney, who ran as the GOP\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, became the first US senator in history to vote to convict a president of their own party in an impeachment trial. He was the only Republican to vote against Donald Trump in his first impeachment and one of seven to vote to convict him in the second. Romney has also been an outspoken critic of Joe Biden. Romney\u2019s decision to retire effectively surrenders his senate seat to a GOP successor who could be more closely aligned with Trump and the hardline conservative politics of Utah\u2019s other senator, Mike Lee, Reuters reported. Utah senator Mitt Romney, who told the Washington Post he will not be seeking reelection in 2024, also announced his intentions in a video statement posted to X, formerly known as Twitter. Romney, a former Republican presidential candidate and governor of Massachusetts, said it was \u201ctime for a new generation of leaders\u201d. The 76-year-old said: At the end of another term, I\u2019d be in my mid-80s. Frankly, it\u2019s time for a new generation of leaders. They\u2019re the ones that need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in. Romney said neither Joe Biden nor Donald Trump are leading their parties to confront issues on deficits and debt, and took aim at Trump for calling global warming \u201ca hoax\u201d. The next generation of leaders must take America to the next stage of global leadership. While I\u2019m not running for re election, I\u2019m not retiring from the fight. I\u2019ll be your United States senator until January of 2025. I will keep working on these and other issues and I\u2019ll advance our state\u2019s numerous priorities. I look forward to working with you and with folks across our state and nation in that endeavour. It really is a profound honour to serve Utah and the country. In pushing back against House Republicans\u2019 impeachment investigation, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted that Joe Biden is giving a major speech on economic policy tomorrow and is focussed on \u201creal issues\u201d, in contrast to what she called the GOP\u2019s \u201cridiculous attacks\u201d on the US president by alleging he is corrupt when they have \u201cno evidence.\u201d \u201cWe have heard this over and over in their investigation. Even House Republicans have said the evidence does not exist,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. She added: \u201cThe only reason McCarthy [House speaker and Republican congressman Kevin McCarthy] is doing this is because Marjorie Taylor Greene threatened to shut down the government. Can you imagine shutting down the government over a political stunt?\u201d she said, referring to the the extreme rightwing representative from Georgia. McCarthy is facing an increasingly militant hard-right group including Greene that hopes to stop him supporting the raising of the US debt ceiling in a bipartisan vote that would avoid a government shutdown next month. \u201cWe are talking about vital programs that Americans\u201d rely on, Jean-Pierre said of the specter of a government shutdown, while saying that Florida extremist congressman Matt Gaetz \u201cis threatening to oust him [McCarthy] as speaker.\u201d House Republicans\u2019 long-shot attempt to impeach Joe Biden over corruption allegations relating to his son Hunter\u2019s foreign business dealings is \u201cbaseless\u201d and a \u201cpolitical stunt,\u201d the White House press secretary just said at the media briefing in Washington, DC, moments ago. \u201cThey have spent all year investigating the president and have turned up no evidence, none, that he did anything wrong,\u201d press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. She said the \u201conly reason\u201d there were impeachment moves led by Kevin McCarthy was because the House speaker is under pressure from right-wingers among his fellow Republican members of Congress. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t even put it up for a vote because they don\u2019t have the vote,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. Mitt Romney was critical of fellow Republican Donald Trump, in his interview with the Washington Post in which he announced that he will not seek a second term in the US Senate. The Utah Senator has staked his reputation on being a moderate Republican and said he did not want Trump to be the party\u2019s nominee for president in the 2024 election and had been working to support an alternative, but added: That apparently isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Romney noted to the Post that the three candidates from the far right \u201cMaga wing\u201d of the Republican party, Trump, hardline Florida governor Ron DeSantis and extremist and political novice Vivek Ramaswamy have collectively garnered the bulk of the support so far for the nomination, with Trump well out in front (despite four criminal indictments against the former president). It\u2019s pretty clear that the party is inclined to a populist demagogue message,\u201d he said in the interview. Utah\u2019s US Senator Mitt Romney, who as the Republican nominee lost the 2012 presidential election to incumbent Barack Obama, has announced that he won\u2019t seek a second term. He told the Washington Post it was time for a new generation to \u201cstep up\u201d and \u201cshape the world they\u2019re going to live in\u201d. Romney twice voted to impeach Donald Trump and the 76-year-old told the Post that he believed a second term, which would take him into his 80s, would be \u201cless productive\u201d than his work now. More to follow. Here\u2019s the report. Jared Bernstein, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, said at the media briefing now underway in the west wing that the White House urges America\u2019s auto workers and companies to \u201cwork around the clock\u201d to reach a deal, while refusing to say if Joe Biden supports the idea of a carmakers\u2019 strike. \u201cThe president believes that the autoworkers deserve a contract that sustains middle class jobs,\u201d Bernstein said. He said that supporting union workers was \u201cpillar one\u201d of \u201cBidenomics\u201d, the US president\u2019s economic policies emphasizing public investment and tax policies aimed at boosting the middle class, in contrast to Reagan-style trickle down economics, which Bernstein said \u201cdoes not work\u201d. The deadline for \u201cthe biggest auto strike in generations\u201d is looming for 150,000 US autoworkers, employees at Ford, Stellantis and General Motors are set to walk off the job at 11.59pm on 14 September if tentative agreements for new union contracts aren\u2019t reached by then, the Guardian\u2019s Michael Sainato reports today in this analysis piece. Bernstein said the White House is hoping that negotiators \u201cstay at the table and work 24/7 to get a win-win agreement\u201d rather than strike action occurring. He added he had no \u201cread out\u201d on whether there was any talk in bringing the opposing sides to the White House to lubricate talks. He noted that the Biden administration was closely monitoring the situation and evaluating alternatives to strike action. House speaker Kevin McCarthy tried to evade questions on Wednesday about why he does not intend to hold a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, despite having said just weeks ago that he would not open an official probe without a floor vote. \u201cTo open an impeachment inquiry is a serious matter, and House Republicans would not take it lightly or use it for political purposes. The American people deserve to be heard on this matter through their elected representatives,\u201d McCarthy told Breitbart News on 1 September. That\u2019s why, if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People\u2019s House and not through a declaration by one person. Asked why he had changed his position since the interview, McCarthy responded: I never changed my position. Here\u2019s the clip: David Scanlan, New Hampshire\u2019s secretary of state, said there is no legal basis for keeping Donald Trump off the ballot in the state, which will hold the first Republican presidential primary next year. Scanlan, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, rejected claims made in lawsuits filed in New Hampshire and elsewhere that Trump is ineligible to run for re-election under section 3 of the 14th amendment, which prohibits those who \u201cengaged in an insurrection or rebellion\u201d against the US constitution from holding higher office, according to an AP report. Scanlan said: There is no mention in New Hampshire state statute that a candidate in a new presidential primary can be disqualified using the 14th amendment of the United States constitution referencing insurrection or rebellion. Similarly, there is nothing in the 14th amendment that suggests that exercising the provisions of that amendment should take place during the delegate selection process held by the different states. He also raised concerns that an uneven application of the clause in different states could lead to \u201cchaos, confusion, anger and frustration\u201d. He added: As long as he submits his declaration of candidacy and signs it under the penalties of perjury and pays the $1,000 filing fee, [Donald Trump\u2019s] name will appear on the presidential primary ballot. Scanlan\u2019s announcement came a day after the Trump campaign sent him a letter signed by a group of Republican state lawmakers urging him to reject what they called \u201can absurd conspiracy theory\u201d. Donald Trump has waived his right to seek a speedy trial in the Georgia election subversion case, according to a court filing. The waiver of a speedy trial came on the heels of a brief filed by the office of Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, that all 19 defendants in the sprawling racketeering case should be tried together starting next month. The former president\u2019s latest move is in line with efforts he has taken in other cases to delay proceedings until after the November 2024 election. From Lawfare\u2019s Anna Bower: House speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s decision to call for a formal impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden came after weeks of pressure from hardline House GOP members, but his decision to bypass a floor vote was designed to protect frontline Republicans from having to publicly cast a vote that could come back to bite them in next year\u2019s election, the Punchbowl News report writes. The reality for the 58-year-old, nine-term McCarthy is that once he opens an impeachment inquiry, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that House Republicans will impeach Biden. Remember, a sizable number of Republicans were ready to impeach before the inquiry even began. And once the House has begun the process, not impeaching Biden will look like a validation of the president to many rank-and-file lawmakers. That may be too much for McCarthy to control. The report says most of the 18 Republicans who represent districts that Biden won in 2020 told them they supported the inquiry. John Duarte, a California congressman who represents a district Biden won by 11 points, told the outlet: I think that there\u2019s been enough preliminary work here to absolutely justify going forward with an inquiry. So I think it\u2019s a great middle step. Let\u2019s just get all the facts out and then decide what goes forward from there. The Republican-led House oversight committee is leading the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, with the House judiciary committee and House ways and means committee playing supporting roles. The committees are expected to send letters this week requesting Biden family members\u2019 bank records and other documents in a bid to prove corruption allegations relating to the president\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings, according to Punchbowl News. The House oversight committee panel\u2019s next steps will be to \u201cpursue Hunter and James Biden\u2019s personal and business bank records\u201d and interview more members of the Biden family, a committee spokesperson told the outlet. James Comer, who is chair of the House oversight committee, said his investigation will focus on the president\u2019s alleged wrongdoing, while the other two committees will train their focus on the alleged \u201ccover-up\u201d. All these issues will be discussed at a special House GOP meeting on Thursday, according to the report. Lauren Boebert\u2019s campaign manager confirmed media reports that the far-right Colorado Republican was escorted out of a performance of the Beetlejuice musical in Denver on Sunday night, for alleged disruptive behaviour. In a statement to media, Drew Sexton said: \u201cI can confirm the stunning and salacious rumors: in her personal time, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert is indeed a supporter of the performing arts (gasp!) and, to the dismay of a select few, enthusiastically enjoyed a weekend performance of Beetlejuice, which the Denver Post itself described as \u2018zany\u2019, \u2018outrageous\u2019, and a \u2018lusty riot\u2019.\u201d Local media, led by the Colorado Sun, were first to publish an incident report which did not name Boebert but described the incident at the Buell Theatre. As the Washington Post reports: Surveillance footage from the theater published by KUSA, an NBC affiliate in Denver, appears to show Boebert and a man being escorted from their seats. In the hall, Boebert is seen rebuking an usher, at one point giving him the middle finger. As they were being escorted from the premises, according to the incident report, the pair made statements such as: \u2018Do you know who I am?\u2019 and \u2018I am on the board\u2019 and \u2018I will be contacting the mayor.\u2019 Officers with the Denver police department responded to the incident and stayed in the lobby until the pair left the venue, the report says. The Post adds that \u201cthe man did not appear to be her husband, and his identity is unclear\u201d. Boebert has courted controversy consistently since winning election to Congress in 2020. A narrow winner in her first re-election campaign last year, she is set to face the same Democrat, Adam Frisch, at the polls in 2024. Sexton added that Boebert \u201cappreciates the Buell Theatre\u2019s strict enforcement of their no photos policy and only wishes the Biden administration could uphold our border laws as thoroughly and vigorously\u201d. He told the Post Boebert had not been vaping during the show. The congresswoman, Sexton said, recommended the musical but offered constituents \u201ca gentle reminder to leave their phones outside of the venue\u201d. On Twitter, Boebert said she \u201cdid thoroughly enjoy the AMAZING Beetlejuice at the Buell Theatre and I plead guilty to laughing and singing too loud!\u201d She also asked followers who went to see the show to \u201cplease let me know how it ends!\u201d The trouble for House speaker Kevin McCarthy started in the spring, after the House passed the compromise debt ceiling bill, known as the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Seventy-one members of the House Republican conference opposed the legislation over concerns that it did not go far enough to reduce government spending, and they sharply criticized McCarthy for agreeing to the inadequate deal. The speaker has been bracing for a potential shutdown ever since the debt ceiling showdown concluded, Gordon Gray, vice-president for economic policy at the center-right thinktank American Action Forum, told the Guardian. He said: Since the debt limit grenade was diffused, there\u2019s a big chunk of House Republicans who just want to break something. That\u2019s just how some of these folks define governing. It\u2019s how their constituents define success. With just 12 legislative days left before the end of the fiscal year, the Republican-controlled House must quickly pass some kind of spending package to keep the federal government open after 30 September. If the chamber does not approve a spending bill, the government will shut down for the first time in nearly five years, furloughing federal employees and stalling many crucial programs. McCarthy has indicated his preference to pass a continuing resolution, which would keep the government funded at its current levels for a short period of time as lawmakers continue to negotiate over a longer-term deal. But members of the hard-right House freedom caucus, who are still furious over the deal that McCarthy and President Joe Biden struck to suspend the debt ceiling earlier this year, insist they will not back a continuing resolution unless the speaker agrees to several significant policy concessions, such as increased border security and an impeachment inquiry into Biden. The speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, faces a significant leadership test ahead of a looming government shutdown and despite giving ultraconservative Republicans the Biden impeachment inquiry they wanted. By announcing the inquiry, McCarthy conceded to weeks of pressure from hardline House GOP members and sidestepped as many as 20 Republican House members opposed to the action by avoiding a floor vote, according to Reuters. But even after the announcement, the Republican Florida congressman Matt Gaetz threatened to oust McCarthy under the terms of a deal he agreed to become speaker. Under those terms, any one member of the chamber can force a vote on removing the speaker. Given House Republicans\u2019 narrow majority and this new motion, McCarthy faces losing his gavel after just eight months in power. On Tuesday, Gaetz outlined a series of demands in a speech on the House floor, including calling for passage of individual spending bills and not a short-term stopgap measure to fund the government, CNN reported. Addressing McCarthy directly, he said: The path forward for the House of Representatives is to either bring you into immediate, total compliance or remove you. The firebrand congressman warned there could be multiple votes to remove McCarthy as speaker. If we have to begin every single day in Congress with the prayer, the pledge and the motion to vacate then so be it. Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign moved to use the impeachment inquiry into a fundraising opportunity in an email urging supporters to \u201cshow that you\u2019re standing with the president\u201d. The fundraising email on Wednesday \u2013 the Biden\u2019s campaign first since House speaker Kevin McCarthy launched the inquiry yesterday \u2013 was sent to supporters in vice president Kamala Harris\u2019 name. It says: Kevin McCarthy, Marjorie Taylor Greene and MAGA Republicans just launched a beyond ridiculous impeachment inquiry into President Biden. It\u2019s clear: They\u2019re going to throw everything they have at Joe, because they know they can\u2019t run against our record. If you\u2019re waiting for a moment to show your support for him, trust me when I say: This is it. The Democratic congressional campaign committee sent out a similar email on Tuesday evening, writing: This MAGA Majority needs to be DEFEATED. The White House sent a letter to US news outlets, urging them to \u201cscrutinize House Republicans\u2019 demonstrably false claims\u201d surrounding their impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. The memo, which was sent by Ian Sams, the White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations, and addressed to editorial leadership at media organizations. It says: It\u2019s time for the media to ramp up its scrutiny of House Republicans for opening an impeachment inquiry based on lies. It was sent after the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, announced he had ordered a formal impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s unproven corruption allegations relating to his son Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings. The inquiry has no supporting evidence, which \u201cshould set off alarm bells for news organizations\u201d, Sams argued in the memo. Covering impeachment as a process story \u2013 Republicans say X, but the White House says Y \u2013 is a disservice to the American public who relies on the independent press to hold those in power accountable. He added: In the modern media environment, where every day liars and hucksters peddle disinformation and lies everywhere from Facebook to Fox, process stories that fail to unpack the illegitimacy of the claims on which House Republicans are basing all their actions only serve to generate confusion, put false premises in people\u2019s feeds, and obscure the truth. Republicans have sought to directly connect Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings to his father, but have so far failed to produce evidence that the president directly participated in his son\u2019s work. Eugene Peltola Jr, the husband of the Democratic Alaska congresswoman Mary Sattler Peltola, has died in a plane accident, a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are devastated to share that Mary\u2019s husband, Eugene Peltola Jr \u2013 \u2018Buzzy\u2019 to all of us who knew and loved him \u2013 passed away earlier this morning following a plane accident in Alaska,\u201d said a statement from Anton McParland, the congresswoman\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cHe was one of those people that was obnoxiously good at everything. He had a delightful sense of humor that lightened the darkest moments. He was definitely the cook in the family. And family was most important to him. He was completely devoted to his parents, kids, siblings, extended family, and friends \u2013 and he simply adored Mary. We are heartbroken for the family\u2019s loss.\u201d Mary Sattler Peltola became the first Alaska Native in Congress when she won her seat in the US House in a special election and then in the 2022 midterms, twice defeating the former governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. McParland said: \u201cMary is returning home to be with their family, and we ask that their privacy be respected during this time. Our team will continue to meet with constituents and carry on the work of the office while Mary and her family grieve.\u201d The language in US district judge Aileen Cannon\u2019s court order pertaining to classified evidence in Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case is surprisingly close to the government case against the former president, according to Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney. This seems like a problem for Trump\u2019s defense, given the breadth of what the government considers classified, Josh Gerstein also of Politico writes, pointing to the order that says \u201cthe defense shall discuss classified information only within the Scif (sensitive compartmented information facility) or in an area authorized by the Ciso\u201d. Donald Trump and his lawyers may only review classified evidence in a secure place as he prepares for a criminal trial over his handling of classified documents after he left office in 2021, according to a court filing. In July, the government filed a motion for a proposed protective order pursuant to section 3 of the Classified Information Procedures Act (Cipa) \u201cto prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure or dissemination of classified national security information and documents that will be reviewed by or made available to, or are otherwise in the possession of, Defendant and defense counsel.\u201d After a sealed hearing on Tuesday, US district judge Aileen Cannon granted the government\u2019s motion. Trump had opposed strict security protocols for the classified evidence as inconvenient, saying he and his lawyers should be able to review them in his office at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, Reuters reports. Prosecutors had argued it would be inappropriate for Trump to review classified documents at the very location where is accused of illegally and haphazardly storing them. The order by Judge Cannon requires Trump and his lawyers to review and discuss all classified evidence in a so-called sensitive compartmented information facility, or Scif. US district judge Aileen Cannon has issued a protective order governing classified evidence in the classified documents case against Donald Trump, according to a court filing. The Classified Information Procedures Act, or Cipa, section 3 order means the justice department can begin producing classified discovery to Trump\u2019s legal team. Trump\u2019s lawyers may challenge the conditions of the protective order, including by asking Cannon for an exemption \u2013 potentially to extend access to the former president himself. Once the Cipa section 3 protective order is settled, the justice department can file a Cipa section 4 motion, my colleague Hugo Lowell explains. Section 4 stipulates that Cannon can authorize the government to \u201cdelete specified items of classified information from documents to be made available to the defendant through discovery\u201d or to substitute the classified documents for \u201cunclassified summaries\u201d of the material. It is unclear whether the government will file a section 4 motion. But if it does, that could prompt a challenge from the Trump legal team. If Cannon then agrees that Trump can have all the discoverable documents without restrictions, the government may seek an interlocutory appeal. The US district judge Steve Jones has denied former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows\u2019 request for an emergency stay of a ruling that sent his Georgia 2020 election interference case back to state court. Meadows had asked Jones to pause his ruling pending an appeal to the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit, after the judge denied his initial effort to transfer his case from state to federal court on the basis that some of the charged conduct was within the scope of his official duties. The latest ruling means the prosecution of Meadows brought by the Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis will stay in superior court in Atlanta. Meadows faces two felony charges, including racketeering and solicitation of a violation of oath by a public officer. He has sought to remove the case to federal court arguing that the charges related to his normal work undertaken as a White House chief of staff, which gave him immunity from prosecution and prevented him from being prosecuted at the state level. Former Trump White House chief Mark Meadows\u2019s request for an emergency stay of the order sending his criminal case back to Fulton county superior court, while he appeals to the 11th circuit, has been denied by a federal judge. The federal judge overseeing Donald Trump\u2019s classified documents case issued a protective order pertaining to classified evidence in the case, according a court filing. The US district court judge Aileen Cannon ruled: If there is any question whether information is classified, the defense must handle that information as though it is classified unless counsel for the government or the CISO confirms that it is not classified. From my colleague Hugo Lowell: Donald Trump\u2019s behind-the-scenes lobbying of prominent House Republicans, including Elise Stefanik, and members of the hard right of the party including Marjorie Taylor Greene, tallies with his increasingly shrill public calls for impeachment. The twice impeached former president posted on Truth Social last month: Either IMPEACH the BUM, or fade into OBLIVION. THEY DID IT TO US. Trump was impeached first for seeking dirt on opponents in Ukraine, then for inciting the deadly attack on Congress on 6 January 2021. Retaining sufficient Republican support in the Senate, he was acquitted both times. James Comer, the chair of the House oversight committee who has led the Republican charge for an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, spent \u201ceight months of abject failure\u201d in trying to prove the US president guilty of wrongdoing, according to a watchdog report published on Monday. Comer has been leading an aggressive investigation into unsubstantiated claims that Biden was involved in his son Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business affairs during his time as vice-president. But the report by the Congressional Integrity Project, which monitors the Republican investigations, says Comer repeatedly overhyped allegations of bribery and corruption against Biden without once producing hard evidence. The report says: After months of political stunts, dozens of hearings, transcribed interviews, and memos, and despite hours on Fox peddling conspiracy theories, Comer and his Maga crew have failed to find a single shred of evidence linking President Biden to any of their lurid accusations. Donald Trump thanked House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik for publicly backing the impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden in July in one of their weekly phone calls, according to the NYT report. Despite his eagerness to see an inquiry move forward, Trump has not been twisting House speaker Kevin McCarthy\u2019s arm, a source told the paper. Mr. Trump has been far more aggressive in pushing several members to wipe his own impeachment record clean, the person said, potentially by getting Congress to take the unprecedented step of expunging his two impeachments from the House record. Donald Trump has been weighing in behind the scenes in support of the House GOP push to impeach Joe Biden, including talking with House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, shortly before House speaker Kevin McCarthy announced Republicans would be pursuing the inquiry. Trump has been speaking weekly with Stefanik, who was the first member of the Republican leadership to come out in support of impeachment, according to a Politico report. Stefanik confirmed she had spoken with Trump on Tuesday, telling reporters: I speak to President Trump a lot. I spoke to him today. Stefanik, who has been floated as a potential running mate for Trump in his 2024 presidential bid, added that she believes the Biden family\u2019s business dealings are \u201cthe biggest political corruption scandal of our lifetime\u201d. The Politico report writes: The extent of [Trump\u2019s] private involvement in encouraging House Republicans to plow forward with the process shows the influence he continues to wield inside the party as its likely presidential nominee. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right congresswoman who dined with Donald Trump two days before Speaker Kevin McCarthy announced a formal impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, told reporters on Tuesday she wanted to see \u201ca very deep dive\u201d \u201cno matter how long it takes\u201d. Greene, who has been pushing for the inquiry since the GOP took control of the House in January, said the inquiry \u201cmay take months and months\u201d. Speaking after McCarthy\u2019s announcement, she said: It may go all the way to the November election. But what we need to do is we need to investigate Joe Biden. But we also need to investigate the web of people that exist in our federal agencies, the FBI, the DOJ, the CIA, and many others, serving not only in this administration, the former administration and the one before it, maybe even further, we need to find the people that have covered up Joe Biden\u2019s crimes and all of the Biden family\u2019s corruption. A New York Times report published this morning says Greene dined with Trump on Sunday night at his Bedminister club, where she told the paper she laid out her plan for a \u201clong and excruciatingly painful\u201d impeachment inquiry into Biden. Donald Trump has privately and publicly pushed for an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, including weekly telephone calls with the chair of the House GOP conference, Elise Stefanik, and dinner with the far-right congresswoman from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, at his private golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to a New York Times report published today. Greene, a conspiracy theorist and Trump ally, confirmed to the paper that she dined with the former president on Sunday night, and that the pair discussed the push by House Republicans to impeach Trump\u2019s likely opponent in the 2024 presidential election. Greene, who has introduced articles of impeachment against Biden, said she laid out her impeachment strategy at the dinner, telling Trump she wanted the inquiry to be \u201clong and excruciatingly painful for Joe Biden\u201d. The dinner took place just two nights before the speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, under intense pressure from his right flank, announced his decision to order a formal impeachment inquiry into the president. Trump has spoken regularly with members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus and other congressional Republicans who pushed for impeachment, according to the report. Just earlier this month, House speaker Kevin McCarthy said he would not move forward with an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden without a floor vote. In an interview with Breitbart published on 1 September, McCarthy made clear that the move would come not as an announcement from him or anyone else, but from a formal vote on the floor of the House. He said: To open an impeachment inquiry is a serious matter, and House Republicans would not take it lightly or use it for political purposes. The American people deserve to be heard on this matter through their elected representatives. That\u2019s why, if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People\u2019s House and not through a declaration by one person. In 2019, McCarthy posted a tweet warning his predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, that she could not call on an impeachment probe against Donald Trump without a House vote. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi can\u2019t decide on impeachment unilaterally. It requires a full vote of the House of Representatives,\u201d McCarthy wrote. He now appears to have changed his mind. Good morning, US politics blog readers. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, on Tuesday announced that Republicans would open an impeachment investigation into Joe Biden over unproven allegations of corruption in his family\u2019s business dealings. In a statement, McCarthy said the House investigations into the Biden family this year uncovered a \u201cculture of corruption\u201d that demands deeper review. But it is unclear if the Republican party has the evidence to substantiate the long-running claims, or even the votes for impeachment. In response, White House spokesperson Ian Sams described McCarthy\u2019s move as \u201cextreme politics at its worst\u201d, while a spokesperson for the Biden-Harris 2024 campaign said the House speaker has \u201ccemented his role as the Trump campaign\u2019s super-surrogate by turning the House of Representatives into an arm of his presidential campaign\u201d. Since gaining the House majority in January, House GOP members have aggressively investigated the president and his son, Hunter Biden, over allegations that echo those that Donald Trump has made for years against Biden and his family. Trump has talked regularly with members of the House Freedom Caucus and other congressional Republicans who pushed for a Biden impeachment inquiry, according to a New York Times report published this morning. The former president dined with the far-right congresswoman, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who said she told Trump she wanted the impeachment inquiry to be \u201clong and excruciatingly painful for Joe Biden\u201d. A Politico report on Tuesday wrote that the former president has been speaking on a weekly basis with House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik, who was the first member of Republican leadership to come out in support of impeachment. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re watching today: 8.30am Eastern time: August consumer price index date released by the bureau of labor statistics. 10am: House majority whip Tom Emmer, House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik, House oversight chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and congressman Ken Calvert will speak to reporters after the GOP conference meeting. 10.45am House Democratic caucus chair Peter Aguilar and vice-chair Ted Lieu will speak to reporters after their closed-party meeting. 1pm: White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein will brief reporters. 2.30pm: President Joe Biden will hold a meeting of his \u201ccancer cabinet\u201d."

            "title": "US and Brazil warn of attempt to stop Guatemala president-elect taking power",
            "date": "2023-09-20T16:56:16Z",
            "content": "International concern over the future of Guatemala\u2019s democracy is growing, as Brazil\u2019s president warned of a possible coup to stop the president-elect taking power and the US denounced unprecedented attempts to undermine the Central American country\u2019s election result. The centre-left anti-corruption crusader Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo was elected Guatemala\u2019s new president last month. This week thousands of supporters took to the streets to protest against alleged attempts to block his inauguration in January. Last week, Ar\u00e9valo \u2013 the son of Guatemala\u2019s first democratically elected president, Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo \u2013 temporarily pulled out of the transition process after government officials raided electoral facilities where ballot boxes were being stored. Ar\u00e9valo has accused corrupt officials and politicians of launching \u201ca plan to break the constitutional order and subvert democracy\u201d. \u201cA coup d\u2019\u00e9tat [is] under way,\u201d he claimed earlier this month after attempts to suspend his party, the Movimiento Semilla (Seed Movement). Addressing the UN general assembly on Tuesday, the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, echoed Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s warning, citing the crisis in Guatemala after recent \u201cinstitutional ruptures\u201d in the African nations of Burkina Faso, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Sudan. \u201cIn Guatemala, there\u2019s the risk of a coup, which would prevent the winner of democratic elections taking office,\u201d Lula said. Lula\u2019s remarks followed comments on Monday from Francisco Mora, the US\u2019s ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS), about the \u201ctroubling\u201d situation in Guatemala. Mora said Washington was \u201cdeeply concerned about the unprecedented actions of those seeking to undermine democracy in Guatemala by discrediting and obstructing a smooth transition of power\u201d. \u201cSuch anti-democratic behaviour, including ongoing efforts by the public ministry and other corrupt individuals to suspend the president-elect\u2019s political party, all subverts the clear will of the Guatemalan people,\u201d Mora said. \u201cIn a healthy democracy, institutions don\u2019t tamper with ballot boxes after election results have been officially certified by the appropriate authority. Such interference and lawfare \u2026 strikes at the very heart of the democratic process and represents an assault on the rule of law.\u201d Lula\u2019s alert was quickly rejected by Guatemala\u2019s outgoing rightwing president, Alejandro Giammattei, as \u201cunnecessary international interference\u201d. \u201cContrary to the untruths \u2026 we have heard from this podium today, on 14 January I will hand power to [the person] elected by the sovereign majority will of the people of Guatemala,\u201d Giammattei told the general assembly. Political observers had hailed Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s surprise election as a powerful correction to the democratic deterioration in Latin America, where countries such as El Salvador, Nicaragua and Venezuela have taken an alarming authoritarian turn in recent years. Concerns have also been raised over the erosion of democratic institutions in Mexico under its president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and the deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in Peru under Dina Boluarte. Speaking at the UN, Lula hailed his 2022 election victory over Brazil\u2019s far right former president Jair Bolsonaro as a \u201ctriumph of democracy\u201d over \u201chate, misinformation and oppression\u201d. But the Brazilian leftwinger was criticised by some for denouncing the democratic crisis in Guatemala and the US embargo on Cuba but failing to mention the dismantling of democracy in Nicaragua or Venezuela. Pamela Ruiz, a Central America analyst for Crisis Group, said it was hard to predict what the coming weeks had in store for Guatemala. But she believed it was possible members of Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s party \u2013 or even Ar\u00e9valo himself \u2013 could face criminal charges after the official electoral process ended on 31 October. \u201cIf Ar\u00e9valo is not allowed to take office there could be very grave consequences for this country,\u201d Ruiz said, describing a mood of trepidation among ordinary citizens who feared \u201cthe corrupt\u201d elites would \u201cdo whatever it takes to stop him getting in\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a very scary statement,\u201d Ruiz added, \u201cbecause \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 is pretty much implying a coup.\u201d"

The world can follow, 31 August). Despite courageous local activism against illegal drilling, stopping it altogether has had limited success to date. Of the two remaining candidates for the presidential runoff in October, the conservative Daniel Noboa, the 35-year-old son of a banana magnate, has vaguely hinted on the need to diversify away from reliance on oil. The position of the other candidate, 45-year-old Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez, is also uncertain in relation to oil production. She is an ally of the former president, Rafael Correa. Ecuadorian courts have accused Correa of corruption and sentenced him to prison in absentia, should he return from exile in Belgium. An omission from the article is the assassination on 9 August of the presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio, a strong voice against corruption and illegal oil drilling. Recognising the power of oil and drug interests in Ecuador, combined with the country\u2019s significant socioeconomic inequalities, might help ensure that the referendum vote becomes a positive step forward rather than offer naive optimism that ends in disappointment.

            "date": "2023-09-20T22:50:16Z",
            "content": "Fulton county prosecutors argued at a court hearing on Wednesday that three fake Trump electors seeking to transfer their criminal cases for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia should have their requests denied as they were not federal officials and thus ineligible. The prosecutors cited past comments made by supreme court justices to contend that merely performing a role in a federal election did not make them federal officials and, in any case, they were not even the duly elected electors for the state because Donald Trump lost. \u201cThese private parties did not transform into public officials by committing a crime,\u201d lead prosecutor Anna Cross said at the evidentiary hearing in federal district court in Atlanta. \u201cThey were not federal officials. They were not electors at all.\u201d The decision on whether the three Trump electors \u2013 David Shafer, Shawn Still and Catherine Latham \u2013 can remove their racketeering charges to federal court will be made by the presiding US district judge, Steve Jones, who declined to issue a ruling from the bench. Jones now has four removal decisions in the Fulton county prosecution pending: the request filed by Jeffrey Clark, the former Trump justice department official, as well as the motions filed by the three fake electors that were collapsed for logistical reasons into one hearing. The judge previously rejected the removal request from Mark Meadows, the former Trump White House chief of staff. Last week, Meadows appealed the decision to the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit. How the current cases play out are important for the other co-defendants in the sprawling racketeering and conspiracy indictment, most notably Trump, who has been weighing whether to file a request of his own and whose lawyer Steve Sadow was at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. To move a state criminal case to federal court, a defendant has to show they were a federal official, that they were acting within the scope of their official duties as a federal official and they had a legitimate defense to the conduct under federal law. At the evidentiary hearing, the defense lawyers for the three Trump electors made two primary arguments that their clients could be construed as federal officials and therefore eligible to be tried in federal court. The Trump electors satisfied the first two prongs of the removal test, their lawyers argued, because the signing and sending of the fake certificates declaring Trump the winner of the 2020 election in Georgia were acts described by the Electoral Count Act. If the Trump electors were federal officials, as their lawyers believed, they could satisfy the third prong by arguing they were immune because they would be protected by the supremacy clause that bars individual states from prosecuting US government officials. That argument from the Trump electors was complicated: it contended that so long as a lawsuit challenging the 2020 election results in Georgia had not been resolved by the so-called safe harbor date, it was up to Congress to decide which slate to accept at the congressional certification. \u201cWhen the state misses the safe harbor date, the power goes back Congress,\u201d said Holly Pierson, one of the lawyers for Shafer. Whether Jones accepts that reasoning is uncertain. Legal experts noted that the argument suggested Congress had an ability to unilaterally decide which slates to accept in the event someone filed a lawsuit and it was not adjudicated before the safe harbor deadline. The prosecutors also argued that the Trump electors were nothing other than private individuals trying to overturn the 2020 election result since, under Georgia state law, official electors are those nominated by the party that wins the popular vote \u2013 which was never in doubt. Furthermore, to successfully change trial venue from state to federal court, the burden rests on the defendants to show they were federal officials. The three Trump electors did not meet their burden because they did not appear in person for examination, the prosecutors argued."

            "content": "The far-right Trump supporter Kari Lake still refuses to accept her defeat in the 2022 race for Arizona governor but will nonetheless run for US Senate next year. \u201cWe need to get a senator in there who is going to fight back and put America first,\u201d the Republican told the Wall Street Journal. A campaign announcement is expected on 10 October, NBC News reported. Lake\u2019s declaration sets up a three-way battle for a seat that could decide control of the Senate, currently held by Democrats 51-49. The incumbent, Kyrsten Sinema, is a former Democrat who now sits as an independent. The most likely Democratic challenger is Ruben Gallego, a congressman and member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Lake lost last year\u2019s Arizona gubernatorial race to the Democrat Katie Hobbs, but refused to concede defeat, claiming electoral fraud. She told the Journal she would continue to fight that quixotic battle, saying: \u201cI\u2019m a mom, I can multi-task.\u201d The Journal also said Lake would head for Washington next week, to meet \u201cRepublicans across the ideological spectrum\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d like to meet them to show them that I\u2019m a very reasonable person who loves my state,\u201d she said. Lake has, however, attained national prominence from the far right of her party, seeing her name raised as a possible running mate for Donald Trump should he win the Republican nomination again next year. In California on Wednesday night, she performed surrogate duties for Trump at a primary debate that he skipped. Steve Daines of Montana, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which oversees candidate selection, told the Journal that Lake was \u201ca talented campaigner with an impressive ability to fire up the grassroots\u201d. Unmentioned \u2013 as in Lake\u2019s recent book, Unafraid \u2013 were Lake\u2019s documented donations to John Kerry and Barack Obama, and reported campaigning for the latter Democratic candidate for president, before she became an ardent Republican. Arizona\u2019s other sitting US senator, the former astronaut Mark Kelly, is a Democrat. But the state has become a key battleground in congressional and presidential elections. Sinema infuriated progressives by blocking voting rights reform, among other issues, before changing her affiliation last year. She has not yet announced a re-election run. A three-way race would almost certainly split the non-Republican vote. As the progressive strategist Rachel Bitecofer recently pointed out: \u201c91% of Arizona Republicans voted for Kari Lake in 2022 and they\u2019ll do so again in 2024. It\u2019s our vote that will split.\u201d That mirrors concerns at the presidential level about the possible impact of a third-party candidate on a likely Biden-Trump rematch. On Thursday, Axios pointed to a possible upside of a Lake candidacy: \u201cThe race will have implications in the presidential campaign and give President Biden an opportunity to run against the \u2018ultra Maga\u2019 mindset that Lake represents.\u201d A spokesperson for Gallego told the Journal that Lake\u2019s \u201cextremism should disqualify her from public office \u2013 and it will. Again.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-05T04:56:12Z",
            "content": "A billionaire presidential hopeful in Taiwan has proposed boosting the plummeting birthrate by offering couples free pets if they have a baby. Terry Gou, the founder of Apple-supplier Foxconn, announced his intention to seek the presidency as an independent candidate last week. In an early sign of how his campaign may run, Gou told attendees at a Taipei city temple on Friday that the declining birthrate in Taiwan could be addressed by giving new parents a cat or dog. Taiwan has one of the world\u2019s lowest birthrates, with many people citing the high cost of living, difficulties in accessing childcare, and traditional gender expectations. The rapid ageing of the population threatens the economy and military defence of Taiwan. Meanwhile pet ownership is skyrocketing, with anecdotal reports suggesting many couples are choosing animals over children. Gou however, felt people could be motivated to take on both. \u201cGive birth to a child and I will let you raise one more pet,\u201d he said, according to a translation by Formosa TV. \u201cA cat, a dog. Give birth to two, and I will let you adopt two more.\u201d Getting a pet in Taiwan does not require government permission. Gou said he had recently visited an animal shelter, and felt that two issues could be solved together. \u201cIf there is no birthrate in the future, who will take care of our furry friends?\u201d he told reporters later. \u201cSo I have put these two issues together. You can\u2019t expect me, one person, to propose a complete policy for every little matter. Adding and multiplying love, that\u2019s my goal.\u201d The proposal was criticised by some government politicians and animal welfare groups. Gou said that during the last presidential election, he had proposed government subsidies for childrearing costs up to the age of six, but it was not implemented. Gou has also pledged to fix cross-strait relations and boost Taiwan\u2019s economy. He resigned from the Foxconn board on Saturday. He has until November to gather 290,000 signatures to secure his nomination, but has already shaken up the presidential race. Gou would be the third opposition candidate, alongside the KMT\u2019s Hou You-ih, and the Taiwan People\u2019s party\u2019s Ko Wen-je. The nominee from the ruling Democratic Progressive party, vice-president Lai Ching-te, remains in front with about one third of support in polling. President Tsai Ing-wen is due to step down in January at the end of two terms. Political analysts say Gou\u2019s entry threatens to further split the non-DPP vote. Gou\u2019s campaign has been contacted for comment."

            "content": "Chris Christie digs Coldplay. Cornel West is into Coltrane. And Vivek Ramaswamy, the pharmaceutical magnate whose net worth is approaching $1bn, has found a kindred spirit in Woody Guthrie. These are a few of the 2024 presidential candidates revealing the music that \u201cstirs their soul\u201d, assuming they have one. The lists, solicited by Politico, are oozing with the raw passion politicians are known for: who hasn\u2019t shed a tear while listening to Bananarama, as Nikki Haley apparently has? Sure, the 20-song lists were probably focus-grouped beyond recognition, but you can learn a lot about someone from the music they pretend to like. Here\u2019s what the playlists tell us. Chris Christie: Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Eagles The tough-talking former New Jersey governor has a well-documented obsession with the Boss, so it\u2019s no surprise that his list starts with Springsteen. His alleged favorite song is Thunder Road, a politically deft option: it\u2019s popular enough without being obvious, avoids any political messaging, yet still screams \u201cregular guy\u201d. The choice of a pathos-tinged tune also feels appropriate given Christie\u2019s shifting position. Once the loudest bully in the room, he\u2019s been so thoroughly out-evilled by red-meat maniacs that he seems to be running as the guy with a heart. To prove his New Jersey credentials \u2013 did you know Chris Christie is from New Jersey? He\u2019s from New Jersey \u2013 he\u2019s also chosen the obscure Bon Jovi hit Livin\u2019 on a Prayer. And among the other highlights on his list \u2013 which features a truly remarkable number of ageing white guys \u2013 is the Eagles\u2019 Hotel California, whose tale of self-imprisonment must ring true for any anti-Trump Republican: And in the master\u2019s chambers They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives But they just can\u2019t kill the beast Nikki Haley: Dolly Parton, the Killers, Post Malone The former South Carolina governor\u2019s favorites feature a bit more variety, squeezing in Dolly Parton, Cat Stevens and Abba. Virtually everything on her list is pre-2010, which is perfectly understandable for a 51-year-old \u2013 and then suddenly there\u2019s Post Malone\u2019s Take What You Want, featuring Ozzy Osbourne and Travis Scott. It\u2019s unclear how she stumbled on this song the year after she stepped down as Donald Trump\u2019s UN ambassador, and what about it stirred her soul. Does she cut a rug to lines like \u201cI feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone / You bled me dry just like the tears you never show\u201d while mulling over policy ideas? The only other recent hit on her list is Fast Car \u2013 the 2023 version by Luke Combs, rather than the 1988 original by Tracy Chapman, a bona fide American classic. Maybe that version has somehow slipped under her radar for the past 35 years. Or perhaps, like Christie, she\u2019s trying to flex her home-state credentials (Combs is from North rather than South Carolina, but they\u2019re close). Then again, Chapman is from Ohio \u2013 a swing state. Haley and Christie have something else in common: a love for the Killers\u2019 Mr Brightside. Tough to imagine why a song about cheating, lies and paranoia would appeal to two Republican presidential candidates. Vivek Ramaswamy: Imagine Dragons, Imagine Dragons, Mozart The Harvard-educated businessman apparently doesn\u2019t know 20 songs: he only submitted eight pieces of music, and one isn\u2019t a song \u2013 it\u2019s Mozart\u2019s Rondo Alla Turca, a staple of fifth-grade piano recitals. (That said, it is an absolute banger.) Beyond an inability to count, he also appears to have trouble following directions: he has two songs by the banal pop outfit Imagine Dragons, despite Politico\u2019s one-song-per-artist rule. Eminem\u2019s Lose Yourself tops Ramaswamy\u2019s list, presumably to the artist\u2019s chagrin: Eminem recently told the politician never to perform his song again after Ramaswamy started rapping at the Iowa State Fair. He\u2019s not the only candidate to have a rocky relationship with one of his musical heroes \u2013 Springsteen has rejected performance invitations from Christie and mocked him on TV, though they did hug once after Hurricane Sandy. And like Christie, Ramaswamy has chosen Aerosmith\u2019s Dream On; like Haley, he\u2019s into Dolly Parton\u2019s Jolene. In a country that can feel so divided, it\u2019s nice to know that politicians can agree on which songs are most likely to make them look good. Will Hurd: A Tribe Called Quest, Demi Lovato, Matisyahu Credit where credit is due: this former congressman who will never be president has a very interesting list, including tracks from A Tribe Called Quest, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Matisyahu and Demi Lovato. Either he has taste so eclectic it\u2019s verging on bizarre, or he closed his eyes and jabbed at random sentences on the Wikipedia page for \u201cAmerican popular music\u201d. Larry Elder: Sam Cooke, Gladys Knight, the Beatles Elder works in radio, so you\u2019d think he might have heard a few songs written after 1992, but apparently none have stirred his soul. To be fair, his list is probably genuine \u2013 no focus group would suggest picking two Boyz II Men songs from the same album. Elder grew up in the 60s, and his favorite songs are mostly from that turbulent era \u2013 Sam Cooke, Gladys Knight, the Beatles. It was a time of youthful idealism, of fights for civil rights and gender equality and against war. One can only imagine how proud these musicians would be of Elder\u2019s views \u2013 his preferred minimum wage of \u201c$0.00\u201d, his assertion that \u201cwomen know less than men about political issues\u201d, and his support for ending birthright citizenship and allowing the denial of emergency care to undocumented people. Asa Hutchinson: Johnny Cash, Garth Brooks, Pink The former Arkansas governor also struggled to come up with 20 songs; like Ramaswamy, he managed a total of eight. They\u2019re mostly country and folk hits from the likes of Johnny Cash, Levon Helm and Garth Brooks \u2013 not surprising for an Arkansas man. But don\u2019t be fooled: this 2024 Republican contender knows a beat when he hears one. When things start to get wild in the ex-governor\u2019s household \u2013 perhaps when the Hutch reflects on such accomplishments as blocking Syrian refugees from entering Arkansas, or resuming executions \u2013 he cranks up Pink\u2019s Get the Party Started. Cornel West: John Coltrane, Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin Given that the philosopher and activist has worked with Talib Kweli, Andr\u00e9 3000, Killer Mike and a host of other musicians, he must know more than four songs. But that was all the Green party candidate was able to provide, falling short of even Ramaswamy and Hutchinson. Then again, maybe there are only four songs that truly stir his soul \u2013 and tracks from John Coltrane, Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin and the Isleys seem like reasonable candidates."

The Home Office, which hopes to hold hundreds of people seeking asylum on the barge in Portland, received the most recent legionella results on 4 September and government sources said they were not planning to make the results public. The Guardian obtained the results in freedom of information data from Dorset council. In these most recent results, all the water samples tested for legionella were deemed \u201csatisfactory\u201d, although some of the bacteria were identified in two of the samples. In three previous sets of tests, at least some of the samples tested were found to be \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d for legionella. The worst results related to samples from 9 August, two days after asylum seekers were briefly put on the barge. They were removed after just four and a half days. In these results, eight of the 11 samples taken were unsatisfactory and three were borderline. Some of the bacteria found was the deadliest strain, legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. A second freedom of information request, to Cornwall council, revealed that the barge was not inspected for legionella while in Falmouth for checks and repairs before it was moved to Portland. A third freedom of information request revealed that the Home Office has used water safety risk assessments for the Bibby Stockholm that are more than six years out of date. The Home Office said a more up-to-date risk assessment had subsequently been signed off. Apart from the legionella bacteria found on the barge, concerns have been raised about planning, fire safety and plumbing breaches. Legal actions are under way relating to these issues. A spokesperson for the Home Office barge contractor CTM confirmed that repairs to the plumbing were under way after an inspection by Wessex Water found failings. In media interviews on Wednesday, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, said \u201cvarious procedures\u201d needed to be completed before people could return to the Bibby Stockholm but that government had done \u201creally well\u201d with its work on the barge. Beyond Borders Totnes &amp; District, an organisation that is supporting some of the men taken off the barge, said none wanted to return there. \u201cThey found the barge intolerable and claustrophobic. It is utterly prison-like,\u201d a spokesperson said. The Home Office said: \u201cWe are pleased to confirm that the latest tests have shown that there are no health risks from legionella on the Bibby Stockholm, with individuals set to return to the barge in due course. \u201cThe welfare of asylum seekers is of paramount importance. It is right we went above and beyond UK Health Security Agency advice and disembarked asylum seekers as a precautionary measure whilst the issue was investigated.\u201d Home Office sources added that an agreed programme of work including a complete flush and chlorination of the water had been undertaken and that a water control plan was in place with regular water testing to continue."

            "content": "Women are being unnecessarily alarmed about their risk of breast cancer by consumer genetic test results that do not take family history into account, researchers have said. Women who discover outside a clinical setting that they carry a disease-causing variant of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes may be told that their risk of breast cancer is 60-80%. But analysis of UK Biobank data suggests the risk could be less than 20% for those who do not have a close relative with the condition. Dr Leigh Jackson, of the University of Exeter\u2019s medical school, who is the lead author of the analysis published in the journal eClinical Medicine, said that in extreme cases this could result in women unnecessarily undergoing surgery. \u201cBeing told you are at high genetic risk of disease can really influence levels of fear of a particular condition and the resulting action you may take,\u201d he said. \u201cUp to 80% risk of developing breast cancer is very different from 20%.\u201d NHS clinical geneticists already routinely factor family history into risk scores, making it unlikely that women are going ahead with surgery on a misinformed basis. However, doctors said that by the time some women arrived in their clinics, they were already strongly inclined to opt for a mastectomy after learning that they carry a BRCA mutation. \u201cFrom a psychological point of view, it is very difficult if you\u2019re a woman and this comes out of the blue,\u201d said Prof Marc Tischkowitz, the head of medical genetics at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the research. \u201cNo matter what a professional says, that initial shock stays with you and you\u2019re kind of inclined not to be so reassured. It\u2019s definitely an issue that we then have to deal with.\u201d The authors analysed more than 454,000 people recruited between the ages of 40 and 69 into the UK Biobank study, which collects DNA samples and asks participants to report illness in themselves as well as in parents and siblings. They found that carrying a disease-causing BRCA variant was linked to a breast cancer risk of 18% (for BRCA2) and 23% (for BRCA1) by age 60. Having a close relative who has had the condition elevated the risk to 24% (for BRCA2) and 45% (for BRCA1). The researchers said these figures could underestimate the risk slightly, due to people who have died early from breast cancer not being included in the cohort. Until recently, women who received BRCA results did so because they had attended clinic due to symptoms or a family history of disease. However, an increasing number are now learning of their genetic risk after paying for home DNA testing kits or taking part in genetic research, without ever having any personal link with breast cancer. The latest study suggests that the risk carried by BRCA variants depends on secondary genetic factors, meaning family history is crucial for understanding an individual\u2019s risk. Prof Caroline Wright, of the University of Exeter medical school, said: \u201cOur findings will not just apply to breast and colorectal cancer. All risk estimates of genetic disease have so far largely been based on relatively high-risk groups who attend specialist clinics, so they will not necessarily translate to the general population. We need to ensure we are carrying out research to find the true risk level, and also to be responsible in how we communicate risk, to avoid unnecessary fear and distress which may lead to avoidable procedures.\u201d"

The Democrat, who is Black, won a crowded primary against 10 other candidates vying for the party nomination on Tuesday in a special election to replace former congressman David Cicilline, who resigned earlier this year to lead the Rhode Island Foundation, a large funder of non-profits. In April, Amo left the White House, where he most recently served as a deputy director of the office of intergovernmental affairs, to launch his campaign for the open seat in Rhode Island\u2019s first congressional district. In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Amo, who was born in one of the district\u2019s larger cities, Pawtucket, began with a nod to his parents and his Rhode Island roots. \u201cThis primary election showed that Rhode Islanders believed in a state where one of their sons, the son of two west African immigrants from Ghana and Liberia, could receive the love and the investments of a community and go from serving the president of the United States and breathing in the Oval Office to being the Democratic nominee for Congress in the first congressional district,\u201d Amo said. Amo will face the Republican Gerry Leonard, a political newcomer and US Marine veteran, during the November election. Rhode Island has not elected a Republican since the 1990s. Rhode Island has two seats in the US House. The freshman Democrat Seth Magaziner, the former Rhode Island treasurer, currently represents the state\u2019s second congressional district. Before the Biden administration, Amo, 35, worked for Barack Obama, including on his re-election bid. He also worked for Gina Raimondo, the former governor of Rhode Island and the current US commerce secretary, after serving as a senior adviser to her gubernatorial campaign. \u201cI\u2019m going to use all of that experience that I\u2019ve built in Washington and working here in Rhode Island to connect to the key priorities of so many people throughout the first district,\u201d Amo told reporters on Tuesday. Among those priorities are preventing gun violence and pushing for an assault rifle ban, protecting social security against Republicans\u2019 efforts to slash its funding, and upholding abortion rights. On Tuesday, Amo prevailed over a slate of well-known candidates, including the progressive runner-up Aaron Regunberg, a former state representative backed by Bernie Sanders, the independent US senator from Vermont, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He also defeated Rhode Island\u2019s lieutenant governor, Sabina Matos, an Afro-Latina woman who is originally from the Dominican Republic. \u201cIt is not lost on me that I stand on the shoulders of giants,\u201d Amo said during his victory speech Tuesday night. \u201cOf so many who paved the road before me: Black, brown, women. So many people, who have had the opportunity to pave a pathway so I could stand here today. And I want to acknowledge that.\u201d Voters will decide between Amo and Leonard in the election on 7 November."

Despite its victory, the PP, led by Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, has little chance of securing the necessary parliamentary support to form a new government during a congressional vote this week. The numbers instead favour the PSOE, led by the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. But to stand any chance of forming a new administration, S\u00e1nchez will have to secure the backing of the hardline Catalan independence party led by the former Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont. Puigdemont fled Spain six years ago to avoid arrest over his role in masterminding the unilateral and unlawful push for independence. Puigdemont has insisted his support will be conditional on the granting of amnesty to him and hundreds of other Catalans wanted by Spanish court for their involvement in the attempt at secession. S\u00e1nchez \u2013 who two years ago pardoned nine Catalan independence leaders convicted over the secessionist push \u2013 has refused to rule anything out. But the PP has seized on the possibility of an amnesty to rally its supporters and portray the PSOE leader as cowardly, beholden to Catalan separatists and hellbent on remaining in office. The PP, which organised Sunday\u2019s rally, put attendance at 60,000, while the central government\u2019s delegation to Madrid said it attracted 40,000 people. In his address to the crowd, Feij\u00f3o accused S\u00e1nchez of \u201can utter lack of moral and political integrity\u201d and of degrading Spanish democracy. Feij\u00f3o said: \u201cThe left sees pardons as coexistence, an amnesty as a normalisation and losing as winning. Don\u2019t call us Spaniards stupid because we\u2019re not.\u201d If voters were forced to return to the polls for a repeat election early next year, he said, S\u00e1nchez would bear responsibility. In a reference to this week\u2019s congressional vote, Feij\u00f3o said: \u2018I\u2019m going to defend that Spain is a democracy of free and equal people even if the cost is not being prime minister\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ll either be prime minister or I won\u2019t, but what will remain is a free, equal and dignified Spain. Long live Spain.\u201d S\u00e1nchez, who criticised the PP earlier this week for what he termed its \u201capocalyptic prophecies\u201d, has been careful to avoid any explicit mention of an amnesty. Speaking in Catalonia on Sunday, the acting prime minister stressed his commitment to equality, adding that all the social, economic and environmental progress his administration had made would be threatened by a PP government that would have to rely on the support of the far-right Vox party to rule Spain. The PP, which once repudiated Vox for being \u201ca party of fear, of rage, of resentment and revenge\u201d, has rowed back on its objections and formed a number of municipal and regional coalitions with the party over recent years. S\u00e1nchez said on Sunday: \u201cIf there\u2019s an equality that\u2019s fracturing, that\u2019s in danger, it\u2019s the equality between men and women that\u2019s in peril because of the deals between the PP and Vox.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-14T13:21:28Z",
            "content": "Private schools want to opt out of GCSE exams because state schools in England are catching up with their results, the government\u2019s former social mobility tsar Katharine Birbalsingh has said. Commenting on moves by Latymer upper school in London and Bedales school in Hampshire to curb pupils taking GCSEs other than English and maths, Birbalsingh accused the schools of trying to hide their failures to achieve consistently high grades. \u201cI would argue that Latymer and other private schools are failing their pupils. They have a highly selective intake and they are unable to produce the results at GCSE, which is why they are making these changes,\u201d Birbalsingh told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cPeople think that they get high results \u2013 [but] we are on their tails with regards to their results.\u201d Michaela community school, the free school in Brent, north London, founded by Birbalsingh, is one of England\u2019s highest performing state schools at GCSEs despite a comprehensive intake and a high proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals. Ian Emerson, the deputy head teacher of Latymer upper, a private school charging \u00a324,000 a year, said that GCSEs \u201cconfine and stifle\u201d students\u2019 learning. \u201c[GCSEs] reward rote learning rather than deep or original thinking, and they do not effectively teach students the core skills that are sought out by employers in the modern workplace,\u201d Emerson said. But Birbalsingh said parents should be suspicious of private schools that opt to limit GCSEs and replace them with internally assessed courses. Creating private qualifications would \u201cadvantage richer pupils, the pupils that can afford \u00a325,000 a year over the normal kids in state schools. And they will then get the jobs and get the positions of authority out there, having not achieved any kind of national standard,\u201d Birbalsingh claimed. Bedales, which charges \u00a333,000 a year for day pupils, has since 2006 cut back on the number of GCSEs taken by its pupils, replacing them with its own assessed courses. But it and Latymer upper have recently said they would go further and have students take just English and maths, with options for taking GCSE sciences and languages. While few other independent schools are likely to follow, most private schools already opt to take so-called iGCSE exams as an alternative to the GCSEs prescribed for state schools. Julie Robinson, chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, said: \u201cIndependent school exam results continue to be very high across the board and the majority still choose to use the standard exams available to all schools. \u201cHowever, given the concerns that many across education have about GCSEs, it is unsurprising that a small handful of schools have chosen to explore what an alternative could look like.\u201d Steve Chalke of the Oasis academy chain of state schools, said Birbalsignh\u2019s remarks were \u201ccompletely unfair and totally inaccurate\u201d, and said state schools as well as private ones were calling for an overhaul of GCSEs. \u201cThe [current] system suits some children who love sitting at desks, who have got instant recall,\u201d Chalke said. Criticisms of the role and structure of GCSEs have been brewing for several years. Last month the Tony Blair Institute called for both GCSEs and A-levels to be scrapped and replaced with qualifications that \u201cencourage breadth of learning as well as more critical thinking, creativity, communication and collaborative problem-solving\u201d. But Birbalsingh rejected the claims that GCSEs stifled creativity or critical thinking. \u201cWhen you are writing essays about Macbeth, you cannot rote learn that. You have to understand the play, you have to be able to take it apart and write your own independent thinking in those essays,\u201d Birbalsingh said. \u201cIt is absolutely the case that GCSEs are rigorous and they test a variety of skills. And we have a national benchmark, not only to judge children but also to judge schools. \u201cAnd when schools don\u2019t meet those benchmarks they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to then change them and say: well actually we don\u2019t like the benchmark.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-26T05:30:26Z",
            "content": "An anti-migrant vigilante organisation in South Africa has registered as a political party and plans to contest seats in next year\u2019s general elections. Operation Dudula, whose name means \u201cto force out\u201d in Zulu, wants all foreign nationals who are in the country unofficially to be deported. The party, which first emerged in Johannesburg\u2019s Soweto township after riots in 2021, claims to have widespread support, with a formal presence in seven of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces. It claims to be planning to stand candidates in 1,500 of the country\u2019s 4,468 voting districts. Many Operation Dudula followers have faced allegations of hate speech and physical violence. They have staged protests outside embassies, turned people away outside hospitals to prevent foreign nationals from accessing state medical services, and conducted door-to-door searches of businesses in poorer areas demanding to see identity documents. In August, Philani Gumede, a 36-year-old from Durban, was convicted of hate speech after sending a voice-note to members calling on them to evict foreigners from businesses in the city. Nomalungelo Ntshangase, a regional court prosecutor, told the court that this had led directly to xenophobic attacks and looting. In 2022, Operation Dudula followers camped outside Kalafong hospital in Atteridgeville, a suburb of South Africa\u2019s administrative capital, Pretoria, preventing people, including pregnant women, from entering the hospital. \u201cPeople were turned away by the protesters based on their appearance and accent,\u201d said Sibusiso Ndlovu, a health promotion supervisor for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. \u201cThey have even demanded that critically ill patients who are migrants must be \u2018unplugged\u2019 and taken out.\u201d Civil society groups have taken the party to court over unlawful evictions and conducting unauthorised citizenship checks in public. A court date has not yet been set. The Operation Dudula party\u2019s spokesperson, Isaack Lesole, said the transition from civil movement to political party would mean a tempering of tactics. \u201cWe want to demilitarise Operation Dudula. We know the military angle did not appeal to a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve taken a new posture, we need to guarantee that we can still achieve a lot without people being militants and killing or kicking things. As a political party, we are governed by a different set of rules.\u201d But its core ideology would not change, he said. \u201cWe view illegal immigrants as criminals, and they must go back to their countries.\u201d About 3.95 million immigrants live in South Africa, according to 2022 estimates by the Institute for Security Studies (ISS). However, there is no such thing as an \u201cillegal foreigner\u201d in South Africa, as its constitution \u2013 widely hailed as one of the most progressive in the world \u2013 confers limited rights upon all people within the country\u2019s borders, regardless of nationality or birthplace. Operation Dudula has its roots in the riots that swept across KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces in June 2021. In the absence of police, some citizens banded together to protect shops and businesses from thieves. \u201cYou saw a lot of communities starting to self-protect. They started cordoning off malls, and protecting them from being looted. Some of these organisations also felt emboldened to have more operations, under the auspices of \u2018anti-crime\u2019,\u201d said Lizette Lancaster, an ISS researcher. Lancaster said the chronic failures of the state in South Africa, which has high rates of corruption, unemployment and violence, created the space for the party to thrive. \u201cSouth Africans have been trying [to hold the state accountable] through protests, but are not getting anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is almost natural for people to look for another scapegoat. The most obvious scapegoat would be our brothers and sisters that have come here to look for better opportunities.\u201d Although not expected to win any outright majorities, the fractured nature of South African politics means that small parties can influence the formation of coalition governments \u2013 anddemand major concessions in return. The current mayor of Johannesburg is from the Al Jama\u2019ah, a fringe Islamist party that won just one of the city\u2019s 135 wards. Established parties are struggling to respond to Operation Dudula, with seemingly contradictory messages. In April, President Cyril Ramaphosa called it a \u201cvigilante-like force\u201d taking \u201cillegal actions\u201d against foreigners. \u201cThese things often get out of hand,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always mutate into wanton violence against other people.\u201d However, with the ruling African National Congress seeing its support eroded in recent years by a series of corruption scandals, rising inequality, high unemployment and violent crime, it has also begun to echo the rhetoric of Operation Dudula in a bid to shore up its electoral chances. Last year an ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe, told the Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper that Operation Dudula was affirming the views of the ANC. \u201cThese [foreign] people come here to sell drugs, seat [live] here illegally, undermine our sovereignty, create illegal business.\u201d Julius Malema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a militant leftwing party, said in a speech in July: \u201cSouth Africans are not xenophobic. [Operation Dudula] is a group of criminals who are in cahoots with some ministers. They are small boys who must be put in their place.\u201d However, in a sign of how politically expedient xenophobia has become in South Africa, even the ostensibly pan-Africanist EFF has campaigned for restaurants to employ more South Africans. Malema visited restaurants last year demanding to see the identity documents of workers as he demanded businesses hire locals. Amir Sheikh, spokesperson for the African Diaspora Forum, said: \u201cAt the end of the day, Dudula will not be the only party that is right wing or anti-immigrant, even including the ruling party, which is leaning towards the right wing.\u201d Many foreigners are returning home with their families, or moving to more friendly countries, although that is in part due to high crime rates and economic decay, said Sheikh. \u201cEven the locals with the means to travel out of the country are doing so.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 September 2024 to correct the spelling of Isaack Lesole\u2019s first name."

            "date": "2023-09-30T05:00:05Z",
            "content": "Voting has started in a knife-edge election in Slovakia that could decide whether the country sticks with its liberal, pro-western line or abandons its staunch support for neighbouring Ukraine to lean more towards Moscow. After a virulent campaign that has included physical brawls and amid a wave of online disinformation, the populist, nationalist three-time prime minister Robert Fico and his Smer-SD party were neck and neck with the newcomers Progressive Slovakia heading into the vote, with PS just ahead in two of the final four opinion polls. However, neither party will come close to a majority in the 150-seat parliament and whichever one finishes first is unlikely to find it easy to form a ruling coalition: the results of half a dozen smaller parties will be critical to the outcome. Hlas-SD \u2013 formed as a spin-off from Smer by Peter Pellegrini, who took over as prime minister after Fico was forced to resign in 2018 after mass protests over the murders of an investigative journalist and his fiancee \u2013 was third in all polls. The moderate social democratic party could become kingmaker. It has so far kept its options open and refused to say which party it would back, but is widely believed to favour an alliance with Smer over the more socially liberal PS. Fico, 59, has become more strident in opposition, adopting more pro-Russian views at variance with the centre-right coalition that ruled the country after the previous 2020 elections before falling apart last year and being replaced by a caretaker cabinet. He has said he will not send \u201canother bullet\u201d to help defend his country\u2019s eastern neighbour from Russian aggression, labelled western and EU sanctions against Moscow \u201cuseless\u201d, and promised to veto any Ukrainian application to join Nato. A vocal admirer of Hungary\u2019s autocratic leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and to a lesser extent Poland\u2019s national-conservative Law and Justice party, Fico told a rally this week: \u201cWar always comes from the west. And freedom and peace always come from the east.\u201d He has also campaigned against immigration and LGBTQ+ rights and \u2013 himself the subject of several court inquiries \u2013 threatened to sack National Criminal Agency investigators and the special prosecutor dealing with high-level corruption cases. Analysts have said that while during previous mandates Fico proved pragmatic and keen to avoid unnecessary clashes with Brussels or Slovakia\u2019s Nato allies, support from Orb\u00e1n and potentially other nationalist leaders could embolden him. His policies, however, would depend on what coalition Smer \u2013 if it wins \u2013 could form. Potential partners range from Hlas to the far-right Republika party, made up of former members of the openly neo-Nazi People\u2019s Party Our Slovakia. More moderate liberal voters, meanwhile, have flocked to PS, led by the 39-year-old Oxford political science graduate and European parliament vice-chair Michal \u0160ime\u010dka, which has said it will not enter government with extremists or Fico. It has run a strongly pro-western campaign, vowing to \u201cdeepen European cooperation\u201d and continue to help Ukraine, and is a rare example in conservative, Catholic Slovakia of a political party in favour of LGBTQ+ rights. Popular among young people, PS narrowly missed out on parliamentary seats in the 2020 vote. It has said it is open to working with small conservative parties, though differences on social policy issues such as same-sex marriage could prove an obstacle. Other parties likely to clear the 5% bar to enter parliament include OLaNO, which won the 2020 election, the rightwing We Are Family, the liberal Freedom and Solidarity, the centrist For the People, Republika and the ultranationalist Slovak National party. Polling stations opened at 7am CET (0600 BST) and will close at 10pm, with exit polls expected soon after and final results due on Sunday morning."

            "date": "2023-09-12T10:15:27Z",
            "content": "Democratic strategists are urging a \u201cdon\u2019t panic\u201d response to a series of opinion polls that reveal deep worries over Joe Biden\u2019s age and his ability to beat Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election. A CNN survey conducted by SSRS caused shockwaves this week when it put Biden\u2019s approval rating at just 39% and found two in three Democrats say the party should nominate someone else next year. In a hypothetical contest, registered voters were split between Trump (47%) and Biden (46%). The findings echoed a Wall Street Journal poll that found 73% of voters say Biden, 80, is \u201ctoo old to run for president\u201d but just 47% of voters say the same about Trump, who is 77 and the current frontrunner for the Republican nomination. It put the two candidates neck and neck in the race for the White House, as does a polling average compiled by RealClearPolitics. This stands in contrast to the last electoral cycle when, in 2019, polls showed Biden enjoying a seven to 10 percentage point lead over Trump. He eventually won the national popular vote by 4.4 percentage points. Even if Biden takes the popular vote again next year, the all-important electoral college may be decided by wafer-thin margins in a handful of states. Third-party candidates, such as the leftwing academic Cornel West or No Labels \u2013 a big money group actively working to secure a place on the presidential ballot in at least 20 states \u2013 could hurt Biden more than Trump and tip the balance. Such a prospect alarms activists who describe how Trump\u2019s four-year presidency assailed the rights of women, people of colour and immigrants, culminating in an attempted coup, and dread a return to the White House that could prove even more authoritarian and aggressive. It also rattles Democrats forced to ask why Biden, with a strong economy and series of major legislative accomplishments under his belt, is failing to pull clear of a predecessor who is twice impeached and charged with 91 criminal counts in Washington, New York, Florida and Georgia. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cLook, Joe Biden should not be their nominee. Joe Biden is unpopular. Joe Biden is too old. That\u2019s no longer a Republican talking point; that\u2019s the sentiment of half of the Democratic party and a supermajority of independents, and rational Democrats know that. But the problem is, how do you get rid of the guy? \u201cNobody has the stomach and is willing to take the risk of taking him on in the primary process because failure weakens the Democratic party and kills your career. So you look around and you say, yeah, there\u2019s huge risks, sane Democrats see them and they\u2019re stuck.\u201d Biden\u2019s age continues to be an obsession, with every stumble or gaffe viewed through that lens, even though aides testify to his energy and he is currently embarked on another overseas trip. Republicans are shaping a campaign message that Biden is unlikely to complete a second term, meaning that Vice-President Kamala Harris would take over. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: \u201cBiden has to stay healthy. You can\u2019t pretend not to be 80 or 81 or 82, which he\u2019s going to be nearly at the time of the election. You have to be what you are but you can minimise the effects of it and they\u2019ve done a terrible job on that. \u201cI know they can\u2019t change him fundamentally but there is no excuse for having him shuffle in front of the cameras almost every day. He does shuffle and I\u2019m sympathetic \u2013 I\u2019m in my 70s \u2013 but there are ways to avoid that. I just don\u2019t understand why, unless he\u2019s insisting \u2013 he\u2019s very sensitive about this.\u201d The latest round of polls have provoked a sharp response by senior Democratic advisers. They argue the party\u2019s strength was underestimated in last year\u2019s midterm elections when a so-called \u201cred wave\u201d failed to materialise for Republicans. They also point to the potency of abortion rights and successes in recent elections and ballot measures in Florida, Ohio, Wisconsin and other states. Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist who bucked conventional wisdom on the 2022 midterms and was vindicated by a weaker Republican showing, said: \u201cThe reason I\u2019m fine with where everything is and not worried is that the Republican base is very engaged right now. There\u2019s a massive primary going on, ads are being run, the candidates are all over Fox News, Trump is threatened with imprisonment. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Republican voter, the election is happening. The Republicans have what I call asymmetrical engagement. They\u2019re engaged, they are being talked to, there\u2019s things going on. Our voters aren\u2019t. There\u2019s a lot of evidence that the Democratic coalition just isn\u2019t very engaged and they\u2019re having a summer. There\u2019s no reason for them to be thinking about 2024.\u201d Rosenberg added: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s panicking our side. There\u2019s an awareness that we\u2019ve got work to do. We should win next year if we do the work.\u201d But longtime Trump critics warn that Democrats are underestimating the dangers. Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project and former Republican consultant, said: \u201cI wish they would panic. The greatest danger here is complacency and a sense of misplaced optimism that some externality is going to take Trump out.\u201d Democrats need to unify strongly behind Biden and close the gap between perception of the economy and the reality, Wilson added. \u201cTelling the economic good news story is their main and only job, and they need to be on that 24 hours a day. \u201cThey have not yet fully internalised how important that is because, while they\u2019re not going to persuade Maga voters, they could persuade moderate Republicans and soft independents. Every time you get a positive economic message, it\u2019s buying a little more safety and security for the guy.\u201d"

            "title": "Polls show support for the voice is falling. How do they work, and will they be more accurate than in 2019?",
            "date": "2023-09-29T00:00:28Z",
            "content": "Support for the voice to parliament stands at about 41% and falling, according to Guardian Australia\u2019s poll tracker. Yes supporters might hope the polls are wrong, but they would need to be off by 10% or more for the yes vote to achieve the double majority necessary for the referendum to pass. That would be an error almost three times larger than what occurred in the 2019 federal election. Such a polling error is possible, but it\u2019s very unlikely and there is nothing to suggest it, according to pollsters and election analysts who spoke to Guardian Australia. So, how does polling work? We asked the experts to explain. What went wrong in 2019? Ahead of the 2019 election, some election watchers had warned that the different polls were unusually clustered, showing remarkably similar results. \u201cEvery single poll that came out was saying exactly the same thing,\u201d says election analyst William Bowe. So far, there aren\u2019t similar concerns about the upcoming referendum. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any farsighted poll watcher who\u2019s come up with any theory this time [for] why the polls might be skewing towards no,\u201d says Bowe. Polls around the world actually tend to over-estimate support for referendums. This was also the case for in the same-sex marriage plebiscite \u2013 polls overestimated the yes vote and the average error was about 7 points. This may be because polling for a referendum is more complex than for normal elections. Among other things, voters might feel less informed about what they are voting on. And there is still a large undecided population that may swing behind yes. How does modern political polling works? Most political polls work by trying to get 1,000-1,500 responses from a representative sample of the population. Pollsters try to match their sample against Australia\u2019s voting population on multiple demographic factors, such as age, sex, income and location. After the 2019 polling failure, many pollsters also try to match on education levels. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cYou can get, on average, quite close to the properties of a whole population by taking a sample of 1,000 or so,\u201d says election analyst Dr Kevin Bonham. \u201cPeople can do this experiment for themselves if they like by tossing coins and keeping track of the cumulative total and noticing how the [percentages of heads] converges on 50%. \u201cAll else being equal, and assuming that there is a perfect sample, 1,000 respondents is most of the time going to give you the right answer within a few percent.\u201d Are landline phones a problem? In the past, pollsters used to contact people via telephone. But all the public polls for the voice have been conducted entirely online. Polling companies have large \u201cpanels\u201d with tens or hundreds of thousands of members who signed up themselves as part of loyalty programs or were invited. \u201cIt\u2019s much, much easier with online panel polling to know enough about your respondent to know who you want to invite for a given survey,\u201d says Bonham. \u201cIn the old days of random phone polling, you\u2019d be ringing and saying things like: \u2018Can I speak to the youngest person in the house or the person who had the last birthday?\u2019\u201d Armed with demographic information, pollsters will send out emails containing survey questions over a few days. They can exclude people who have recently answered surveys and keep sending out batches until they have filled their quota of younger voters, Western Australians and so on. If there aren\u2019t enough respondents from a certain group, then the pollster can \u201cupweight\u201d the responses of those they do have. It\u2019s in these details that much of the differences between the pollsters arise. How much variation is there? \u201cWhen we run a survey we make a series of assumptions because we\u2019re trying to get an estimate of public opinion,\u201d says Dr Shaun Ratcliff, who has worked with pollster Redbridge on voice polls. \u201cSo you\u2019re working out, you know, what is the best method I can use to get the most representative sample of the electorate I can get. And then what\u2019s the best question, or set of questions, I can ask them to elicit a response that will most closely match the decision the voter makes when they\u2019re in the booth. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no perfect way to do that.\u201d Before the official wording of the referendum question was released in March, Bowe says there was a lot of variation in the questions that pollsters were asking. But most pollsters have switched to using the exact referendum wording. Some difference remain, but there has been a lot of convergence: since mid-July, every poll in Guardian Australia\u2019s tracker has shown the no vote in the lead. There is about an eight percentage point difference between the highest and lowest polls released over the past week, but Ratcliff says these kinds of differences are to be expected. \u201cIf you had five surveys run in the same period, with the same question, same quotas, the same weights, you\u2019d get a couple of percent variation,\u201d he says."

            "date": "2023-09-10T06:00:45Z",
            "content": "By the polling, Joe Biden is stuck in a footrace with Donald Trump, his 91-times criminally charged predecessor as president. More than three-quarters of voters say Biden is too old to govern effectively. Two-thirds of Democrats wish he would throw in the towel. The intersection of Biden\u2019s work as vice-president to Barack Obama and what Franklin Foer calls the \u201cdodgy business dealings of son Hunter\u201d haunts the father still. More than three fifths of Americans now believe Joe Biden was involved in Hunter\u2019s business. The impeachment specter hovers. Kamala Harris poses a further problem. The polls, again: 53% of independents disapprove of the vice-president, two in five strongly. Were Biden to leave the stage, few would be reassured. Under the subtitle \u201cInside Joe Biden\u2019s White House and the Struggle for America\u2019s Future\u201d, Foer dives into our political morass. He emerges with a well-sourced look at Biden and his time in power. A staff writer at the Atlantic and former editor of the New Republic, Foer acknowledges his own doubts about Biden but also voices his admiration for the back-slapping politician from Scranton. Foer\u2019s title, The Last Politician, points to his thesis: that Biden\u2019s old-fashioned approach to politics drives and shapes all he does. Foer captures Biden\u2019s successes and his cock-ups, his abilities and insecurities. At times, Biden is portrayed as overly confident. He is also caught wondering why John F Kennedy was not so tightly handled by his aides \u2013 or \u201cbabied\u201d, as Foer reports it. Youth, vigor and acuity are all parts of the answer. The Last Politician is definitely news-laden, a must-read for political junkies. Biden\u2019s staff finally spoke. Foer lays out how Biden\u2019s age shapes his first term and his re-election odds; Harris\u2019s shortcomings as vice-president; and Biden\u2019s relationships with Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine and Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Complications dominate. Biden\u2019s \u201cadvanced years were a hindrance, depriving him of the energy to cast a robust public presence or the ability to easily conjure a name\u201d, Foer writes. \u201cHis public persona reflected physical decline and time\u2019s dulling of mental faculties that no pill or exercise regime can resist.\u201d Biden was gaffe-prone as a younger politician. Now, his verbal and physical stumbles lead news cycles. Decades ago, Ronald Reagan\u2019s typical day began with his arrival in the West Wing at 9am. Biden starts about an hour later. That\u2019s an hour earlier than Trump, sure. But Foer writes: \u201cIt was striking that [Biden] took so few morning meetings or presided over so few public events before 10am.\u201d Plenty has been written about Reagan\u2019s capacity by the end of his term. When Reagan left the White House, after eight years, he was nearly 78. Today, Biden is nearly 81. \u201cIn private,\u201d Foer writes, Biden \u201cwould occasionally admit that he felt tired.\u201d Unstated is this: the cumulative effect of such realities of age leaves Biden on the cusp of being ignored, unable to woo swaths of the American public or drive his message and numbers. In the 2022 midterms, his popularity deficit kept him sidelined. For a politician, a shrug or a yawn can be more damning than disdain. Expect Republicans to quote Foer as they bash Harris. \u201cRabbit Ears\u201d is the chapter title of Foer\u2019s examination of the former California senator, a moniker bestowed by Biden\u2019s inner circle. As they saw it, Foer writes, Harris was sensitive to \u201cany hint of criticism \u2026 instantly aware\u201d of the slightest dissatisfaction. She projected clinginess and uncertainty. \u201cInstead of carving out an independent role, she stuck to the president\u2019s side \u2013 an omnipresence at every Oval Office meeting.\u201d Harris\u2019s \u201cpiercing questions\u201d impressed Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, but lunches with Biden gradually fell \u201coff the schedule\u201d. Then again, Biden owed Harris little. She brutalized him in a debate, intimating he was a bigot. Then she dropped out of the Democratic primary before a vote was cast, the political equivalent of a face-plant. The relationship between Biden and Zelenskiy also had its ups-and-downs, Foer says. He lauds Biden for \u201cquietly arming the Ukrainians\u201d, helping them \u201cfend off invasion\u201d by Russia. He also describes tensions between the two leaders. Biden and Zelenskiy failed to establish swift rapport. Zelenskiy demanded Nato membership and offered \u201cabsurd analysis\u201d of alliance dynamics, leaving Biden \u201cpissed off\u201d. In Foer\u2019s telling, \u201ceven Zelenskiy\u2019s most ardent sympathizers in the [Biden] administration agreed that he had bombed\u201d, while Zelenskiy \u201cat least subconsciously \u2026 seemed to blame\u201d Biden \u201cfor the humiliation he suffered, for the political awkwardness he endured\u201d at the hands of Trump. \u201cWhere Biden tended to expect Zelenskiy to open with expressions of gratitude for American support, Zelenskiy crammed his conversations with a long list of demands.\u201d Sucking up to Ted Cruz didn\u2019t help either. In the end, Foer is a Biden fan. He gives the Inflation Reduction Act, in his view the crowning achievement of the first term, an unqualified endorsement. Homing in on provisions that aim to \u201cstall climate change\u201d, Foer says the law stands as \u201can investment in moral authority\u201d, enabling the US to \u201cprod\u201d other countries on environmental issues. Watching the latest spate of environmental cataclysms, it is hard to dispute that the climate crisis is real \u2013 all while Republican presidential aspirants continue their denials. But there is something amiss in Foer\u2019s enthusiasm and the administration\u2019s posture. For now, inflation holds more public attention. Nearly three-quarters of Americans see inflation as a \u201cvery important\u201d issue. Climate crisis and the environment? Forty-four per cent. A hunch: voters are less worried about moral authority and more about grocery bills and prices at the pump. According to the polls, the Democrats have lost their grip on voters without a four-year college degree, regardless of race. A priorities gap is on display again. Issues that speak loudest to white progressives lack broad resonance. The faculty lounge makes a lousy focus group. Foer\u2019s enthusiasm is premature.

            "date": "2023-09-26T16:57:12Z",
            "content": "When the tears came, they weren\u2019t always for the dead and the unfathomable depths of suffering. They also flowed for the times in between, for the joy and smiles of the unknowing. As the acclaimed American war photographer Corinne Dufka sorted through the pictures and negatives for her new book, This Is War: Photographs from a Decade of Conflict, covering more than a decade on frontlines from El Salvador to Bosnia and Liberia, she once again looked into the faces she had perhaps only registered briefly years ago. \u201cI entered into this zone of memory, of trying to understand what I witnessed. That in and of itself is an interesting process because I wept a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the pictures that were saddest were of times of hope. One of the saddest pictures is in between the first and second wars in Liberia when people are waiting in line to vote, so earnestly and with so much enthusiasm and optimism. They didn\u2019t know that within two years their country would be involved in another horrific conflict.\u201d This Is War is thankfully spare on dead bodies. They are there but the focus of the book, as with most of Dufka\u2019s work, is on those responsible for the killing or forced to live with its consequences. In one picture, Dufka captures a child combatant playing with an abandoned toy as he guards a checkpoint in the middle of the embattled Liberian capital, Monrovia, in 1996. A rural Salvadorian woman stands at her window holding a photo of her husband who was one of three men in her village abducted by the army, and tortured and murdered. In besieged Sarajevo, Dufka turns her camera on the agony of parting with no certainty as to when, or even if, women and children waving from an evacuation bus will see their families again. In Mostar, a Bosnian Croat soldier nonchalantly holds his gun at his side as hundreds of Muslim men are marched down a mountain track to a prison camp in an abandoned factory. The book\u2019s cover photo is of a pile of machetes discarded at Rwanda\u2019s border as Hutus fled the country following the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis in 1994. A lone child stares at the camera as the adults shuffle past carrying bundles and responsibility for the last great crime against humanity of the 20th century. Dufka describes her book as a \u201cpersonal journey to come to terms with these dozen tumultuous years of covering some of the bloodiest and most horrific conflicts of the latter part of the last century in which I saw not only tens of thousands of people who\u2019ve been killed in these outbursts of unspeakable violence but also a dozen or so journalist friends killed\u201d. Part of that is a reckoning with what she frankly admits is her own dehumanisation. Dufka came to war photography by accident. She was a psychiatric social worker in San Francisco for a decade before heading to El Salvador at the height of its civil war in the mid-1980s, first as a social worker with the Lutheran church and then a human rights investigator tracking the murderous work of the country\u2019s rightwing death squads. Herbert Anaya, the director of El Salvador\u2019s human rights commission, asked Dufka to set up a photo documentation programme. Two weeks later he was murdered by a death squad. Dufka took the photo of Anaya\u2019s body published in the New York Times the next day. Not long after she went to work for Reuters. El Salvador\u2019s conflict was rooted in resistance to historic oppression but it had an ideological hue because the guerrillas were Marxist. By the time Dufka arrived in Bosnia in 1992, the old cold war rivalries had given way to ethnic and nationalist conflict that came to define so many of the wars in Europe and Africa in that decade. The scale of human barbarity horrified Dufka but drew her in. \u201cIt\u2019s a theme throughout my life of trying to address dehumanisation that started way back in my family because there was a lot of suffering from blindness, from mental illness, there\u2019s a lot of substance abuse. So I learned to get on with it and then I transferred those skills to my life as a photojournalist,\u201d she said. In 1997, the International Women\u2019s Media Foundation awarded Dufka its courage in journalism prize. By then she had a reputation among her peers for astonishing bravery in the midst of some of the most brutal conflicts. In Rwanda, a member of a Hutu death squad put a gun to her head until she talked him down. She captured intense street battles in Monrovia from among the combatants. Dufka was badly injured when an anti-tank mine exploded under the Reuters armoured car in Bosnia in 1993, turning her camera into shrapnel that smashed into her face. The force of the blast tore the ligaments in her knees and she suffered internal bleeding. Dufka and her injured colleagues tumbled out of the burning car only to come under Croatian sniper fire before their rescue by British soldiers. Three weeks later she was in Somalia, still walking with a cane. The role of photographers has come under more scrutiny in recent years, in part because it\u2019s so much easier for anyone to take a picture of individual suffering and have the wider world view it. \u201cThere\u2019s a debate about who should have ownership. Whether, if you\u2019re not from a community or a victim from that population, you have a right to even photograph. There\u2019s a level of sensitivity about showing people in hardship and conflict,\u201d she said. \u201cWar is ugly and war is painful. It\u2019s important that people see the handiwork of those who make and perpetrate and support wars. It\u2019s really a minority of people, usually from political elites, who object.\u201d Dufka said that only once did someone tell her to stop taking a picture. A man turned on her after a bombing during South Africa\u2019s first free elections in 1994 and kicked her in the face. \u201cThat was the one time. Very often it was the opposite. People welcomed me into their homes, into the hospitals, into their battlefields, into graveyards where burials were taking place,\u201d she said. Dufka drew satisfaction from the fact that her work and that of other photographers can have real political impact in foreign capitals and influence policies to alleviate suffering if not end conflicts. But she came to understand the price of viewing war through a lens. \u201cI have to say it\u2019s profoundly dehumanising. You can\u2019t break down every time you see human suffering. You\u2019ve got to keep it together and do your damn job. But that has a price,\u201d she said. Dufka wasn\u2019t even present at the atrocity that prompted her to give up war photography. She was on a plane flying out of Nairobi in 1998 when al-Qaida blew up the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killing 224 people, almost all Africans. She was horrified when she realised she was more upset at missing the opportunity to photograph the carnage than she was about the victims. \u201cI hadn\u2019t given a thought to the Kenyans and I\u2019d been living in the country for six years. I was so profoundly ashamed of myself. I\u2019d become so dehumanised. I didn\u2019t recognise myself, and that\u2019s why I got out,\u201d she said. But Dufka didn\u2019t give up on conflict, she changed how she worked with it. In 1999, she moved to Sierra Leone to open a field office for Human Rights Watch documenting its civil war and the terrible crimes against civilians including the cutting off of limbs. The switch to taking testimony and then working as a criminal investigator for the UN war crimes court for Sierra Leone felt like more of a contribution. She also had a daughter, which again shifted her perspective on war, and eventually moved back to the US. \u201cIn those years I never gave myself a break. I went from conflict to conflict to conflict. There are some people who become afflicted with post-traumatic stress. That\u2019s just not the way my personality is wired. I only had one post-traumatic stress incident, right after my daughter was born for about a month with intrusive dreams and thoughts. I achieved more balance in my life now,\u201d she said. As she was sorting the photographs for the book, Dufka was struck by how many places she worked remain in conflict of some form. Ethiopia was at war again. So was Sudan. \u201cSierra Leone, Bosnia, Liberia, they\u2019re still grappling with the legacies of conflict. Endemic corruption and some of the world\u2019s worst socioeconomic indicators,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like this book to generate some reflection about conflict, relapse and risk in recidivism.\u201d So does she see common features in conflicts as far apart as Central America, Europe and central Africa? \u201cOne common thread is a conclusion about human behaviour. There\u2019s nothing that people will not do to each other, and there\u2019s nothing they won\u2019t do for each other. I\u2019m not the first one to say that but it is so clear. I have watched profound brutality and cruelty, and then documented later, as a human rights investigator, the most astounding acts of human generosity and courage to help each other,\u201d she said. \u201cI also learned that fear is stronger than love and the sort of solidarity that binds communities together. You saw that in Rwanda, in Bosnia, where you have communities turn on each other. It\u2019s manipulated, of course. But fear is a huge motivator.\u201d This Is War: Photographs from a Decade of Conflict is out now"

            "content": "A liberal group representing US military veterans took aim at Tommy Tuberville, the Alabama Republican senator holding up officer promotions in a protest over abortion, but also at party leaders who have not forced him to stand down, calling them \u201ctraitors\u201d and warning: \u201cTight lips could sink ships.\u201d Presented in the style of a second world war propaganda film, a short ad from Vote Vets bemoans \u201can un-American assault on our military\u201d by a \u201cso-called American senator singlehandedly stop[ping] hundreds of military leaders from taking command\u201d. Tuberville, a former college football coach, was elected in 2020. He is now protesting Pentagon policy that allows service members to travel for abortion care if it is restricted where they are based, a possibility since the US supreme court removed the federal right to abortion last year. As a result of Tuberville\u2019s block on Senate-confirmed promotions, more than 300 senior roles are being filled in an acting capacity. Military officials have bemoaned the effects of Tuberville\u2019s blocks on officers\u2019 families and finances. Even the position of chair of the joint chief of staff stands to be affected, when the current occupant, Gen Mark Milley, steps down at the end of this month. Noting that leadership of the army, navy, air force and marines has already been affected, the Vote Vets ad shows images of leaders of Iran, Russia and North Korea. \u201cDangerous dictators look on with glee as Tuberville does their work for them, hurting American military readiness,\u201d says the narrator. Switching to footage of Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, the narrator says Tuberville\u2019s \u201cAmerican comrades are traitors in their silence. Their tight lips could sink ships.\u201d \u201cLoose lips sink ships\u201d was a phrase coined during the second world war, under the guidance of the US Office of War Information and meant to warn citizens about careless talk that might boost the US\u2019s enemies. The Vote Vets ad concludes by telling McConnell to \u201cstop the block on military promotions\u201d. Last week, Tuberville told 1819 News, an Alabama-based news site: \u201cI\u2019m voting for the people of Alabama, and I\u2019m going to stand up for what I believe is right when it comes to the right to life and a lot of the things that go along with it.\u201d The senator has said he will end his protest if the Senate votes on Pentagon abortion policy. He has also said Democrats who control the Senate can confirm the held-up promotions one by one. As that would be enormously time consuming, the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said it will not happen. Tuberville has rejected criticism based on his own lack of service, saying he is the son of a father who served. On Monday, he wished a \u201chappy 76th birthday to the US air force\u201d and thanked the \u201cbrave men and women who keep our skies and country safe\u201d. One user shot back: \u201cHow about letting them get promoted!! That would be a nice birthday gift!!\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-27T05:45:49Z",
            "content": "Good morning. Over the last few days you have probably heard about a growing crisis in Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of ethnic Armenians surrounded by Azerbaijan. Right now, tens of thousands of people are fleeing the region fearing for their lives and the future of their homeland. Experts expect that over the coming weeks almost all of the estimated 120,000 people who live in Nagorno-Karabakh could leave for Armenia, creating another refugee crisis on the doorstep of Europe. There\u2019s a lot going on in the world right now, and it\u2019s hard to be up to speed on everything, particularly things that sound complicated. So you\u2019re forgiven if you don\u2019t, yet, know all about it. Today we will hopefully answer all the important questions: Including where is Nagorno-Karabakh? What is happening? Why is it happening now? Is this related to the war in Ukraine, and what might happen next? Our guide is Andrew Roth, the Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent, who is on the Armenia border witnessing a \u201cstaggering stream\u201d of Nagorno-Karabakh refugees entering the country. More after the headlines. Five big stories Iraq | More than 100 people have been killed and 150 people injured in a fire at a wedding in northern Iraq. It is not yet clear what caused the blaze, but early reports say it may have broken out after fireworks were lit before the first dance. Donald Trump | Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House, a New York judge ruled on Tuesday. The ruling found that Trump and executives from his company, including his sons Eric and Donald Jr, routinely and repeatedly deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing assets and exaggerating his net worth. Asylum | The UN\u2019s refugee agency has rebuked Suella Braverman after she claimed that world leaders had failed to make wholesale reform of human rights laws because of fears of being branded \u201cracist or illiberal\u201d. It came after the home secretary claimed that women and gay people must face more than discrimination if they are to qualify as a refugee Prisons | Traumatised children in a young offender institution are talking to psychologists through the hatch in their cell doors as there are not enough guards to unlock them for therapy sessions, the Guardian has learned. Many of the teenagers have suffered childhood trauma, with an overrepresentation of autism, ADHD and other neurological disorders. Politics | Ed Davey has closed the Liberal Democrats\u2019 conference with a pledge to guarantee in law that anyone referred for cancer treatment will be seen in two months. The announcement was arguably the sole big policy of the gathering and reinforces the party\u2019s focus on the NHS before the general election. In depth: \u2018It is a historic exodus, and everyone who\u2019s leaving has a heartbreaking story\u2019 Let\u2019s start with the real basics. Where is Nagorno-Karabakh? It\u2019s a landlocked region in the South Caucasus mountains surrounded by Azerbaijan, about 140km to the east of the border with Armenia. To complicate matters a little more the region is known by Armenians as Artsakh. What is happening in Nagorno-Karabakh (watch this video for help on how to pronounce it), and why is it happening now? To answer this, Andrew says we need to rewind at least thirty years to the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, which led to the messy creation of 15 states. They included Armenia and Azerbaijan, which both claimed Nagorno-Karabakh. While the land is within Azerbaijan (and the international community recognises it as part of Azerbaijan), it has been run autonomously by its ethnic Armenian population as a de facto independent state since 1994. \u201cArmenians call it their ancestral homeland, but territorially it is part of Azerbaijan,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cThis led to a series of wars over who it really belongs to, which led to the uneasy status quo that it is Armenian within Azerbaijan. It has always been a bone of contention.\u201d In the last conflict in 2020 \u2013 which lasted 44-days \u2013 Azerbaijan recaptured seven surrounding districts and took back about a third of Nagorno-Karabakh itself. The region is now 3,170 sq km \u2013 that\u2019s about twice the size of greater London. As part of the truce that halted that war, Russia provided peacekeepers to police a road, known as the Lachin corridor, that allowed people to travel between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia. However, the road has been blocked since December 2022, which has effectively trapped Nagorno-Karabakh people within the territory and led to shortages of food, medicine and baby formula. Azerbaijan denies there is any blockade and says it was forced to act after environmental violations. The Russian peacekeeping troops did not intervene to get traffic moving. Hostilities restarted on 19 September 2023 when Azerbaijan launched a full scale military offensive against Nagorno-Karabakh. It described it as \u201can anti-terrorist operation\u201d. It lasted just over 24 hours, before the local Karabakh government accepted a ceasefire proposal negotiated by Russian peacekeepers. Azerbaijan declared military victory while Armenia accused Azerbaijan of pursuing a \u201cpolicy of ethnic cleansing\u201d. The majority of Armenians are Christian, and the majority of Azerbaijanis are Muslim. *** Why has this happened now? Andrew believes Azerbaijan is taking advantage of Russia being \u201cdistracted by the war in Ukraine\u201d. \u201cRussia is the big player here, and Armenia is its traditional ally,\u201d he says. \u201cRussia is meant to get involved, but it is a very hard time for Russia with the war in Ukraine taking up a lot of resources.\u201d Azerbaijan has also, Andrew says, invested heavily in militarisation so the balance of power has shifted. \u201cAzerbaijan wants to end the three decades of self-rule in Karabakh, and take it over.\u201d Azeri president Ilham Aliyev has said the region would be turned into a \u201cparadise\u201d as part of Azerbaijan. *** What is causing the exodus? \u201cThe ethnic cleansing of Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh is under way, that\u2019s happening just now,\u201d Armenia\u2019s prime minister Nikol Pashinyan told the US in a plea for help. \u201cAnd that is [a] very unfortunate fact, because we were trying to urge international community on that,\u201d Azerbaijan denies it is intent on ethnic cleansing, and said it wants to re-integrate the ethnic Armenians as \u201cequal citizens\u201d. Andrew says, most Nagorno-Karabakh people aren\u2019t willing take the risk of trusting Azerbaijan, and are fleeing through the \u2013 recently re-opened Lachin corridor \u2013 to Armenia. Almost 30,000 refugees have already crossed the border out of the estimated 120,000 population of Nagorno-Karabakh. \u201cIt\u2019s been called a negotiated ceasefire, but really there is no negotiation,\u201d Andrew says. \u201cAzerbaijan massively has the upper-hand, so the only thing to negotiate is how Azerbaijan is going to take the territory and what happens when the troops go into the towns and how they treat the people.\u201d He says the people, who have seen videos of Azeris beheading locals during the 2020 war, aren\u2019t sticking around to find out what might happen this time. More than 100 people were killed in an explosion at a fuel depot on Monday, which witnesses said struck as people lined up to refuel their cars before evacuating. Andrew, who spent yesterday talking to refugees as they cross the border, said people say they are \u201cfleeing for their lives\u201d and are angry at the international community for not doing more to protect them. \u201cThere are wave after wave of cars and vans coming over every 10-15 minutes,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re full of people and their belongings latched to the roof. They are making children lie on the floor of minibuses and blocking the windows with cardboard in fear of shelling. \u201cNo one expected this many people to be leaving so quickly. It is a historic exodus, and everyone who\u2019s leaving has a heartbreaking story.\u201d He has talked to people whose relatives have been killed in shelling and had their homes destroyed, and others who had been forced into hiding for days. \u201cI spoke to a 90-year-old who slept for three days on the floor of the airport terminal [which is controlled by the Russian peacekeepers].\u201d A father of a four-day old baby told Andrew, that he took the newborn and his six other children to a shelter, before going back to try to protect his house. *** Where will the Nagorno-Karabakh people go? Pashinyan has said Armenia has allocated space for at least 40,000 people, but warned that he expects the vast majority of the 120,000 people \u201cwill see exile from their homeland as the only way to save their lives and identity\u201d. Andrew says there\u2019s no way Armenia, a country with a population of just under 3 million people, will be able to integrate 100,000 refugees. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to find them housing or jobs \u2013 it is beginning to look like the beginning of another refugee crisis on the doorstep of Europe.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor Robert Habeck, a novelist turned green politician with huge ambitions, was once one of the country\u2019s more popular public figures.

            "title": "Were the Beatles used as propaganda by Greece\u2019s military rulers? ",
            "date": "2023-09-30T14:00:16Z",
            "content": "In the summer of love, on a hot July day, John Lennon was sitting by a lake in central Greece. The Beatles were on their way to Delphi, via the mountain village of Arachova. Lennon, who was splayed across the grass next to his first wife, Cynthia, and their young son, Julian, appeared to be lost in thought. The rest of the band were lapping up the rays, knocking back beers and splashing about in the lake. Labis Tsirigotakis, then a cub reporter on the Greek daily, To Vima, realised this was his big chance. Sensing a scoop, he moved closer. \u201cJohn, can I ask you a few questions?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo problem, I\u2019m happy to meet you,\u201d came the response as Lennon, looking up from his Orwell novel, contemplated Tsirigotakis\u2019 next question on his \u201cimpressions of Greece\u201d. What followed was an outburst so impassioned it took the reporter aback: \u201cUnfortunately the social inequalities in England are so big it wounds me psychologically. Greece is a wonderful country, fantastic climate, great people \u2026 and that\u2019s why we are seriously thinking of buying a small Greek island and setting up our own hippy commune where we could live undisturbed for half of the year.\u201d In 1967 it was extraordinary that the Beatles were in Greece at all. Three months earlier a group of colonels had seized power . One of the regime\u2019s first acts was to ban the miniskirt \u2013 and anything else that to the rightwing junior army officers smacked of decadence and immorality. Top of the list were hippies, who were seen as \u201cdrug addicts, sex maniacs and thieves\u201d. And yet, officials at EOT, the national tourist board \u2013 like the media tightly controlled by the junta \u2013 were keen to use the Beatles\u2019 visit to offset international isolation spurred by reports of widespread torture and persecution of political opponents. \u201cThe regime clearly saw them as celebrities who could serve a purpose,\u201d said Tsirigotakis, recalling the cat-and-mouse games he and a photographer were forced to play with EOT minders tasked with acquiring the perfect propaganda snap. It appeared to have been lost on the dictators, who would rule with an iron hand for the next seven years, that at the height of the flower-power 60s Britain\u2019s most famous band were not only viscerally opposed to violence and war but deep into their psychedelic phase. Greece, for all of them, would be recalled as the backdrop for a series of mind-blowing acid trips. More than five decades later, the episode related in the veteran journalist\u2019s recently published memoirs has given pause for thought to scholars who study the Beatles. Last month the University of Liverpool\u2019s Journal of Beatles Studies ran an 8,000-word essay titled \u201cUsed as propaganda\u201d: The Beatles\u2019 Greek island plans and international politics. Its author, Jonathan Knott, is persuaded, after several years of research, that while the musicians were keen to buy an outpost to escape the pressures of recognition and fame, Greek officials were equally intent on exploiting that desire to encourage tourism. Weeks earlier, protests against the military government, which had banished thousands of ex-communists to Aegean island labour camps, had erupted in London. A newspaper reported on protesters carrying placards demanding \u201cdemocracy in Greece\u201d as they greeted the arrival of guests at a Cafe Royal reception of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Athens. Its Greek host had made \u201can impassioned plea to British tourists to come to Greece\u201d. \u201cThe Greek press at the time was heavily censored, so any reports concerning the Beatles presumably had official blessing,\u201d Knott writes. \u201cBut cumulatively, the evidence suggests more than this: that there was an attempt in 1967 by Greek tourism representatives to use the Beatles\u2019 visit to generate beneficial publicity. \u2026 To be clear, I am not suggesting that any of the Beatles were at any time aware that their trip might be, or might have been used, in this way.\u201d Knott describes how when the group found their island (believed to be Tsougrias, off Skiathos) and before the deal fell through, they were instructed to wire \u201c\u00a3120,000 worth of property dollars in total to cover legal fees and renovating the properties\u201d. The trip to Greece had been organised by the late Alexis Mardas, an electronics genius affectionately named Magic Alex, who had invented a light-box that stimulated Lennon\u2019s LSD trips and was one of the Beatles\u2019 first Apple company employees. Mardas, who would fall out spectacularly with the band, was the son of an airforce officer with close links to the colonels. \u201cIt appears likely that official tourism representatives and Alexis Mardas were involved,\u201d Knott writes. Later, Barry Miles, a friend of the group and Paul McCartney\u2019s biographer, said he had been \u201chorrified\u201d by the Beatles\u2019 stance, telling the author Peter Doggett in his book There\u2019s a riot going on: Revolutionaries, rock stars and the rise and fall of 60s counter-culture: \u201cAs I remember it, Paul was faintly embarrassed by it all, but John wasn\u2019t concerned. As far as I can gather, the entire trip to Greece was just a haze of LSD, though. None of them really knew where the hell they were.\u201d Historians concur that the Beatles\u2019 presence in Greece would have been seen as a boon. \u201cThe colonels were desperate very early on for some kind of legitimisation from abroad,\u201d said Alexandros Nafpliotis, whose expertise is in the regime era. \u201cThe Beatles being in Greece in the middle of Beatlemania would have constituted a propaganda coup for them.\u201d Half a century later, as Greece prepares to commemorate the November 1973 polytechnic uprising against the regime \u2013 an event that would lead to the Colonels\u2019 overthrow \u2013 questions are being asked as to how a cluster of paranoid, low-level army officers managed to stay in power for so long. The Beatles\u2019 sojourn in Greece \u2013 and their dream of acquiring an island - will undoubtedly come into sharper focus. \u201cAlthough the thought of the Beatles ostensibly buying their own private Greek island tends to be recalled with a touch of romance and whimsy, [Knott\u2019s] article really highlights the process as being anything but,\u201d said Dr Holly Tessler, who co-edits the Journal of Beatles Studies. \u201cOften influenced and sometimes dazzled by some of Apple\u2019s employees, the Beatles\u2019 almost-purchase shows both their naivety and their innocence, sometimes exploited by those in their inner circle.\u201d"

            "title": "Nagorno-Karabakh: ceasefire agreed after dozens killed in military offensive",
            "date": "2023-09-20T18:18:47Z",
            "content": "A ceasefire agreement has been reached a day after Azerbaijan launched a new military offensive against the local Armenian government in the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, potentially averting a wider war but threatening the long-term existence of the ethnic Armenian enclave there. The agreement took effect at 1pm local time and includes provisions for the local Armenian government to disband its local military, in a capitulation to Azerbaijan. In a televised address on Wednesday night, Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, claimed victory, saying that the country had \u201crestored its sovereignty\u201d over its territory after the 24-hour offensive. Aliyev praised his army and claimed it had achieved the \u201ccomplete surrender\u201d of local Armenian fighters. In the speech, he blamed a \u201ccriminal junta\u201d for the conflict and said it appeared that local Armenians from Karabakh had \u201cforgotten that they live in Azerbaijan\u201d. He said the Azerbaijani army would not engage in reprisals against the local population. Estimates of the number killed in the assault range from dozens to hundreds. One official in Nagorno-Karabakh said at least 200 people had been killed and more than 400 wounded after Azerbaijan launched what it described as an \u201canti-terrorist operation\u201d in the disputed South Caucasus region on Tuesday. Gegham Stepanyan, the region\u2019s rights ombudsman, said that at least 10 civilians were among the dead, five of them children. Officials in the regional capital, Stepanakert, and in Azerbaijan\u2019s capital, Baku, confirmed that representatives would meet in Yevlakh, in Azerbaijan, on Thursday for negotiations. Azerbaijan, which has demanded the dissolution of the local government in Nagorno-Karabakh, said the talks would include plans for the reintegration of the region into Azerbaijan. Later, an adviser to Aliyev said it had readied a \u201cplan for the reintegration of the Armenian population of Karabakh\u201d. Officials in the breakaway region of Stepanakert have accused Baku of preparing a campaign of \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, told Aliyev to protect the rights of ethnic Armenians in the region and \u201censure full ceasefire and safe, dignified treatment by Azerbaijan of Karabakh Armenians\u201d. \u201cTheir human rights and security need to be ensured. Access needed for immediate humanitarian assistance,\u201d Michel wrote in a post on social media. In a statement, the breakaway government in Stepanakert cited an agreement to \u201cpull out the remaining detachments and troops of the Armenian armed forces from the zone of deployment of the Russian peacekeeping contingent, to disband and fully disarm armed units of the Nagorno-Karabakh defence army, and pull out heavy hardware and weapons from the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh for the sake of their soonest possible disposal.\u201d Both sides said the agreement had been mediated by a local Russian peacekeeping force that has been deployed in the region since war broke out in 2020. Local officials earlier said 27 people had been killed and more than 200 wounded in Nagorno-Karabakh after Azerbaijan launched its new offensive. Although fighting died down after the announcement of the ceasefire, shelling continued on Wednesday evening. An unknown number of Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh were killed on Wednesday after the car they were driving came under fire, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said. It did not say who was behind the shooting. Photographs have shown thousands of ethnic Armenian civilians crowding into a local airport protected by Russian peacekeepers. The Russian defence ministry said 2,261 civilians, including 1,049 children, were being sheltered at the base at Khojali airport near Stepanakert. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin rejected criticism that Russian peacekeepers had stood aside while Azerbaijan reignited the conflict. \u201cOur peacekeepers are working very actively with all parties involved in the conflict,\u201d he said, while meeting the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, in St Petersburg. \u201cThey are doing everything possible to protect the civilian population.\u201d Artak Beglaryan, a former adviser to the breakaway government who is now in Stepanakert, said more than 200 people were believed to have been killed. \u201cThe situation is quite disastrous,\u201d he said. \u201cNagorno-Karabakh is now separated into a few parts because the Azerbaijani side has occupied some strategic heights and roads \u2026 We are under local additional blockade and siege by the Azerbaijani forces.\u201d Azerbaijani officials had demanded that the local government dissolve and dismantle its military formations as a precondition to negotiations. Ruben Vardanyan, a former head of the local administration, cited higher casualties in what he told Reuters was the beginning of a \u201cbig war\u201d. Although Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as Azerbaijani territory, part of it is run by local Armenian authorities who say the area is their ancestral homeland. The region has been at the centre of two wars since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the latest in 2020. The Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, said on Wednesday he supported the ceasefire and it was \u201cvery important\u201d that it held. His administration has distanced itself from the breakaway republic, saying Armenia had not stationed any troops in the region and that he was not involved in the negotiations over the ceasefire. \u201cWe hope that military escalation will not continue, because in the current conditions it is very important to ensure stability and stop combat actions,\u201d Pashinyan said in a televised address to Armenians. Protests in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, continued on Wednesday despite the announcement of the ceasefire. Thousands gathered in Yerevan\u2019s central Republic Square to express their anger with Pashinyan\u2019s government, as well as what they see as the failures of Russia and the west to protect the lives of ethnic Armenians. \u201cI came here today because there is still a small amount of hope that we can save our country,\u201d said protester Alexan Yesiyan, 47, an education official. \u201cThe first thing we need to get rid of the traitors who control the levers of power in Armenia.\u201d Most of the demonstration passed off peacefully, but after people had started to leave Republic Square, several hundred demonstrators attacked lines of riot police in front of government buildings. Dozens of windows were smashed by rock-throwing protesters, and there were repeated scuffles. One police officer suffered a head injury and was rushed to an ambulance. Protesters chanted \u201cArtsakh, Artsakh, Artsakh!\u201d \u2013 the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh \u2013 and \u201cNikol is a traitor!\u201d There was despair in the crowd at what protesters describe as the capitulation of local defence forces in Nagorno-Karabakh, and calls for Armenia to intervene. Azerbaijan\u2019s defence ministry announced the start of the operation on Tuesday, saying frontline positions and military assets of Armenia\u2019s armed forces were being \u201cincapacitated using high-precision weapons\u201d and that only legitimate military targets were being attacked. Armenia\u2019s foreign ministry denied that its weapons or troops were in Nagorno-Karabakh and called reports of sabotage and landmines in the region \u201ca lie\u201d. Nagorno-Karabakh and sizeable surrounding territories had been under ethnic Armenian control since the end of a war in 1994, but Azerbaijan regained the territories and parts of Nagorno-Karabakh during the 2020 fighting. That ended with an armistice placing Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh."

            "date": "2023-09-19T08:51:13Z",
            "content": "Labor has just handed down its first New South Wales state budget in more than a decade. Here are some of the winners \u2013 and some of those who missed out. Winners The Star casino The Minns government will bail out Sydney\u2019s embattled Star casino in a decision that is set to cost the taxpayer nearly half a billion dollars in lost revenue over the next four years. The government revealed in August it would lower taxes for casinos in NSW by slashing a planned increase to the casino duty that the former Coalition government had announced eight months earlier. The budget papers released on Tuesday say the Minns government made the decision to ensure The Star\u2019s \u201congoing financial viability\u201d. The government expects its decision to lower casino taxes is expected to cost it $432m in lost revenue over the next four years, with a forecast reduction in annual revenue of between $96m and $121m until 2026-27. Labor is expecting to collect $1.5bn less in overall gambling revenue than was forecast before the March election. The government says the revised figure is a result of the lower casino tax rates, as well as a reduction in pokies use in both clubs and hotels and a \u201cmore subdued outlook\u201d for Sydney\u2019s casinos. The government says that, in return, The Star promised to protect about 3,000 jobs over the next six years and contribute to the industry transition to cashless gaming. Public sector workers Workers employed by the state government will benefit, including teachers, police officers, nurses and firefighters. The government has committed $3.6bn to an \u201cessential services fund\u201d it has created to pay for wage rises of up to 4.5% this year. Labor went to the election promising to tear up the former Perrottet government\u2019s 2.5% public sector wage rise cap. Teachers The government will also fund historic pay rises for the state\u2019s public school teachers after months of tense negotiations with their union. From October, the starting salary for first-year teachers will go from $75,791 to $85,000 \u2013 an increase of more than 12%. Salaries for teachers at the top of the scale will rise from $113,042 to $122,100. Motorists Chris Minns went to the election promising to end Sydney\u2019s \u201ctoll mania\u201d and Tuesday\u2019s budget includes $561m over two years to cap tolls. From January motorists will be able to claim back weekly spending above $60 on the state\u2019s toll roads. Parents of young children The parents of three-year-old children in NSW have been promised $500 a year off their childcare bills per year, costing the budget $64m over the next two years. The rebates will not be means tested and will be available to the families of every three-year-old child in a preschool program at a long daycare centre. The budget also includes $20m to build new public not-for-profit childcare centres, with a focus on western Sydney and regional NSW. Party animals in Newcastle and Wollongong Tens of millions of dollars will be made available to the 24-hour economy commissioner to allow the office that has worked to develop nightlife in Sydney in recent years to replicate its work around the state. The government has allocated $26.8m to be spent this financial year to expand the office to Wollongong, the Central Coast and Newcastle \u201cto build vibrant, safe, and diverse night-time economies in those regions\u201d. A new body called Sound NSW will also be established and a \u201cMusic Scene Plan\u201d developed to support contemporary music. \u201cFestivals need a secure pipeline of creative talent and workers,\u201d said arts minister John Graham as he announced $31.2m to fund these initiatives for one year. But it\u2019s not all good news for the arts, as the government will not reinstate funding for a range of arts, cultural and innovation programs left unfunded by the former government. People who already own an EV While the Minns government has ditched the Coalition\u2019s electric vehicle rebate, it will use some of the money it saves to invest $263m to speed up the delivery of infrastructure such as charging stations around the state. Losers Would-be fast rail riders Announced with a bang but killed off quietly, NSW\u2019s go-it-alone approach to building fast rail between Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong has been shelved entirely, the budget confirms. Fast rail was a flagship policy that former premier Gladys Berejiklian announced in the lead-up to the 2019 state election. Guardian Australia first reported the former Coalition government had gone cold on the fast rail plan late last year, despite spending about $100m on studies for the project. Tuesday\u2019s budget confirmed the new Labor Minns government has identified that the program \u2013 which was expected to cost in the tens of billions \u2013 \u201cshould no longer proceed\u201d. Renters and people in housing stress Housing was promoted as the centrepiece of the Minns government\u2019s first budget but it didn\u2019t ultimately include that much to directly boost housing supply. The budget includes a relatively modest $300m investment into the state-owned development organisation Landcom to build fewer than 5,000 homes over the next 16 years. Treasurer Daniel Mookhey said this was \u201cjust the start\u201d and that the government\u2019s $2.2bn overall spend on housing in the budget, mostly for infrastructure, would pave the way for more homes to be built in the future. That $2.2bn package has received a mixed reception from housing advocacy groups. NSW\u2019s booming property market is forecast to deliver the Minns government billions more in revenue through stamp duty and land taxes over the next four years than it was expecting before the election in March. People who want to buy an EV Labor has dumped the Coalition\u2019s electric vehicle rebate, axing a government subsidy of $3,000 that was previously on offer to buyers of new EVs. The decision was roundly criticised by the Electric Vehicle Council as well as the NSW opposition\u2019s energy spokesperson, James Griffin, who called it \u201cpoor environmental policy\u201d. The coal mining industry Coal mining companies will pay 2.6% more in royalties to the state government from July next year. It\u2019s the first change to NSW\u2019s royalty rates in 15 years and is expected to earn $2.7bn over four years. Environmental groups and the Greens have said the government hasn\u2019t gone far enough and should introduce a progressive coal royalty scheme such as the one in Queensland.

            "content": "Working on my latest book with nutritionist Dr Federica Amati has opened my eyes to the health benefits of barley, which has been grown in Scandinavia since the Stone Ages. The word barley means \u201cwhat is cultivated\u201d, and this grain is one of the oldest known to man; it is also vitamin- and mineral-rich, and has a high fibre content compared with other wholegrains. Today\u2019s fritters are very quick to make, combining grated beetroot and caraway with cooked barley; smoked fish and dill are my favourite topping for them, but go with whatever takes your fancy. Cooking barley like rice, risotto-style, is a bit more time-consuming, but it can be the base for so many meals and, like so many things, is vastly improved by the addition of a fried egg. Barley beetroot cakes with mackerel, dill and yoghurt Prep 10 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 as a starter 200g grated raw beetroot 300g cooked barley 2 eggs 1 tbsp creme fraiche 2 spring onions, trimmed and finely chopped 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed 1 tsp caraway seeds 25g chickpea flour Salt and pepper 100g Greek yoghurt 1 tbsp chopped dill 1 x 100g tin smoked mackerel fillets, drained and shredded 2 tbsp olive oil In a large bowl, mix the grated beetroot with the barley, eggs, creme fraiche, spring onions, garlic, caraway and chickpea flour, to make a thick batter, then season with salt and pepper. Put the yoghurt and dill in a medium bowl, gently stir in the shredded mackerel and season. Put the oil in a nonstick pan on a medium heat. Once hot, spoon in four fritter-sized dollops of the batter and cook for about three minutes on each side, until golden brown. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve two fritters per portion, each topped with a spoonful of the mackerel yoghurt. Barley, bacon, pea and mushroom risotto with a fried egg Prep 10 min Cook 40 min Serves 4 3 tbsp olive oil 2 rashers streaky bacon, chopped 250g pearl barley 100g mushrooms, sliced 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed Salt and black pepper 700ml chicken stock 200g frozen peas 25g parmesan, grated 4 eggs Heat a tablespoon of the oil in a medium pan and cook the chopped bacon for two or three minutes, until it is lightly browned and has released some of its fat. While the bacon is cooking, rinse the barley under cold running water, then drain. Stir the drained barley into the bacon pan, cook for a couple of minutes, then stir in the mushrooms and garlic, and season. Add the stock, bring to a simmer and leave to cook gently, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until the barley is almost tender. Stir in the peas, cook for another five minutes, adding extra stock or water if the mix seems a little dry. When the barley is cooked, stir through the grated cheese and season to taste. Heat the remaining two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then break in the four eggs and cook until fried to your liking. Divide the barley mixture between four shallow bowls, top each with an egg and serve. Jane Baxter is chef/co-owner of Wild Artichokes in Kingsbridge, Devon.

            "content": "Chickpeas are a great choice in budget cooking, and there is so much more to them than hummus. I stipulate a cooked weight for today\u2019s recipes, and by far the easiest option is to use drained tinned chickpeas, but I much prefer soaking and cooking dried ones, because you can impart more flavour into them. That said, the cooking time can be as much as an hour, so I understand why they put some people off. To get around this, use a pressure cooker, where the chickpeas will be done in about 15 minutes, or cook a big batch and use them up over the course of a few days. Spinach and chickpea salad (pictured top) This brilliant salad is one I\u2019ve been making for years, and can also be incorporated into a Moorish-style spread. Prep 10 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed 50g currants 4 tbsp olive oil 500g spinach Salt and pepper 1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained (or 250g cooked chickpeas) 1 pinch cayenne pepper 50g flaked almonds, toasted In a small bowl, mix the chopped red onion with the vinegar, sugar and garlic, then set aside. Put the currants in a second small bowl, pour over boiling water just to cover, then leave to rehydrate and plump up. Heat two tablespoons of the olive oil in a large pan, tip in the spinach, season and stir to coat. Keep stirring for a couple of minutes, until the spinach wilts, then tip into a colander and leave to drain and cool. Once cool enough to handle, squeeze out any excess moisture, then roughly chop the leaves. Put half the chickpeas in a food processor and pulse briefly, just so they\u2019re roughly chopped (you can also do this by hand). Drain the currants, tip them into a large bowl, then add the onion mixture, the spinach, both the chopped chickpeas and the remaining whole ones, and the almonds. Season generously with salt, pepper and cayenne, then gently fold everything together. Drizzle over the remaining olive oil and serve. Chickpea and chorizo fideu\u00e0 Fideu\u00e0 is traditionally made with fideus, a very thin Spanish pasta that is usually toasted in a dry pan before being simmered in stock; if you can\u2019t get hold of it, use broken-up angel-hair pasta or vermicelli instead, in which case the cooking time may vary. Prep 10 min Cook 25 min Serves 4 100g cooking chorizo, sliced 1 tbsp olive oil 250g fideus, or vermicelli or angel hair pasta, broken into small pieces 2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1 red pepper, stem, seeds and pith discarded, flesh diced (optional) 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes 500ml chicken stock 1 x 400g chickpeas, drained (or 250g cooked chickpeas) Salt and pepper 1 tbsp chopped parsley 2 spring onions, trimmed and chopped (optional) In a large shallow pan on a low heat, cook the chorizo in the olive oil for a few minutes, until it releases its fat and colours the oil. Add the pasta, garlic and red pepper, if using, stir to combine, then turn up the heat to medium and cook the pasta in the chorizo fat for five minutes, until toasted and lightly browned. Stir in the tomatoes , cook for five minutes, then add the stock and chickpeas. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes, until the pasta is just cooked. Season, stir in the parsley and spring onions, if using, and serve. Jane Baxter is chef/co-owner of Wild Artichokes in Kingsbridge, Devon.

            "date": "2023-09-21T16:21:45Z",
            "content": "The Swedish government is facing a huge backlash \u2013 including threats of no-confidence votes against its climate minister \u2013 after slashing the country\u2019s climate budget while admitting it will dramatically increase carbon dioxide emissions. The minority-run coalition, which has been in power for just under a year, announced on Wednesday it would be cutting funding for climate and environmental measures next year by 259m krona (\u00a319m) and introducing tax cuts on petrol and diesel. While long-term emissions are expected to decrease by 2045, the government is now expected to miss its 2030 transport targets. By its own estimates, emissions will increase by 5.9m-9.8m tonnes of CO2 equivalents by 2030 as a consequence of government decisions made between 1 July 2022 and 1 July 2023. The move has drawn comparisons to the UK, where Rishi Sunak this week also attracted condemnation after performing a significant U-turn on Britain\u2019s climate commitments by pushing back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers. Since Elisabeth Svantesson, the Swedish finance minister, made the announcement, the government has faced heavy criticism from other parties \u2013 including from those within the ruling coalition, sources have told the Guardian. Some commentators have suggested it could pull apart the prime minister Ulf Kristersson\u2019s coalition between his own party, the Moderates, Christian Democrats and Liberals, dependent on the support of the far-right Sweden Democrats. But a government source rebutted such claims, saying the coalition was \u201ccooperating very well\u201d. Rickard Nordin, the climate and energy spokesperson for the opposition Centre party, condemned the climate cuts, which he said were unprecedented. Along with other parties, he said, he would do what it took to stop the budget and presented the government with an ultimatum. He said if it did not deliver a climate action plan before Christmas, they would issue the Liberal climate and energy minister, Romina Pourmokhtari, with a motion of no confidence. \u201cWhat has happened is that the Swedish government is consciously increasing emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cNo Swedish government in modern times has consciously increased emissions. Few countries in the world have done that and it\u2019s extremely serious.\u201d Swedish climate law required the government to reduce emissions, he said, and he planned to hold Kristersson\u2019s government accountable. Nordin said: \u201cWe are going to start by putting forward alternative proposals and use every tool we have in parliament to stop this.\u201d He accused the government of underestimating public and political strength of feeling on climate. \u201cThey have underestimated the explosive power in this, because in Sweden we have a united business community and citizens are screaming out for leadership on climate politics while the government is doing the opposite.\u201d Many blame the influence of the Sweden Democrats, which has members who have denied the climate crisis, for the Moderates\u2019 shift in priorities. \u201cWhen you sell your soul to a populist and nationalist party with plenty of climate deniers, this is the result,\u201d said Nordin. Mats Engstr\u00f6m, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear it will be very difficult for Sweden to reach its climate targets. This is a national explosion of the tension since this government was founded. \u201cThis must be really hard for the Liberals and Romina Pourmokhtari. But she is not the party leader \u2013 and for the party there may be other issues that are more important, like the school system.\u201d Pourmokhtari has so far stood behind the budget, telling Green party spokesperson Per Bolund in a debate on SVT that it was the \u201cthird largest budget ever for climate and environment\u201d and would help Sweden reach its 2045 climate goals. Engstr\u00f6m said the developments in the UK and Sweden were part of a Europe-wide pattern. He said: \u201cYou have leaders and parties who are now criticising the previous climate policy for their elections and standing. This rhetoric and what Sunak said reflects what\u2019s happening in Sweden. \u201cI know there are concerns in other European capitals about whether Sweden will stay a climate leader. I wouldn\u2019t say it will totally destroy this reputation but it will fuel concerns in other parts of Europe that Sweden is changing its mind.\u201d As well as affecting Sweden\u2019s international standing as a climate leader, which Engstr\u00f6m said was already raising concerns in European capitals, it also has strong potential consequences on domestic attitudes. Maria Xylia, a senior research fellow at Stockholm Environment Institute, said in Sweden the image of environmental leadership was for many a question of national identity. She said the government\u2019s decision to scrap stadsmilj\u00f6avtal (the urban environment agreement providing sustainability support to muncipalities and regional authorities) was also a big problem. While the government has pledged to replace it, she fears it will create a vacuum of resources in the meantime by creating uncertainty. \u201cWe have some very critical years coming up to 2030,\u201d she said. Fridays for Future, the youth climate movement started by the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, said the budget was \u201ca catastrophe\u201d and \u201ca big betrayal\u201d, inviting people to join Friday\u2019s national climate strike in protest. Linna Gadde, a Fridays for Future spokesperson, said there was a lot of anger about the budget. She said: \u201cThe government is not meeting the situation as seriously as they should because we\u2019re in an emergency. The budgets before have been bad but this one is even worse.\u201d The group is marking the end of its week of action on Friday, with a strike and protest march in central Stockholm. Gadde said Fridays for Future was expecting thousands to attend, and she expected the budget announcement to bring more people out. \u201cWe need to use our right to demonstrate to stand up for what\u2019s right and show that people have the power.\u201d"

            "content": "A liberal group representing US military veterans took aim at Tommy Tuberville, the Alabama Republican senator holding up officer promotions in a protest over abortion, but also at party leaders who have not forced him to stand down, calling them \u201ctraitors\u201d and warning: \u201cTight lips could sink ships.\u201d Presented in the style of a second world war propaganda film, a short ad from Vote Vets bemoans \u201can un-American assault on our military\u201d by a \u201cso-called American senator singlehandedly stop[ping] hundreds of military leaders from taking command\u201d. Tuberville, a former college football coach, was elected in 2020. He is now protesting Pentagon policy that allows service members to travel for abortion care if it is restricted where they are based, a possibility since the US supreme court removed the federal right to abortion last year. As a result of Tuberville\u2019s block on Senate-confirmed promotions, more than 300 senior roles are being filled in an acting capacity. Military officials have bemoaned the effects of Tuberville\u2019s blocks on officers\u2019 families and finances. Even the position of chair of the joint chief of staff stands to be affected, when the current occupant, Gen Mark Milley, steps down at the end of this month. Noting that leadership of the army, navy, air force and marines has already been affected, the Vote Vets ad shows images of leaders of Iran, Russia and North Korea. \u201cDangerous dictators look on with glee as Tuberville does their work for them, hurting American military readiness,\u201d says the narrator. Switching to footage of Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, the narrator says Tuberville\u2019s \u201cAmerican comrades are traitors in their silence. Their tight lips could sink ships.\u201d \u201cLoose lips sink ships\u201d was a phrase coined during the second world war, under the guidance of the US Office of War Information and meant to warn citizens about careless talk that might boost the US\u2019s enemies. The Vote Vets ad concludes by telling McConnell to \u201cstop the block on military promotions\u201d. Last week, Tuberville told 1819 News, an Alabama-based news site: \u201cI\u2019m voting for the people of Alabama, and I\u2019m going to stand up for what I believe is right when it comes to the right to life and a lot of the things that go along with it.\u201d The senator has said he will end his protest if the Senate votes on Pentagon abortion policy. He has also said Democrats who control the Senate can confirm the held-up promotions one by one. As that would be enormously time consuming, the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said it will not happen. Tuberville has rejected criticism based on his own lack of service, saying he is the son of a father who served. On Monday, he wished a \u201chappy 76th birthday to the US air force\u201d and thanked the \u201cbrave men and women who keep our skies and country safe\u201d. One user shot back: \u201cHow about letting them get promoted!! That would be a nice birthday gift!!\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-28T10:30:15Z",
            "content": "Travis King, the American soldier who fled across the border from South Korea to North Korea in July, has landed at a US military base in Texas after being taken back into US custody. CNN reported that King arrived at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston on a US military flight in the early hours of Thursday morning. According to senior administration officials, he had crossed the Chinese border on Wednesday, and Chinese authorities handed him to the US embassy, who then arranged for the army private to be flown to a US military base in the region, from where he was flown back to the US. King is expected to undergo a medical review at Brooke Army Medical Center, a hospital at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston. The basketball player Brittney Griner was treated there in December after a prisoner swap with Russia ended her 10 months in Russian detention. The US government has said that upon his return, King will first undergo evaluation and then a reintegration process so he can be reunited with his family. King was about to be flown out of South Korea in July, after serving two months in a South Korean prison for assault. He was under military escort to a plane at Incheon airport near Seoul, to face further possible disciplinary action in the US, but he did not board his plane and left the airport. He joined a tour group going to the demilitarised zone between South and North Korea, and ran across the border on 18 July, reportedly laughing as he did so. North Korean state media reported that King had defected because of his \u201cinhumane treatment\u201d and racial discrimination within the US army. US officials briefing the press on Wednesday did not comment on his motivations but insisted he had returned willingly. \u201cWe can confirm that Private King was very happy to be on his way home. That has been quite clear as we have resumed our contact with him, and he is very much looking forward to being reunited with his family,\u201d a senior US official said. The US was first informed that North Korea (formally known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, DPRK) was ready to let King go home earlier this month, with the news coming from the Swedish government, which serves as Washington\u2019s \u201cprotecting power\u201d in Pyongyang, representing US interests through Sweden\u2019s embassy in Pyongyang. Intensive negotiations followed involving Sweden, the UN, China and North Korea leading up to Wednesday\u2019s transfer. \u201cThe private was transferred out of the DPRK across the border to China, with the help of the government of Sweden. The United States has been able to receive him in China, and is now in the process of transferring him home,\u201d a US official said. The state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said King had been handed over to the US ambassador, Nicholas Burns, and the defence attach\u00e9 in Beijing, Brig Gen Patrick Teague. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said: \u201cWe thank the government of Sweden for its diplomatic role serving as the protecting power for the United States in the DPRK and the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for its assistance in facilitating the transit of Private King.\u201d The White House pointed out that King\u2019s return showed the value of keeping lines of communication open even to states with whom the US has bad relations, and officials stressed that Washington remained open to further diplomacy with North Korea. On the issue of any legal or disciplinary action King might face on the return to the US, a US official said that would be considered after a medical and psychological assessment. \u201cWhen he arrives on US soil, he will be evaluated by [a] very talented, experienced team that are going to guide him through a reintegration process,\u201d the official said. \u201cThey\u2019ll address any medical and emotional concerns and ensure we get him in a good place to reunite with his family \u2026 and we\u2019ll work through all those administrative status questions following completion of his reintegration.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-25T07:00:20Z",
            "content": "The indictment of Senator Bob Menendez on charges of corruptly aiding the Egyptian government has set the stage for a week of renewed pressure on US lawmakers to withhold military aid to Egypt. Menendez stepped town temporarily from his position as head of the Senate foreign relations committee on Friday after he was indicted by New York\u2019s southern district court on a set of explosive and detailed charges. These included accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes as well as gold bars, payments towards his mortgage and gifts including a luxury car, in exchange for using his influence and breaching his duties \u201cin ways that benefited the government of Egypt\u201d, while bolstering a halal meat certification business based in his New Jersey district linked to the Egyptian state. The senator has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, stating \u201cthose who believe in justice believe in innocence until proven guilty\u201d. The indictment also details the senator\u2019s close relationships with members of the Egyptian intelligence services, including meetings in his office in Washington and in Cairo to discuss the $1.3bn in foreign military aid given to Egypt by the US each year, an area where Menendez possessed substantial control due to his position. The Biden administration recently opted to withhold $85m of military aid for Egypt citing human rights concerns, substantially less than the amounts withheld in previous years. The move sparked criticism from observers who pointed to Egypt\u2019s abysmal human rights record, citing tens of thousands detained under president Abdel-Fatah al Sisi including political prisoners and US green card holders. With one week remaining before the end of the financial year, Menendez\u2019s indictment has sparked furious calls from rights groups and lobbyists in Washington demanding that US lawmakers withhold on national security grounds a further $235m in military aid to Egypt that was previously approved by the Biden administration earlier this month. \u201cAccording to the three-count indictment, while enriching himself, Menendez used his position to prioritize the wants of Egypt\u2019s corrupt and brutal government and security services,\u201d said the Washington-based group the Freedom Initiative, which focuses on political prisoners held across the Middle East. \u201cThe indictment alleges significant efforts by the Egyptian government to improperly influence US policy and law. President Biden and his administration should demand an accounting from the Egyptian government and announce a review of the bilateral relationship.\u201d Seth Binder, advocacy director at the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington, said that his organisation would be among those pressing lawmakers to withhold the military aid to Egypt in light of the accusations against Senator Menendez and revelations around Egyptian interference in US policy. \u201cThis is a rare thing; Congress jumping in like this is not commonly done. But also the information in the indictment is quite unusual,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe often hear that using military aid as leverage won\u2019t work, as the Egyptian government doesn\u2019t really care about the assistance. This indictment should put that argument to bed, it has clearly been proven false.\u201d Among the details in the indictment against Menendez are text messages to his wife, Nadine Menendez, which were passed on to Egyptian officials, specifying sensitive information regarding staff at the US embassy in Cairo. The accusations also include examples of Menendez communicating with Egyptian officials, via his wife, about his personal approval of specific arms sales to Egypt. \u201cAsking for names and individuals working at an embassy: that part is truly scandalous to my mind,\u201d said Binder. \u201cWe know that Egypt is regularly trying to harass Egyptian nationals that work at foreign embassies, to use them to gather intelligence and information. Playing a part in that is really dirty.\u201d The extensive allegations against Menendez appear likely to affect multiple areas of US foreign policy, while also emboldening rights groups who have long complained of the Biden administration\u2019s broken promises on Egypt. As a candidate, Biden promised \u201cno blank cheques\u201d for Sisi, belied by increasingly warm relations once he took office."

            "date": "2023-09-23T17:23:18Z",
            "content": "US president Joe Biden has decided to supply Ukraine with long-range army tactical missile systems (ATACMS), an important boost to Kyiv\u2019s capacity to target Russian military logistics at long range distances as the country prepares for a second winter at war. Biden told Ukraine\u2019s leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a private meeting that a small number of the weapons would be transferred, NBC reported, citing US officials. Ukraine has been asking for ATACMS for months. Officials in the US were reluctant as the country\u2019s own stockpile is limited and because of fears Russia could accuse Washington of escalation. But Ukraine will commit not to target Russian territory with them and a waiver allowing the transfer of cluster munitions to Ukraine has expanded the number of potential missiles that could be used there, the Wall Street Journal reported. Fired from a mobile launcher, ATACMS can hit targets up to 190 miles (300km) away, allowing Ukrainian forces to strike far beyond the front lines. Potential targets include command headquarters, weapons depots and supply networks, including railways. Asked about reports that Biden had shifted his position, Zelenskiy did not directly respond, saying only that the US was Ukraine\u2019s biggest weapons supplier, Reuters reported.\u201cWe are discussing all the different types of weapons \u2013 long-range weapons and artillery, shells with the calibre of 155mm, then air defence systems,\u201d Zelenskiy told a press conference during an official visit to Canada. Ukraine\u2019s acquisition of the ATACMS is the latest in a long-running and largely successful campaign to push western allies for more advanced weaponry, which has been bolstered by Ukrainian military successes on the ground. When Russia invaded last year, guided anti-tank missiles were among the most hi-tech equipment sent to Ukraine. It now has western tanks, surface-to-air missile defence systems and pilots training to take over a fleet of F-16 fighter jets. Ukrainian forces are already familiar with the Himars mobile rocket launchers used to fire ATACMS, as the US began transferring these systems last year. However, it only supplied Ukraine with shorter-range guided rockets. The long-range missiles could be particularly important in winter, when cold weather slows fighting along the frontlines and Russia may try to shore up its defences in occupied Ukrainian territory. Ukraine launched a counteroffensive this summer that progressed more slowly than the country\u2019s own military and its US allies had hoped. Kyiv aimed to break through Russian lines, then drive down to the Sea of Azov, isolating invading forces around Kherson and cutting off supply routes to Crimea. A dense mine belt stalled troops for weeks, however, after it proved impenetrable even to armoured vehicles and tanks from the US and European powers. Eventually a path was cleared by sappers on foot, and last week, in another key breakthrough, armoured vehicles breached Russia\u2019s main anti-tank defences in the same area.That could allow them to push farther south more easily, or attack Russian forces along defensive lines from the rear. While the land offensive has advanced slowly, Ukraine has sought to put pressure on Russian forces with long-distance drone and other attacks, both inside Russia and on occupied Ukrainian soil, particularly in Crimea. Although there was no official announcement on ATACMS during Zelenskiy\u2019s whirlwind visit to Washington last week, he secured $325m in new US aid and worked to reinforce support for his country among politicians.While in Europe support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort is largely bipartisan, in the US there are splits along party political lines, with a faction of congressional Republicans largely aligned with the party\u2019s presidential frontrunner Donald Trump increasingly opposed to funding aid and weapons transfers."

A Marine Corps pilot safely escaped the F-35B Lightning II jet over North Charleston on Sunday afternoon after a \u201cmishap\u201d, military officials said, adding that the search for his missing aircraft was focused on two lakes north of North Charleston. The pilot parachuted safely into North Charleston at about 2pm and was taken to a local hospital, where he was in stable condition, said Maj Melanie Salinas. The pilot\u2019s name was not immediately released. Based on the plane\u2019s location and trajectory, the search for the F-35 Lightning II jet was focused on Lake Moultrie and Lake Marion, said Senior Master Sergeant Heather Stanton at Joint Base Charleston. Both lakes are north of North Charleston. The local Republican congresswoman, Nancy Mace, said: \u201cHow in the hell do you lose an F-35? How is there not a tracking device and we\u2019re asking the public to what, find a jet and turn it in?\u201d The F-35 is in fact designed to be hard to detect \u2013 though in flight, with anti-radar elements, and not to the point of being invisible, as Donald Trump repeatedly claimed when he was in the White House. In November 2017, in remarks to US Coast Guard members, the former president said: \u201cSo amazing we are ordering hundreds of millions of dollars of new airplanes for the air force, especially the F-35.

It\u2019s hard to fight a plane you can\u2019t see.\u201d He also said: \u201cThat\u2019s an expensive plane you can\u2019t see.\u201d Trump returned to the subject frequently, in January 2020 telling an audience in Michigan the planes were \u201ctotally stealth, so maybe you won\u2019t see them come in\u201d. In South Carolina, Stanton said a state law enforcement helicopter joined the search after bad weather cleared. Officials were investigating why the pilot ejected, authorities said. The pilot of a second F-35 returned safely to Joint Base Charleston. The planes and pilots were with the Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 based in Beaufort, not far from South Carolina\u2019s Atlantic coast. The Associated Press contributed reporting."

            "date": "2023-09-28T04:00:18Z",
            "content": "International regulators are incapable of properly monitoring safety at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, according to a critical dossier compiled by Greenpeace that is being sent to western governments on Thursday. The environmental campaign group concludes the International Atomic Energy Agency has too few inspectors at Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear plant \u2013 four \u2013 and that there are too many restrictions placed on their access. It argues that the IAEA is \u201cunable to meet its mandate requirements\u201d but it is not prepared to admit as much in public, and as a result what it describes as Russian violations of safety principles are not being called out. Shaun Burnie and Jan Vande Putte, nuclear specialists at Greenpeace, conclude: \u201cThe IAEA risks normalising what remains a dangerous nuclear crisis, unprecedented in the history of nuclear power, while exaggerating its actual influence on events on the ground.\u201d The vast Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with six reactors on site, was captured by Russia in early March 2022 and has been on the frontline of the war ever since. It is sited on the Dnipro River in central Ukraine and Ukrainian forces occupy the riverbank opposite, leaving the plant in the sights of both sides\u2019 militaries. Russian forces have based themselves inside the plant, potentially numbering 500-600 based on reports from early in the war. Imagery from 2022 revealed some armoured vehicles present. At times it has come under attack, including in August 2022 when shelling blew holes in the roof of a storage unit. The IAEA declined to comment directly on the Greenpeace report but highlighted that it had had inspectors on site since September 2022, and that without their presence \u201cthe world would have no independent source of information about Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant\u201d. All six of its reactors are in shutdown, and concerns about whether there was enough water available for cooling after the dam at Nova Kakhovka downstream was breached in June have been eased by the drilling of new wells, according to the IAEA. But anxieties remain about the potential for a fresh outbreak of fighting at the plant, as Ukraine seeks to regain territory in its counteroffensive. Greenpeace\u2019s conclusions are supplemented by an open-source military assessment, written by McKenzie Intelligence. Most of the Russian troops and defences on the site are likely to be concealed, and inspectors report evidence that some areas of the plant have been mined, though it is unclear how heavily. But relying on satellite imagery, the analysts said there was evidence that the occupiers had built sangar firing points on the roof of four of the reactor halls. Track marks, also revealed from above, demonstrate that Russia routinely fires Grad or Smerch rocket launchers at Ukrainian targets from various sites between 1km and 18km away from the plant. The Russian military is also likely \u201cto be using the proximity of the nuclear power plant as a shield\u201d to deter counter-battery fire, Burnie and Vande Putte write, a breach, they argue, of the IAEA\u2019s five safety principles first announced by its director general, Rafael Grossi, at the UN security council in May. Grossi told members of the UN body that he had identified five core safety principles relating to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, including that \u201cthere should be no attack of any kind from or against the plant\u201d and that it \u201cshould not be used as storage or a base for heavy weapons\u201d. The Greenpeace authors argue that, five months later, there has been \u201cno significant reporting by the IAEA DG [director general] on the compliance or non-compliance by Russia forces or Ukraine\u201d \u2013 and raise concerns about the level of access the on-site inspectors have around the plant. An IAEA report in September noted that while inspectors were able to conduct independent verifications at the nuclear site, \u201csome areas of the plant, such as reactor building rooftops or turbine halls, remained inaccessible \u2026 for long periods\u201d. Russian managers requested inspectors give one week\u2019s notice of all access requests, it added. Such statements, Greenpeace said, demonstrated that the IAEA could not confirm compliance because of \u201cRussian obstruction\u201d \u2013 and accused the global nuclear inspectorate, which has 177 member countries including Russia and Ukraine, of \u201ctaking its commitment to neutrality too far\u201d. Copies of the Greenpeace dossier were submitted on Wednesday night, before publication, to a number of the IAEA\u2019s international board of governors. They include representatives of the US, UK, France and Germany. It is understood Greenpeace has also held discussions with Ukraine about the situation at the plant."

            "date": "2023-09-18T13:00:42Z",
            "content": "Prospective investors in the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk will undergo \u201cstrict national security checks\u201d, the government has said, as it formally kicked off a hunt for outside investment. The project, led by the French state-backed energy company EDF and backed by the UK government, aims to produce 3.2 gigawatts of electricity \u2013 enough to power about 6m homes \u2013 and was approved in July last year. On Monday, the newly appointed energy security secretary, Claire Coutinho, opened applications for interested parties to register their interest in investing in it. In reality, the project has been touted to potential investors \u2013 including sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure and pension funds \u2013 for years. In June 2022, advisers at Barclays were appointed to lead the search for investors in the huge project. The government and EDF have each taken a 20% stake in the project. Ministers hope the Suffolk plant will mark the next phase of a planned nuclear renaissance in the UK and have so far pumped in \u00a3700m. They have also made \u00a3511m available to continue project development and prepare the site for construction, ahead of the planned equity raise for the project. Estimates on its overall cost and build time, expected to be at least \u00a320bn, have varied significantly. Funding for the scheme faced upheaval after the government forced out the Chinese state-backed nuclear company CGN, which initially had a 20% stake, amid security concerns over Beijing\u2019s further involvement in UK nuclear. CGN has part-funded the Hinkley Point C in Somerset, a sister project to Sizewell C based on the same designs. The government said on Monday that \u201cany investment will also be subject to strict national security checks\u201d. Investors in the United Arab Emirates, Australia and Saudi Arabia have reportedly already been approached, while the idea of publicly floating a stake in the project has also been touted, although this strategy is unlikely. Nuclear industry sources said that efforts to get pension funds to invest in the project had stalled, and that the prospect of a general election next year could hold up the financing process. Chris O\u2019Shea, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica \u2013 a minority investor in Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations \u2013 last year told the Observer it was interested in the Sizewell C project. The investment firm Greencoat Capital has also expressed an interest, and the Emirati sovereign wealth fund Mubadala has also been tipped to invest. Sizewell C\u2019s joint managing director, Julia Pyke, said investors \u201cshould feel confident in our proposals as we are building a replica project [to Hinkley C] with government backing, a mature reactor design and a workforce ready to build it\u201d. However, Hinkley Point C is overbudget and has been delayed \u2013 it was originally supposed to be producing power by 2017. Coutinho said of the Sizewell C drive: \u201cWe are focused on securing good value for taxpayers and look forward to seeing strong and competitive bids to be a part of this exciting project.\u201d The government has sought to bolster its credentials in nuclear \u2013 after a decade in which several large power plants have closed \u2013 with the launch of Great British Nuclear earlier this year. The delivery body aims to smooth the path to the building of a new generation of nuclear plants. Sizewell C has faced significant local opposition. On Monday, the Together Against Sizewell C campaign said it had received permission from a court of appeal judge, Lord Justice Coulson, for a further hearing on its concerns over the impact on the local water supply. The group was refused a judicial review into the consent granted to Sizewell C by the then energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng."

            "date": "2023-09-26T13:57:45Z",
            "content": "Heavy metal has always revelled in its us-against-the-universe attitude, remaining steadfast in the face of hostility and outright ridicule; its bands were often born in the shadow of industrial decline, recession or the cold war. Few, though, can claim to have faced the struggles of Brazil\u2019s early extreme metal acts, as their country emerged from a 21-year military dictatorship where poverty, torture and hopelessness were the norm. \u201cThe Brazil of girls and coconuts and paradise beaches existed, but not in our reality,\u201d says Max Cavalera of Sepultura, who remain the country\u2019s most famous heavy metal export. \u201cOur Brazil was dirty and grey and all it offered was crime, drugs or fucked-up factory jobs. We wanted music that made sense to us as young, pissed-off Brazilian kids.\u201d Pooling resources and sharing or stealing instruments, acts like Sepultura, Sarc\u00f3fago, Vulcano, Holocausto and Chakal took inspiration from groundbreaking overseas acts like Venom, Hellhammer and Discharge, kicking against a repressive church and state with feral and often blasphemous attempts to emulate their heroes. The scene is now documented in a mammoth 528-page book \u2013 United Forces: An Archive of Brazil\u2019s Raw Metal Attack, 1986-1991 \u2013 that pools the work of Marcelo R Batista, whose United Forces fanzine documented it all. Sepultura would slough off their crude, knobbly edges to sell 20m records while shaping the path of thrash, groove and nu metal. Formed in 1984 by teenage brothers Max (vocals, guitar) and Iggor Cavalera (drums), the band wielded their crude material like a medieval weapon. \u201cIt was always about attitude over perfection,\u201d says Max. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to play well, you don\u2019t sound that good, but you love what you\u2019re doing. That\u2019s pretty much what got us signed, our attitude.\u201d Switched on to rock\u2019n\u2019roll at a Queen concert, the brothers took in AC/DC and Mot\u00f6rhead \u2013 \u201cthe gateway drug to the bad shit,\u201d chuckles Max \u2013 and then a mix of nascent black metal and hardcore punk. For teenagers who\u2019d lost their father and were facing a bleak, uncertain future, these ugly sounds provided the perfect soundtrack. For all the anger, Iggor is keen to point out the role naivety and joy had to play in the band\u2019s early days, including painting double AA batteries for makeshift bullet belts: couture of choice for any self-respecting metalhead. \u201cIt was tough, but at the same time we had fun doing it,\u201d says Iggor. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we were hating life. And I think every artist invests way more than you get out. But if you can balance that out where you\u2019re happy enough to continue, then it\u2019s all good.\u201d This said, the dictatorship remained a chilling memory (\u201cwe all knew of at least one person that disappeared,\u201d says Iggor) and police brutality was a constant threat, with every interviewee recounting tales of being stopped, harassed, beaten and threatened. \u201cWe used to stay at my aunt\u2019s house in Belo Horizonte,\u201d Max recalls. \u201cHer apartment faced the back of the police station and one of the most vivid memories I have is hearing people being tortured in the night. I couldn\u2019t go to sleep because of their screams, it was fucking horrible. We used to joke with our friends that we were more scared of the police than we were the devil. They really scared us, because you could get dragged into the back of a police car and nobody would ever see you again.\u201d This intimidation didn\u2019t just stop at individuals, but also the scene\u2019s burgeoning infrastructure. By now, Sepultura and others had \u201cawakened in other kids the feeling that they could start bands or help promote the metal scene by setting up gigs or running their own fanzines,\u201d says United Forces author Batista. Belo Horizonte\u2019s Cogumelo Records was also key: founded in 1980 by Jo\u00e3o Eduardo de Faria and his wife, Patty, the shop catered to the area\u2019s growing hoard of metalheads and later morphed into an influential label. Cogumelo Produ\u00e7\u00f5es released Sepultura\u2019s earliest material and, in 1986, the classic Warfare Noise compilation, which gave the world outside Minas Gerais its first bitter taste of Chakal, Mutilator, Holocausto and Sarc\u00f3fago. By then, democracy was settling in, but de Faria faced \u201csevere censorship of the lyrics of the songs, and our store was the target of constant police raids looking for evidence of drug use.\u201d If some were harassed for merely looking like troublemakers or dissidents, others like Vulcano practically begged for interference. A S\u00e3o Paulo band with its roots in Brazil\u2019s 70s hard rock scene, the band\u2019s sawtoothed thrash proved highly influential. \u201cVulcano was considered an ugly duckling at the time,\u201d says bassist Zhema Rodero. \u201cOur songs were considered bad and poorly played, but there was a scene of headbangers who adored us. We started playing around S\u00e3o Paulo and those were totally insane gigs: just the audience and the band, no barriers, security, roadies, nothing! At the time our drummer used two human tibias to play, the singer\u2019s microphone was clamped on to a human femur and we spread human bones onstage. That caused us some huge problems.\u201d Back in Minas Gerais, another Cogumelo band were courting their own controversies. Beginning as Asmodeu in 1984 before transitioning into Holocausto, the band\u2019s Campo De Exterm\u00ednio debut confronted the horrors of Nazi Germany, and its crude, borderline-childlike sleeve remains gut-churning to this day. \u201cIt was a crushing time for the Brazilian population,\u201d says vocalist Rodrigo Magalh\u00e3es, a heavy metal lifer who has served with the likes of Impurity and, now, Tormentador. \u201cIn geopolitical terms, we lived on the verge of a nuclear war. We didn\u2019t know if there would be tomorrow, so what we wanted was to fuck with everything, all the time. We had no pretensions and no specific purposes beyond screaming and shocking to the fullest. We had no political conscience or knowledge. Through music, we tried to show the horrors of war. Among all miseries, the scourge of war is one of the most absurd and terrifying.\u201d While Rodrigo views Holocausto as a \u201ccursed band,\u201d often loathed for its controversial themes and imagery, Cogumelo\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Eduardo remains more philosophical when it comes to the work of his early charges. \u201cAll of the Warfare Noise bands were heavily criticised,\u201d he says. \u201cThe names of the bands themselves were controversial, and we had a lot of criticism trying to distribute the products. But Holocausto depicted an illusion-free view of the real world and warned that nothing changes. Just look at the world today \u2013 fascism is coming back.\u201d Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s 2019-2022 presidency mirrored similar populist shifts in the US, UK and swathes of Europe. \u201cHe brought back every nightmare and stupidity of those horrible years of dictatorship,\u201d says Batista. \u201cThe Bolsonaro years were like a bad trip into hypocrisy and bigotry, not to mention the corruption cases, crimes against nature and the lack of respect for those who died during the worst days of the pandemic.\u201d The protean recordings, photoshoots and album sleeves snapshotted by United Forces would later be championed by influential second wave black metal acts outside Brazil such as Darkthrone, Mayhem and Blasphemy, and they remain touchstones for many fans seeking raw, untamed sound. But many of those involved continue to look forward as well as backwards. Cogumelo has celebrated 40 years of operation, while Marcelo\u2019s early fanzine set him on a path that would take him from working in a steel mill to founding a record label (releasing music by overseas acts he\u2019d championed in United Forces, such as Fear of God and Agathocles) and Extreme Noise Discos, the record shop he runs with his wife in downtown S\u00e3o Paulo. While no longer members of the band they formed, Max and Iggor Cavalera remain deeply connected to their earliest material, rerecording and touring (under the name Cavalera) the songs from 1985\u2019s Bestial Devastation and 1986\u2019s Morbid Visions, still savage but now more audible and in-tune. Max has never stopped exploring audio brutality, his sons Zyon and Igor continue the Cavalera dynasty in the bands Soulfly and Go Ahead and Die, and Iggor performs as one half of extreme electronic duo Petbrick. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise how political the Brazilian metal scene was at the time,\u201d he says of the early days that forged him. \u201cThere was a lot of resistance. I think everyone that participated should be proud, because we had to build something from nothing and we opened a lot of doors. Now, if you hear about a Brazilian band, you\u2019re not surprised. But I remember people laughing, saying \u2018they\u2019re in the jungle, there\u2019s no music there!\u2019 So the bands, the tape traders, promoters and fanzine writers made that scene, and it was important.\u201d \u2022 United Forces: An Archive of Brazil\u2019s Raw Metal Attack, 1986-1991 is published by Bazillion Points"

            "content": "It is impossible to disagree with Giorgio Parisi\u2019s deeply felt concern (Is it TikTok or global crisis? How the world lost its trust in scientists like me, 25 September). A part of the blame must be shared with schools and universities. During my lifetime (I was born in 1955) the quality of instruction has declined at an accelerating rate. The teaching of natural sciences has lost its former rigour in favour of social science claims that are blatant nonsense, such as the argument that scientific knowledge is not based on observation, hypothesis generation and rigorous testing by the world scientific community, but is \u201cconstructed\u201d within the framework of the political and social convictions of scientists. Those who teach such ideas seem not to be aware that the world community of scientists would soon discard any hypothesis that conflicts with observation. That is why science has made such rapid progress since Galileo ignited the scientific revolution in the 17th century. Those societies that have lagged behind are those that tried to subordinate science to social convictions, including religions and such political dogmas as Marxism, nazism, fascism and similar movements that forbid free, critical thinking. We must go back to the optimism of the Enlightenment and teach the coming generations that whatever humanity knows has become known because of science. Everything else is wishful thinking, and may be so dangerous that it might spell the end of our civilisation. This, I think, is the most serious evil that saps the foundation of our science-based society. Our society is certainly not the best, but it is the best we have been able to generate. Do not let us allow it to regress because of sheer stupidity. Prof AM Cel\u00e2l \u015eeng\u00f6r Istanbul Technical University \u2022 As a longtime science publisher, I share Giorgio Parisi\u2019s concern over the growing chasm between scientists and the public. The need to show mistakes, a core part of the scientific method, has become more and more at odds with the publishing process, where scientists are required to tell perfect stories that will satisfy journal editors and peer reviewers. This is not how science really works. In recent years, researchers in the life sciences have started sharing their work early in the form of \u201cpreprints\u201d (unreviewed versions of their research papers), allowing them to tell their own stories. During the pandemic, this early sharing of research became a matter of life and death, and led to thousands of findings being made available as soon as they were ready. Servers such as bioRxiv (pronounced \u201cbio-archive\u201d) and medRxiv grew rapidly to accommodate this new movement, and it has been encouraging to see the trend continuing into other areas of biomedical research. The movement has created the opportunity to reinvent scientific publishing \u2013 an industry worth around $20bn worldwide, mostly in the hands of a few corporate publishers \u2013 and put the power back into the hands of researchers. If they take this opportunity, we can move to a world where science is more honest, open and trusted by all. Damian Pattinson Executive director, eLife \u2022 Giorgio Parisi is of course absolutely right in recognising the alarming decrease in public trust in science and scientists. But the basic conclusion that he settles on \u2013 \u201cIn a nutshell, scientists are thought to be part of the elite and, therefore, not trustworthy\u201d \u2013 fails to recognise that a well-organised, well-financed, and ruthlessly aggressive campaign against science (regarding not only the efficacy and safety of vaccines but the critical planetary threat of climate change) by rightwing politicians, their donors and their media promoters, intended only to advance their political goals, is largely to account for this decrease. Put simply, large numbers of people no longer trust in science because they\u2019ve been told not to.

            "content": "The Conservatives have reportedly received a \u00a35m donation from a healthcare technology entrepreneur. Frank Hester, the founder and chief executive of the Phoenix Partnership (TPP), has given the seven-figure sum, a Tory party source told the PA news agency. The figure, first reported by Sky News, is expected to be disclosed by the Electoral Commission when it publishes its latest quarterly data on political donations. It comes after commission records showed that TPP, which specialises in healthcare software, donated \u00a311,300 to the Tories in February and \u00a3145,000 in March. Last week, the company said the donations should have been made in Hester\u2019s name and he had since repaid the money back to his firm. According to the TPP website, Hester founded the Leeds company in 1997 as he worked on integrated care models. TPP describes the firm as providing \u201cleading software that is transforming healthcare worldwide\u201d. In 2015, the businessman was made an OBE for his services to healthcare. Hester has been invited on several government trade missions in the past, including visiting India with then-prime minister David Cameron in 2013. The entrepreneur appeared at number 321 on the 2023 Sunday Times rich list, with the newspaper estimating his wealth at \u00a3415m. The Tories recorded a loss of \u00a32.3m last year, according to the Electoral Commission\u2019s annual accounts, in what the party described as a \u201cturbulent year\u201d. Income from donations fell by \u00a32.4m compared with 2021, with party officials saying this was partly due to \u201cdonor pledges moving into 2023\u201d. The party has recorded more than \u00a312m in donations in the first three months of this year, with Labour raising \u00a34.4m and the Liberal Democrats \u00a31.3m. Earlier this year, it emerged that Labour had secured a multimillion-pound donation pledge from Gary Lubner, a former boss of windscreen repair firm Autoglass. He told the Financial Times he wanted Keir Starmer to lead the Labour party into government and remain there for \u201ca long time\u201d. The newspaper said he was expected to give about \u00a35m to help fund its election campaign. The total for the Tories in the first quarter of the year was boosted by a \u00a35m donation from Mohamed Mansour, the party\u2019s senior treasurer and a former minister in the government of Egyptian autocrat Hosni Mubarak. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2023 to correct some references to TPP as TTP."

Our research explores the reasons why so many people opted out of sharing their data after the government announced its General Practice Data for Planning and Research (GPDPR) programme in 2021. People told us they recognise the value their data has to research into new treatments, and would like to make it available for this use. However, they object to the way the GPDPR proposals would not have allowed patients to decide whether or not their data should be shared, with whom and for what purpose. Government proposals to regulate access to health data fail to recognise people\u2019s personal connection to \u201ctheir data\u201d, including anonymised data. People feel they should have a right to make decisions about its use which reflect their identity and values. NHS data is part of the story of our lives and our interactions with healthcare professionals. The desire to contribute to health research and support the NHS means that people are willing to share this part of who they are, but this community spirit can be severely undermined by a lack of trust that their data will be handled in line with their wishes. In order to benefit from health data\u2019s value as a societal research resource, regulatory approaches need to address the lack of trust with transparency, ongoing patient control, and an understanding of what patients mean when they say their health records contain \u201cmy data\u201d.

            "title": "Healthcare worker named as a victim of Coventry hit-and-run collisions",
            "date": "2023-09-04T18:38:06Z",
            "content": "A cyclist who was one of two people killed in a series of hit-and-runs in Coventry has been named as Joel Carreido, a healthcare assistant who was 47. His family said he was \u201ca loving husband and father of two\u201d and would be \u201cmissed dearly by all that knew him\u201d. A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and sectioned under the Mental Health Act after a pedestrian and then Carreido were fatally hit by a car in separate collisions. West Midlands police confirmed that the incident was not being treated as terror-related and they were not seeking anyone else in relation to the case. Two pedestrians were hit on Gosford Street in the city centre at about 8am on Sunday, one of whom, aged 44, died from his injuries. Police said they were in the process of contacting his next of kin. Carreido was killed when he was hit by the same vehicle on Woodway Lane, about four miles away on the north-east outskirts of the city. The driver of the car then crashed into a house on Beckbury Road, where he fled the vehicle, and police called in a drone team and dog unit to help locate him. The suspect was arrested at about 9am. Flowers and candles have been left at the scene where Carreido was killed. He had been returning home from a night shift at the University hospital less than a mile away, where he was a healthcare assistant on the gastroenterology ward. He had two children, who left messages addressed to their father. One read: \u201cI wish I could turn back time to at least tell you I love you one last time. I will try to be a better daughter and sister, so please don\u2019t worry about us.\u201d The other read: \u201cYou were a good dad. Thank you for taking care of us.\u201d Friends and colleagues leaving flowers at the roadside described Carreido as a \u201cvery happy man\u201d who was \u201calways helping people\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s so horrible for the family,\u201d one said. Prof Andy Hardy, the chief executive of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust, said staff were shocked and saddened by Carreido\u2019s death. \u201cJoel\u2019s passion for caring for others shone through in everything he did and he left a lasting impression on the patients and families he came into contact with,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile his work was a huge source of pride, it was evident to everyone who knew Joel that the role he enjoyed the most was being a loving husband and a father to his two cherished children. Joel will be sorely missed by us all and our thoughts are with his friends and family at this difficult time.\u201d Barry Dean, 76, who owns the house on Beckbury Road that the driver crashed into shortly after hitting Carreido, said he was watching football in his living room on Sunday morning when he heard a loud bang outside, and by the time he unlocked his front door, the driver had fled. The crash removed a large chunk of the front wall of his house and he and his wife will have to live elsewhere while the damage is fixed. \u201cIt was all a bit of a shock \u2013 not what you expect on a Sunday morning,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ve got to move out, we\u2019ve got no gas or electric. But this is only bricks and mortar. It can be repaired. It\u2019s awful. I feel for them and their families.\u201d Gosford Street, where the two pedestrians were hit, is a 15-minute drive away through largely residential streets. By Monday the road, which runs through the Coventry University campus, had reopened and normal business resumed. One worker at a cafe on the street, which was closed on Sunday after police cordoned off the area, said the news of the deaths had \u201cmade her shudder\u201d and made the city feel unsafe. She said: \u201cWe had no idea people had died until we saw it in the news.\u201d She said she had seen sand piled in the street that she believed was to cover blood after the collision. The other pedestrian struck on Gosford Street was treated for injuries that were not life-threatening, West Midlands police said. The force said: \u201cOur thoughts are with the families and friends of those who have tragically lost their lives, and we\u2019ll be doing all we can to support them during this deeply distressing time. We\u2019re not looking for anyone else in connection with what happened, and from the information we have, this is not being treated as terror-related.\u201d"

            "title": "Women in Afghanistan are fighting an unequal war. We need your support | Zahra Joya",
            "date": "2023-09-06T07:00:51Z",
            "content": "We suddenly all woke in the middle of the night. A piercing cry came from the corner of our room. It was my teenage sister, sobbing in the little room we rent in London. She always used to sleep in the same bed as my mother \u2013 until the fall of Kabul. She wasn\u2019t used to sleeping alone. That night, early in spring, she sobbed until dawn. Her pain was obvious: separation from my mother and a longing that became chronically painful for us all. Since our exile, I have been playing the role of mother, thousands of miles from our parents. Afghanistan\u2019s fall was not just the takeover of a country, but the separation of its people, including thousands of teenagers like my sister. The fall is also the story of a mother\u2019s comfort, now missing for my sister and me. We miss her arms and the bed we could share, the food she cooked. When the Taliban took over again in Afghanistan, countless lives were transformed in horrible and distressing ways. We were catapulted to another country, with a culture and language so different it felt like another planet. Although being away from parents is exhausting, I still reassure my sister that, as Hazara girls and women, we are the lucky ones who now live in a safe and free country. There are young girls who were forced into marriages inside Afghanistan, and millions of girls have been deprived of basic rights. Migration is a path that leads to a new world, one full of challenges and opportunities, but it comes at a cost. The feeling of loneliness and distance from family and friends does not leave you for a second. On 24 August 2021, when I was forced into exile, I had never thought about the difficulties of living away from home and family. I didn\u2019t have time to think because we were all so confused about what had just occurred. But now, two years into exile, I am only in touch with my mother through WhatsApp; it\u2019s a strange thing but it has become a familiar practice now. When I see my mother\u2019s face, I can\u2019t hold back tears at the deep lines that have settled on her face. In those wrinkles, I see the pain and suffering of the separation of a mother from her loved ones. I weep afterwards. Reviewing two years of Taliban rule in Afghanistan is full of despair and darkness. The first question is how the Taliban managed to create the first gender apartheid system in front of the world. How was this possible? Why have the women of Afghanistan been abandoned? What happened to those promises that the international community touted all the time? Today, millions of school-age girls are deprived of education by the Taliban, made possible by the infamous peace deal that the US agreed with the Taliban in Qatar. Today, the universities are closed to women and girls. The opportunity to work has been taken from tens of thousands of women who were breadwinners and heads of their families. Women\u2019s access to health centres is limited, and the heavy burden of poverty and hunger is backbreaking. The Taliban have excluded women from public life. Can you picture 50% of the population completely isolated in every sense? Why do we Afghan women pay the price for the Taliban\u2019s return? Afghanistan\u2019s women now have to fight for something basic: the right to leave the house, to go to school and to parks, to get a job. When I founded Rukhshana Media, I never imagined such a dark day. I feel hopeless \u2013 not because I don\u2019t have the will to fight, but when I try to describe and draw attention to this exceptional human condition. During these two years of Taliban rule, I have received images of mutilated bodies of women and men tortured and killed by the Taliban forces. I could never have imagined such violence. In these two years, we at Rukhshana have written and reported on the pain of protesting women who were flogged by Taliban fighters. We have written about the murder and disappearance of policewomen who, with the support of the west after 9/11, fought against inequalities in a patriarchal society and made room for themselves in the system. In these past two years, it seems that the vast majority of Afghan men support women\u2019s education, but this consensus has never been utilised as a means of mobilising people against the unacceptable situation under the Taliban. Women are left alone in their fight against the Taliban. The Taliban regime does not look at women\u2019s situation as a national issue, and international human rights institutions do not take action beyond publishing statements and reports. As part of our research at Rukhshana Media, we examined the devastating effects of shutting schools to girls. Our findings showed girls suffering severe psychological problems. Suicide, femicide, forced marriage and domestic violence have increased drastically. It is hard to understand the depths of this darkness, and international human rights organisations seem oblivious to these issues. We live in a turbulent world. War, violence, natural disasters, fear and anxiety have become integral to our lives. From the earthquake in Turkey and the devastating floods in Pakistan to the war and violence in the Middle East and Ukraine, life has become bitter and unbearable for many. The number of displaced people in the world increases every day; hunger and economic crisis lurk even in the world\u2019s largest economies. However, women in Afghanistan are fighting a full-scale and unequal war. We need your support, just as the people of Ukraine want your support in their battle against the Russian invasion. Please do not leave Afghan women to suffer and fight alone. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2023-09-26T07:10:15Z",
            "content": "Crucial tests and results from scans and blood tests may have been missed by patients after a NHS hospital trust failed to send out 24,000 letters from senior doctors due to a new computer system. The BBC reported that when letters from staff at the Newcastle hospitals foundation NHS trust had to be signed off from a senior doctor they were placed into a folder few staff knew existed and remained unsent. The majority of the letters explained what should happen when patients were discharged from hospital but a significant number were written by specialist clinics spelling out care that was needed for patients, the broadcaster reported. Some of the letters would have been sent to GPs. Dr George Rae, a GP and chair of the North East BMA Council, told the BBC there would be \u201can incredible amount of information\u201d within the letters. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t get the letters, you wouldn\u2019t have the results of scans and X-rays or blood tests,\u201d he said. He said GPs would be \u201cabsolutely unaware\u201d of a change in medication or treatment if a patient had gone to hospital and received a significant diagnosis. Staff have been told to record any subsequent cases of patient harm. The issue emerged after the health and social care regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) conducted a review when staff at the trust raised concerns about delays in sending out correspondence. Martin Wilson, Newcastle hospitals\u2019 chief operating officer, said the trust was \u201ctaking immediate steps to address the issue\u201d. \u201cWe sincerely apologise for any anxiety or inconvenience this may cause,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any concerns are identified, we will inform patients and their GPs directly. We are taking this issue very seriously and are working quickly to put things right.\u201d The CQC said it was monitoring the trust closely and could inspect it at any time if it had concerns. Sarah Dronsfield, CQC\u2019s interim director of operations for the North Network, said: \u201cWe inspected several core services at Newcastle upon Tyne NHS trust in June and July 2023 as part of our routine inspection activity. \u201cFollowing that inspection, in September 2023, CQC received concerns from trust staff about risks to patient safety caused by delays in sending out patient correspondence. \u201cWe took immediate action to request further detail from the trust to understand the extent to which people may be at risk, and evidence of the steps being taken to review the impact on patients, ensure people are safe and mitigate any risk of avoidable delays in treatment going forward. \u201cThe trust has submitted an action plan and volunteered to provide weekly updates on its progress against that plan. We have received assurance to address our immediate concerns. \u201cHowever, the trust remains subject to close monitoring, and we can inspect at any time should our monitoring reveal heightened concerns or the need for further action. We will report on the full findings from our latest inspection and any areas where the trust has been required to make improvements as soon as we are able to. \u201cIf anyone has any concerns about the care they have received they can let us know directly via Give Feedback on Care.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-21T01:13:11Z",
            "content": "Anthony Albanese has announced a Covid-19 inquiry to consider commonwealth responses to the pandemic but excluding \u201cactions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments\u201d. On Thursday, the prime minister announced the one-year inquiry will be headed by epidemiologist professor Catherine Bennett, health economist Dr Angela Jackson, and the former director general of the NSW health department Robyn Kruk. The scope and powers of the inquiry have already sparked a war of words with the opposition, which has warned it is \u201ca complete waste of time\u201d if states cannot be compelled to give evidence, a criticism Albanese dismissed as \u201cabsurd\u201d. At a press conference in Adelaide, Albanese repeatedly deflected questions about whether the inquiry will have compulsory powers, telling reporters that seeking \u201cconflict\u201d is \u201ccompletely contrary\u201d to its aims. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The proposed scope of the inquiry includes \u201cthe role of the commonwealth, responsibilities of state and territory governments, [and] national governance mechanisms\u201d, including the national cabinet. Potential topics for the inquiry include: vaccine supply; \u201cbroader health supports for people affected by Covid-19 and/or lockdowns\u201d; financial support for individuals, industry and business; community supports; international policies to support Australians at home and abroad; and \u201cmechanisms to better target future responses to the needs of particular populations\u201d including First Nations Australians. But the scope excludes \u201cactions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments\u201d \u2013 which would exclude state border closures and could exclude the length and severity of lockdown restrictions \u2013 and \u201cinternational programs and activities assisting foreign countries\u201d. Asked if the length of lockdowns will be considered, Albanese told reporters the three inquiry heads \u201ccan look at whatever they like\u201d. \u201cThat is point of an independent inquiry.\u201d Albanese said he wanted a \u201cprocess of learning from the pandemic [that] is constructive, rather than destructive\u201d. \u201cWe need to make sure that this is forward focused and consider all of the commonwealth responses to the pandemic.\u201d Asked if participation will be compulsory including by state leaders, Albanese said \u201cI should imagine that everyone will want to participate in this\u201d. The inquiry will run for 12 months, with a final report to be delivered by 30 September 2024. Albanese explained a shorter inquiry was favoured because \u201ca lot of the work has already been done, there have been 20 different inquiries\u201d. Albanese confirmed that premiers and chief ministers had been briefed about the proposal at the last national cabinet and had \u201cwelcomed\u201d the idea. Despite Albanese promising a royal commission \u201cor similar inquiry\u201d ahead of the election, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, accused him of a \u201csignificant broken promise\u201d on Thursday. Dutton said that Australians would be \u201cstunned\u201d to learn that premiers \u201cwho were responsible for lockdowns\u201d were excluded from the inquiry, which he labelled a \u201cprotection racket for [Victorian premier] Daniel Andrews and [Queensland premier] Annastacia Palaszczuk\u201d. The shadow health minister, Anne Ruston, said the inquiry was \u201ca witch-hunt against a previous Coalition government\u201d and \u201ca copout\u201d because of the exclusion of states and territories. \u201cMany of the decisions that were made during the pandemic by the states and territories are the ones that probably impacted Australians the most,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether that be the lockdowns, border closures, mandates and the like which all had a very significant impact on Australians.\u201d Earlier, Albanese rejected the criticism the inquiry would protect Labor premiers as \u201cabsurd\u201d, noting that the Liberals were in government in South Australia, New South Wales and Tasmania. Albanese told FIVEaa radio the government opted for an inquiry rather than a royal commission because the latter \u201ccan take more time\u201d and is \u201cnormally headed by a judge\u201d. \u201cThe advice we have received is that this is the best form of inquiry,\u201d he said. Andrews said a Covid-19 inquiry was a \u201cvery good thing to be doing\u201d. He suggested it should examine improvements to the national medical stockpile, supplies of vaccines and personal protective equipment, which are mostly commonwealth responsibilities. \u201cI think what is most important is to have that really important forward focused planning work, so what did we learn?\u201d \u201cCan we avoid not having enough vaccines when we need them?\u201d The former commonwealth deputy chief medical officer, Nick Coatsworth, suggested the inquiry should focus on the \u201cproportionality\u201d of governments\u2019 responses to Covid-19."

            "date": "2023-09-17T06:00:53Z",
            "content": "The \u201cbox office\u201d inquisitions that will bring Rishi Sunak, Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings before the Covid-19 inquiry have been shunted back a month until November to prevent them clashing with the political conference season. The eagerly awaited appearances of those in charge of the pandemic response will lay bare tensions and disagreements at the heart of government, including over the severity and timing of lockdowns, the rushed contracts awarded for huge amounts of personal protective equipment (PPE), school closures and policies such as Sunak\u2019s \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme. The inquiry also wants to understand the culture that was allowed to develop in Downing Street and Whitehall at the time, which ultimately led to the Partygate scandal. The second, and most eagerly awaited, part of the inquiry on \u201ccore UK decision making and political governance\u201d had been expected to see the key political leaders summoned early next month. But such is the anticipated interest, and potential for political fallout, that it was decided to delay their appearances by several weeks in order not to disrupt or torpedo the conferences, and also so that the likes of Sunak would not have competing demands for their time. Instead, the current and former prime ministers, Sunak and Johnson, as well as Johnson\u2019s former adviser Cummings and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, will now be called to give evidence in November, probably around the time of the king\u2019s speech on 7 November \u2013 when Tory strategists had been hoping to in effect relaunch the Sunak premiership in the run-up to a general election \u2013 or the autumn financial statement on 22 November. All the main participants have been sent long lists of written questions to answer before their appearances in the witness box. The inquiry has also demanded to see other information, including emails and WhatsApp messages, to gain the fullest picture of what was going on in government at the time. A total of 150 questions was sent to Johnson by the inquiry, which is chaired by the former high court judge Heather Hallett. One, which is bound to form a key part of verbal questioning, asks: \u201cWhy did you not attend any Cobra meetings in relation to Covid-19 prior to 2 March 2020, given the seriousness of the emergency?\u201d By this stage, with the Covid virus spreading across the world, Johnson had failed to turn up to a single meeting of the special emergency committee on the unfolding crisis. Another, on an issue potentially more problematic for Sunak, was: \u201cWhat discussions did you have with the then chancellor about the Eat Out to Help Out scheme prior to its implementation in August 2020?\u201d The scheme, which offered financial incentives for people to go out to restaurants again, cost \u00a3850m and was subsequently linked to a jump in Covid cases that autumn. No epidemiologist was officially consulted on the scheme beforehand. Last summer, Prof John Edmunds of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was a member of the Sage committee of advisers to ministers, told the Observer that the scheme had been a \u201cspectacularly stupid idea and an obscene way to spend public money\u201d."

            "content": "Public health and legal experts have expressed disappointment at the narrow scope of the Covid-19 inquiry, with the Australian Medical Association president, Steve Robson, labelling it \u201chalf an inquiry\u201d and warning the exclusion of states will \u201chobble\u201d it. On Thursday Anthony Albanese revealed the inquiry would exclude \u201cactions taken unilaterally by state and territory governments\u201d, which the human rights commissioner, Lorraine Finlay, warned could \u201cdeflect responsibility\u201d for some aspects of Australia\u2019s pandemic response. The scope and powers of the inquiry have already sparked a war of words with the Coalition, with shadow health minister, Anne Ruston, labelling it a \u201ccop-out\u201d and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, accusing Labor of running a \u201cprotection racket\u201d for state premiers. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The prime minister rejected the criticism as \u201cabsurd\u201d but deflected questions about whether the inquiry would have the power to compel premiers to appear, telling reporters that seeking \u201cconflict\u201d is \u201ccompletely contrary\u201d to its aims. Robson said that \u201clooking at half the equation will hobble the ultimate inquiry\u201d. \u201cSo much of the healthcare delivery and pandemic response was done by the states and territories \u2026 [that] a wide-ranging system-wide inquiry would make more sense,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere will be another pandemic, no doubt about it. We need to be ready to go next time. \u201cI\u2019m scratching my head how it can come up with a meaningful plan if you take states and territories out of the equation.\u201d Finlay welcomed the inquiry but said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d the terms of reference did not include an explicit reference to the human rights impacts of the pandemic response. \u201cThe terms focus on the direct health and economic impacts \u2013 human rights is the missing part of that,\u201d she said. \u201cSchool closures, border closures, vaccine mandates, curfews and lockdowns \u2013 these all had not just health and economic impacts, but a significant human rights impact.\u201d Asked about the exclusion of state actions, Finlay said: \u201cAustralia is a federation and we need an inquiry that reflects that. We know during the pandemic actions of state and federal governments \u2013 separately and in combination \u2013 had a really significant impact. \u201cWe need to examine state and federal actions at the same time rather than attempt to deflect responsibility. \u201cThe pandemic itself showed it can be confusing about which level of government is responsible for the response. A review that doesn\u2019t allow us to consider that isn\u2019t properly reflective of Australia\u2019s experience.\u201d Finlay also noted it \u201cisn\u2019t clear\u201d whether the inquiry would hold public hearings, which would be important to ensure \u201cthe voices of Australians are heard\u201d. The infectious diseases physician Prof Peter Collignon agreed it was \u201cproblematic if [the inquiry] can\u2019t look at what states did in Australia\u201d, particularly because of the difficulty making international comparisons. \u201cNew South Wales was criticised for not going harder with restrictions, like Victoria, but NSW has done better if you look at excess deaths or Covid deaths,\u201d he said. \u201cQueensland allowed people outside more but border lockdowns impacted people in northern NSW. \u201cYes, we need restrictions but how hard do you go? If you exclude looking at variations around Australia \u2013 that makes it very difficult to judge public health settings.\u201d Prof Nancy Baxter, a clinical epidemiologist and the head of the University of Melbourne school of population and global health, said she understood the government did not \u201cwant this to be bigger than Ben Hur but we are likely to miss important learnings\u201d. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said it was \u201cdifficult to rationalise\u201d the exclusion of states\u2019 actions. \u201cIf the purpose of the commonwealth inquiry is to identify lessons learned to improve Australia\u2019s preparedness for future pandemics, then excluding unilateral state actions is a major oversight to say the least,\u201d Willox said. \u201cWhile this inquiry is at one level very welcome, it falls short of the root and branch review that is required to ensure that governments work cohesively and respond holistically during the next inevitable pandemic.\u201d The narrow approach has been defended by epidemiologist Prof Catherine Bennett, one of the three independent reviewers, and Prof Allen Cheng, the director infectious diseases at Monash Health and a former senior Victorian health department official. Bennett told Sky News that states had already held inquiries and the commonwealth inquiry would \u201cpull all of that together, rather than look at the particular parts of this, to take a systems approach\u201d. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t up to us to set the terms of reference of this,\u201d she said. \u201cStates have actually at varying stages been doing their own reviews \u2013 so it\u2019s not necessary to reproduce or duplicate that work, but it is important to consider how it all worked nationally.\u201d Cheng said he thought it was correct to examine the federal government\u2019s response because it would be a future federal government to respond to a pandemic. \u201cAnd then the state responses are best left with the states,\u201d he said, citing the fact NSW Health had already conducted a review with 106 recommendations."

            "content": "The UK economy made a faster recovery from the Covid pandemic than previously estimated, according to revisions to official figures revealing a stronger performance than Germany and France. In a boost for Rishi Sunak before the Conservative party conference in Manchester beginning this weekend, revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed gross domestic product was 1.8% above pre-pandemic levels at the end of the second quarter this year. In August, the ONS had estimated the economy was still 0.2% below the level at the end of 2019 before the global health emergency triggered one of the deepest recessions on record. The changes mean the UK economy is no longer the worst performer in the G7. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cWe know that the British economy recovered faster from the pandemic than anyone previously thought, and data out today once again proves the doubters wrong.\u201d The ONS said growth in the first quarter of 2023 was revised up to 0.3% from an earlier estimate of 0.1%, while its estimate for growth in the second quarter was unchanged at 0.2%. Growth was also faster than expected last year. GDP is now estimated to have increased by 4.3% in 2022, revised from a first estimate of 4.1%. Momentum is, however, beginning to stall as the UK economy grapples with higher interest rates from the Bank of England and stubbornly high inflation weighing on businesses and households amid growing fears of a recession. Sandra Horsfield, of the investment bank Investec, said: \u201cWe see little in today\u2019s numbers to derail our expectation of a more challenging growth picture ahead: we continue to forecast that the UK economy will enter a recession over the winter months.\u201d Ruth Gregory, the deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cWe still think that higher interest rates will trigger a mild recession involving a 0.5% fall in GDP in the coming quarters.\u201d Business surveys show private sector activity collapsed in September at the fastest rate, outside the Covid pandemic, since the financial crisis. Millions of households are braced for a sharp jump in mortgage payments, while inflation remains at the highest level in the G7, and taxes have risen by the most in any parliament since the 1950s \u2013 hitting consumer spending power. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s economy remains trapped in a low-growth, high-tax cycle after 13 years of economic mismanagement under the Conservatives.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-13T01:09:57Z",
            "content": "Qantas has lost its high court bid to overturn a ruling that it illegally outsourced 1,700 ground handler jobs. On Wednesday the high court unanimously upheld a full federal court decision exposing the embattled airline to a mammoth compensation bill for laying off staff at 10 airports in November 2020. The Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary, Michael Kaine, told reporters in Canberra it will now seek \u201csignificant\u201d compensation and penalties in the federal court for the \u201clargest sacking found to be illegal\u201d in Australian history. In July 2021 the federal court ruled Qantas\u2019s outsourcing of the workers was in part driven by a desire to avoid industrial action, which is a breach of the Fair Work Act. The decision is a major win for the TWU, which was supported in the case by an intervention from workplace relations minister Tony Burke. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Ahead of the high court decision Kaine, said the outsourcing decision was part of outgoing chief executive Alan Joyce\u2019s \u201cspiteful management style\u201d that had damaged the airline\u2019s reputation. The union cited complaints increasing by 70% in 2022 amid high cancellations, delays and lost baggage. The TWU responded to the result by calling for a public apology from Qantas and for the chairman, Richard Goyder, and the entire board to be replaced by new directors, including a worker representative. \u201cQantas workers have made history today,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cIt has been three years and 20 days since Alan Joyce first announced the decision to outsource these workers, and they have not stopped fighting for a moment to ensure justice was served. \u201cThe final act of this board should be to strip Alan Joyce of his bonuses and follow him out the door. \u201cThe Joyce regime has been toppled, but the airline cannot achieve the reset necessary for its survival under the same board that resided over the largest case of illegal sackings in Australian corporate history. Richard Goyder cannot make it through another day as chair.\u201d In the majority judgment, chief justice Susan Kiefel and justices Stephen Gageler, Jacqueline Gleeson and Jayne Jagot said the meaning of the Act was \u201creadily ascertainable\u201d, rejecting Qantas\u2019 claim it had not taken unlawful \u201cadverse action\u201d because workers did not yet have the right to take industrial action when they were sacked. \u201cNo such temporal confinement appears\u201d in the law, they said. They noted earlier court findings that although Qantas \u201chad sound commercial reasons for the outsourcing decision\u201d, it was also taken \u201cto prevent the affected employees from exercising workplace rights to organise and engage in protected industrial action and to participate in bargaining\u201d. In submissions to the high court, the union had warned that overturning the federal court\u2019s decision would create \u201cuncertainty\u201d about accessing workplace rights and water down protections against other forms of discrimination. Qantas had claimed the outsourcing was a necessary financial measure that could save it $100m annually and reduce future spending on ground handling equipment such as tugs and baggage loaders. In a statement Qantas said it \u201cacknowledges and accepts\u201d the high court decision. \u201cAs we have said from the beginning, we deeply regret the personal impact the outsourcing decision had on all those affected and we sincerely apologise for that,\u201d it said. Qantas explained it took the outsourcing decision in August 2020 \u201cwhen borders were closed, lockdowns were in place and no Covid vaccine existed\u201d in a bid to \u201cimprove its ability to survive and ultimately recover\u201d. The Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, said that in addition to the high court verdict, the \u201ccourt of public opinion\u201d had turned on Qantas, which now needs to \u201crestore respect\u201d for its customers and workforce. Qantas has been under scrutiny for failing to refund flight credits accrued during the pandemic, which is the subject of a class action, and allegedly cancelling flights as part of a strategy to hoard slots at major airports, for which the competition regulator is seeking penalties of $600m. McManus and Kaine urged the Senate crossbench to pass Labor\u2019s closing loopholes industrial relations bill, which McManus argued could stop sackings at their \u201csource\u201d by requiring that workers of labour hire entities are paid the same as those on a workplace pay deal."

            "date": "2023-09-25T23:01:19Z",
            "content": "Wealthier children experienced the steepest decline in mental health during the pandemic, research suggests. Children\u2019s mental health worsened across the board in the UK during the pandemic. But those whose parents were highly educated, employed, stayed together and had high incomes suffered sharper falls in mental health than those who were less well off. The findings, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, show the gap between the mental health of the poorest and richest children narrowed during the pandemic. The authors of the research cited a range of potential reasons for their findings. One was parents juggling highly paid work with looking after children and educating them while schools were closed. \u201cThis strain, which has been linked to parent distress levels, may plausibly have been greatest for families with employed parents who needed to balance childcare against their paid work,\u201d they said. \u201cMoreover, the intense pressures and increased risk of Covid infection faced by essential (key) workers in this period may have placed further strain on some families with employed parents. \u201cFor example, studies in Brazil and Bangladesh have shown that children whose parents worked in essential roles, and were unable to work from home, experienced worse mental health during the pandemic. \u201cWe speculate that these excess pressures faced by some working parents, who were required to balance childcare and paid work during the pandemic, may have contributed to the poorer mental health of children with employed parents during the pandemic compared with before.\u201d The study looked at data for 9,272 children as part of the UK Household Longitudinal Study. The mental health of young people was reported by parents using a standardised questionnaire when the children were aged five to eight between 2011 and 2019. Details of mental health were also recorded when they were aged five to 11 in July 2020, September 2020 and March 2021 \u2013 all during the pandemic. The results showed that wealthier children experienced steeper declines in their mental health during the pandemic than more disadvantaged children, who tended to have lower mental health to begin with. For example, the average difference in child scores between those whose parents were unemployed compared with those whose parents were employed was 2.35 points before the pandemic but fell to 0.02 points during the pandemic \u2013 meaning the inequalities narrowed. The researchers cautioned that there were limitations to their research, but added: \u201cOur study provides evidence that trends in child mental health have continued to worsen during the pandemic. \u201cUnexpectedly, in many cases children from traditionally advantaged groups saw larger declines than children from disadvantaged groups \u2013 that is, child mental health has become more equal but at a worse overall level. \u201cThe pattern is contrary to predictions from some child health experts that the financial and emotional strain of lockdowns would fall hardest on children with parents in unstable employment, living in overcrowded housing, with less access to outdoor space and educational resources. \u201cWe speculate that social isolation and reduced access to services during the Covid-19 pandemic brought the experiences of traditionally advantaged groups closer to those already faced by children from disadvantaged backgrounds, and/or that emergency income support measures during the pandemic may have eased the economic burden for disadvantaged families.\u201d A separate report, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, suggests the poorest third of families in England will see almost no direct benefit from the government\u2019s new expanded childcare entitlements. By September 2025, children in working families will be entitled to up to 30 hours a week of funded term-time care from the age of nine months until the start of school \u2013 a dramatic scaling up from the current provision which provides funded places for three- and four-year-olds in working families. However, the policy expansion continues the trend of neglecting families in the bottom 30% of income distribution, the IFS said. So while the new offer will benefit overall just over half of parents with a child aged between nine months and two years, that will include just a fifth of families earning less than \u00a320,000 a year, but four-fifths of families with household incomes above \u00a345,000. A government spokesperson said: \u201cAs well as announcing the biggest ever expansion to free childcare for working parents, we have also almost doubled childcare support for the most financially vulnerable and by 2027-28 we expect to be spending \u00a38bn a year to help parents with affordable childcare.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-21T15:00:04Z",
            "content": "Secondary school pupils in the UK experienced significantly higher rates of depression, social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, and overall worse mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic, research shows. Cases of depression among secondary school pupils aged 11 to 13 rose by 8.5% during the pandemic compared with a 0.3% increase for the same cohort prior to Covid, according to a comparative study by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s psychiatry department. The researchers found that girls\u2019 mental health deteriorated more than that of boys during the pandemic. Girls were also more likely to find the return to full-time schooling difficult. The students who were most resilient during the pandemic were those with plenty of social interaction and support, including a supportive school environment, good relationships at home and a friend to turn to for support during lockdowns. Even partial school attendance during lockdown put students in a better place to adjust to returning to school full-time than no attendance at all, the study found. Willem Kuyken, the study\u2019s lead and professor of mindfulness and psychological science at Oxford\u2019s department of psychiatry, said: \u201cThis study shows that to promote better mental health and adjustment among young people, we need policies that foster home connectedness, friendship and a positive school climate and consider young people\u2019s individual differences, needs and vulnerabilities. Also we can see that full school closures should be avoided to protect the adjustment of young people.\u201d Kuyken said more research was required \u201cto understand both what places young people at risk and what protects them under challenging circumstances\u201d. The study showed that cases of significant social, emotional and behavioural difficulties increased by 7.9% for teenagers during the pandemic, compared with 3.5% for those before, while general poor mental health increased by 12.8%, compared with 4.5% before. The researchers found that students who had a poor school environment but a supportive family life had improved outcomes during the pandemic, while those with the reverse struggled more. While other research has suggested that mental health declined during the pandemic, this study is the first to use a comparison to pinpoint the effect on mental health of successive lockdowns, and shed light on the risk factors. The pupils involved in the study were recruited when they were aged between 11 and 13, and then had their mental health and wellbeing assessed at four different time points over three years. More than 6,300 pupils participated in the research during the pandemic, with the final follow-up taking place in spring 2021, while 864 students were assessed before the pandemic, with final data collected in autumn 2019. The project is funded by Wellcome and is a partnership between the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, the University of Exeter, King\u2019s College London and University College London."

            "content": "Qatar Airways says the Australian government\u2019s decision to block its request for extra flights was \u201cvery unfair\u201d given the airline\u2019s support for Australians during the pandemic. The airline\u2019s bid to fly an extra 21 services into Australia\u2019s major airports was rejected with ministers citing a range of reasons including it being contrary to the national interest. Qatar Airways chief executive, Akbar Al Baker, told CNN he was \u201cvery surprised\u201d when the request was blocked. His comments were made while welcoming the US government\u2019s decisions to approve more Qatar flights in the country. \u201cWe found it to be very unfair [for] our legitimate request to be not granted, especially at a time when we were so supportive of Australia,\u201d Al Baker said. \u201c[We were] repatriating their stranded citizens from around the world to and out of Australia, helping them receiving medical supplies and spare parts etc during the Covid period,\u201d Al Baker said. \u201cThe national carrier and its partners completely stopped operating in Australia. We were there for the people of Australia.\u201d During the pandemic, some of Qatar\u2019s flights to Australia arrived with just 20 seats filled but services continued while the Qantas fleet was grounded. According to Prof Rico Merkert from the University of Sydney, Qatar temporarily became Australia\u2019s \u201cde facto international airline\u201d. Al Baker\u2019s criticism comes days before a Senate committee holds public hearings to investigate why Qatar\u2019s request for extra flights was blocked, given the lack of competition in the aviation industry. Qantas former chief executive, Alan Joyce, has claimed that allowing Qatar the extra capacity would \u201cdistort\u201d the local aviation market. The chair of the inquiry, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie, has criticised the transport minister, Catherine King, for refusing to provide it with documents related to the Qatar decision. \u201cThere is a public interest in not disclosing such discussions so the government\u2019s negotiations over air services agreements with a range of countries can continue unimpeded,\u201d King said last week. McKenzie has accused the federal government of having a \u201ccosy, personal and political relationship\u201d with Qantas. King was contacted for comment. Al Baker told CNN he was aware of the Senate inquiry and was \u201calways hopeful\u201d the Australian government would listen to the airline\u2019s case and reassess its request. \u201cWe can never influence a government decision but the fact remains is that we were very surprised for getting these rights blocked or unapproved,\u201d Al Baker told CNN. McKenzie conceded the former Coalition government had knocked back Qatar Airways in the past and said the committee would look at previous decisions to help open up the aviation market. A broad chorus of aviation and travel industry groups have backed Qatar\u2019s bid for expanded capacity, with many desperate to increase international flight capacity and add more seat supply into the market to bring down air fares. State premiers have supported the flights as a boost to tourism and economic activity \u2013 some of the more generous estimates of this economic benefit put the value as high as $1bn from the extra flights. Virgin Australia \u2013 a partner airline of Qatar Airways \u2013 supported the extra flights. Former and current chiefs of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have also agreed the extra flights would put downward pressure on international air fares."

            "content": "Parents in Pakistan who refuse to get their children vaccinated against infectious diseases could be jailed or fined under a new law introduced in Sindh province. The introduction of the legislation is an attempt to eradicate polio, which is endemic in Pakistan, but will cover vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough (pertussis), measles, mumps and rubella. Parents who do not allow their children to be vaccinated could be sentenced to a month in prison and fined 50,000 Pakistani rupees (\u00a3130). The law, the first of its kind in the country, was signed last week and will come into force this month. Shazia Marri, a former federal minister of poverty alleviation and social safety from Sindh, said: \u201cThis law will be used as a deterrent to end the refusal of vaccination. There have to be some extraordinary measures to ensure this virus [polio] is eradicated from Pakistan.\u201d \u201cThere are multiple reasons that this virus still remains endemic in our country and we need to address all such reasons,\u201d she said. According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where polio is endemic. So far this year, Pakistan has registered two wild polio cases, compared with 20 in 2022. No cases have been reported in Sindh this year. However, more than 62,000 parents, most of them in Sindh province, refused polio vaccinations for their children during the countrywide polio vaccination campaign in January this year. Anti-vaccination sentiment in Pakistan is deeply rooted. Clerics have spread myths that vaccines are a western conspiracy to sterilise Muslim children. In some areas, vaccinators, who are usually women, have to be escorted by security guards for their safety. Some health workers have been killed. Junaid Khan, 36, a day labourer and father of five from eastern Karachi, said a law would not compel him to get his children vaccinated against polio. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust this vaccine. We see people involved in corruption and other major crimes are roaming free. Why is the government forcing us to vaccinate our children? I will prefer jail over protecting my children from the polio drops.\u201d Osama Malik, a legal expert in Pakistan, said people had been detained by police for refusing vaccines under the colonial criminal code. In 2015, authorities in the northern city of Peshawar arrested 471 parents for \u201cendangering public security\u201d by refusing the vaccines, but released them the same day. During the Covid pandemic, Sindh government employees who refused to be vaccinated against the virus were deducted a month\u2019s salary. Malik said the new law was \u201crather harsh\u201d, adding: \u201cIt would have been better if monetary inducements were given to the generally poor and semi-literate parents to encourage them to inoculate their children.\u201d However, he said the polio situation in Pakistan was \u201cquite dire, so the personal liberties of a few must take a back seat when it comes to protecting public health at large\u201d."

            "date": "2023-09-08T18:08:34Z",
            "content": "Ministers are facing urgent calls to consider widening the availability of Covid vaccines amid concerns that a new variant of the virus could put pressure on the NHS and cause more sickness in the workforce this winter. As new data appeared to show the Pirola variant spreading, Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay, the health secretary, were urged to rethink their decision to restrict vaccines to people aged 65 and over and vulnerable groups. A group of MPs wrote to the prime minister on Friday warning that the NHS may struggle to cope with another winter of high numbers of Covid cases, while one leading virologist said the health service was in for a \u201crocky ride\u201d and called to a return to jabs for over-50s. Members of the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus, led by Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP, called on Sunak to consider extending the booster programme this autumn to more groups, such as people aged 50 to 64, and to help make the Covid jab publicly available to buy privately, like the flu vaccine. Scientists have noted the high number of mutations that the new variant BA.2.86 carries, which raises the possibility that it could evade the immune system more easily or be more transmissible. In a briefing note on Friday, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said an outbreak at a care home in Norfolk and other cases across the UK indicated there was likely to be community transmission of the strain, but said it was too early to judge the full extent of its spread. The NHS is launching its autumn Covid vaccine programme this Monday, with residents of elderly care homes and people who are housebound the first to get the offer of jabs. From Monday 18 September, over-65s and people who are clinically vulnerable, carers and those living with people who are immunosuppressed will start to be invited for vaccines. The government brought forward the vaccine programme by a month in response to the BA.2.86 variant but did not widen the eligibility criteria, saying it would follow the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Moran said: \u201cAs the government have been flexible about moving the date, they should also consider widening the groups it should be available to.\u201d She said two of the main arguments for more boosters, such as for the over-50s, and allowing GPs to recommend people on a case-by-case basis, were reducing pressure on the NHS and helping the economy by having fewer people off sick with the virus or from long Covid. \u201cOur argument is that the government is being a bit cavalier and thinking this is just going to be fine,\u201d Moran said. \u201cIt also does not make any sense to us that the vaccines will be available to buy in the US but not in the UK. I think a lot of people would want the option and it\u2019s not clear at the moment why it\u2019s not available here.\u201d Steve McCabe, a Labour MP and vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on access to medicines, also said there was a case for extending the vaccine rollout to include over-50s and a number of other groups. \u201cWe should be focusing on older people, and yes of course on vulnerable people, but perhaps it should also include workers from groups who are likely to come into contact with the public,\u201d he said. Joan Twelves, of Covid Action, a grassroots campaign group, said anyone who wanted the vaccine should be able to take it up. Pharma industry sources say Covid jabs will not be available privately in the UK until 2024 at the earliest. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, said the government should \u201cabsolutely\u201d extend the eligibility of Covid vaccines to over-50s, and also consider offering them to all adults. He said the UK faced a \u201crocky ride\u201d this winter amid growing concerns over new variants, and ministers should reverse their decision to deny boosters to under-65s. \u201cWe\u2019re heading into a very uncertain time as evidenced by the recent upsurge in various variants of concern. I just don\u2019t understand for the life of me why this is any different to autumn 2022 when all over-50s were offered an extra dose,\u201d he said. Young said he understood that the JCVI had taken cost-effectiveness into account when making its recommendations. \u201cBut I think amid all this uncertainty and unpredictability about Covid, it would make much more sense to give the vaccine to as wide a population as possible.\u201d He added: \u201cThe threat from Covid has not gone away. If anything, there\u2019s even more concern given the fact we\u2019ve got waning immunity. Many folks won\u2019t have had a vaccine for a year or so. We\u2019ve got new variants. I think we need to be protecting as many people as possible.\u201d Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher and lecturer in psychology at Swansea University, also called on ministers to reverse their decision to deny under-65s access to Covid jabs. \u201cExtending the Covid booster to over-50s would be a sensible precaution ahead of an uncertain winter,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the US, President Biden is encouraging all Americans to get an updated Covid-19 booster, in addition to an updated flu jab. It is right to prioritise those over 65 and clinically vulnerable, but in the UK the decision to limit to the over-65s only seems to have been made on too narrow a definition of cost-benefit. Cost-effectiveness, looked at from a broader perspective, is about more than just reducing deaths and hospitalisations.\u201d Dr Andrew Hill, a visiting research fellow in pharmacology at Liverpool University, said excluding the 12 million people aged 50-64 was shortsighted. \u201cThese vaccines are known to be effective against the new Covid variants. There is no other way for people aged 50-65 to access Covid vaccines in the UK, especially as it looks like people who want them will not after all be able to get them privately,\u201d he said. However, Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of East Anglia, said denying under-65s Covid jabs was the correct decision. \u201cIf you look at the ONS survey data back from April, the average number of infections that people in England had had then was over two infections per person since the start of the pandemic [and] it will be more now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo almost every one of us has survived one, and most of us have already survived multiple, Covid infections.\u201d Health sources said there were currently no plans to widen the availability of vaccines. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe have accelerated the autumn flu and Covid-19 vaccine programmes to ensure greater protection, support those at greatest risk of severe illness and reduce the potential impact on the NHS. \u201cThose most at risk from winter illness \u2013 including people in care homes for older people, the clinically vulnerable, those aged 65 and over, health and social care staff, and carers \u2013 will be able to access a Covid vaccine from next week.\u201d Steve Brine, the Conservative chair of parliament\u2019s health committee, said he thought it was right that the JCVI advice was being followed. \u201cThe commercial pharma companies need to look at this as a commercial opportunity and if they\u2019ve got a customer base then they need to meet that demand. If there\u2019s not a commercial basis then I refer you to JCVI advice. Other than doing a population-level vaccination programme, I don\u2019t know what the alternative really is. I wouldn\u2019t be making any different decision if I were in the government now,\u201d he said."

Here\u2019s a little of what we learned: Environmental groups have accused the Albanese government of recklessness and hypocrisy after it approved a major coalmine expansion in central Queensland. Australia\u2019s winter of 2023 has been the warmest since official records began in 1910, with average daily temperatures 1.53C above the long-term average. Partners at PwC Australia will see their salaries slashed by up to 30% due to an ongoing reputation crisis that has kept profits flat. The federal government will be responsible for enforcing new controls around the importation, manufacturing and advertising of vapes, as well as controls on therapeutic vapes. Qantas should pay a record-breaking penalty of more than $600m if the consumer watchdog is successful in its legal action against the airline, the ACCC chair said. The trade minister, Don Farrell, has wrapped up \u201cvery positive and productive\u201d talks with his European Union counterpart, Valdis Dombrovskis, following the breakdown in negotiations over agriculture matters in Brussels in July. The Victorian Liberals lost a senior shadow cabinet member, Matt Bach, as opposition leader John Pesutto prepares to advance a plan to cover the costs of looming legal action. Atagi has recommended that all adults aged 75 years and older should receive an additional 2023 Covid-19 vaccine dose if six months have passed since their last dose. Australian home values are up 4.9% since February, adding about $34,000 to the average dwelling. There\u2019s been a push to expand commonwealth assistance to university students. Thanks so much for your company this week. Have a lovely, safe weekend. More information about doctors to be publicly available The information available on the national public registers of health practitioners could be expanded to include practitioners\u2019 regulatory history in respect to any boundary violations in the course of practice or a criminal conviction for a sexual offence. Federal, state and territory health ministers agreed at this afternoon\u2019s meeting to develop a National Law Amendment Bill that would include reinstatement orders and information on violations on the national register. It comes as part of efforts to address concerns that allegations of boundary violations by health practitioners were not being managed adequately. \u201cHealth Ministers agree that the safety of patients and the community is paramount in accessing care, and that all allegations of misconduct must be dealt with appropriately and sensitively,\u201d according to a communique from the meeting. New national rules to regulate cosmetic surgery Federal and state and territory health ministers have also approved new rules to regulate cosmetic surgery to ensure better safety standards. An independent review into cosmetic surgery in Australia was commissioned by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) in 2021 after media reports revealed serious problems in the sector, and in 2022 the Australian Commission for Safety and Quality in Health Care was tasked to develop national licensing standards. At the meeting of all health ministers this afternoon, they approved the new National Safety and Quality Cosmetic Surgery Standards, and the National Licensing Framework for Cosmetic Surgery. State and territory governments will put in place these new regulatory powers within the licensing framework \u201cas soon as practical\u201d, according to a communique from the meeting. Additionally, a mechanism will be created between state and territory regulators, the federal government, and the Medical Board of Australia to support the framework. Health agencies will put in place the new Cosmetic Surgery Standards, and work to develop an accreditation process to better support safe care for clients and patients accessing cosmetic procedures. The federal government will be responsible for enforcing new controls around the importation, manufacturing and advertising of vapes, as well as controls on therapeutic vapes, while states and territories will be responsible for the point of wholesale and retail. The decision was made when the federal and state and territory health ministers met this afternoon as part of an update on the drafting of an implementation plan to support the National Response to Vaping. While this plan continues to be worked through, the ministers agreed to extend the operation of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to restrict the importation, manufacture and supply of all vapes. They also agreed that the involvement of police and law enforcement agencies would be critical in implementing the new vaping laws, and all health ministers will soon meet with police ministers. More on the background to this decision here: Makarrata commission has spent barely half the $900,000 allocated by Labor, documents show The federal Makarrata commission for truth-telling and treaty-making has so far spent just a small amount of the funds it was allocated by the government, newly released documents show, with the body focusing on research and talking with state governments about treaty processes already under way. It is the first look at the work of the Makarrata commission, a body requested by the Uluru statement from the heart and funded by the federal Labor government in its first budget last year, to oversee processes around treaty and truth-telling. While $900,000 was allocated to the commission by the National Indigenous Australians Agency, it has actually spent barely half that figure \u2013 despite its funding coming under heavy scrutiny by the Coalition opposition in recent parliamentary sittings. Read more here about what the documents, obtained by Guardian Australia after a freedom of information request to the NIAA, show: Tripping hazard thylacine sculptures find a new home in Launceston Tasmanian tiger sculptures removed from a city mall because they posed a tripping hazard will soon be installed in a new garden home, AAP reports. Launceston city council in March voted to shift the bronze thylacines commissioned in 2018 from Brisbane Street Mall to Civic Square. The sculptures, originally intended as children\u2019s play items, have proven divisive, with community members complaining they were a potential hazard. Several people have required medical treatment after tripping on them. In 2019, a woman said she fractured her thumb, grazed her hands and bruised her knees when she took a tumble. The Launceston mayor, Matthew Garwood, said the thylacines had also impacted the mall\u2019s functionality for events, such as the annual lighting of the Christmas tree. Garwood said installation of the sculptures in garden beds at Civic Square would be completed next week: A set of stencilled thylacine footprints and facts will also be placed in Civic Square, challenging children and those young at heart to find all the sculptures throughout the space. We know that the thylacine sculptures are particularly popular with young children, and we expect that will continue to be the case. The last real Tasmanian tiger died in 1936 in captivity in Hobart, with extensive hunting at the hands of colonists largely to blame for the species\u2019 extinction. Shocked Victorian Liberals ponder what\u2019s next after Bach \u2018massive loss\u2019 In less than a week the Victorian Liberal leadership went from heralding the \u201cnew dawn\u201d of a byelection win to facing an even newer dusk as it lost one of its most valued MPs. Matt Bach, the upper house MP seen as a future leader by many of his colleagues, shocked the party room on Thursday night when he announced he was quitting politics to move to the UK with his young family at the end of the year. Unlike the many Liberals before him who have left parliament for the greener, better-paying pastures of the corporate world, Bach is returning to his former profession, taking on a role as a teacher and assistant principal. While Bach maintains he made the decision \u201cpurely in the interests of his family\u201d and says he is confident the Coalition will win the 2026 state election without him, his departure is undeniably a huge blow to the Liberals. Read the full analysis here: The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) has recommended that all adults aged 75 years and older should receive an additional 2023 Covid-19 vaccine dose if six months have passed since their last dose. A release from the health minister Mark Butler\u2019s office this afternoon says the Australian government has accepted Atagi\u2019s advice. They\u2019ve also accepted a recommendation that adults aged 65 to 74 years, or those aged 18 to 64 years who are severely immunocompromised, should consider an additional dose if six months have passed since their last dose. Butler said: For other people who were advised to get a 2023 booster but haven\u2019t had one, it\u2019s not too late to come forward and get one. It is really important people remember Covid-19 is still with us, so I encourage people to keep following the vaccination advice of the experts on the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Following on from the previous post about the fight over 60-day medical prescriptions, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, told Guardian Australia today the foreshadowed disallowance motion was now unlikely but the junior Coalition partner would be closely watching the government\u2019s next steps. It\u2019s unlikely but we will keep our options open in terms of discussions we have with the guild and making sure they\u2019re satisfied with the intent in which the government is entering discussions with them today and over the coming days. The Liberal senator Anne Ruston, one of the disallowance motion movers last sitting fortnight, said the government had \u201cfinally listened\u201d and the Liberals would await its next steps. Littleproud added there\u2019s a lot of goodwill right now after the community agreement date was brought forward a year to 1 March 2024 but the \u201cdevil was in the details\u201d. If [the Pharmacy Guild] believes that there\u2019s genuine intent in terms of being able to get to a policy solution, then there\u2019s no need for us to inject ourselves into it, but we\u2019ll make that call over the coming couple of days. But obviously, if the government is entering this with the right intent, and not just trying to silence us from stopping, then yes, we\u2019ll take everyone in good faith. Senate fight over 60-day medical prescriptions quashed for now A looming fight in the Senate over 60-day medical prescriptions has been quashed for now after the federal government agreed to come to the negotiating table early with pharmacy groups. The dispensing changes mean patients can now get two months\u2019 worth of medicine in one visit, saving many hundreds of dollars each year. But the changes impact community pharmacies, the Pharmacy Guild says, which will now be expected to cover additional costs out of their own pocket. Last sitting fortnight, the Coalition attempted to force a disallowance motion in the Senate against the changes \u2013 which came into effect today \u2013 before backing out when it appeared they didn\u2019t have the numbers to pass. Coalition senators said they would attempt it again this sitting fortnight if the federal government didn\u2019t come to the negotiating table. However, the health minister, Mark Butler, announced on Friday morning the community pharmacy agreement would be brought forward by more than a year to 1 March 2024. For the next six months, pharmacies will still be affected by the changes without the requested additional support but the Coalition is still chalking it up as a win. The ACT senator David Pocock has also welcomed the move as a \u201cconstructive step after a difficult period\u201d. PwC Australia staff get $47m in bonuses while partners get pay cuts There\u2019s a couple more interesting nuggets in the latest disclosure from PwC Australia. Despite the flat profit result last financial year, the firm has given staff bonuses worth a combined $47m. The firm also suspended its mid-year partner intake, but stressed this was \u201ca prudent decision in light of current circumstances\u201d and not a reflection on the calibre of candidates. Here\u2019s the statement: These candidates will be welcomed to the partnerships at a later date. The firm\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Burrowes, has also thanked the 1,500 staff and partners who will move across to the new spinoff, Scyne, once the transaction is completed later this month: For those moving across to Scyne Advisory, this is an opportunity to join Australia\u2019s first advisory practice dedicated exclusively to government engagement and be part of an exciting new entity. And the internal review, conducted by the former Telstra boss Ziggy Switkowski, will be released later this month. This will be closely examined by the federal government and a Senate committee still investigating consultants. Weak housing numbers as economists turn attention to GDP data dump House prices might be on the way up across the nation but it\u2019s not yet turning up in the housing loan figures, mostly because transactions are down. New loans for housing fell 1.2% in July and are down more than 14% from a year ago, the Australian Bureau of Statistics says. Owner-occupiers were the main reason for the contraction, sliding 1.9% in the month, with loans taken out for housing by investors off just 0.1%. Still, lending to owner-occupiers is about 6% higher than at its nadir earlier in 2023, with investor lending up 12% from its lows, CBA says. Investor activity is strongest in NSW and Queensland (which is partly why Sydney and Brisbane dwelling prices are leading the rebounds). Data on longsuffering first home buyers was not available \u201cdue to data-reporting issues\u201d, the ABS said. (Ignorance probably not being bliss in this case.) Economists, meanwhile, are starting to run their slide-rules (not rulers) over what next week\u2019s numbers will look like, with Wednesday\u2019s GDP the main event. The March quarter had GDP up 0.2% for the quarter and 2.3% for the year. The market is predicting a quickening to 0.4% in the June quarter, with the year-on-year figure easing to 1.9% growth. Some of the pieces of the June quarter GDP puzzle will land early next week (eg trade on Tuesday) so economists\u2019 forecasts might be tweaked a bit more yet. One sure bet, though, seems to be that Tuesday\u2019s Reserve Bank meeting will leave the cash rate on hold for a third consecutive month at 4.1%. That\u2019s unless the governor, Philip Lowe, decides to go out with a bang rather than a whimper at his last board meeting as boss. Film-maker calls no campaign \u2018rightwing swine\u2019 for using scene in voice ad Oscar-winning film-maker Martin McDonagh has said he \u201cdefinitely wasn\u2019t aware\u201d that Australia\u2019s official no campaign was using a scene from his film Seven Psychopaths in the lead-up to the Indigenous voice referendum, alleging it \u201cappears to be deliberate copyright infringement by a bunch of rightwing swine\u201d. McDonagh told Guardian Australia on Friday he had \u201ccontacted my agents and producer to have them desist\u201d. On Thursday, the no campaign group Fair Australia shared a short scene from the 2012 film Seven Psychopaths to Twitter and Instagram, with the face of the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, superimposed over Zeljko Ivanek, who in the film plays a thug who threatens the character Hans (Christopher Walken) with a gun. Walken\u2019s face has an Australian flag imposed on it while Albanese is wearing a yes campaign badge. When Hans doesn\u2019t submit, the thug/Albanese is incredulous: But I\u2019ve got a gun. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Hans/Australia replies. \u201cToo bad.\u201d Read the full story here: Partners at PwC Australia will see their salaries slashed by up to 30% due to an ongoing reputation crisis that has kept profits flat. The pay cuts were detailed in response to the firm\u2019s financial results, which confirmed profit remained \u201cflat year-on-year\u201d despite an 11% increase in underlying revenue. But the true impact of the scandal, caused by the misuse of confidential tax policy information by a former partner, will not be revealed until next year. The divestment of PwC Australia\u2019s government services division for just $1 is not reflected as the sale is not expected to be formalised until the end of September. This division accounted for $680m or about 20% of the firm\u2019s revenue last financial year. On average, partner pay declined by 11% last financial year. Partners were paid between $374,000 and $4m, which was given to the firm\u2019s former chief executive Tom Seymour. But the real pain for partners will be felt next year, with the firm confirming \u201cthe owners of our firm \u2013 our partners \u2013 are taking a target income reduction of up to 30% in 2023/24\u201d due to the divestment and reputation crisis. Here\u2019s the statement from the PwC Australia chief executive, Kevin Burrowes: It has clearly been a challenging year for PwC Australia and our people. While our revenue results were pleasing, the challenges we experienced in the final quarter had an impact on our profit, which remained flat as compared with FY22. I want to thank our people for their resilience, their continued focus on our clients and the high quality of their work in the face of what has been a difficult time for them at the firm. As we look forward, we completely accept that past leadership failed to meet the standards our people, our clients, the community and the Australian government rightly expect, and for that I apologise. We didn\u2019t get it right, but our focus has, and always will be, on our clients, as we take the necessary steps to re-earn trust with our stakeholders. Universities need to \u2018take a hard look at themselves\u2019, student union says The National Union of Students (NUS) president, Bailey Riley, says universities aren\u2019t doing enough on student safety and haven\u2019t been for more than a decade. Speaking at a public hearing on Friday, Riley added universities who appeared before her had failed to take \u201cany real responsibility\u201d for their \u201clack of action\u201d. Some 275 students are assaulted on campus every week, according to the latest data, published in 2021. Riley said: Student safety should be at the forefront of every university campus in Australia ... we know there is a general failure throughout the whole system in terms of how universities have been responding ... to sexual assault and violence, particularly on campus. Earlier, Vicki Thomson, the CEO of the research-intensive Group of Eight (Go8), said claims universities weren\u2019t addressing student safety were \u201cfrankly insulting\u201d. Riley did not agree: They really need to take a hard look at themselves. Law Council of Australia urges judicial immunity reform after judge Salvatore Vasta successfully sued Australia\u2019s peak lawyers body has called for reform to judicial immunity and reiterated its support for a federal complaints body after a landmark case finding a sitting judge personally liable for false imprisonment. Earlier this week, the federal court ruled inferior court judge Salvatore Vasta falsely imprisoned a man, known only as Mr Stradford, and should not be afforded the usual immunity from civil liability afforded to members of the bench. Guardian Australia revealed this morning that the decision had paved the way for a separate case to proceed against Vasta alleging he falsely imprisoned a second man, also during a minor civil matter. The Law Council of Australia issued a statement on Friday saying judicial immunity was \u201cintrinsically related\u201d to the independence of judges and their ability to fearlessly make decisions according to the law. More on this story from Christopher Knaus and Nino Bucci here: \u2018Schools just want to have funds\u2019: SA teachers take protest to parliament AAP has more news on the teachers\u2019 strike in South Australia today which has affected hundreds of schools: Thousands of teachers and supporters gathered at South Australia\u2019s parliament to protest over their pay and conditions. Many brandished signs with messages including \u201cthe last straw\u201d, \u201csave our schools\u201d, \u201cschools just want to have funds\u201d and \u201cteachers unite for learning rights\u201d. Teachers derided the pay rise offer and said pressure on them was rising. One teacher told the ABC: We\u2019re overworked, we\u2019re underpaid, we need more support in the classroom. We have a huge number of children and young people with exceptional needs, and we want to be able to support them effectively. As well as a larger pay rise beyond the 3% offered, the Australian Education Union is demanding the government ease workplace pressures by cutting instructional time by 20%. The state\u2019s education minister, Blair Boyer, said the state budget could not afford the reduction in instructional time, which would equate to a billion dollars extra a year on top of the wage claim. He said: We have to find meaningful workload reduction that doesn\u2019t mean kids in South Australian classrooms get a poorer quality education. You\u2019ve got two options: you\u2019ve got kids have less education, or you backfill those teachers. You\u2019ve got to find the staff and you\u2019ve got to pay them. That\u2019s where the cost comes from. Boyer believes negotiations are on the right track after the union dropped its demand for a school support officer in every classroom. Greens hit out at government\u2019s delay in scrapping the job-ready graduates scheme The Greens education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, has canned the job-ready graduates scheme in a public hearing into the education minister\u2019s higher education bill. The bill repeals the 50% pass rule, one part of the scheme, but has not changed the pricing of courses that made some degrees, including humanities, vastly more expensive to incentivise students to take up other courses, including Stem. Faruqi asked how urgent it was to repeal the scheme in full amid a cost-of-living crisis. The education minister, Jason Clare, has delayed changes until the Universities Accord interim report is released in full. University bodies have echoed in the hearing that it failed to achieve its aims. Faruqi: Is it a missed opportunity that it hasn\u2019t been [reformed] in this bill? Dr Alison Barnes, the president of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU), said the bill was a step in the right direction while \u201cobviously\u201d more needed to be done: The job-ready graduates scheme is an appalling piece of legislation and clearly needs to be scrambled. Here\u2019s a story from July on why Labor\u2019s plans to scrap a Coalition reform may come too late: Government boosts commonwealth-supported places to help fill jobs needed for Aukus The federal government has announced an additional 4,000 commonwealth-supported university places to deliver the Aukus nuclear submarine program. The $128.5m investment, targeted at graduates in Stem courses, will provide training in engineering, mathematics, chemistry and physics to meet the needs of the program. Some 800 of the places will go to South Australian universities as part of an agreement for the submarines to be built in Adelaide. The education minister, Jason Clare, said the additional places would give more Australians \u201ca crack at a career in Stem\u201d. Universities Australia welcomed the funding, first outlined in the recent budget. Its chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said the body had previously called for defence internships to expand the workforce for projects like Aukus and was \u201clooking forward to exploring this option further\u201d. The National Tertiary Education Union has been critical of the higher education sector\u2019s backing of the program, as has the Australian Education Union. The Greens education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, welcomed the additional university places in Stem when the budget was handed down in May, while labelling the stated purpose of the places \u2013 to support Aukus \u2013 as \u201cgross\u201d. Universities are best placed to contribute to peace not warmongering. As we reported earlier, data just released by the Bureau of Meteorology shows Australia has experienced its warmest winter on record for mean temperatures. Here\u2019s a further dive into what that data shows, with the help of my colleague Peter Hannam. Winter rainfall was close to the average of 63mm across the country. However, southern Australia had a relatively dry winter. And back to the data on the record-breaking warm weather, the month of August alone was the second-warmest August on record for mean and maximum temperatures, and the third for minimum temperatures. Environmental groups have accused the Albanese government of recklessness and hypocrisy after it approved a major coalmine expansion in central Queensland, AAP reports. Groups including the Climate Council and Australian Conservation Foundation are calling for the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to stop approving fossil fuel projects following the government\u2019s green light this week for Sojitz\u2019s Gregory coalmine at Crinum. Plibersek defended the decision, saying it accorded with national environment law and under the government\u2019s safeguard mechanism the project\u2019s carbon pollution conformed with Australia\u2019s transition to net zero. It is the Albanese government\u2019s third approval relating to coal projects this year after it cleared the new Isaac River coalmine and the Ensham mine extension. The Australian Conservation Foundation branded the approval reckless and inappropriate. The foundation\u2019s CEO, Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, said: Following the hottest July on record, as we\u2019ve watched climate change wreaking havoc in Canada, Hawaii, Greece and Italy \u2013 and with Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology warning of a dangerous spring and summer ahead of us \u2013 it beggars belief that the government would approve a 50-year coal mine extension. Australia\u2019s winter of 2023 has been the warmest since official records began in 1910, with average daily temperatures 1.53C above the long-term average. According to data just released from the Bureau of Meteorology, the winter of 2023 beat the previous record of 1.46C set in 1996. Every winter since 2012 has been warmer than average. For maximum daily temperatures, 2023 was 1.85C above average, ranking second behind the mark of 1.94C set in the winter of 2017. The bureau classifies winter as the months of June, July and August. Amanda Vanstone was seemingly unaware her guest was still on the line when she finished a pre-recorded interview with him on Wednesday, because the Radio National Counterpoint presenter rudely derided his manner of speaking and called him a \u201cfuckwit\u201d. He was waiting to speak to the producer and he heard every word. The former Liberal senator\u2019s guest was the Kamilaroi Stem expert Corey Tutt, the founder of DeadlyScience, which provides remote Australian communities with educational resources and mentoring. Tutt was the 2020 NSW Young Australian of the Year and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2022. Read the full story and all the other media notes from this week here: Overall funding to universities to remain the same when all Indigenous students get access to federal funds, opposition says The shadow education minister, Sarah Henderson, has told a public hearing that federal government funding will not increase to universities when commonwealth places are extended to all Indigenous students. In a briefing, Henderson said the Department of Education indicated it would make a one-off adjustment to the base funding by reducing funding for all students and allocating it to uncapped Indigenous students, instead of increasing the overall funding rate. Commonwealth funding for Indigenous students was previously only available to those in regional areas. The Universities Accord interim report recommended this be extended to all students in order to drive up Indigenous enrolments. The vice-chancellor at Curtin University and chair of the Australian Technology Network of Universities (ATN), Prof Harlene Hayne, said she was not aware of the briefing but she was concerned whenever money was \u201cmoved from one pot to the other with the overall funding remaining the same\u201d: We saw that in the job ready graduates package \u2013 we weren\u2019t in favour of it there and we certainly aren\u2019t in favour of any kind of moving of the deck chairs without additional funding ... it doesn\u2019t matter where it\u2019s going. Australian rents are rising at the fastest rate since the GFC \u2013 and from a higher base Rents across Australia have risen at the fastest rate in at least 15 years, according to CoreLogic\u2019s Rental Value index. Annual rent increases, which are calculated monthly, topped 10% in late 2022 and early 2023. The last time rents increased at such a pace was in 2007 during the global financial crisis, when peak annual rent growth reached 9.7%. But the proportion of household income spent on housing is currently much higher than in 2007. The CPI rent index in March 2021 \u2013 when the current wave of rental increases began \u2013 was 55% higher than it was in June 2005, the equivalent point before the 2008 peak. \u201cThese increases today come on top of an already very significant level of cost,\u201d says Dr Michael Fotheringham, the managing director at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. More on this story from my colleague, Josh Nicholas, here: Married couples on road trip killed in highway crash AAP has some new details on the tragic car crash that killed four people yesterday: Four people killed in a crash in northern Victoria were on a road trip from NSW to visit loved ones and had just stopped for coffee moments before the collision with a truck. The two married couples from central NSW aged in their 70s stopped off in the town of Chiltern before heading towards Melbourne when the crash occurred on Thursday. Their sedan collided with a B-double truck as they attempted to get on the Hume Freeway about 10.30am. The Victoria police assistant commissioner Glenn Weir said the group set off on what was meant to be a seven-hour drive early on Thursday and there was no indication anything was wrong with the road. The identities of the four killed have not been publicly released as authorities are still notifying family members. University group chief calls for move to improve disadvantaged student outcomes The head of the Group of Eight universities, Vicki Thomson, has called for a national data equity institute to improve access and outcomes of disadvantaged students in the tertiary sector. Asked whether universities should better publicly account how students are performing, Thomson said: \u201cUniversities are accountable and transparent.\u201d She pointed to reporting requirements from the federal government and the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, including three different definitions of low SES and two definitions of regional and remote students. There\u2019s not even coordinated reporting back into the department ... we\u2019re all reporting differently ... how we\u2019re asked to report is fairly muddled ... We need to understand the scale of the problem because what we have is a lot of anecdotal commentary. ACCC wants Qantas hit with $250m penalty if guilty The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has clarified that it wants to see Qantas hit with a more than $250m penalty \u2013 twice the current record penalty \u2013 if its legal action alleging the airline was selling tickets already cancelled flights succeeds. Speaking on ABC Radio National, ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb noted the current record penalty for a breach of Australia\u2019s consumer law was $125m \u2013 issued to Volkswagen in 2019 for deceiving customers over diesel emissions \u2013 and said she was hopeful that, if found in breach of the law, Qantas should face a fine significantly higher. Some more details on the change allowing patients to receive 60-day prescriptions for some medicines has come into effect from today. The federal government has said the changes will save up to $180 a year per medicine while concession card holders will save $43 per medicine. But not everyone\u2019s pleased. Pharmacy lobby group the Pharmacy Guild has been running a campaign railing against the changes without offering additional support to pharmacies it says are footing the bill. The guild, however, has said it will suspend the campaign for now in good faith after the federal government agreed to bring forward the next community pharmacy agreement by more than a year. The meeting will now happen on 1 March 2024. The Pharmacy Guild president, Trent Twomey, told reporters in Sydney today: When a two-for-one policy is announced, it sounds great at face value, until you realise that it\u2019s actually the independent pharmacist behind the counter who\u2019s covering the cost of that second box. So whilst this policy may have good intentions, and I do not doubt that it has good intentions, the way in which it has been rushed, has created unintended consequences and that\u2019s exactly why we need to bring forward the next negotiation of the agreement. And I\u2019m happy to say we\u2019ve agreed we\u2019ll start that on 1 March next year. Teachers need to be \u2018paid properly\u2019, Barbara Pocock tells SA rally Greens senator Barbara Pocock is at a rally being held outside Parliament House in South Australia today by teachers who\u2019ve walked off the job in demand for better pay and conditions. Pocock said in a video filmed at the rally: This is about the future of our children, which is about the future of our country. Teachers need to be paid properly, and the state government needs to up their offer [so] teachers can return to the classroom with the awards that they and our children deserve. The Australian Education Union said 80% of its members voted in favour of the strike \u2013 which has seen hundreds of schools close across the state today \u2013 after the government\u2019s \u201cinsulting\u201d 3% pay rise offer. Universities putting measures in place on student safety, group head says Vicki Thomson, CEO of the research-intensive Group of Eight (Go8) universities, has been asked asked who universities have engaged with on their student safety policies, including the leading body End Rape on Campus. She replied that \u201ccertainly our universities would have\u201d. All of our universities have put in place significant processes, policies, procedures \u2026 That\u2019s not to say that we can\u2019t do better. My point \u2026. was we are putting in place measures. We are concerned about the issues students raise, and staff. Thomson said the data on sexual harassment on campuses needed to be interrogated in a \u201ccalm, rational way\u201d, adding there shouldn\u2019t be a \u201cprevailing view\u201d that universities were any more safe or unsafe than other places in society. The latest national student safety survey, released in 2021, found one in 20 students had been sexually assaulted since starting university, and one in six had been sexually harassed. Universities Australia, the peak body for the sector, has confirmed it will hold another national survey next year after ongoing lobbying from advocacy groups. Qantas should be fined \u2018hundreds of millions\u2019 if guilty to send message to companies, ACCC says Earlier we bought you news that Gina Cass-Gottlieb, chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, told RN Breakfast she wanted the Qantas case to deliver a new record penalty for consumer law breaches to scare other companies who had stopped fearing such fines. Guardian Australia has approached the ACCC to clarify how much the consumer watchdog would be seeking. Speaking on ABC Radio National, Cass-Gottlieb noted the current record penalty for a breach of Australia\u2019s consumer law was $125m \u2013 issued to Volkswagen in 2019 for deceiving customers over diesel emissions \u2013 and said she was hopeful that, if found in breach of the law, Qantas should face a fine significantly higher. Host Patricia Karvelas asked Cass-Gottlieb: \u201cAre you talking over $300 million?\u201d Cass-Gottlieb replied: \u201cWe would want to get to more than twice that figure.\u201d The ACCC has been approached to clarify whether Cass-Gottlieb meant more than $600m \u2013 double the figure Karvelas suggested \u2013 or more than $250m, which is twice the current record penalty. More on this story from my colleague, Elias Visontay, here: Claims universities aren\u2019t addressing student safety are \u2018insulting\u2019, Group of Eight head says The CEO of Australia\u2019s prestigious Group of Eight (Go8) universities, Vicki Thomson, has rubbished claims universities aren\u2019t doing their bit to address student safety on campus. The topic has been in the spotlight in recent weeks after education minister Jason Clare announced the convention of a working group to consult with advocacy groups and offer immediate actions on student safety. At the time, Clare said actions universities had taken to address sexual assault and harassment on campuses to date had \u201cnot been good enough\u201d and university governing bodies \u201cmust do more\u201d. Some 275 students are assaulted on campus every week, according to the latest data, published in 2021. Speaking at a public hearing in Sydney on Friday, Thomson said it \u201cgoes without saying\u201d the Go8 universities had zero tolerance for sexual assault or harassment on or off campus. All universities ... have policies and procedures in place to ensure our university community offers safe and respectful university environments for student and staff ... This is an issue Go8 staff ... take seriously and personally. There\u2019s no doubt that we can and all should do better but to suggest somehow that we don\u2019t care or we\u2019re not trying is frankly insulting ... What we would seek is a constructive discussion in pursuit of our shared goal of safety for all. In Sydney, a public hearing is taking place into the education minister\u2019s higher education support amendment. The amendment seeks to legislate the urgent recommendations of the Universities Accord interim report, including improving university governance, expanding commonwealth support to all Indigenous Australians, not just people in regional areas and abolishing the former government\u2019s controversial 50% pass rule. The rule, introduced as part of the Coalition\u2019s job ready graduates scheme, removed commonwealth assistance for students who failed to pass 50% of subjects and disproportionately impacted disadvantaged students. Vicki Thomson, CEO of the research intensive Group of Eight (Go8) universities said the body \u201cstrongly support[s]\u201d the legislation while adding it must also deliver outcomes in success \u2013 retention rates and future employment. She said targets and places were \u201cnot the barrier to participation\u201d among disadvantaged cohorts, pointing to UNSW\u2019s policy to make an offer to every Indigenous student who applied. Additional government support is needed \u2026 this doesn\u2019t just start with universities, we need to build aspiration and prepare our students for study while they\u2019re in secondary \u2026 and primary school \u2026 we\u2019re less interested in headlines than we are of results.\u201d Just 15 of Australia\u2019s 39 universities have met or exceeded the target of 20% students to be from low socioeconomic backgrounds. None are the Go8 universities, and the vast majority are in regional areas. Victorian government increases funding for community sector The Victorian government today has announced a new set of standards and an increase in annual funding for the community sector, in an effort to provide organisations working in areas such as child protection, family violence, homeless and mental health with more certainty. In a statement, the minister for child protection and family services, Lizzie Blandthorn, and the treasurer, Tim Pallas, announced the increase in annual indexed funding \u2013 worth about $260m over four years \u2013 for 800 community sector organisations. In addition, a new code has been created to ensure organisations comply with all applicable employment, industrial relations and workplace health and safety obligations, foster workplace equity and diversity and constructive relationships with their respective unions. The code will apply to organisations that receive direct funding of more than $2m a year from the Victorian government to provide community services and will come into effect from August 2024. It was finalised in consultation with the Victorian Council of Social Service, the Australian Services Union and other sector representatives. Blandthorn said: The Community Services Fair Jobs Code will help ensure job security for this critical workforce that tirelessly serves the most vulnerable members of our community. No campaign politicians\u2019 ad spends highlight need for law reform: Steggall Independent MP Zali Steggall has said Guardian Australia\u2019s revelation this morning that Coalition no campaigners are spending four times more on Facebook ads than other parliamentarians showed why \u201cAustralia desperately needs to reform political advertising laws\u201d. You can read more on this story from my colleagues here: Queensland hospitals vaccine mandate to be scrapped News via AAP: Healthcare workers without the Covid-19 vaccination will return to Queensland hospitals as the government begins consultation to scrap a pandemic-enforced rule. The state\u2019s health minister, Shannon Fentiman, said the decision to enforce Covid-19 vaccination requirements for Queensland Health and Queensland Ambulance staff no longer applies due to high jab rates and natural immunity in the community. It is estimated about 1,100 health workers resigned in the state during the pandemic, some of whom were not compliant with the vaccination mandate. ANU staff secure 18.5% pay increase over five years Union members at Australian National University have voted in favour of an enterprise agreement that will make employees the highest paid in the nation. The agreement offers an 18.5% pay increase over five years, including 3.5% paid this February followed by 2.5% each six months to mid-2026. It\u2019s the highest total pay offer in the sector and second behind UNSW on a per-year basis. A spokesperson for ANU said the university was pleased to reach the \u201csignificant milestone\u201d in the bargaining negotiations of getting the backing of the NTEU: ANU is committed to building and maintaining employment arrangements that attract and retain world-class staff, especially in the face of current challenges faced by the university and sector more broadly. We want our staff to feel supported and valued and proud to work at our leading University. We are confident this agreement delivers on that commitment and promise. The proposed agreement will give casuals paid sick leave for the first time, and all staff will have 20 days of gender affirmation leave. An all staff vote is likely to take place in mid-October. Pharmacists shelve medicines campaign as talks begin A peak pharmacy body has shelved its campaign against 60-day medicine dispensing and agreed to talks to iron out an agreement that will not jeopardise the viability of local pharmacies, AAP reports. The Pharmacy Guild president, Trent Twomey, hopes negotiations with the federal government will ensure pharmacies are remunerated fairly for medicine dispensing and can continue to operate sustainably under the new scheme. When announced, the changes were met with fierce opposition from the peak pharmacy bodies, with concerns some pharmacies would have to close. But bringing forward negotiations on the next community pharmacy agreement by more than a year has convinced the guild to suspend its campaign. Twomey said: We thank the prime minister and the health minister for hearing our concerns, and 60-day dispensing, along with other reforms, will now be dealt with in the normal way under a community pharmacy agreement. Pharmacists are ready, willing and able to step up and provide more care and services to patients, at a time when the health system is under significant strain, and we look forward to those opportunities within the eighth community pharmacy agreement. \u2018If Not Now\u2019: Paul Kelly\u2019s new song in support of the Indigenous voice Australian music legend Paul Kelly has released a song in support of the Indigenous voice to parliament, days after he called on voters to back the referendum. Titled If Not Now, Kelly released the song online this morning. The lyrics talk of \u201ca feeling something\u2019s missing\u201d, \u201cbusiness that\u2019s unfinished\u201d, \u201ca simple proposition\u201d and \u201ca chance to make our country larger in its soul\u201d. \u201cHow long can we keep walking with this stone in our shoe? If not now, then when? If not us, then who?\u201d he asks, repeating a phrase used commonly by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, in advocating for a yes vote. \u201cToo many falling far behind, shut out of the deal. If you called and no one heard you, imagine how you\u2019d feel. This land was never given, it was taken and then sold. But its ancient songs and stories are a gift greater than gold.\u201d Kelly this week shared a statement online, outlining his reasons for a yes vote, including the \u201chuge and stubborn gap\u201d in health and life outcomes for Indigenous Australians. \u201cThat yawning gap is unfair and diminishes us all,\u201d he wrote. Thread\u2019s new features Meta\u2019s Twitter rival Threads is testing search functionality in Australia and New Zealand exclusively. The search function will now allow people to search for specific posts, and Meta has said it will be extended to other English-speaking countries after testing is done and feedback obtained in Australia and New Zealand. While more than 100 million people initially signed up to Threads in a bid to find something to replace Twitter, which has people turning away under the ownership of Elon Musk, the lack of features meant that the estimated active users has dropped to just a fraction of that 100m. Meta said that the launch of Threads will pave the way for trending topics, which will bring in more Twitter-like features. The site is still missing a direct messaging function, and hashtags. Threads launched a desktop version last week. This winter is looking to be Australia\u2019s warmest on record, with warmer than usual temperatures also forecast for spring, the Bureau of Meteorology has said. The BoM\u2019s climate services manager, Dr Karl Braganza, said the warm spring weather will especially be felt in Western Australia and part of Australia\u2019s south-east. The forecast is also showing an \u201cunusually dry spring\u201d with a high chance of below average rainfall. Debelle leaves Fortescue as exodus continues Guy Debelle, the former Reserve Bank deputy governor, has left Fortescue after just 17 months, marking the third prominent departure from the iron ore miner in a week. His exit comes days after Fiona Hick, the chief executive of Fortescue\u2019s mining business, abruptly left after six months in the top role. Fortescue then announced late on Thursday that chief financial officer Christine Morris was leaving. She was appointed in June. Aspiring critical minerals miner Tivan told the stock exchange on Friday that Debelle had agreed to join its board. The former central banker will also invest $25,000 in the small company, according to the announcement. Debelle\u2019s departure from Fortescue was first reported by the Australian Financial Review early on Friday. He joined Fortescue\u2019s emerging clean energy business last year, before stepping down from his executive role to recover from a serious bicycle accident, but remained with the company. He spent 25 years with the Reserve Bank before joining Fortescue. \u2018Women deserve fairer paid parental leave\u2019: Greens demand super be added to paid parental leave The Greens are threatening to block the Albanese government\u2019s changes to lift the tax rate for superannuation balances above $3m unless it extends superannuation to paid parental leave. The party points to an estimation from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, which found paying superannuation on paid parental leave would around $200m a year. This is less than 10% of the $2.3bn expected to be raised from the government lifting the superannuation tax rate. The Greens leader in the Senate, Larissa Waters, said: We will use our balance of power in the Senate to get outcomes for women and young families who are struggling with the cost of living crisis. We know Australian women are retiring with significantly less superannuation savings than men, with the gender retirement gap currently sitting at 23%. Women deserve fairer paid parental leave, and it\u2019s only fair if it includes super. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, hit out at the Greens, accusing the party of playing \u201cpolitical games\u201d: We\u2019ve already extended paid parental leave as part of a multibillion-dollar agenda to support women\u2019s economic opportunity. We\u2019ve already made it clear for some time that we intend to act on the super guarantee on [paid parental leave] when budget circumstances permit \u2013 that remains the case and we\u2019ve said so publicly and repeatedly. Neil Mitchell leaves Melbourne\u2019s 3AW Mornings program Some news via AAP: Melbourne radio stalwart Neil Mitchell is leaving 3AW\u2019s Mornings program. The host revealed on Friday that he is leaving the show in December to take up a new role at the Nine Network. Mitchell has been host of the program since 1990 and dominated the ratings in the slot. Business group chief says cost-of-living crisis an \u2018unusual time\u2019 to raise prices to improve gig workers\u2019 pay Innes Willox, chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, was speaking on RN Breakfast a few moment ago about the Albanese government\u2019s proposed gig economy rules, which would see minimum wages and conditions set for workers. Asked about the workplace relations minister Tony Burke\u2019s comments that Australians should be willing to pay a small price to stop what he has called the underpayment of thousands of delivery workers, Willox said: It\u2019s sort of unusual at a time of a cost-of-living crisis that the government would be looking to increase costs for consumers and put the possibility for people to pick up work at risk. But as my colleague, Paul Karp, reported this morning, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has dismissed what it says is the latest \u201cscare campaign\u201d designed to bolster profits at the expense of basic conditions to help workers afford the rising cost of living. More on this story here: Snowy Hydro\u2019s stuck tunnel boring machine \u2018ready to go\u2019 A bit more on Snowy Hydro and its giant 2.0 pumped hydro project with its ginormous $12bn (plus) price tag. Fans of \u201cFlorence\u201d, the boring machine that got stuck in soft earth just 180 metres into its 17km tunnel as part of Snowy Hydro\u2019s giant 2.0 pumped hydro project, will be glad to know its restart might not be that far off. Florence got stuck late last year because it wasn\u2019t equipped with gear to deliver the material to a slurry plant, that\u2019s now been added. Pity the preparatory drilling didn\u2019t pick up the geological problem before they got boring. Snowy\u2019s CEO, Dennis Barnes, tells us the machine is \u201cready to go\u201d but first the modifications to its permits need to go on exhibition and get the nod from the New South Wales government. More from his interview here: Barnes told RN Breakfast, he hopes Florence can bore at the speed of 10-20 metres a day. At the slower end of that range, it will take the machine about 4.6 years to cover 17km. Given Snowy is now working to a plan of first power by the second half of 2027, that speed would put that timetable at risk. Any delay will push back the revenues Snowy is banking on to realise its $15bn benefit. Ted Woodley, from the National Parks Association, says that if Florence operated at the pace of the other two machines it would take seven years to cover the 17km. Snowy 2.0 watching, in other words, has a ways to go. ACCC chair says more Qatar Airways flights would enhance competition and lower air fares Chair of the ACCC, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, has said allowing Qatar Airways\u2019 bid to operate more flights in Australia would lower the cost of air fares, adding that the consumer watchdog welcomes \u201call enhancements to competition\u201d. Asked how much it would lower costs by on ABC RN, Cass-Gottlieb said: Virgin has given an estimate of 40%. That is difficult to predict, that\u2019s that\u2019s their estimate. In regards to the Albanese government\u2019s decision to reject Qatar Airway\u2019s bid, which has a partnership with Virgin Australia, to operate more flights in Australia, Cass-Gottlieb said: The point we are very well aware of is the test in national interest here will include additional factors to competition and we don\u2019t know what was considered there, but we certainly welcome all enhancements to competition. Qantas should pay a record-breaking penalty of more than $600m if the consumer watchdog is successful in its legal action against the airline, the ACCC chair has said. Speaking on ABC RN, Gina Cass-Gottlieb said the penalty should exceed the record penalty faced by a company for breaching Australian consumer law, which currently stands at $125m. Asked if she thinks the penalty should exceed $300m, Cass-Gottlieb said: We would want to get to more than twice that figure. Mark Butler confident in transport minister\u2019s decision on Qatar Airways Circling back to an earlier interview with the health minister, Mark Butler, on ABC News, where he was asked about assistant treasurer Stephen Jones\u2019s comments that the decision to not let Qatar airways bring more flights into Australia was about protecting Qantas\u2019 profitability. Butler said he was confident about the decision made by minister for transport, Catherine King: She made the decisions, weighing up all of the considerations about the health of the aviation sector and most importantly, the interests of passengers and I think she would have made that in utterly the right circumstances. Asked about the consumer watchdog\u2019s legal action against Qantas, Butler said the airline would need to answer to both the watchdog and its customers for its conduct. Snowy 2.0 is an investment, says CEO of nearly $13bn cost blowout Dennis Barnes, the chief executive of Snowy 2.0, is speaking on ABC RN about the project\u2019s cost blowout to almost $13bn, saying Australians must remember the project is an investment. He said: [We are] obviously very disappointed in the cost increase, and of course we apologise for that. But bear in mind that this is an investment that the Australian taxpayer will get a return on. Asked whether there\u2019s a chance the cost of the project could blow-out further, Barnes said \u201cthere\u2019s a degree of confidence in this number\u201d. We\u2019ve learned a lot in the last five years \u2026 my last five or six months has been to get the team together, get international experts and really do a rigorous assessment, so there\u2019s a degree of confidence in this number and timing. My colleague Peter Hannam has more on the cost blowouts in this story from yesterday: AMA says Coalition should \u2018get out of the way\u2019 of 60-day dispensing changes The Australian Medical Association has welcomed the start of 60-day dispensing and urged the Coalition against reversing the decision. The opposition is expected to attempt to overturn the decision with a disallowance motion when parliament resumes next week. AMA president, Prof Steve Robson, said the policy will provide much-needed financial relief amid a cost-of-living crisis. He called the Coalition\u2019s push to reverse the decision \u201cmadness\u201d. Patients have waited for five years to get the hip pocket savings this policy delivers due to hardline opposition from pharmacy owners. It\u2019s time for patients to get a fair go and for the Coalition to get out of the way of this long overdue health reform and to stop defending pharmacy owner profits. Hundreds of SA public schools closed as teachers strike Hundreds of schools across South Australia will be closed to students today as teachers walk off the job to protest pay and conditions, AAP reports. The government has told parents at 167 public schools to make alternative arrangements for their children on Friday. A further 152 schools will operate with a modified program, while the state\u2019s remaining 608 schools will open as normal. The Australian Education Union said 80% of its members voted in favour of the strike after the government\u2019s \u201cinsulting\u201d 3% pay rise offer. As well as a larger pay rise, the union is demanding the government ease workplace pressures by cutting instructional time by 20%. Sixty-day dispensing changes start today Patients with chronic conditions are set to receive two months of medicine for the price of one from today after the Albanese government\u2019s shake-up of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to allow 60-day scripts. The federal minister for health, Mark Butler, was on ABC News just now to spruik the changes, saying almost 4 million patients will benefit. Now you will effectively get two scripts for the price of one, halving the cost of your medicines. It will mean fewer visits to the GP and pharmacist as well as more money in your hip pocket. The 60-day dispensing changes are supported by doctors\u2019 groups including the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, as well as patient groups including the Consumer Health Forum. But it was met with intensive lobbying from the Pharmacy Guild, who warned the change would lead to staff cuts, fee increases, and cause pharmacies to close. Asked about the guild\u2019s claims this morning, Butler said: This is just another scare campaign from the pharmacy lobby. This is a highly profitable industry, more profitable than any other part of the private medical services industry I can find. We are dedicated and committed to a vibrant future for community pharmacy which is why every single dollar we save is being ploughed back into the community pharmacy sector, reinvested into programs that allow them to provide more services to their customers. Fortescue\u2019s CFO Christine Morris departs days after chief executive walks Investors will be able to give their verdict on the latest executive changes at the mining giant Fortescue when trading opens again this morning. The company is dealing with yet another executive loss, days after the shock exit of chief executive Fiona Hick. In a brief ASX statement on Thursday, Fortescue announced the departure of Christine Morris as chief financial officer. The company did not disclose the reason for her departure, having only started in the role in July. Apple Paget has been appointed acting CFO. My colleague Henry Belot has the story: Shareholders will also note that the company\u2019s new adviser on green energy transition is Kwasi Kwarteng, the former British chancellor who was discredited when he introduced a budget shortly after getting into office which promptly crashed the UK economy. His new role with Fortescue was first reported by the Australian Financial Review. Guardian Australia understands the position will start in October, exactly one year after he was removed from his position as a high-ranking member of cabinet. Jonathan Barrett has more on this story here: The Victorian Liberals have lost a senior shadow cabinet member as opposition leader John Pesutto prepares to advance a plan to cover the costs of looming legal action, AAP reports. The Liberal upper house deputy leader, Matt Bach, stepped down from his role and as a member of the shadow cabinet at a special party room meeting last night. The opposition education spokesman has accepted a role in the UK as an assistant headteacher and teacher and intends to leave parliament at the end of the year or early next year. \u201cWe\u2019ll win the next election but nonetheless, for me and my family, we felt that we had a great opportunity,\u201d Bach told reporters at state parliament. Liberal MPs also met to discuss how Pesutto and his senior leadership team would finance their legal bills following a new defamation threat. UK anti-trans rights activist Kellie-Jay Keen this week issued defamation concerns notices to Pesutto, the party\u2019s deputy leader, David Southwick, upper house leader, Georgie Crozier, and Bach. The notices are the first step in the potential launch of defamation proceedings. Pesutto said the party room agreed to look at a way for Liberal organisers to financially cover him and the leadership team. \u201cAnybody working in a workplace today will ordinarily have insurance cover in the course of their employment,\u201d Pesutto said. \u2018Confirmshaming\u2019: report reveals subscription traps and hidden costs targeting Australian consumers The \u201cHotel California\u201d subscription, or the one you can never leave.

Confusing terms and conditions. \u201cConfirmshaming\u201d, where companies make you feel like an idiot when you try to opt out of their emails. These are among the \u201cdark patterns\u201d used unfairly by companies to nudge, manipulate, exploit and trick consumers into handing over money or data. Now, the federal government is considering ways to stop those practices, which are currently not egregious enough to be illegal. A Treasury consultation paper, released on Thursday, looks at options to crack down on how companies target vulnerable people, use \u201cpredatory or aggressive business conduct\u201d, make it hard to opt out of cancelling goods or services, or mislead people through omitted, hidden or overly complex information. My colleague Tory Shepherd has more on this story: Good morning everyone, and thanks to Martin Farrer for kicking off our live blog this morning! I\u2019m Jordyn Beazley and I\u2019ll be bringing you our rolling news coverage today. As always, please send me an email if there\u2019s something you think needs attention on the blog: jordyn.beazley@theguardian.com. The trade minister, Don Farrell, has wrapped up \u201cvery positive and productive\u201d talks with his European Union counterpart, Valdis Dombrovskis, following the breakdown in negotiations over agriculture matters in Brussels in July. After a teleconference between the parties yesterday, the Australian team said both sides were committed and willing to finalise a deal. The ministers have agreed to meet again in person in the coming months. Farrell said: I\u2019ve made our expectations clear on what it will take to finalise a trade agreement with the European Union \u2013 a better deal. We are making progress, but we need to bridge the gap between our expectations, and what the Europeans are offering. I\u2019m prepared to persist for as long as it takes, and to work as hard as I can on behalf of Australian producers and businesses, to get a better deal. Australian home values are up 4.9% since February, adding about $34,000 to the average dwelling. CoreLogic\u2019s national home value index, released today, marked a sixth consecutive monthly rise, up 0.8% in August. Every capital city except Hobart (-0.1%) recorded a rise in dwelling values over the month. Lower than average advertised supply levels have put upwards pressure on home values across most capital cities, while flatlining interest rates are boosting buyer confidence. Gains were led by a 1.5% increase across Brisbane, followed by Sydney and Adelaide where home values were up 1.1%. CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless said: \u201cSydney has led the recovery trend to-date with a gain of 8.8% since values found a floor in January this year. \u201cBrisbane has also posted a strong recovery with values up 6.2% since bottoming out in February. \u201cAt the other end of the scale, some other capital cities are better described as flat, with Hobart home values unchanged since stabilising in April, while values across the ACT have risen only mildly, up 1% since a trough in April.\u201d Across the capital cities, house values are up 6.3% since bottoming out in February, compared with a 4.9% rise in unit values. Conditions across regional housing markets were mixed. Values were down over the month across the non-capital city regions of NSW (-0.2%) and Victoria (-0.6%), rising across regional Queensland (0.8%) and SA (0.9%), and holding flat in regional Western Australia and Tasmania. Parts of the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast comprised seven of the top 10 markets for the largest capital gain over the three months ending August. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release its latest lending data on Friday, ahead of the Reserve Bank board meeting on Tuesday. The RBA is expected to keep rates on hold at 4.1% for a third month in row, on the back of cooler than expected monthly inflation. Good morning and welcome to our live news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer, bringing you the best overnight stories while my colleague Jordyn Beazley will be along shortly to guide you through the day. Our lead story this morning reveals that Coalition politicians have spent more than four times more on Facebook ads about the Indigenous voice to parliament than Labor politicians. According to a Guardian Australia analysis of federal politicians\u2019 advertising data in Meta\u2019s ad library, Coalition politicians who oppose the voice are vastly outspending other parliamentarians on Facebook. Out of the top 10 Facebook accounts belonging to politicians that shared ads supporting a yes or no vote, the majority were from the Coalition, with Nationals senator and no supporter Jacinta Nampijinpa Price heading the list. It\u2019s been a busy few weeks at Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals Group and yesterday was no exception after its chief financial officer, Christine Morris, became the latest senior figure to quit the mining group. Her departure last night comes days after CEO Fiona Hicks headed for the exit. Earlier in the day, it emerged that Kwasi Kwarteng, the British chancellor who crashed the pound before being booted from office, was coming in the other way later this year to start advising FMG on its clean energy ambitions from October. We\u2019ll see how the market reacts to the comings and goings a little bit later. Plus, the company has been reported to WA\u2019s safety regulator over a huge party featuring rock legend Jimmy Barnes held to celebrate its 20th anniversary. More coming up. Victorian Liberal leader John Pesutto has lost a key ally after upper house deputy leader and education spokesman Matt Bach resigned last night at a special party room meeting. Bach is quitting to take up a teaching role in the UK and his departure is a blow for Pesutto as he tries to persuade the party to cover his legal bills in defamation cases brought by former Liberal MP Moira Deeming and UK anti-trans activist Kellie-Jay Keen. More on that later, too."

We can\u2019t let cost prevent us keeping Britain healthy, 8 September). However, increasing the number of people eligible for vaccination is not a zero-cost option, and the funding needed for a wider programme needs to be looked at against the potential benefits. With the NHS and wider public sector facing many challenges (for example, mental health and cancer, and schools that need substantial funding for repairs), there are many calls on public spending. Therefore decisions on eligibility for Covid vaccination need to be pragmatic and evidence-based. Proponents of wider vaccination have not presented data showing that vaccinating groups at lower risk of complications such as hospital admission and death will be cost-effective and a better use of public spending than investment in other priority areas. The era of mass vaccination we saw earlier in the pandemic is ending and more countries will \u2013 like the UK - move towards targeted vaccination of higher-risk groups, as we already see every year for flu vaccination. The only circumstances in which we are likely to see a return to mass vaccination is if a new variant of Sars-CoV-2 emerges that can bypass immunity from vaccination and prior infection, and cause more serious disease than the virus variants that are currently circulating. For now, targeted vaccination of higher-risk groups remains the most rational and cost\u2011effective policy.

            "date": "2023-09-30T14:03:16Z",
            "content": "Covid cases are rising, new variants are spreading; there is a horrible sense of deja vu. Only this time there are no vaccines on the horizon for the majority of the population. This is especially concerning for long Covid patients, who have never been eligible for early access to vaccines or additional boosters. Yet a study has shown that 60% of recovered long Covid patients will see a recurrence of symptoms if reinfected; another suggested that the condition can have a more damaging impact on quality of life than stage 4 lung cancer. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation guidance focuses only on Covid\u2019s acute phase, not the chronic conditions it can cause. But now that mortality rates have been brought down, we need to take the disease\u2019s debilitating after-effects with the seriousness they deserve. Even if this is purely an economic decision, it does not take into account how many people will have to be out of work for months or years while they recover. Living with Covid, for some of us, has been more literal than others. It has been 1,284 days since I first got infected, and I am only just beginning to feel close to how I was before March 2020. I am doing everything I can to avoid reinfection, but it is only a matter of time before it happens. The prospect of the whole process starting again, with its attendant physical and psychological devastation, is terrifying; every social encounter or trip to the office is fraught with anxiety. If only long Covid patients could minimise risks with vaccines and medication, it would all be a little bit easier to face. Writers blocked It\u2019s been a bleak week for aspiring authors, as news of the closure of the literary magazine The White Review and cuts to the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) PhD funding mean that writing will be even more inaccessible to young people unless they have private wealth and connections. The White Review\u2019s annual short story prize championed early work by authors such as Claire-Louise Bennett, Vanessa Onwuemezi and Sophie Mackintosh; on Tuesday it announced it would cease publishing, after Arts Council England had repeatedly rejected its funding applications. Meanwhile, the AHRC will be cutting its yearly doctoral research grants by a quarter. Award-winning novelist and poet Daisy Lafarge responded: \u201cLike many first gen people I could never have done a PhD without funding, scholarships etc; I would also never have been in a position to write and publish books.\u201d This is all part of the Conservatives\u2019 decade-long attack on the humanities (on Thursday, the arts body Creative Scotland had its budget cut by \u00a36.6m). In the government\u2019s view, writing is essentially a glorified hobby; not only does it fail to create value that can be measured in a quantifiable way but it encourages independent thinking and critical faculties \u2013 undesirable attributes in an increasingly authoritarian society. Carving out revenge If only all local authority spats were as bizarre as the one unfolding in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, where Michael Thomas, a developer incensed by a three-year planning dispute, had a gargoyle-like sculpture erected on one of his buildings. Stewart Palmen, the town council leader, recognisable by his beard and half-moon glasses, is depicted sticking out his tongue in a gesture of provocation. But far from being insulted, Palmen is pleased with the statue: \u201cI quite like it,\u201d he has said. \u201cIt would be nice in the garden.\u201d We can only hope that the dispute will be resolved soon, and that further planning permission issues up and down the country will be decided by stonemasonry-based showdowns. \u2022 Kathryn Bromwich is a commissioning editor and writer on the Observer New Review"

            "date": "2023-09-12T15:00:33Z",
            "content": "Evidence to support the widespread use of psychedelics to treat mental health conditions such as depression is lacking, according to politicians and representatives of peak health bodies interviewed for a research paper published on Wednesday. Researchers from Monash University in Melbourne conducted in-depth interviews with senior experts from a range of organisations involved in psychedelic drug law reform, clinical use or regulation. The interviewees \u2013 who cannot be identified due to study ethics requirements \u2013 included state and federal politicians, members of peak bodies representing clinicians and unions representing mental health workers. They were asked about potential issues around prescribing psychedelics. The interviews were conducted between September and January. In February, drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) announced that psychiatrists would be able to prescribe medicines containing psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder. These changes took effect in July. Some mental health researchers have criticised the decision as questionable, concerning and driven by the influence of lobby groups instead of health experts. The TGA has denied this, saying the decision acknowledged that evidence for the use of the substances in treating mental illnesses is not yet well established. However, given the lack of treatment options for severe depression and strict prescribing safeguards in place, the TGA believes the benefits outweigh the risks. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The interviewees in the Monash study were hesitant to support the widespread clinical implementation of psychedelics due to concern about this poor quality of evidence. They expressed that a stronger research base on the use of psychedelics in mental health was needed, and noted methodological flaws in existing research such as small sample sizes, short durations and the use of participants who were not representative of the general population. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to run before we walk. We want to make sure there\u2019s a really good evidence base behind this,\u201d one participant told the researchers. Another theme that emerged from the interviews was the need for clear and consistent messaging about what treatment involves to combat negative stigma and gain support among the general public. \u201cThese findings suggest significant effort may be required to convince those charged with designing legislation and supporting clinicians about the role of psychedelic assisted options in treating mental health conditions,\u201d the paper, published in the journal Public Health Research &amp; Practice, found. A co-author of the paper, Prof Chris Langmead, said he was personally supportive of the TGA decision \u201cgiven the paucity of other available options for those cohorts of patients with treatment-resistant depression\u201d. But he said now the decision had been made, it was important those prescribing the medicines and those who represented consumer groups also felt confident in the changes, even if prescribing was not widespread. He said the findings of the paper suggested more education may be needed. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving people ecstasy and sending them home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving them a defined dose of pharmaceutically manufactured MDMA that is delivered in a controlled clinical environment, which is a very different concept than just being given any psychedelic drug.\u201d Prof Susan Rossell, a cognitive neuropsychologist at Swinburne\u2019s Centre for Mental Health who was not involved in the research, said the paper \u201creally speaks to what we have all been saying \u2013 that as experts in the field we need good-quality rigorous data to ensure that the data that is reported on is of the highest standards\u201d. \u201cThis will give us the best chance of ensuring that any changes to regulations can be reinforced,\u201d she said. \u201cAt present there isn\u2019t the data we need to give widespread support to psilocybin for depression or MDMA for PTSD. Initial data is certainly promising but a great deal more needs to be known. I think that we need to revisit to the TGA decision with data.\u201d"

            "content": "Millions of parents in Britain are struggling with their mental health, a survey suggests, amid the rising cost of living, a lack of childcare and fewer support services. Sixty-one per cent of respondents revealed concerns about their mental health, with those on lower incomes most likely to be affected, a poll for the charity Unicef UK found. Parents variously said they had felt overwhelmed (49%), anxious (43%), unsupported (36%) and lonely (26%) all or a lot of the time in the past 12 months. Meanwhile, 70% of parents with babies and young children said it was getting harder every year to be a parent in Britain, and 70% felt that being a parent today was harder than it was for their parent\u2019s generation. The figures come from a YouGov survey for the charity of 2,661 parents of children aged four and under in Britain in July. Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Unicef UK, said: \u201cThis lack of support for families falls at a critical stage in babies\u2019 and young children\u2019s development, threatening life chances and piling more and more pressure on families.\u201d The rising cost of living (83%) was the most common reason parents felt it was harder to be a parent now. More than two-thirds (68%) of parents said it was harder due to a lack of childcare, 64% felt there was less time to spend with children, and 41% said there were fewer local support services. Parents also said housing costs (78%) and the dangers of social media (75%) were making parenting for their generation harder. Two-thirds (68%) of respondents said they believed the government was not doing enough to support them as parents of young children. Thirty per cent of parents reported working longer hours in the past year due to increased financial pressures, with 37% having less time to read, play and cook healthy meals with their children. Sparkes said: \u201cThese findings provide a stark snapshot into the reality for many families with babies and young children right now \u2013 worried for their children\u2019s future, struggling to make ends meet and left feeling anxious, alone, and unsupported. \u201cIt is vitally important that families can access basic services like maternity care, health visits, mental health support, affordable and high-quality childcare and support for special educational needs and disabilities (Send). These services, while essential for all, can provide a lifeline for families struggling financially and/or with their mental health.\u201d The research also highlighted stark inequalities, with 94% of the poorest households reporting that the cost of living crisis had a negative impact on family life, compared with 78% of all parents with young children. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s the most disadvantaged families who are struggling more and who are least likely to have accessed support means we risk cementing inequalities in children\u2019s lives before they\u2019ve even picked up a pencil,\u201d Sparkes said. \u201cUrgent government action is needed to address the gaps to stop families slipping through the net and to safeguard our babies and children\u2019s futures.\u201d"

            "content": "A private sector mental health provider has been hit with a \u00a31.53m fine after pleading guilty in a criminal prosecution brought by the Care Quality Commission over an inpatient\u2019s death. Cygnet Health Care pleaded guilty to the offence of failing to provide safe care and treatment at its Ealing hospital, after the death of a young woman who was able to take her own life there in July 2019. It is the largest fine for a mental health service as a result of a prosecution brought by CQC. It follows a \u00a31.5m fine against Essex Partnership University NHS foundation trust in 2021 for lapses in care that led to 11 deaths. Cygnet Health Care, which is owned by US firm Universal Health Services, acknowledged failing to provide a safe ward environment to reduce the risk of people being able to use a ligature, as well as not ensuring sufficient patient observations in line with the company\u2019s procedures and failures in training staff to be able to resuscitate patients in an emergency. In 2022, the Guardian revealed that coroners or inquest juries had identified serious failings in the care given to 11 inpatients who were in a Cygnet facility since 2012 and patients at other private mental health providers. In all, the NHS pays private hospitals about \u00a32bn a year for mental health services. The CQC brought the prosecution over the case of a young woman who was admitted to a ward in Cygnet Hospital Ealing in November 2018, but managed to take her life while on the ward eight months later . The CQC said Cygnet Ealing were aware the young woman had previously tried to harm herself in an almost identical way, but \u201cfailed to mitigate the known environmental risk she was exposed to\u201d. Had the company complied with its statutory obligations, \u201cthis young woman would not have been exposed to such a significant risk of harm,\u201d it added. Jane Ray, CQC deputy director of operations in London, said: \u201cPeople, especially those at such a frightening, vulnerable time in their life, should be able to expect safe care and treatment, so it\u2019s unacceptable that this young woman\u2019s safety wasn\u2019t well managed by Cygnet Hospital Ealing when she needed them the most. This is why I welcome their guilty plea. \u201cIt is also unacceptable that Cygnet Ealing failed to learn from earlier incidents, which could potentially have avoided this tragic outcome.\u201d A spokesperson for Cygnet said: \u201cWe would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family and all those affected by this very sad death. \u201cIn court the judge made clear this was not a case of the provider putting profit before safety, and both the judge and the CQC acknowledged the significant improvements and progress made by Cygnet since 2019.\u201d"

            "content": "Thank you for your article highlighting the challenges to mental health that many students may face and outlining potential self-help measures (Self-care to support: how to look after your mental health at university, 15 September). Sadly, it came a little too late for my son, who attempted suicide in June. He was supposedly at the end of his second year of a physics degree, but, unbeknown to me, he was withdrawn from the course last January for lack of attendance. He continued in his student digs, and in phone calls intimated to me that all was going more or less OK. He felt unable to open up to me, and his levels of desperation accumulated to breaking point. I am immensely grateful to the police, who attended him very promptly, and the ambulance service and the NHS for subsequent care. I do worry about the news that the police may now not respond to mental health scenarios. He is now at home, and gently considering future options with family and community support. In my search to understand, I can look to the fact that he completed his A-levels in the confusion of 2020, and also a past mental health episode in his early teens. He had been in contact with university support services through his first year. What I can\u2019t understand is how the university had no policy to contact his next of kin on withdrawing him from the course. If I had known about this, I would have been able to support him six months earlier. Yes, students are young adults, but I feel there should be higher level of duty of care that necessarily involves next of kin, particularly as most students are away from their home support networks. One can only hope that, with increasing awareness of these issues, similar future scenarios may be avoided.

            "date": "2023-09-05T04:00:21Z",
            "content": "A headteacher whose 830 pupils must learn semi-remotely for at least a term because of the schools concrete crisis has warned that the upheaval could cause a recurrence of the negative mental health impact of Covid lockdowns. James Saunders, the leader of Honywood school in Coggeshall, Essex, fears that year-seven students entering their first term at secondary school could face future struggles after the Department for Education last week ordered the closure of 22 classrooms as part of a nationwide safety alert. The 1960s school was built using the aerated concrete roof panels known as Raac, which have forced the partial or complete closure of more than 100 schools in England and Wales over fears of sudden collapse. Pupils at the school will be given a rota that means they will attend school on some days and work at home the rest of the time. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst time to be moving to remote learning,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cLet\u2019s put ourselves in the shoes of our year-sevens. That\u2019s a crucial time. It\u2019s a transition [from primary to secondary school] that can really affect their mental health going forward.\u201d He said there had been a clear knock-on effect on the mental health of some in the cohort who started secondary school during the pandemic lockdown of 2020. \u201cThat could happen again,\u201d he warned. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot tougher.\u201d UK government data from February and March 2021 shows that rates of probable mental disorder in children and young people increased between 2017 and 2021 from 12% to 17% among six-16-year-olds and from 10% to 17% among 17-19-year-olds. On Monday, Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, promised to publish a list of the affected schools before the end of the week. Over the weekend, the numbers grew as engineers continued inspections of a material that the Health and Safety Executive said \u201cis now life-expired\u201d and \u201cliable to collapse with little or no notice\u201d. Some schools face having to disturb asbestos to access the Raac, which requires specialist contractors and is likely to lead to further delays in reopening classrooms. Pupils in all years at Honywood will have to rely on iPads at home for the coming month for at least part of the time. It could take several months for props to be installed in the affected English, maths, modern languages and computing classrooms to make them temporarily safe. Pupils would then, in theory, be able to move back in, but in the longer term, the buildings will have to be vacated again for a permanent fix. Toilets, the staff room and photocopier room will also be out of action. Temporary buildings are being sought. It is a story being repeated across England and Wales. An estates manager in another area told the Guardian that the cost of fixing a single block made with the now out-of-date lightweight panels could easily hit \u00a31m. That is likely to raise the question of whether good money is being thrown after bad when schools from the 1960s, 70s and 80s also have leaks, problems with wiring and, in some cases, asbestos \u2013 a fire-retardant material that if disturbed can release fibres that cause the incurable lung cancer mesothelioma. Wholesale rebuilding could drive up the cost of the crisis well into hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when capital spending on schools in England has been falling in real terms. In 2021-22 capital spending by the Department for Education was about \u00a34.9bn, the lowest recorded since 2009-10, according to the House of Commons library. Treasury sources said at the weekend that spending would have to come out of the existing schools capital budget despite the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, vowing to \u201cspend what it takes\u201d. Steve Chalke, whose Oasis foundation runs 52 academies in England, many of which serve disadvantaged communities, said children from poorer families would suffer most from the coming disruption. \u201cThere\u2019s an impact on all children, but the greatest impact will be on the most disadvantaged. \u201cIt\u2019s a re-run of Covid. It\u2019s another reason why you can\u2019t be at school. If you are a two-income family, with a good house and the capacity to work from home, and money is no issue to you, you can devote time to your child\u2019s education. If you are not that family and the pursuit of cash consumes a whole lot more of your time and you have to be out to do your job, you are faced with a crisis.\u201d"

            "title": "Beware September: five cautionary tales from economic history",
            "date": "2023-09-01T05:00:05Z",
            "content": "Be afraid. That\u2019s the message from history to policymakers returning from holiday this week as they contemplate negotiating the trickiest few weeks of them all. For while TS Eliot called April the cruellest month in The Waste Land, in economics and finance that unwanted label would better be attached to September, the time of the year \u2013 from the 18th century to the modern day \u2013 when problems that have been quietly developing over the summer come to a head. As these five examples demonstrate, September can be the month when share prices crumble, banks wobble and currencies are devalued. 1. September 1720 and the collapse of the South Sea Bubble Even three centuries on, the rise and fall of the South Sea Company is the yardstick against which all subsequent speculative manias are judged. That\u2019s because this crisis had everything: a dodgy business prospectus; a company that was unable to generate the returns it was promising; the first example of what became known as a Ponzi scheme under which the company was buying its own stock to keep share prices high; groupthink; and investors left to rue their foolishness. The list of casualties when the share price collapsed from a high of \u00a31,000 included Sir Isaac Newton, who lost upwards of \u00a340m in today\u2019s money. The main beneficiary was Sir Robert Walpole, who as chancellor handled the crisis deftly and went on to become prime minister. Lesson to be learned: what goes up comes down. 2. September 1931 and the departure of sterling from the gold standard In the early years of the Great Depression, Britain and most other major countries were subject to the strictures of the gold standard, under which governments agreed to exchange their paper currency for a fixed amount of the precious metal. The gold standard ensured that countries facing balance of payments deficits could not devalue their way out of trouble but instead had to deflate their economies to regain competitiveness. Britain had suspended membership of the gold standard at the start of the first world war but rejoined in 1925. The result was slow growth, high unemployment and pressure for cuts in welfare spending to balance the budget. A minority Labour government collapsed under the strain and a new national government \u2013 still with Labour\u2019s Ramsay MacDonald at its head \u2013 bowed to the inevitable and came off the gold standard in September 1931. Other countries followed suit. Lesson to be learned: bad economics equals bad politics. 3. September 1992 and Black Wednesday Over the course of the 20th century, it was Labour governments that took the political flak for devaluation. The exception to that was the day speculators led by George Soros forced Britain out of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and inflicted a blow to John Major\u2019s Conservative administration from which it never recovered. Britain had joined the ERM in October 1990, less than two years previously, and was committed to keeping the pound within a set range against the German mark. The ERM effectively operated as a looser form of the gold standard and had many of the same defects. Pressure on the pound intensified as the UK struggled with recession at a time when reunification led to higher German interest rates. Soros and his fellow speculators saw the pound as a one-way bet and on Black Wednesday (16 September 1992) they were proven right. After announcing that interest rates would be raised to 15% to defend sterling, resistance crumbled and the pound was allowed to float. Economic recovery followed swiftly but Major\u2019s reputation was permanently tarnished. Lesson to be learned: be careful of importing your economic policy from overseas. 4. September 2008: Lehman Brothers and the near death of the global banking system The global financial crisis had actually begun more than a year earlier but culminated with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, a middle-ranking US investment bank, on September 2008. Lehmans came to symbolise everything that had gone wrong across the banking sector: institutions had taken big bets on the US housing market, creating new opaque and complex financial instruments that magnified gains in the good times but left them exposed when the market turned down. Investors were unsure which banks were nursing the losses so assumed that all of them were in the same boat. Banks lacked the capital to cover their potential losses and when the US government allowed Lehmans to go to the wall panic set in. Even the most powerful banks were seen as vulnerable and ultimately governments were forced to step in with injections of public money. In the UK, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds were partly nationalised, while central banks slashed interest rates to mitigate the economic fallout. Fifteen years later, the banks look healthier but the global economy has never fully recovered. Lesson to be learned: A bubble is a bubble so never believe people who say: \u201cIt\u2019s different this time.\u201d 5. September 2022 and the short-lived premiership of Liz Truss. As a historian, Kwasi Kwarteng ought to have been aware of the perils of September but Liz Truss\u2019s chancellor was eager to make his mark quickly after being appointed in the month. Kwarteng sacked the Treasury\u2019s top mandarin, Tom Scholar, decided not to run his proposals past the government\u2019s spending watchdog and then seemed surprised when the biggest package of tax cuts in 50 years was greeted with the loudest of raspberries from the financial markets. The plan to kickstart Britain\u2019s sluggish economy was an instant flop. Within a week the pound had fallen to its lowest ever level against the US dollar and the Bank of England was forced to launch an emergency bailout of the UK pensions industry. Mortgage rates soared, and Kwarteng was summoned home from a meeting of the International Monetary Fund to be sacked by Truss, who was forced out shortly afterwards. Orthodoxy returned under Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt, who became the fourth chancellor of 2022. Lesson to be learned: Mess with the financial markets at your peril."

            "title": "Liz Truss blames \u2018groupthink\u2019 for economic damage under her watch",
            "date": "2023-09-18T16:55:08Z",
            "content": "Liz Truss has set out her intent to be the Conservatives\u2019 beacon for lower taxes and smaller government despite her disastrous 49 days inside No 10, arguing that the economic damage under her rule was largely the fault of \u201cgroupthink\u201d from officials and the media. In a pugnacious and lengthy Q&amp;A after a speech in London, and taking notably more questions than she did as prime minister, Truss promised to push her message at the Conservative party conference in Manchester next month, which she will then expand on in a book. While she was careful not to directly criticise Rishi Sunak, Truss strongly implied the prime minister was part of a failed economic model backed up by the Bank of England, Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and others. Truss took some responsibility for the markets crisis that followed her government\u2019s tax-cutting mini-budget almost exactly a year ago \u2013 \u201clots of people made lots of mistakes\u201d \u2013 but said the main blame was with the Bank for allowing artificially low interest rates for too long. Truss\u2019s intervention, and pledge to continue to push for economic ideas that she said \u201caren\u2019t fashionable on the London dinner party circuit\u201d, prompted some strong criticism, including from a few fellow Conservative MPs. Conor Burns said Truss\u2019s best contribution to the party would be \u201csustained silence\u201d, while Damian Green said he was \u201cglad she\u2019s not responsible\u201d for this year\u2019s budget. Asked if the economic record of her time in office had damaged the Conservative brand, Truss accused the questioner of echoing opposition ideas. \u201cI really want to challenge this phrase, \u2018crashed the economy\u2019,\u201d she told the Institute for Government event. \u201cThe fact is that since I left office, both mortgage rates and gilt rates have gone higher than they were at the time of the mini-budget. So I just think you are repeating a line to take from Labour.\u201d The Bank of England had been \u201cpumping the system full of money\u201d, keeping interest rates low, and allowing \u201cexcessive government spending\u201d, Truss argued. \u201cInterest rates were going to go up anyway,\u201d she added. \u201cI think the real failure was not to tell people, years and years ago, that interest rates were artificially low. That was the problem. \u201cWe gave people an expectation that cheap money would go on for ever. And then when the interest rates went up, there was a problem.\u201d Asked why she did not have the OBR assess the mini-budget before it was delivered, Truss said it had not been asked to check much bigger spending commitments during Covid. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s interesting that media organisations choose to target the mini-budget for not having an OBR forecast, but don\u2019t mention this when it\u2019s about spending,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think that reveals a mindset, which is: spending is good. They will always be relaxed about that, but cutting taxes is somehow a countercultural thing to do. I think that\u2019s reflected in the media. I think it\u2019s reflected in the polity more broadly.\u201d Truss also accused the OBR of leaking calculations that there was a \u00a370bn hole in the mini-budget to try to undermine her. The OBR denied this, saying it had given any forecasts it made only to the Treasury. Asked for examples of the civil service trying to block change, Truss said it was more a case of \u201cwarnings and back-covering\u201d. She said: \u201cWith anything to do with climate change, officials were enthusiastic and rush to get out papers. If it was something about doing the [migration] deal with Rwanda, there was less enthusiasm.\u201d While arguing that financial markets were necessarily influenced by politics, Truss conceded that she misjudged their likely response: \u201cIf we\u2019d known the fragility of the markets we would have done things differently. These kind of questions are quite difficult because a lot of it, the way I did things, was basically the way I am, and my character.\u201d Asked if she accepted the view of many Tory MPs that her government had been fundamentally incompetent, Truss said: \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t want to do is point fingers. Of course, it was a very difficult circumstance and lots of people made lots of mistakes. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d"

            "title": "Germany will suffer worst from world economic slowdown, says OECD ",
            "date": "2023-09-19T09:00:53Z",
            "content": "Germany is expected to experience the heaviest blow from a slowdown in the world economy driven by higher interest rates and weaker global trade, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has warned. In downbeat forecasts for the world economy, the Paris-based organisation said Europe\u2019s largest economy was likely to be the only G20 country apart from Argentina to shrink this year during a wider international slowdown. The organisation left its 2023 forecasts for UK growth unchanged at 0.3%, the third weakest in the G20 outside of Germany and Argentina. It cut its estimate for UK growth in 2024 from 1% to 0.8%, with only Argentina weaker in the G20. The UK is expected to have the highest inflation in the G20 after Turkey and Argentina, with an average rate for 2023 of 7.2%, before dropping closer to the middle of the pack with a rate of 2.9% expected in 2024. After a stronger-than-expected start to 2023, helped by lower energy prices and China\u2019s easing of Covid restrictions, the OECD said activity across leading countries was slowing towards the end of the year before a weaker 2024. The impact of higher interest rates to tackle sky-high inflation after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has added to pressure on households and businesses, while Germany\u2019s manufacturing-heavy economy grapples with weaker global trade volumes. Growth in China \u2013 an important German trade partner \u2013 had been weaker than anticipated, according to the OECD, while economic activity across Europe was under strain from stubborn inflation and higher interest rates. Cutting the growth forecasts in its interim economic outlook, it said Germany\u2019s economy was on track to shrink by 0.2% this year, down from an estimate for zero growth made in June. It also issued Germany with the sharpest downgrade among EU countries covered in the report for 2024, forecasting growth of 0.9%, down from a previous estimate of 1.3%. Clare Lombardelli, the OECD chief economist, said: \u201cYou\u2019re seeing weaker growth across all of Europe but Germany is probably the largest example. You\u2019re seeing the impact of inflation on real incomes. That\u2019s been suppressing consumer demand. And you\u2019re seeing impact of monetary policy tightening. \u201cGermany, perhaps more than other EU economies, is affected by the slowdown in China. It exports a lot to China, as well as imports, so it\u2019s a combination of factors.\u201d She said the OECD did not anticipate recessions across any of the big economies, although cautioned activity would remain weak and warned there were risks to the forecast if inflation remained stubbornly high or activity in China deteriorated further. Households and businesses remained under pressure from high interest rates. \u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet on inflation. It\u2019s far too soon to declare victory,\u201d she said. Overall, the OECD expects growth across the world economy to remain sub-par this year and next, with growth of 3% in 2023 before a slowdown to 2.7% in 2024. While inflation was subsiding, it said pressures were persistent in many economies \u2013 held up by cost pressures and high company profit margins in some sectors. The body representing 38 of the world\u2019s richest countries urged central banks to keep interest rates in \u201crestrictive\u201d territory until there were clear signs that underlying inflationary pressures were fading. However, this would add to the risk of weaker economic growth by hitting business and consumer confidence. Economists anticipate the world\u2019s leading central banks are nearing the end of the most aggressive cycle of interest rate hikes in decades, amid growing concerns over the impact of previous increases hitting economic activity. The European Central Bank last week increased rates to the highest level since the creation of the euro in 1999. The US Federal Reserve is expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged on Wednesday, while the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates for the final time in the current cycle on Thursday after 14 increases. Lombardelli said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing monetary policy having an impact. It\u2019s reining in demand \u2013 that\u2019s necessary to tackle this inflation challenge \u2013 but it means we have lower growth.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-13T10:47:57Z",
            "content": "The Liberal MP Julian Leeser says a voice to parliament is not about \u201cspecial treatment or privileges\u201d but about getting Indigenous Australians \u201cto the same starting line that other Australians are at\u201d. Amid rising partisan rancour in the referendum debate, with his own side leading the charge for the no campaign, Leeser told parliament he supported the voice because it was a manifestation of \u201cdeeply Liberal and conservative ideas\u201d. Leeser resigned in April as the shadow attorney general and shadow minister for Indigenous Australians after the Coalition decided to oppose an Indigenous voice in the constitution. He used the adjournment debate on Wednesday night to share an anecdote about a constituent querying why he was supporting the constitutionally enshrined Indigenous advisory body \u201cwhen the economy is so tight\u201d. The Liberal MP said the question was entirely legitimate, but he was supporting the voice to parliament because \u201cmy concern, as a Liberal, is that Indigenous Australians are not sharing in this country\u2019s opportunities\u201d. Leeser said establishing a constitutionally enshrined advisory body was about \u201cIndigenous children, their lives and their future; and trying to create the conditions so that Indigenous children can walk confidently in two worlds\u201d. It was also about \u201cempowerment, respect and the strengthening of Indigenous civic infrastructure, all within our democratic system\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He said the disconnect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia was \u201cthe root cause of the economic disconnection in Indigenous communities and lives\u201d. \u201cIn our country, the Indigenous employment rate is around 49% \u2013 this compares with 75% for non-Indigenous Australians,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of household income, the latest data of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found that 43% of Indigenous adults receive a total weekly pre-tax income of $500 a week or less. The poverty line in Australia is $489 a week for a single person. Almost one in two Indigenous adults live on the poverty line.\u201d He said closing the gap meant creating opportunity. It meant \u201cjobs, not welfare. It\u2019s about universities not prisons.\u201d Leeser said the referendum on 14 October offered Australians a moment of shared understanding. He said empathy was often defined as identifying with people \u201cjust like us\u201d when the concept demanded something \u201cbigger\u201d. Empathy was \u201cnot about accepting and embracing people because we can see ourselves in them \u2013 it is about standing with people and their right to dignity, freedom and self-expression when we can\u2019t see the similarities\u201d. \u201cI want to invite all Australians to lift up their eyes, and despite their own challenges, to see the gap that does not close,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a moment of empathy \u2013 a moment of shared understanding \u2013 and a moment of consequence. I hope that we seize it.\u201d Leeser\u2019s appeal follows intensifying confrontations between the Albanese government and the opposition about the voice. The current parliamentary sitting week is the last time the chambers will sit before the referendum vote. On Wednesday, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, declared the Liberal leader Peter Dutton\u2019s campaigning against the proposal was adding \u201cmore poison into the well\u201d, which sparked uproar on the opposition benches. Dutton accused the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney \u2013 the focal point of the Coalition\u2019s parliamentary questions about the proposal \u2013 of \u201creading from a script\u201d. Burney characterised the looming referendum as a one-time chance to achieve appropriate recognition for First Nations people and to establish a new mechanism for listening at the national level. She said the opportunity for a voice would be \u201cgone forever\u201d if the no campaign prevailed."

            "title": "Arm shares set to soar as UK chipmaker joins the Nasdaq \u2013 business live",
            "date": "2023-09-14T20:27:41Z",
            "content": "And finally\u2026. Arm\u2019s shares have closed tonight at $63.59, a gain of almost 25% on the $51 at which Softbank sold equity in its UK chip designer. That means Arm has ended its first day on the US stock market with a valuation of over $65bn. That may encourage further technology firms to float in the months ahead, after a fairly dry year for IPOs (especially in Britain). Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital LLC, says: \u201cThe game is back on. Capital markets are open for business. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see so many IPOs in the next 12 weeks your head is going to spin.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story, on a memorable day for the UK chip designer: On that note, goodnight. GW With less than 90 minutes trading to go, Arm is on track for a positive first day on the US market: The British chip designer Arm looked set to be valued at more than $60bn as it debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange in the biggest US share listing of the year. Arm set a price of $51 a share, valuing the company at $54.5bn on Wednesday. But as trading began on Thursday morning, investor appetite for the company\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) pushed its share price up 10% to $56.10, valuing the company at just below $60bn. It later rose by as much as 20% up, before settling back at 17% up, giving a valuation of around $64bn. Founded in Cambridge in 1990 as Advanced Risc Machines, Arm supplies chipmakers with circuit designs and is the dominant supplier to the mobile phone market with its circuitry in 99% of smartphones. Japanese investment company SoftBank bought Arm for \u00a324bn ($32bn) in 2016. Arm\u2019s share price in early trading gave the company a market capitalisation of $63.6bn based on shares outstanding, or nearly $66.2bn on a fully diluted basis, the Financial Times reports. More here. Wall Stret is rallying today, as investors take their lead from the gains in Europe earlier. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently up 319 points, or 0.9%, at 34,894 points, with traders also cheered by Arm\u2019s IPO. George Sweeney DipFA, deputy editor at the personal finance comparison site, finder.com, reminds us that London missed out on the Arm IPO \u2013 with Softbank preferring to list in New York. Sweeney writes: A surprisingly strong start to trading for Arm has seen its share price break the $60 mark, substantially above what most analysts predicted. This could be partly due to the fact that the IPO became oversubscribed, providing leverage to demand a higher price. Even so, Owners of Arm (SoftBank) had been pushing for an even higher valuation after it paid $16bn to acquire 25% of Arm from one of its own venture capital funds, Vision Fund. Although this is an exciting opportunity to invest in a chipmaker in its early stages, it will be a tough challenge for Arm to grow and keep pace with the more well-established global players. As an example, Nvidia grew 127% in their first year of trading back in 1999 and is now a much larger business than Arm. Retail investors should also be alert to the risk of Arm\u2019s stock price falling back after this initial flurry of interest. Amidst all the noise of this IPO, it\u2019s worth remembering that listing on the FTSE could have been a logical move for the british-based firm and it would have been the one of the largest 14 constituents of the FTSE 100 based on its live market cap. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case and is a reminder of the struggles that London is having post-Brexit. Today\u2019s jump in Arm\u2019s share price, currently up 18% at just over $60, lifts the company\u2019s value to over $60bn. Here are the key points on today\u2019s Arm stock market flotation, from Josh Warner, market analyst at City Index: The Arm IPO was priced at $51 per share, giving it a $54.5 billion valuation. Current owner Softbank has listed less than 10% of Arm\u2019s float, and a large chunk of this is expected to have been snapped-up by major tech companies that are Arm customers. Based on its most recent annual earnings, Arm is coming to market with a valuation multiple of around 98x \u2013 three-times the average on the Nasdaq 100. Arm shares are rising in initial trade but are proving volatile. Arm is underpinning its valuation on new prospects stemming from a shift in strategy that will see it design more comprehensive, advanced and financially-rewarding chips rather than the business as it is today. Rising US-China tensions may cause concern for Arm as it threatens to disrupt its second largest market. Following a heavily oversubscribed IPO, ARM has started its first day of trading with a bang, says Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot. This will delight Softbank, which still owns around 90% of Arm, and also the cornerstone investors from the big tech world who have backed the IPO. Barringer adds: \u201cNow much of this is clearly hype and a bit of market froth, particularly as it has been starved of high profile IPOs in recent years. But with interest rates seeming to have peaked, growth companies are coming back into vogue at a time when artificial intelligence threatens to change the world as we know it. With only 10% of the company up for grabs in this IPO, pricing in the early stages will be quite volatile, so we won\u2019t know the true value for some time. For example, ARM\u2019s Q3 results won\u2019t be until 14th November. However, investors, and especially those in big tech, clearly recognise ARM\u2019s unique status. Its licensing and royalty business model gives it clear sight of its earnings and will sustain it even in difficult environments. Not only that, it has invested heavily and diversified its offering since being acquired by Softbank and has also continued to have an entrenched and dominant position in smartphone processors. Expectations are big for Arm, though, and growth is expected to accelerate quickly in 2024. Barringer explains: Margins could go as high as 60% in the long-term if it can continue to grow its market share, expand its offering and increases its royalty rates. \u201cThere are clearly risks around ARM China and the Softbank\u2019s 90% stock overhang. However, this is a strong start and will be a key indicator for more tech firms looking to come to the public markets. ARM will be the story to watch for the rest of the year and beyond.\u201d Arm\u2019s shares are racing higher on the Nasdaq \u2013 they\u2019re now up 20%, at over $61 per share. Newsflash: shares in Arm have opened sharply above the chipmaker\u2019s IPO price, as Wall Street traders scramble for a piece of the UK chipmaker. Reuters reports that Arm Holdings have opened at $56.10 each in its Nasdaq debut, a day after owner Softbank sold shares at $51 each. That\u2019s an increase of 10% on the IPO price, which was itself at the top of Softbank\u2019s range, and valued the company at over $52bn. Today\u2019s opening price values Arm at $57.5bn, by my maths. This strong interest is partly because Softbank, which acquired Arm in 2016, is only floating around 10% of the business on the US stock market. My colleague Hibaq Farah writes: The chip designer predicts on its website that 70% of the world\u2019s population use Arm-based technology. Without its designs, the iPhone and other smartphones would not work. The global chip powerhouse employs more than 5,000 people. Arm\u2019s valuation is exceedingly high for a chip company when compared with other firms in its market, other than semiconductor-maker Nvidia, which is worth more than $1tn. A billboard at the Nasdaq stock market is showing information about Arm Holdings\u2019 initial public offering today: Newsflash: The UK\u2019s blue-chip stock index has just posted its best day of the year so far. The FTSE 100 index has closed 147 points higher at 7673 points, a gain of 1.95%. That\u2019s its biggest percentage jump since last November, and takes the Footsie to its highest closing level since the start of August. The rally was led by mining companies such as Anglo American (+7.7%), Rio Tinto (+4.7%) and Glencore (+4.3%). Shares soared today after China\u2019s central bank cut the amount of cash that Chinese banks must hold as reserves, in an attempt to stimulate lending and support economic growth. Investors were also cheered by hopes that the European Central Bank may have finished raising eurozone interest rates, following today\u2019s hike. Arm\u2019s flotation (once its shares actually start trading\u2026) will set the tone on Wall Street, points out New York Times writer Erin Griffith: Arm shares are on track to jump sharply, as they make their debut on the tech-focused Nasdaq index today. Reuters reports that Arm Holdings shares are currently indicated to open at $58.01. That would be a 13% increase on the $51 per share which investors bought stock in its IPO. The ECB is walking on \u201ca very treacherous path right now\u201d, warns Cl\u00e9mence Dachicourt, senior portfolio manager at Morningstar Investment Consulting France. Economic growth in the Euro-zone has come to a halt, expectations for future growth prospects are bleak, yet core inflation remains stubbornly high and way significantly above the central bank\u2019s 2% target. While this draws the effectiveness of the ECB\u2019s rate hikes into question, the central bank will certainly want to avoid errors of the past when it decided to raise interest rates in July 2008, at the same time as the global economy was heading into one of the biggest financial crises, or again in 2011 just before the Eurozone crisis. Going forward, the European Central Bank may decide to be more considerate about underlying economic growth and pause interest rate hikes to avoid precipitating the zone into a deep recession.\u201d The euro continues to lose ground against the US dollar, now down three-quarters of a cent at $1.066. The European Central Bank is raising interest rates into a recession, fears Felix Feather, economic analyst at investment company abrdn. Feather explains: The decision comes despite very weak activity data in recent months. It is our belief that the ECB are continuing to hike rates into a recession that is probably already underway. The latest hike could make this downturn deeper and the recovery slower. Despite losing out in the rate decision, it appears the bank\u2019s doves were able to secure a dovish framing in which the hike was delivered. Indeed, it appears the bank now considers its hiking cycle over (barring any big surprises). We think this will indeed be the final rate hike of this cycle. However, we do expect cuts in 2024 when the effects of the upcoming recession on the labour market and consumer prices become apparent.\u201d Today\u2019s ECB interest rate rise is a \u201cdovish hike\u201d, declares Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies. Kumar explains: The statement reads like a one and done hike from the ECB. Key statement change suggests that Governing Council considers that the key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target. Growth forecasts were lowered and more importantly inflation forecasts were lowered for 2024 and 2025. But, Jeffferies does not predict interest rate cuts anytime soon, indeed not until the second half of next year. Kumar adds: We believe rate cuts will be a H2 24 story. Over in New York, executives from UK chip designer Arm have just rung the Nasdaq opening bell, to mark its stock market flotation. Cambridge-based Arm, owned by Japanese giant Softbank, is joining the US stock market with a valuation of around $52.3bn. Last night it priced its shares at the top of its expected range, $51 each, having seen strong interest from investors. This makes Arm\u2019s float the biggest IPO of 2023 so far \u2013 in a year when flotations have been relatively rare, due to market volatility. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says all eyes in the equities world are on Arm today as it goes public, adding: The company set its IPO price to $51 a share. It\u2019s at the top end of the proposed price range, but still lower than the valuation of $64bn when Softbank bought out a stake from Vision Fund. Today\u2019s eurozone interest rate rise is the tenth consecutive time the ECB has tightened monetary policy. points out Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor. She adds: Meanwhile the central bank issued some gloomy forecasts on the economy, cutting its 2023-24 growth outlook and raising its inflation guidance for next year, suggesting price pressures will take longer to shake off than previously anticipated. Inflation is expected to be at 5.6% in 2023, 3.2% in 2024 and finally around target at 2.1% by 2025. The ECB began tightening later than the Fed and the Bank of England, landing it behind the curve, which forced the central bank into acting more swiftly. But that aggressive policy has had consequences for the euro zone economy with Germany potentially heading into a recession. With sluggish growth and increased labour market slack, the more dovish ECB rate setters believed a pause would have been more appropriate, but the governing council decided to prioritise tackling inflation, even if it comes at a cost to the economy. Looking ahead, the recent rally in oil prices is likely to muddy the picture for the ECB by standing in the way of the eurozone\u2019s disinflationary path. Government bond yields in the euro zone fell despite another hike from the ECB. Price action in the bond market reflects the ECB\u2019s signalling that it is probably at the end of this tightening cycle, even though inflation for August hit 5.3%, still sharply above its 2% target. ECB President Lagarde said she expect inflation to fall in the coming months. And no doubt the governing council is also worried about a significant slowdown in the euro zone economy, given the weakness in recent indicators.\u201d \u201cWe are not saying that we are now at peak [interest rates],\u201d Christine Lagarde adds. Q: Is today\u2019s interest rate increase a \u2018dovish hike\u2019 \u2013 is this the end of the rate hiking cycle, or do you leave the door open? Christine Lagarde points to the line in today\u2019s statement, that the ECB will take a data-dependant approach about how high interest rates should rise, and how long they should remain there. Q: Did you discuss how long rates would have to stay at their peak level? Lagarde says the ECB did not discuss how long would be long enough \u2013 because policymakers will remain \u2018data dependent\u2019. Christine Lagarde, ECB president, is taking questions now, and reveals that today\u2019s decision to raise interest rates was not unanimous. Q: How did the discussion go, between the hawks and doves on the ECB\u2019s governing council? Lagarde says policymakers had \u201ca lot of data\u201d, and a lot of analysis from ECB staff, which was looked at \u201cvery closely\u201d, at presentations lasting many hours. But, she says, \u201csome members did not draw the same conclusion\u201d. Some governors would have preferred to pause, to wait until they had \u201cmore certainty, more intelligence\u201d, and seen the impact of previous interest rate hikes. [that\u2019s because monetary. policy acts with a lag \u2013 it takes time for higher interest rates to influence the real economy]. Lagarde says: There was a solid majority of the governors to agree with the decision that we have made\u2026. There are a few members in the governing council who would have preferred another one [another decision]. She insists it was not an adversarial discussion. Here are the ECB\u2019s new, downgraded, growth forecasts\u2026. \u2026. and its new, higher inflation forecasts: ECB president Christine Lagarde is holding a press conference now, to explain today\u2019s interest rate decision. Lagarde tells reporters that the eurozone economy is likely to remain subdued in the coming months. It broadly stagnated over the first half of the year, and recent indicators suggest it has also been weak in the third quarter. Growth is being dampened by lower demand for eurozone exports and the impact of tight financing conditions, says Lagarde, adding that the services sector is now weakening. But, she says economic momentum should pick up as real incomes rise (ie, wages rising faster than inflation). After a brief jump, the euro has now fallen by half a cent against the US dollar to $1.0674. Interest rate rises should, classically, boost a currency. But today, traders are noting the ECB\u2019s point that interest rates are now high enough to make a \u2018substantial contribution\u2019 to bringing inflation down to its 2% target. More economists are predicting that today\u2019s ECB interest rate hike will be the last in this cycle. Mike Bell, global liquidity market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, explains: \u201cWith the business surveys indicating an imminent sharp slowdown in growth, the ECB are probably done hiking. \u201cThe new orders component of the latest business surveys were very weak. Incoming new business for the service sector is contracting now, joining new orders for the manufacturing sector in the doldrums. But while the ECB could hit the pause button now, eurozone households and companies may face a wait until rates fall. Bell says: \u201cAgainst the weaker growth backdrop, the ECB can probably pause at the next meeting and if the growth outlook continues to deteriorate a pause could morph into a peak. \u201cHowever, unless unemployment rises sharply and rapidly, the outlook for Eurozone interest rates could end up looking like table mountain with rates on hold for quite some time.\u201d The fear of not getting inflation fully under control and the risk of stopping too early must have over-riden the rising recession risk in the eurozone and prompted today\u2019s ECB interest rate rise, says Carsten Brzeski, ING\u2019s global head of macro. Brzeski adds: The ECB only has one job and this job is to maintain price stability. The eurozone has not seen price stability in almost three years. And even if the inflation surge is mainly due to factors outside of the ECB\u2019s direct reach, the Bank simply has to show its determination to stamp it out. That this approach will eventually push the eurozone economy into a more severe slowdown does not matter to the ECB, at least not for now. Looking ahead, a further weakening of the economy and more traction in a disinflationary trend will make it very hard to find arguments for yet another rate hike before the end of the year. The remark in the official communication that \u201cbased on its current assessment, the Governing Council considers that the key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target\u201d shows that today\u2019s rate hike looks like the last. Today\u2019s hike isn\u2019t only a credibility booster, it will also be the last in the current cycle. Today\u2019s ECB announcement also contains a hint that eurozone interest rates are now at or at least near their peak. The ECB says: Based on its current assessment, the Governing Council considers that the key ECB interest rates have reached levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to the timely return of inflation to the target. The Governing Council\u2019s future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. The ECB adds that its Governing Council will continue to follow \u201ca data-dependent approach\u201d to determining the appropriate level of interest rates, and how long they stay in restrictive levels. European Central Bank policymakers have also cut their forecast for growth in the eurozone, due to the impact of higher interest rates. They say: The Governing Council\u2019s past interest rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully. Financing conditions have tightened further and are increasingly dampening demand, which is an important factor in bringing inflation back to target. With the increasing impact of this tightening on domestic demand and the weakening international trade environment, ECB staff have lowered their economic growth projections significantly. The ECB now expect the euro area economy to expand by just 0.7% in 2023, down from the 0.9% growth forecast in June. Expected growth in 2024 has been downgraded to 1.0% from 1.5% three months ago, while 2025\u2019s forecast has been trimmed to 1.5% growth from 1.6%. Today\u2019s ECB decision has been seen as a knife-edge call, with some economists predicting that the central bank might have left interest rates on hold. Dean Turner, chief eurozone and UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts that today\u2019s increase will be the last in the current cycle. Turner explains: The ECB didn\u2019t blink in the face of growing speculation that it would hit pause on the rate-hiking cycle. To be sure, economic data have raised questions about the health of the economy, but it is clear that still high inflation trumps these concerns. We expect this to be the last hike from the ECB in this cycle, but that does not mean the era of tight monetary policy is over. Interest rates are likely to remain at these levels well into next year. Moreover, the ECB will continue to, and may even accelerate, the shrinking of its balance sheet. The euro has been caught in the crosshairs leading up to this decision, and today\u2019s hike should provide some short-term relief. But with investors stuck in the \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they?\u201d debate about the US Federal Reserve\u2019s next move, this may not last. We still see the euro higher against the US dollar next year, but investors will need more confidence that rates have peaked before they can look towards the next phase of the economic cycle, which should favour cyclical currencies like the euro. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has raised interest rates in the eurozone, as it continues its fight against inflation. The ECB\u2019s Governing Council has decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, or a quarter of one percent, after concluding that inflation will be higher than it had expected. Announcing the move, it says: Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. This lifts the bank\u2019s benchmark deposit facility rate, which is paid to commercial banks when they deposit money with the central bank overnight, to 4% from 3.75%, a record high. The EBC\u2019s main refinancing rate, which provide the bulk of liquidity to the banking system, has risen from 4.25% to 4.5%. The marginal lending facility, charged when banks borrow from the ECB, has risen to 4.75%. The ECB has also lifted its inflation forecasts for this year, and next year, saying: The September ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area see average inflation at 5.6% in 2023, 3.2% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025. This is an upward revision for 2023 and 2024 and a downward revision for 2025. The upward revision for 2023 and 2024 mainly reflects a higher path for energy prices. Tensions between Beijing and Brussels have escalated after the European Commission announced yesterday it would launch an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese electric vehicles that are \u201cdistorting\u201d the EU market. China\u2019s commerce ministry has warned today that the investigation, into Chinese electric vehicles believed to have benefited from state subsidies, will have a \u201cnegative\u201d impact on economic and trade ties. In a statement, the ministry said: \u201cChina believes the investigative measures proposed by the European Union are in reality to protect its own industry in the name of \u2018fair competition\u2019.\u201d \u201cIt is a naked protectionist act that will seriously disrupt and distort the global automotive industry and supply chain, including the EU, and will have a negative impact on China-EU economic and trade relations.\u201d European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced the investigation on Wednesday, to examine if punitive tariffs should be introduced to protect EU producers from a \u201cflood\u201d of cheaper Chinese EV imports. More UK households missed direct debit payments last month, as they came under growing financial strain. The number of missed bill payments was 14% higher in August than a year ago, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows. The percentage of failed direct debits - mostly used for utility bills or mortgage and credit card repayments - rose from 0.82% in July to 0.83% in August. A year ago, in August 2022, the rate was 0.73%. On a monthly basis, though, missed direct debit paymenrs have been \u201cbroadly unchanged since March 2023\u201d, the ONS said. In January, the rate hit 0.94%, as households ran out of money following Christmas spending. Over in China, policymakers have just announced new measures to stimulate its economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China has cut the amount of cash which lenders must hold in reserve for the second time this year, as it tries to bolster the country\u2019s economic recovery. (This is Graeme Wearden taking over from Kalyeena). The business department has released new quarterly data for the \u00a377bn the total drawn value Covid loan schemes, which were meant to keep businesses afloat during the pandemic lockdowns. Most strikingly, they show that commercial banks \u2013 which distributed the government-backed loans to firms \u2013 flagged around \u00a31.69bn of those loans for suspected fraud. That marks a 43% rise from the \u00a31.1bn flagged three months earlier, and means that taxpayers could be on the hook for more than the government last estimated (based on the business department\u2019s 2021-2022 annual report). The figures are becoming clearer as businesses start to repay the loans. And the fraud issue has been divisive. While the government credits the programme with having saved 500,000 businesses and 2.9m jobs through the Covid crisis, it prompted former Cabinet Office minister Theodore Agnew to resign in protest in January 2022, citing the government\u2019s \u201cwoeful\u201d efforts to control potential fraud. The business department\u2019s last set of estimates suggested taxpayers will be left nursing about \u00a31.1bn in losses due to error and fraud by scammers \u2013 including disqualified directors reported to have spent tens of thousands of pounds worth of government-backed loans on anything from a Range Rover to pornographic websites. We\u2019re still waiting on the business department\u2019s latest annual report \u2013 which was tipped to be released today but may be delayed \u2013 to give some indication of the government\u2019s own figures and forecasts for fraud and error. Stay tuned. Back to the hottest IPO of the year. Some market players are expecting Arm shares to climb when they start trading on Wall Street this afternoon. New Street Research, for example, has initiated a buy rating, setting a target price of $59 each. That is compared to the $51 starting price, which was already at the top of Arm\u2019s own range. And no surprise, then, that Wall Street is expected to rise at the open, given the anticipation of Arm\u2019s debut on the Nasdaq: Nasdaq futures are up 0.33% at 15,605 points Dow futures are up 0.26% at 35,009 points S&amp;P 500 futures are up 0.33% at 4,532 points The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to increase interest rates across the 20-member euro currency zone in a few hours time. Speeches and question and answer sessions with ECB council members over rent months have shown a strong leaning towards tightening monetary policy to kill off any signs of inflation. Analysts at UBS said they expect a 0.25 percentage point rate hike to 4% and for this to be the peak. If we are wrong and the ECB leaves rates on hold, we would expect it to keep the door open for an October hike. The key reason why we expect the ECB to deliver a final hike next week is that we anticipate the its new staff macroeconomic projections to show a 2025 inflation forecast that is still above 2%. Like the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, the ECB\u2019s policy makers say \u201cprice stability is best maintained by aiming for 2% inflation over the medium term\u201d. Over in the oil industry, refinery workers at the Fawley Esso oil refinery in Hampshire are balloting to strike over pay. Around 300 engineering construction workers, who are employed as contractors to carry out essential repairs and maintenance, are being balloted, Unite the union said. The contractors are angry that, even though oil industry profits have surged, the value of their pay has been falling progressively since the pandemic, Unite explained. Workers have so far rejected a two-year deal, averaging 6% per year, for 2024 and 2025. If the ballot is successful, strike action is scheduled to start by late October. Any strike action is expected to cause \u201csignificant disruption at the site\u201d, the union said. Unite national officer Jason Poulter said: The anger amongst our membership is such that we are balloting for strike action. The Engineering Construction Industry Association must acknowledge that without a better offer, falling recruitment and retention for NAECI (National Agreement for the Engineering Construction Industry) roles will only get worse. Any disruption caused by potential strikes lies squarely at their door \u2013 a much improved offer needs to be put forward if this dispute is not to escalate into industrial action. On Christmas trading: John Lewis Partnership bosses said the consumer environment was still \u201creasonably tough\u201d but they were hearing that people are very much looking forward to a good celebration at Christmas, and expected the shopping season to be a \u201cgood event\u201d with \u201cgreat availability.\u201d \u201cWe, as a team, feel we have the right skills and capability to deliver the performance that we need,\u201d they added. More on shoplifting: reporters have asked bosses about the impact of organised crime gangs, and whether there were any particular regions or stores being targeted. John Lewis Partnership chair Sharon White said the partnership, and retailers more widely, have unfortunately seen much more organised crime \u2013 rather than opportunistic shoplifting or those linked to cost of living pressures. That has resulted in gangs going store to store to shoplift. It\u2019s \u201calmost become a job\u201d she said, and this was partly why her team have been calling for a change in legislation that would make it a criminal offence to abuse shop workers. And that ends the JLP press conference. No clear answer on whether the John Lewis Partnership is likely to make a full year profit. Finance director Berangere Michel said that while John Lewis has a great autumn season ahead and is hoped to continue its success in fashion, they know customers \u201care feeling the pinch\u201d. Therefore it\u2019s difficult to give more specific guidance in relation to numbers, Michel said. The John Lewis Partnership said it also struggled from a jump in shoplifting. Financial director Berangere Michel said that theft in the first half of 2023 was up by \u00a312m year-on-year. However, despite its ongoing losses, bosses said they are not considering shutting any Waitrose or John Lewis shopfronts. While they will always review the format of their stores, and review their properties regularly, bosses insisted there are \u201cno planned closures.\u201d John Lewis bosses have also been asked when they\u2019ll appoint someone permanently to run department store John Lewis, given that Naomi Simcock is only serving in an interim basis. But unfortunately, no update yet (including on whether Simcock could end up taking the role permanently). John Lewis bosses have insisted that despite the delay to the turnaround plan deadline, they expect the group \u201cwill return to profit much earlier than that.\u201d But how much earlier, is still TBC. Full story: Losses at John Lewis narrow as Sharon White suggests reasons for optimism The owner of John Lewis and Waitrose remains in the red after it reported another loss for the first half of the year, and admitted that its turnaround plan will take two years longer to deliver. The John Lewis Partnership made a pre-tax loss of \u00a359m for the 26 weeks to 29 July, as it continued to face pressures from higher costs, and noted caution from shoppers during the cost of living crisis. However, the retail group said its performance was improving, and its pre-tax loss was 41% lower than the \u00a399m loss reported for the same period a year earlier. Despite the challenging economic situation, shoppers continued to spend money on themselves, with sales of clothing, beauty products and \u201cdine-in\u201d meals all rising. However, consumers proved wary about splashing out on \u201cbig ticket\u201d items for their homes, such as technology products or sofas, the sales of which fell. As a result, operating profit at the John Lewis department store chain fell from \u00a3295m to \u00a3277m. However, operating profit at the Waitrose supermarket improved to \u00a3504.4m from nearly \u00a3432m, despite IT problems earlier in the year, which affected product availability. John Lewis sales fell 2%, while Waitrose sales were up 4%. Read more here: Turning to the John Lewis Partnership press conference call. John Lewis bosses have been asked whether the delay to the turnaround plan is going to impact its goal to generate 40% of its profits outside retail, given there have been some reports about some delay to its housing schemes. (A reminder that John Lewis plans to build 10,000 rental homes on its land). Chair Sharon White said the 40% target remains long-term goal, and they will have to see whether that part of their profit proportion target \u201calso has a bit of a delay to it\u201d. But White said it \u201cremains as strong an aspiration as it did before.\u201d Not all is well among UK supermarkets. The UK arm of German discount supermarket Lidl has swung to an annual loss, as attempts to keep prices low for customers, paired with higher costs and inflation, weighed on performance. Lidl GB reported a \u00a376m pre-tax loss in the 12 months to February, down from a pre-tax profit of \u00a341m That was despite a 19% rise in full-year revenues to \u00a39.3bn, as its low prices attracted a greater numbers of shoppers. Disappointing news from the John Lewis Partnership this morning. The partnership, which runs John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets, reported a \u00a359m pre-tax loss in the six months to July. While that is an improvement on the \u00a399.2m loss reported during the same period last year, the company said it was still struggling due to the ripple effects of high inflation, which has racked up costs and resulted in customers being more cautious with their spending. The partnership said inflation \u2013 which increased its costs by \u00a3179m last year \u2013 is also partly to blame for its failure to deliver on its turnaround plan, which is now going to be delayed by two years. The retailer said: A combination of inflationary pressures and greater than expected investment requirements for our transformation means it will take a further two years to deliver the Partnership Plan - to 2027/28 rather than to 2025/26. That plan, originally announced in October 2020, was meant to see the John Lewis Partnership reach \u00a3400m profit by the end of the programme, including through making its operations and head office more efficient. Despite the challenges, the JLP\u2019s chair Sharon White, tried to strike a positive tone: The Partnership is a unique model that has been tested and come through stronger many times in our 100 year history. While change is never easy - and there is a long road ahead - there are reasons for optimism. Performance is improving. More customers are shopping with us. Trust in the brands and support for the Partnership model remain high. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. We start the day with news that UK chip designer Arm Holdings has secured a bumper $54.5bn valuation ahead of its first day of trading. It comes after the Softbank-backed company priced shares at the top of its initial estimate, at $51 each, as investors scrambled for a piece of the action in the biggest initial public offering of the year. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown said: Despite some concerns about the company\u2019s exposure to numerous risks in China, it\u2019s not stopped a juggernaut of enthusiasm, with the IPO oversubscribed multiple times, with interest from tech giants like Nvidia, Apple and Alphabet. Given the eagerness from investors , it seems Arm could have pushed for an even higher price, but is playing it safe to try to ensure a surge in the share price once trading gets underway. While enthusiasm is high for the company\u2019s return to public markets, seeing the UK company list on the US Nasdaq rather than in London, is another embarrassment for the City. But Streeter explains that there was no room for sentiment as Softbank pursued the best price for Arm\u2019s return to public markets. The fanfare surrounding today\u2019s launch in New York will cement disappointment that London has been shunned, even though the decision was announced back in March. Arm was very much seen as a British success story, but owner SoftBank is pulling no sentimental punches here and wants the biggest bang for its buck. We\u2019ll bring you further reaction, and Arm\u2019s first market moves, in the hours ahead.

            "title": "Fentanyl, cartels or simple market glut: what\u2019s behind collapse of Colombia\u2019s coca market?",
            "date": "2023-09-13T12:00:02Z",
            "content": "Noralba Galvis usually returns home to her village in the Colombian jungle with fresh supplies of rice, meat, salt and other foods stuffed into bags. But today, as the 40-year-old steps onboard a boat for the two-hour journey home along the Putumayo River, she carries just a single cardboard box. \u201cMy mother gave me these chicks,\u201d she says. \u201cChickens are great in times of emergency like these, when there is nothing else left to eat.\u201d Like most farmers in Putumayo, a vast southern department where the Andes meets the Amazon and where Colombia borders Ecuador and Peru, Galvis depends on selling coca to make a living. Despite decades of efforts from successive Colombian governments to stamp out the green shrub used to make cocaine, it has thrived across the country\u2019s most remote corners since the 1990s. If families in the region do not grow coca, there is a good chance they are employed in fields to strip coca leaves, or in rudimentary labs chemically transforming the plant into white powder. Many have abandoned growing food entirely to focus on the small green shrub, depending on coca buyers for their income. But no buyer has come to Galvis\u2019s village for three months now, pushing her family \u2013 and nearly half a million other households \u2013 deeper into poverty. \u201cFor most of us, coca is the only income we have,\u201d says Galvis, who is the community representative for her remote village of 50 families. \u201cNow no one is buying and many of us mothers are having to go hungry.\u201d After three years of rising prices, over the past 12 months the coca market in Colombia has inexplicably collapsed, fuelling speculation from government officials and organised crime analysts as to why cartels have stopped buying. While experts debate whether the collapse of the market was triggered by the US fentanyl boom, Mexicans cartels muscling in on Colombia\u2019s drug trade or a simple market glut, many rural families have been left wondering if they will be able to afford their next bag of rice. The price drop has been so severe and sudden that it has prompted concern from the Colombian government and international organisations such as the World Food Programme that it could cause widespread hunger. \u201cCoca is a lifeline for many families. For several decades it is what people have looked to in times of crisis, such as when other crops fail. So the question is, what can they look to now?\u201d said Elizabeth Dickinson, senior analyst for Colombia at the International Crisis Group. About 400,000 households depend on the coca crop to get by, but in departments such as Cauca in central Colombia the price for coca base \u2013 the first step in the production of cocaine \u2013 has almost halved from \u00a30.60 ($0.75) a gram to about \u00a30.35. As coca\u2019s market value has plunged, the cost of the pesticides, gasoline and chemicals used to make cocaine base has spiked. So too have food prices. In communities like Galvis\u2019s, the coca buyer who came every week started coming monthly and then disappeared entirely, leaving families wondering anxiously when he will return. \u201cThings are never easy here. Coca is the uncomfortable way that we can get by, but now even that is becoming impossible,\u201d the mother of three says, spooning a serving of chicken and rice on to a metal plate for her four-year-old son. Coca production in the Putumayo region leapt 77% last year, helping drive national cocaine production up 24%, to 1,738 metric tonnes\u2013 a more than 20-year high, according to the UN. Billions of dollars are made from the illicit cocaine trade, which in Colombia has perpetuated six decades of conflict between armed guerrillas, paramilitary death squads and the military. But precious little of that wealth has made its way to the jungle settlements where the drug\u2019s journey begins. There is little state presence in Galvis\u2019s village, where residents live hours away from the nearest town in rickety wooden shacks and must fetch water from a well and construct their own bridges from concrete and wooden planks. Coca farmers live in constant fear of violence, but continue anyway, since it is the only way to make a dignified living, said Meily Calder\u00f3n, 50. A kilogram of plantain fetches about 15,000 pesos (\u00a33, $3.75) at the nearest market, but by the time a farmer has paid for it to be dragged through the rainforest on a mule and for a boat to ship it upriver, only about 6,000 pesos (\u00a31.15, $1.44) remains. \u201cWhat are you supposed to do with 6,000 pesos?\u201d Calder\u00f3n asked as she walked through a forest clearing filled with rows and rows of fully grown coca plants. Theses crops reached harvest maturity weeks ago but have been left abandoned when nobody turned up to buy the harvest. The effects of the coca crisis have also rippled out far beyond the coca fields, hitting regional capitals. Three years of rising coca prices had caused a flurry of new restaurants and bars to pop up in the town of Puerto As\u00eds, but as coca money dries up, the local economy is slowing down, say small business owners. \u201cMany of my friends studying in Puerto As\u00eds suddenly stopped coming to class,\u201d said 20-year-old university student Neider Cortes. \u201cWithout the coca money coming in they can\u2019t afford the semester and had to drop out.\u201d The Colombian government is aware of the crisis but so far its response has been limited. Addressing the issue is complicated by a lack of clarity as to precisely why armed groups have suddenly stopped buying coca. A recent report published by the Washington Office on Latin America listed 12 leading theories for the collapse in the price of coca \u2013 among them the deadly fentanyl boom in the US hurting demand for cocaine and the fragmentation of Colombia\u2019s drug cartels into tiny competing businesses. \u201cMany of these theories don\u2019t make sense as the market in the USA for cocaine is relatively stable and continues to grow in Europe and Asia,\u201d said Gloria Miranda Espitia, Colombia\u2019s director of drug policy, while on a visit to dialogue with coca producers in Putumayo. \u201cSo we think this is only an issue in Colombia and only in certain regions, which is associated with the dynamics of armed groups. There are some armed groups that are managing to sell to the international market, and there are others that are not.\u201d The government sees the coca crisis as an opportunity to entice farmers away from the illicit coca economy and out of the orbit of armed groups. In Galvis\u2019s village, campesinos are returning to legal crops such as plantain, yuca and sugar cane, which were sown by previous generations before coca swept the region. But coca farmers could just as easily swap one illicit economy for the other: in areas with mineral deposits, struggling coca farmers are reportedly leaving coca cultivation for illegal mining. Successive governments have tried the carrot-and-the-stick approach to halt coca production and end the cocaine trade, but neither spraying herbicide from the skies nor paying farmers cash to grow legal alternatives has prevented the crop\u2019s relentless expansion. Now that rural families can no longer guarantee putting food on the table by growing coca, Galvis hopes they may finally be able to leave the crop behind and with it the armed conflict. \u201cEven though we are screwed right now, maybe this could help farmers find their way again back to their roots,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe this is just the wake-up call we need.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 14 September 2023. Herbicide, not insecticide, is sprayed to try and halt coca production."

            "date": "2023-09-06T09:34:22Z",
            "content": "Manchester United shares have suffered their steepest single-day fall in price after a report claimed the Glazer family was considering a U-turn on plans to sell the club. Shares in the Premier League club dropped by 18.2% on Tuesday to $19.35 (\u00a315.40), the biggest daily drop since they were listed the New York stock exchange in 2012. The valuation drop came after a report that claimed the club\u2019s owners had decided to take it off the market after a prolonged sales process that has cast a shadow of uncertainty over United. The American Glazer family, led by the brothers Joel and Avram, had sought bids for the club. The Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani and the British chemicals billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe had lodged bids that valued it in the billions of pounds, with the former\u2019s thought to be up to \u00a36bn. However, the Mail on Sunday reported that the Glazers were holding out for a much higher bid, and potentially as much as \u00a310bn. The report said the Glazers would wait until 2025 to sell the club, when increased television rights revenues and the expansion of the football World Cup could make the club appear more valuable. A \u00a310bn valuation would go far beyond the \u00a34.25bn achieved by Chelsea, a record for a sports club, albeit one pushed through in a forced sale after the London club\u2019s previous owner, Roman Abramovich, was placed under UK sanctions. United have had a tricky start to the Premier League season, and are 11th after four games in the Dutch manager Erik ten Hag\u2019s second season in charge. United beat Wolverhampton Wanderers and Nottingham Forest but lost to Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. United\u2019s share price implied a valuation of only $3.15bn on Tuesday night, although a buyer of the club \u2013 or most companies \u2013 would expect to pay a significant premium. The market valuation peaked at $4.5bn at the height of the bidding battle. The Glazers bought United in 2005 for \u00a3790m but sold 10% of the club in the stock market listing in 2012. That listing coincided with the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson as manager, and United\u2019s last Premier League title. Since then, the club have gone through a series of managers, none of whom have been able to return United to the top of English football, despite two second-place finishes. The deterioration in the club\u2019s on-field performance \u2013 and the dominance of rivals Manchester City after a takeover by the Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan \u2013 has led to persistent criticism of the Glazers by fan groups, and repeated protests inside and outside the stadium."

            "date": "2023-09-20T16:03:47Z",
            "content": "A body convulses on a table, with broken bones poking from a stump of torn flesh below the knee, one arm gruesomely peppered with gunshot wounds, as men in military uniforms look on approvingly. \u201cHe bleeds, he moves, he breathes, he has a pulse,\u201d says the smiling sales rep. \u201cHis eyes even react to light. We have a canine version too, which barks and whines \u2013 and it comes with interchangeable injured limbs.\u201d I am perusing the medical zone of Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI), Europe\u2019s biggest arms fair, which takes place every two years in the Excel convention centre in east London. It is a sprawling supermarket of modern warfare, where the world\u2019s armies come to buy the latest AI-guided missiles and tanks, inspect giant warships moored in the Royal Docks, and queue to take a turn sitting in the cockpits of fighter jets. Every possible military requirement is covered here, from the writhing \u201chigh-fidelity trauma simulators\u201d, to camouflage dealers showcasing their prints, to stands selling medals and commemorative coins \u2013 and even one specialising in epaulette tassels. Joystick manufacturers jostle with makers of invisibility cloaks, while purveyors of VR simulators compete with those of radar jammers, next to endless ranks of machine guns. Sleek submarines sparkle on spotlit plinths while flocks of missile-carrying drones dangle from the ceiling like menacing mobiles. \u201cThis year feels much busier than usual,\u201d one bomb salesman tells me, standing by a gleaming rack of cone-shaped warheads, polished like trophies in a glass cabinet. \u201cIt seems war is back in a big way. People are looking to stock up.\u201d Whereas attendees of this great murderous bazaar may once have felt sheepish, they now proudly march through the entrance gates with their heads held high. War, long something that happened far away, is now on our doorstep. In an auditorium nearby, Britain\u2019s most senior military officer, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, informs a rapt audience about the recently increased threat levels, noting that Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has highlighted the vulnerability of our cities to deadly missile and drone attacks. It\u2019s now easy to \u201cget close to a country and fly drones in\u201d, he says. \u201cWe need to have a conversation about integrated missile defence.\u201d Recent events in Ukraine have sharpened minds and opened wallets in relation to governmentspending on defence. Total global military expenditure reached an all-time high of $2.2tn (\u00a31.8tn) in 2022, with Europe seeing the steepest annual increase in 30 years \u2013 the total surpassing, in real terms, that of the last year of the cold war. The UK has the highest military budget in central and western Europe, at $68.5bn, and the government has committed to increase it. As the hi-tech wares on show in this marketplace of munitions reveal, there are plenty of expensive toys for it to splurge on. Covering the mind-boggling area of 14 football pitches, the exhibition is organised into zones for land, naval, aerospace, and even space warfare. In between, there are sections dedicated to medical innovations, security, manufacturing and future tech, along with a host of national pavilions, each showcasing its country\u2019s arms-dealing specialities, like a bloodthirsty Eurovision song contest. At the Israel pavilion, one company is promoting its \u201chigh-penetration wireless communication for indoor robotics and drones\u201d, showing videos of drones swooping through bombed-out buildings, looking for prey like a swarm of deadly mosquitoes. Brazil features a stall offering \u201cammunition, bombs, rockets and fuses\u201d, with a bowl of complimentary sweets, while a rifle company in the US section tries to lure punters with a free calendar of busty models draped across its anti-aircraft guns. (\u201cIt\u2019s been approved by all our female staff,\u201d the man at the desk assures me.) Norway touts its outdoorsy all-weather reputation, exhibiting a sledge equipped with a machine gun, while, among the long ranks of firearms in the Turkish pavilion, I am offered a gleaming golden handgun. \u201cIt\u2019s for people who want the traditional style,\u201d says a beaming lady behind the counter. Night-vision goggles and AI-assisted firing sights abound, but Switzerland opts for an old-school vibe, showing off its Victorinox Swiss Army knives \u2013 including models especially customised for different security forces, from the German navy to the Malaysian police. \u201cThe Malaysians are always the funniest and fanciest when it comes to special features,\u201d says the sales manager, showing me a knife with every tool coated in a sleek matte black finish, designed to match their uniforms. Nearby, I encounter a mannequin covered in a thick furry shroud of white fabric petals, giving it the look of the abominable snowman. It turns out to be a real-life invisibility cloak. \u201cIt protects soldiers from UV cameras, thermal cameras and infra-red cameras,\u201d says Kiran Joshi of Indian firm Entremonde Polyecoaters. \u201cIt has a special coating on the fabric, so it merges with the surrounding terrain and makes the soldier invisible.\u201d A few stands away I bump into a robotic, drone-carrying dog \u2013 whose applications range from perimeter security to bomb disposal \u2013 displayed near snout-shaped helmets with electronic ear defenders, designed to be worn by dogs on the battlefield. As the host nation, the British armed forces get top billing, showing off the products of the latest projects. At the army stand, staffed by a crowd of young soldiers in neatly pressed khaki uniforms, I am introduced to the new armoured vehicles of the troubled \u00a35.5bn Ajax programme \u2013 an \u201cadvanced, fully digitised land vehicle system delivering transformational change\u201d, manufactured by General Dynamics in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. It is the biggest single order in more than two decades, for 589 vehicles at a cost of almost \u00a310m each. Running more than six years late, Ajax has been repeatedly criticised by the National Audit Office, the defence select committee and the public accounts committee, branded \u201ca complete and utter disaster\u201d by the former head of the Royal Navy. \u201cNothing like this has ever been seen before,\u201d says a jovial Maj David Hughes, slapping the armoured flank of one of the new reconnaissance vehicles as if it were a prized thoroughbred. \u201cIt gives us enhanced lethality, survivability, reliability, mobility and all-weather intelligence.\u201d He shows me its 40mm cannon, which has a range of more than 1.5 miles (2.5km), as well as long-range thermal sights and acoustic sensors that can pick up gun noises and plot the target directly on the commander\u2019s screen. \u201cWith a click of two buttons,\u201d he says, \u201cthey can pass that information to an unmanned drone or an Apache helicopter. Another press of a button, and the Apache pilot comes in and destroys the target on one pass. This digitally networked system vastly increases our operational lethality.\u201d Nearby hangs a massive jet-powered drone, of the kind that might soon be part of this digitally networked battlefield, carrying a hefty payload of three laser-guided Brimstone missiles. This is the Hydra 400, which uses hybrid propulsion technology (rotors and jet engines) to carry a whopping 400kg of bombs, developed in response to the increasing challenges of urban warfare. Compact and portable, it only takes six minutes to assemble, giving troops \u201can Apache gunship in the boot of their car\u201d, as one source put it. Next to it, a gaggle of smaller drones hang alongside their mothership, designed to carry its young for longer distances and then release them for precision strikes, like warhead-equipped carrier pigeons. \u201cThey all have onboard AI cameras,\u201d says Maj Matthew McGarvey-Miles, lead of the army warfighting experiment, a flagship programme where the latest technology is developed. \u201cThey can identify targets and track them automatically, without the requirement of an operator to constantly monitor them.\u201d These devices are still at testing stage, and need to be approved, but the army appears to be heading rapidly in an automated, connected, lethally digital direction. \u201cWe are responding to the operating environment that we see in Ukraine,\u201d says the army\u2019s chief of the general staff, Patrick Sanders, keen to stress that these unmanned killing machines need skilled humans, too. \u201cWhen the electromagnetic spectrum is so heavily contested, automation fails and the skill of the pilot predominates. We need \u2018war fighters\u2019 \u2013 whether they are cyber specialists, drone pilots, or infantry soldiers \u2013 to be stronger, faster, more intelligent and more resilient.\u201d The nature of these unmanned weapons \u2013 and the kind of remote fighters the army is looking for \u2013 is having a knock-on effect on how the physical controls are designed. While crowds of decorated generals compare the lengths of their missiles at the big-budget displays of major munitions manufacturers, my eye is caught by a small stand that glimmers with hundreds of tiny switches, buttons and joysticks, giving it the look of a fiendishly complex submarine control room. \u201cWe make push-button switches, toggle switches, slam switches, switches with locking levers, and fully sealed safety critical switches,\u201d says Steve Blackwell of Apem components. \u201cWe are Europe\u2019s largest manufacturer of switches. But the big thing now is thumb-stick controllers. So many people in the military now come from the Xbox generation, so they\u2019re used to thumb-sticks. Gone are the days when you\u2019d have big pneumatic or hydraulic controls.\u201d He hands me a controller that looks just like a gaming joypad \u2013 a deceptively playful device for something that could unleash hellfire on a pixellated target, hundreds of miles away. Nimble thumbs, it seems, will define the future of warfare. Tomorrow\u2019s battles will be waged from the safety of a gaming chair (also on display), with the assistance of algorithms. The world of autonomous, unmanned war has already moved beyond drones. I find acoustic minesweepers, smart submarines, self-guided skidoos, tanks and other remote-controlled weaponised contraptions that defy classification. At BAE Systems\u2019 vast, moodily lit stand (which has its own aerial walkway so you can see its armoured hulks from all angles) I find something that looks like a furious praying mantis. This is Strix, billed as a \u201chybrid, tandem wing, multi-domain and multi-role uncrewed air system\u201d, capable of vertical take-off and seamless transition to horizontal flight, styled like something from the Batcave. German arms giant Rheinmetall, meanwhile, takes unmanned vehicles into heavier-duty realms, with a fleet of giant-wheeled, all-terrain monsters that look as if they are auditioning for a part in the next Mad Max movie. With tyres bigger than its body, the chubby Mission Master XT is fully amphibious and capable of carrying 1,000kg payloads for 460 miles without refuelling, even up 35-degree slopes over ice and snow in -30C, using AI-powered navigation. It can spin on the spot, too. A promotional video shows it making snow angels as it trundles into battle. Outside the exhibition halls, reality hits. \u201cPlease be aware,\u201d a polite protester tells visitors, \u201cthat many of the countries you are doing business with are on the UK government\u2019s human rights priority list.\u201d Emily Apple of Campaign Against Arms Trade is more direct. \u201cDSEI is a marketplace in death,\u201d she says. \u201cDeals done here will cause misery across the world, causing global instability and devastating people\u2019s lives. Arms dealers only care about perpetuating conflict, because conflict increases profits for their shareholders. It\u2019s time we shut this arms fair down for good.\u201d Back inside, bottles of champagne have appeared. The face of a young black female mannequin stares out from a body bag, while delegates toast their billion-dollar deals of destruction."

            "date": "2023-09-24T13:00:01Z",
            "content": "Not everyone will know his name, let alone his paintings, yet Aboudia has emerged as the bestselling artist of 2022, based on the number of artworks sold at auction, to the surprise of market experts. Aboudia, aka Abdoulaye Diarrassouba, 40, whose art is inspired by street culture in his home town of Abidjan in Ivory Coast, heads the Hiscox Artist Top 100, a new survey analysing key trends in contemporary art that will be published on Monday. Aboudia\u2019s work is influenced by the graffiti of Abidjan and the traditional wood carvings of West Africa, and has been compared to the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, who made his name with graffiti-like images. Since the Ivorian civil war in 2011, Aboudia\u2019s pictures have reflected the trauma of man\u2019s inhumanity to man with images of skulls and soldiers. The Hiscox survey found that a total of 75 artworks by Aboudia were auctioned, followed by Damien Hirst with 73 works. His prices have soared from a few thousand pounds about a decade ago to six figures today. Christie\u2019s in London sold one of his untitled paintings for \u00a3504,000 last year. Robert Read, head of art and private clients at Hiscox, said he had not previously heard of Aboudia and was taken aback by his auction success. \u201cBut then I\u2019m constantly surprised by things that happen, especially in the contemporary art market \u2026 That\u2019s what makes it so exciting \u2026 Aboudia seems to be an artist that people want to speculate in,\u201d he said. The Jack Bell gallery in London gave Aboudia his first UK show in 2011, and the artist counts Charles Saatchi among his collectors. Oliver Durey, Jack Bell\u2019s director, said: \u201cIt has been great to see the level of international engagement in Aboudia\u2019s practice increase over the years.\u201d The market success may reflect a rising interest in modern art from Africa, with leading western museums and galleries building up collections. Among the survey\u2019s other findings, David Hockney was the bestselling artist in global auction value in 2022. His sales generated $75m (\u00a361m). His most valuable painting was Winter Timber of 2009, which fetched $23m (\u00a319.3m) at Christie\u2019s in New York in November. The research was carried out for Hiscox, an international specialist insurer, by ArtTactic, a research and analysis firm. Its findings are based on unique artworks \u2013 editions were not included \u2013 made after 2000, which have been auctioned at Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s and Phillips between 2018 and 2022. The research includes more than 23,000 lots from more than 3,800 artists. The data reveals that the past two years saw a significant increase in the value of contemporary work sold, peaking in 2021 at almost $1.2bn. It also reflected a market that has become increasingly speculative with, for example, \u201ca dramatic increase in art being flipped as \u2018wet paint\u2019 sales\u201d, those re-sold at auction within two years of being made, which more than doubled last year. Read said: \u201cWe suspected that over time, the contemporary market had become more speculative, but last year wet paint sales sky-rocketed. Art is an attractive asset class for investors in the long run, but reselling within such short periods can have a destabilising effect on the market as it creates a speculative bubble.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-17T05:00:51Z",
            "content": "A senior Conservative has called on his party to ensure welfare claimants are not handed a real-terms cut next year, after Rishi Sunak refused to commit to increasing benefits in line with inflation. Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor and the most senior Tory outside London, said the party\u2019s previous commitment to increasing benefits such as universal credit in line with inflation had become a \u201creal symbol\u201d of the party\u2019s commitment to helping the low-paid. Concerns over the policy have emerged since it was claimed that the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was considering a below-inflation increase in benefits as he struggles with tight public finances and Tory demands for tax cuts before the next general election. Sunak then refused to rule out a below-inflation rise during his recent trip to India. Benefits are usually increased every April in line with the inflation rate from the previous September. That would mean an increase of about 7%. With inflation expected to be much lower in the spring, Hunt could then argue that a 7% rise would be too high. Street, who has emerged as a leading voice on the party\u2019s liberal wing, called on Hunt and Sunak to increase benefits in line with inflation, as they did this year. \u201cI don\u2019t think the prime minister vacillated on it for one second,\u201d said Street. \u201cIt seemed very clear, the decision to upgrade it by inflation was really important. And we will face that decision again, and I\u2019m absolutely clear \u2013 that has to happen again, because that\u2019s a real symbol. \u201cThere is absolutely no question that there is a big chunk of people in this city [Birmingham] who are really hurting with the cost of living crisis at the moment, I\u2019m not questioning that in any way. All of the national issues play out here, probably even more pronounced, from fuel poverty to declining real wages.\u201d The Department for Work and Pensions has previously said the government has increased benefits by more than 10% this year \u201cto protect the most vulnerable from the impact of high inflation\u201d. Hunt is likely to announce his decision over the uprating of benefits in the autumn statement, which he is due to give on 23 November. It comes as analysis suggests that the government is far off course to halve UK poverty by 2030, a commitment it made as part of the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals in 2015. The foreign secretary, James Cleverly, will discuss the goals at a summit this week. Research by Adam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, found that absolute poverty declined between 2015-16 and 2020-21, from 20% to 17%. Poverty has since been edging upwards as a result of the energy price shock, the removal of temporary pandemic support, ongoing welfare cuts, rising housing costs and the overall weak economic conditions. Absolute poverty is projected by Corlett to be higher in 2029-30 than in 2020-21. The poverty rate for children is currently projected to increase slightly from 27% to 28% of children. \u201cChanges in economic forecasts for the second half of this decade could easily alter this long-term, uncertain outlook; as could major policy changes,\u201d said Corlett. \u201cBut at present, the UK is nowhere near on track to meet its poverty reduction commitment, or even put in a creditable performance, and with each passing year the speed of change that would be required to meet the target increases.\u201d"

Let us hope she is not one to get easily alarmed, given the latest monthly CPI figures showed a small increase in annual inflation. The figures released on Wednesday by the Bureau of Statistics showed a slight bump in annual inflation from 4.9% in July to 5.2% in August. One of the problems with the monthly inflation figures is that, while they give us more timely data on prices, they are also more erratic than the traditional quarterly measure. That\u2019s why it is best to also look at other measures, such as the one that excludes volatile items and holiday travel, which fell from 5.8% to 5.5%: If the graph does not display click here Overall, inflation is following the path of other major nations such as the United States. Indeed, our inflation is largely replicating the old days of us getting TV shows and movies from the US \u2013 we\u2019re about six months behind: If the graph does not display click here The good news is that, even with the slight increase in August, in the eight months from our peak in December last year, inflation has fallen 3.2 percentage points. By contrast, in the eight months after the US\u2019s peak, inflation fell just 3.0%pts. Australia\u2019s inflation peaked at a lower level and is falling marginally quicker than was the case in the US. This is despite the central bank in the US raising interest rates there much faster and higher than did the RBA: If the graph does not display click here The huge rate rises in the US have, however, made life tougher for us because it has kept the value of the Australia dollar low. Investors naturally like to put their money in places where they can get a higher rate of return. And when the US\u2019s interest rates rise faster, that means more international investors want US dollars and fewer want Australian ones. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup As a result the \u201cprice\u201d of US dollars rises (reflected by the exchange rate) and the Australian dollar falls. That\u2019s why anyone buying things from overseas might be finding they are not particularly cheap at the moment. It is also one reason why petrol is so expensive right now. In August, the price of fuel jumped \u2013 unleaded was up 9% and diesel up 14%: If the graph does not display click here This is because world oil prices have increased due to Russia and the Opec nations, led by Saudi Arabia, cutting production. As a general rule, our petrol prices move almost in sync with world oil prices, and so too does the value of the Australian dollar. Usually when oil and other resource prices are high, the value of our dollar rises. But this has not happened over the past year. Given past world oil prices, you would have expected the average price of unleaded in August to have been about $1.70, not $2.00: If the graph does not display click here Mostly the reason it is not $1.70 is the value of our dollar. Since last November the world price of oil has fallen 3% in US dollars but has remained flat in Australian dollars. If the value of our dollar had risen, the price of oil in Australian dollars would be less and as a result the price of petrol would also be lower. If the graph does not display click here Not all of these higher-than-expected prices are due to the exchange rate. Even when you take that into account, prices should still be lower. One reason they are not is that our petrol sector is little more than an oligopoly, and the pressure to reduce prices is limited. But all the same, in August Australia effectively imported inflation. This is not something the Reserve Bank should be reacting to. Yes, higher interest rates might increase the value of the Australian dollar, but at what cost? Higher petrol prices and imported goods are already slowing the economy. Should the RBA slow the economy more just so petrol prices might not rise as fast as they otherwise would? They should look through the price increases of things they cannot affect. And if you look at big growth items over the past year, there is little that higher interest rates would change: If the graph does not display click here Higher interest rates don\u2019t affect the world oil price, the same goes for gas and electricity prices. The increase in bread and dairy prices is not due to a mass surge in demand for multigrain and cheese, and insurance costs are driven by climate change causing higher reinsurance and natural disaster costs. And you would be a brave person to suggest that higher interest rates would reduce rental prices. Next week in her first meeting as governor, Bullock should note that the economy does not need more slowing, and that higher petrol prices and higher rents, gas, electricity and insurance costs are already reducing the ability of households to spend money on non-essential services and goods. She should argue the Reserve Bank should keep rates where they are, rather than be spooked by things beyond its control. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "date": "2023-09-19T09:00:53Z",
            "content": "The OECD has warned of \u201cpersistent\u201d high consumer prices around the world including in Australia, strengthening the case for further interest rate rises despite \u201cvisible\u201d effects from previous increases. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its interim economic outlook on Tuesday, titled Confronting Inflation and Low Growth. It said that although headline inflation is declining steadily \u201ccore inflation remains persistent in many economies\u201d and this \u201cwould require additional policy tightening\u201d. In Australia, it estimates core inflation of 5.9% in 2023, up 0.4 points from its June estimate, and 3.3% in 2024, up 0.1. The OECD blamed \u201ccost pressures and high margins in some sectors\u201d for core inflation, which measures the change in prices of goods and services, excluding items frequently subject to volatile prices, like food and energy. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Estimates for growth in Australia are flat at 1.8% in 2023 and down 0.1 in 2024 to 1.3%. But global growth is projected to be up 0.3 points compared with the June estimate to 3.0% in 2023 then down 0.2 to 2.7%. The OECD warned that \u201crisks remain tilted to the downside\u201d, including that the \u201cadverse effects of higher interest rates could prove stronger than expected\u201d and \u201ca sharper-than-expected slowdown in China is an additional key risk that would hit output growth around the world\u201d. The observation echoes the treasurer, Jim Chalmers\u2019, warning earlier in September that there is no guarantee Australia\u2019s economy is heading for a soft landing. The OECD said the start of 2023 was \u201cstronger-than-expected\u201d thanks to \u201clower energy prices and the reopening of China\u201d but global growth is now expected to moderate. \u201cThe impact of tighter monetary policy is becoming increasingly visible, business and consumer confidence have turned down, and the rebound in China has faded.\u201d \u201cGlobal GDP growth is projected to remain sub-par in 2023 and 2024, at 3% and 2.7% respectively, held back by the macroeconomic policy tightening needed to rein in inflation.\u201d The OECD, which is now headed by former Australian finance minister Mathias Cormann, recommended that \u201cmonetary policy needs to remain restrictive until there are clear signs that underlying inflation pressures have durably abated\u201d. It noted interest rates \u201cappear to be at or close to a peak in most economies\u201d with further rises now \u201cfinely balanced\u201d decisions. The release of the outlook comes as Michele Bullock begins her term as Reserve Bank governor in Australia, taking the reins after 12 interest rate rises to tackle high inflation. The RBA faces a dilemma about whether to keep rates on hold due to easing inflation or to continue monetary tightening due to strong labour market results. Minutes from the September meeting of the Reserve Bank show the slowing pace of inflation was enough to keep rates on hold, but the board was aware higher petrol prices could upset the balance. The RBA board chose to leave the cash rate steady at 4.1% for the third time in a row in September, although the minutes showed another increase was discussed. The central bank is aiming to have inflation back within its two-to-three per cent target range by late-2025. In July, inflation sunk to 4.9% from 5.4% in the month prior. The RBA kept the possibility of more tightening alive \u201cshould inflation prove more persistent than expected\u201d. \u201cMembers noted that the recent rise in petrol prices \u2013 an important input for households\u2019 inflation expectations \u2013 highlighted that the process of returning inflation to target could be uneven,\u201d the minutes said. Fuel prices have been marching upwards due to oil supply cuts and the weakening Australian dollar. Chalmers said the OECD report \u201cshows the global economy is in an unpredictable place with growth forecast to slow considerably over the coming year\u201d. \u201cWhile we expect our economy to slow considerably over the coming year and the unemployment rate to tick up, we enter this period of uncertainty from an enviable position,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe have a strong labour market, wages are getting moving again, and we continue to get good prices for what we sell to the world.\u201d The OECD noted that \u201cgovernments are faced with mounting fiscal pressures from rising debt burdens and additional spending on ageing populations, the climate transition and defence\u201d. \u201cEnhanced international cooperation is needed to ensure better coordination and faster progress in carbon mitigation efforts.\u201d Chalmers noted that \u201cthe OECD stresses the importance of countries rebuilding their fiscal buffers so they are in a position to respond effectively to future shocks\u201d. \u201cThis is consistent with the Albanese government\u2019s budget strategy and is one of the reasons why delivering a surplus in 2022-23 is so important.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-20T17:53:42Z",
            "content": "Leading lenders including NatWest have cut their mortgage rates after an unexpected fall in UK inflation, and brokers are predicting that others will follow suit over the coming days. Banks and financial firms have announced a fresh wave of home loan reductions before Thursday\u2019s Bank of England interest rates decision, with NatWest announcing reductions of up to 0.31 percentage points across its fixed residential and buy-to-let deals. It means NatWest will have five-year fixed-rate deals starting at 5.14%, although intense competition means there are cheaper rates than that on offer: during the past few days Virgin Money and Yorkshire building society have launched five-year fixes priced at 4.97% and 4.99% respectively. The last time that deals of this type priced at below 5% were available was in June. Other lenders cutting the cost of their new mortgage deals on Wednesday included Bank of Ireland UK and LiveMore Capital. The latest reductions will improve conditions for homebuyers and those hoping to remortgage on to a new deal. Many brokers have said a full-scale mortgage price war is now under way in the UK, with lenders jostling to attract customers. Brokers highlighted a two-year fixed-rate deal priced at 3.9% that was launched on Wednesday \u2013 the first sub-4% product offered for several months. However, this deal, launched by State Bank of India\u2019s UK arm, is available only to buy-to-let borrowers and has a 5% arrangement fee. While lenders have been reducing their rates for several weeks, Wednesday\u2019s inflation data appears to have triggered a fresh wave of reductions. The UK\u2019s annual inflation rate unexpectedly slowed to 6.7% last month. Nicholas Mendes, a mortgage technical manager at the broker John Charcol, said it was \u201cfantastic\u201d to see NatWest give details of fresh rate cuts after previous moves earlier this month. \u201cI suspect this will be one of many reduction notices we see this week,\u201d he said. Richard Campo, the founder of Rose Capital Partners broker, said: \u201cWith the lower-than-expected inflation figures, falling money markets and now even a question mark over whether the Bank of England will raise rates, it is no surprise that major lenders are cutting rates. NatWest are just the first of many that will be doing this in the coming weeks.\u201d Steven Hargreaves, an adviser at the Mortgage Co, said NatWest was the third large lender this week to reduce its fixed rates, \u201csuggesting the rate war is now truly under way\u201d. He added: \u201cI would expect several other lenders to look to reduce their offerings in the next week or so.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-20T13:12:40Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England faces a knife-edge decision on interest rates after an unexpected fall in UK inflation last month, as financial markets bet the central bank could leave borrowing costs unchanged for the first time in almost two years. In a crunch week for the economy, the August figures from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday led financial markets to give a more than 50% chance of the central bank keeping interest rates on hold on Thursday. The UK\u2019s annual inflation rate slowed to 6.7% last month amid weaker growth in food prices and monthly falls in the cost of hotels and air travel. Threadneedle Street, City economists and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, had anticipated a modest increase to 7% driven by rising petrol and diesel prices. The latest drop in the inflation reading from 6.8% in July marks the sixth straight decline in the headline rate. It does not, however, meant that prices are falling, only that they are rising at a slower pace. Highlighting the pressure on households of the cost of living crisis, food and drink prices increased by 13.6% in the year to August, lower than their peak inflation rate of 19.1% earlier this year but still high by historical levels. The ONS said the largest impact on food and drink inflation was from milk, cheese and eggs, where prices fell sharply between July and August but were still up by about 15% compared with a year ago. The cost of vegetables, as well as fresh, chilled and frozen fish and seafood, also fell on the month. Core inflation \u2013 which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 fell by more than expected, from 6.9% in July to 6.2% in August, driven by lower services prices. Figures for core inflation and the service sector are watched closely by the Bank when determining interest rates. Threadneedle Street had said last month it expected inflation to rise slightly in August before falling sharply to about 5% in October. The pound fell on global currency markets after the August inflation data release, while financial markets cut the probability of a rate rise on Thursday from about 80% to 48%. James Smith, an economist at the Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cWe\u2019re still tempted to say the Bank of England will hike rates tomorrow. But it\u2019s a close call, and both wage and inflation data suggest the end of the current tightening cycle is very close to its conclusion.\u201d Hunt said the latest inflation figures showed the government\u2019s plan was working. \u201cBut it is still too high, which is why it is all the more important to stick to our plan to halve it so we can ease the pressure on families and businesses. It is also the only path to sustainably higher growth,\u201d the chancellor said. However, the UK remains an international outlier, with the highest inflation rate among G7 economies. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe prime minister is too weak to turn things around, while his predecessor Liz Truss continues to call for the same policies that crashed the economy this time last year. \u201cThe Conservatives have wreaked havoc and working people are paying the price.\u201d"

            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy is at growing risk of recession, with industry figures showing the sharpest monthly fall in private sector activity, outside of the Covid pandemic, since the financial crisis. In a sign that higher interest rates and the cost of living crisis are combining to depress consumer demand, the latest snapshot from S&amp;P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) showed a steep drop in the UK\u2019s dominant service sector and manufacturing output in September. Aside from pandemic disruptions to the economy, the latest decrease in the purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) was the steepest since March 2009. On Thursday, the Bank of England halted its most aggressive round of interest rate increases in decades on Thursday amid growing concerns over the economy, holding borrowing costs at 5.25% after 14 previous rises. It said it was given early sight of the S&amp;P Global/Cips data before its decision. On Friday, Mike Bell of the US investment firm JP Morgan Asset Management said: \u201cThis morning\u2019s weak UK PMI business survey explains why the Bank didn\u2019t raise rates yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the weak survey data that the effect of the prior interest rate hikes is starting to bite. The weakness in the key service sector, along with the ongoing weakness in manufacturing, was probably what sealed the deal for the Bank.\u201d Total new work in the private sector fell for the third month in a row, with firms warning that cost of living pressures and higher borrowing costs, alongside cutbacks in the real estate and construction sectors, were weighing on activity. The S&amp;P Global/Cips UK PMI composite output index fell from 48.6 in August to 46.8 in September. A reading above 50 separates growth from contraction. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global market intelligence, said the reading was consistent with the economy shrinking at a quarterly rate of about 0.4%. Two consecutive quarters of decline are regarded as the technical definition of a recession. Williamson said: \u201cThe disappointing PMI survey results for September mean a recession is looking increasingly likely in the UK. Underscoring the severity of the UK\u2019s deteriorating situation, September\u2019s downturn is the steepest since the height of the global financial crisis in early 2009, barring only the pandemic lockdown months.\u201d Separate figures for retail sales in Great Britain showed some recovery in consumer spending in August, after a washout for retailers in one of the wettest Julys on record. Sales volumes rose by 0.4% on the month after a sharp 1.1% fall in July, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly stronger rebound to 0.5%. Sales in food stores drove the recovery, with growth in the volume of sales of 1.2% after a fall of 2.6% in July, when supermarkets reported that wet weather had reduced clothing sales. Sales volumes at non-food stores grew by 0.6%in August, after a fall of 1.2% in July when poor weather reduced footfall. Sandra Horsfield of the investment bank Investec said: \u201cThe trend in total retail spending volumes has been broadly sideways. The economy is entering more troubled waters and a [relatively mild and short-lived] recession is likely to ensue this winter.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-03T09:57:16Z",
            "content": "Manufacturing is struggling and house prices are sliding. There is precious little money in the kitty for pre-election tax cuts. Inflation is proving hard to shift and strikes by hospital doctors and railway workers are set to continue. The Bank of England is slowly throttling the economy with its increases in the cost of borrowing. Having dodged the recession bullet last year, there are signs the UK may not do so again in the coming months. Any good news from lower energy prices is outweighed by the impact of higher interest rates, the full effects of which have yet to be felt. It is a rotten prospect for a government that is 20 points behind in the opinion polls and has to fight an election by January 2025 at the latest. Still, amid all the gloom, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has at least something to be thankful for: Germany rather than the UK is the sick man of Europe and the laggard in the G7. Revisions to past growth data showed that the UK recovered much more quickly from the pandemic-enforced lockdowns than previously thought. Brexit, it appears, was not as big an impediment to growth as some commentators assumed. By the end of 2021, the UK had bounced back from Covid faster than Germany, France, Italy and Japan. Only the US and Canada of the major western industrial nations had performed more strongly. Naturally, the UK\u2019s performance has to be put into context. Even after the fresh look at the data by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the economy was only 0.6% bigger at the end of 2021 than it was in late 2019. There\u2019s still not much to choose between the four biggest European economies and Britain may once again slip to the bottom of the G7 league table if and when other countries revise their growth figures for the peak Covid-19 years. And although the revisions make it harder to blame Brexit for all the UK\u2019s ills, it is still possible to argue that the UK\u2019s economic performance would have been even stronger had it still been in the EU. That said, a quick glance at the updated ONS growth data shows how it has been Covid-19 and its aftermath that have really shaped the economy since the 2019 election. It was the lockdown \u2013 not Brexit \u2013 that led to the economy shrinking by a massive 20% in the second quarter of 2020. It was the furlough wage-subsidy scheme and the range of state support to keep businesses afloat that meant the economy grew by almost 17% in the three months that followed, after restrictions had been eased. The second lockdown in early 2021 was far less costly in terms of lost activity, with the economy shrinking by just 1% in the first three months of that year. It then grew by 7.3% in the second quarter, in part because businesses had learned how to operate with restrictions in place and in part because the furlough was still in place. We now know, of course, that the economy\u2019s problems did not end when it had made up the ground lost during the pandemic. As the world opened up in 2021, demand for commodities and finished goods rose sharply, leading to supply bottlenecks. The mismatch between demand and supply led to a pickup in inflation, which was assumed to be temporary but wasn\u2019t. Inflation was given another upward twist by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. At a time of labour shortages, workers sought to prevent their living standards being eroded. Fearing a wage-price spiral, central banks slammed on the brakes. It remains to be seen whether the ONS revises up growth for the period since late 2021 but, as things stand, the UK economy is about 1.5% bigger than it was pre-Covid rather than 0.2% smaller. That compares with an average of 2.8% for the other G7 nations and would still mean it had grown more slowly than any other member of the rich-nation club, bar Germany. But as Ruth Gregory, of Capital Economics, notes, the economy has been much stronger than previously thought. \u201cThe implication is that the UK economy is no longer at the back of the G7 pack and it is not so far behind the average,\u201d she said. While Hunt was, unsurprisingly, pleased at news of the growth upgrade, he was also careful not to get too carried away. That makes sense, because \u2013 as is invariably the case with the UK economy \u2013 for every silver lining there is a cloud. Or three clouds in this instance. For a start, the better performance of the economy in 2021 was confined to certain bits of the service sector: a return to more normal levels of activity in the NHS and a spending binge by consumers. Manufacturing and construction both did less well in 2021 than previously thought. This is the same old UK economy with the same old problems, in other words. Second, the recovery in the economy had pretty much fizzled out by early 2022. Since then, at least according to the latest available data, growth has pretty much flatlined, up marginally in some quarters and down marginally in others. Finally, the fact that the economy is stronger than previously thought will do little to dissuade the Bank from continuing with its tough policy stance and may indeed make some Monetary Policy Committee members warier of easing back. Interest rates are close to a peak but look set to remain high for some time to come. Hunt says the growth revisions show the resilience of the economy but forward-looking indicators of the economy\u2019s health \u2013 such as last Friday\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index \u2013 paint a darker picture. They suggest a recession is coming."

The latest purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) flash survey from S&amp;P Global showed a slight drop in the overall output index to 50.1 last month from 50.2 in August, pointing to a slight expansion (any reading above 50 signals expansion; any reading below indicates a contraction). Manufacturers and service providers reported muted demand. New orders fell at the fastest pace this year so far as demand for services slipped further into negative territory. Manufacturers also saw a drop in new sales, albeit at a slightly softer pace. Cost pressures ticked higher again, as input prices rose at a marked pace. Nonetheless, the rate of cost inflation was much weaker than those seen on average throughout the last three years, S&amp;P Global said.

As UK mortgage interest rates fall, should you choose a two-year or five-year fix? Read this piece by our Money editor Hilary Osborne. Houses prices in Germany plunged nearly 10% between April and June, the biggest fall on record. Prices fell by 9.9% in the second quarter on a year earlier, the largest decline since the series began in 2000, according to Germany\u2019s Federal Statistical Office. House prices reached an all-time high in the second quarter of 2022 during a post-pandemic boom, and have fallen every quarter since then. The latest CBI industrial trends survey paints a gloomy picture for manufacturing. All the main measures are down, including output; total orders, which fell to a five-month low, a net balance of -18 in September from -15 in August, driven by a further decline in overseas demand; export orders declined to -23 from -18 (the balance deducts the number of manufacturers who said orders rose from those reporting they fell). This suggests production will continue to contract, said Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The further decline in the CBI survey in September chimes with other evidence that the downturn in the manufacturing sector has further to run. And the true picture probably is gloomier, given that the message from the CBI survey still is stronger than that from the equivalent balance in the S&amp;P Global/CIPS manufacturing PMI. We are inclined to place more weight on the latter; the CBI survey has a smaller sample size and asks respondents to compare orders to \u201cnormal\u201d levels, rather than to the previous month, as the PMI does. On balance, then, we think manufacturing output will continue to tick down over the coming few months, as demand remains weak and firms continue to reduce their excess stock. The CBI survey, however, adds to our conviction that the rate of increase in the core goods consumer prices index will slow in the second half of this year. While the net balance of manufacturers intending to increase selling prices over the next three months increased to +14, from a 30-month low of +8 in August, it was consistent with core producer output price inflation remaining around 1%.

While the rest of Europe is still a sea of red, the UK index of blue-chip stocks has turned positive, boosted by AstraZeneca, which reported promising clinical results on a breast cancer drug.

Away from economic worries, this is a fascinating story about how the Russian oil and gas tycoon Roman Abramovich and his ex-wife Dasha Zhukova amassed one of the most significant collections of modern art in private hands, by my Guardian colleagues Rob Davies and Jonathan Jones: At first glance, the red-brick facade near a line of railway arches resembles an ordinary south London warehouse. A more careful observer might notice spiked railings, a steel door, and imposing metal gates through which lorries come and go. On a cold February day in 2014, a precious cargo left this small fortress: a spectacular and unconventional nude by the painter Lucian Freud. Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, a study of one of his most celebrated models snoozing on a well-worn sofa, the folds of her flesh filling the canvas, is recognised as a modern masterpiece. Bought at a New York auction in 2008 by Abramovich for $33.6m (\u00a326.5m), it was now emerging from storage, to be displayed in his mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens, a few miles across London. Most art lovers could only dream of wielding such power. But for Abramovich, the work was a mere fragment of a hoard of paintings and sculptures that the billionaire former owner of Chelsea football club could order up for private enjoyment at homes in England and the south of France or aboard his yacht, the $700m Eclipse. The Guardian can reveal that during an extraordinary spending spree, spanning nearly a decade, Abramovich and his ex-wife, the US-based collector Zhukova, acquired what experts believe is one of the most significant private collections of modern art ever assembled, a trove of more than 300 pieces whose worth was estimated by the oligarch\u2019s own assessors at almost $1bn. \u201cYou could fill a museum with it; this is a stupendous collection,\u201d said Andrew Renton, the professor of curating at Goldsmiths, University of London. Rupert Harrison, a member of the chancellor\u2019s economic advisory council, said: Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, is somewhat sceptical about the UK going into recession. But he added that the gloomy PMI data further increases the chances that interest rates have peaked at 5.25%. We are skeptical of the composite PMI\u2019s signal that economic activity is declining quickly, given that real wages have picked up and consumers\u2019 confidence has improved materially over recent months. The PMI has a track record of signalling downturns that have not materialised. For instance, it averaged 48.5 in Q4 2022, when GDP rose by 0.1% q/q. It also signalled quarter-on-quarter contractions in GDP in 1998 and 2001 that never materialised, as well as a dip in activity after the Brexit vote in 2016, which isn\u2019t visible in the official data\u2026 For now, then, we are sticking with our forecast for a marginal 0.1% quarter-on-quarter increase in GDP in Q3. Needless to say, though, today\u2019s report further increases the chances that the BoE\u2019s tightening cycle is over. Independent economist Julian Jessop also thinks that the UK can dodge a recession: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiled the PMI survey said: The disappointing PMI survey results for September mean a recession is looking increasingly likely in the UK. The steep fall in output signalled by the flash PMI data is consistent with GDP contracting at a quarterly rate of over 0.4%, with a broad-based downturn gathering momentum to hint at few hopes of any imminent improvement. Underscoring the severity of the UK\u2019s deteriorating situation, September\u2019s downturn is the steepest since the height of the global financial crisis in early 2009 barring only the pandemic lockdown months. The survey had warned that a revival of growth in the second quarter looked unsustainable, and the third quarter is indeed seeing a mounting toll on the economy from the reality of the increased cost of living and the recent rapid rise in interest rates. Despite higher fuel prices during the month, firms\u2019 costs grew at a sharply reduced rate overall which, combined with collapsing pricing power amid weak demand, looks set to take further pressure off inflation in the coming months. Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds Bank, said: Yesterday\u2019s pause in interest rate rises will be welcomed as a second piece of good news in as many days for businesses following Wednesday\u2019s lower than expected inflation stats. However, today\u2019s data add further weight to Bank of England concerns that economic activity has weakened and reinforces expectations in the market that interest rates are now at a peak. Nevertheless, manufacturers and services businesses are still feeling the pressures of a tight labour market that has pushed salaries up and squeezed margins in recent months. Businesses will be hoping inflation continues to head in the right direction and that signs that labour market pressures are easing will both aid recruitment and cap wage demands. The Bank of England referred to the grim business survey yesterday when it announced that it was keeping interest rates unchanged. The PMI survey said: Manufacturing production continued to decrease more quickly than service sector output, but the gap narrowed considerably in September. Service providers recorded a fall in business activity for the second month running and the rate of decline was the fastest since January 2021. The latest survey highlighted an abrupt turnaround in private sector employment numbers, thereby ending a five-month period of growth. Aside from the pandemic lockdown months, the rate of job shedding was the fastest since October 2009. Cost pressures eased, with input price inflation posting its biggest monthly fall so far this year, despite reports of pressure on costs from higher fuel bills. The risks of a UK recession have risen as business activity is shrinking at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, when months hit by Covid-19 lockdowns are excluded, according to a closely-watched survey. A steeper downturn in the dominant service sector is weighing on the UK economy, with overall business activity at a 32-month low in September, the \u2018flash\u2019 estimate from S&amp;P Global showed. Key findings (any reading below 50 signals contraction): Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 46.8 (Aug: 48.6). 32-month low. Flash UK Services PMI Business Activity Index at 47.2 (Aug: 49.5). 32-month low. Flash UK Manufacturing Output Index at 44.6 (Aug: 44.1). 2-month high. Flash UK Manufacturing PMI at 44.2 (Aug: 43.0). 2-month high. Maximilian Uleer and Carolin Raab, analysts at Deutsche Bank, said: Contrary to the rest of the eurozone, Germany has merely managed to return to its pre-Covid GDP level and the title \u201cthe sick man of Europe\u201d has reemerged in the media. We dislike the title and prefer to see Germany as a \u201csore athlete\u201d. Despite the weak GDP growth, the Dax is up 18% since the end of 2019. Germany has been facing multiple challenges, from rising energy costs, its high manufacturing exposure, to weak demand from its export destinations. Some of the challenges are \u201chomemade\u201d and might persist, while others could start to unwind and soon turn into opportunities. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: The numbers for PMI services in the Eurozone paint a grim picture, but it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. Sure, activity has been reduced once again and new incoming business has been shrinking for three months in a row. However, companies are hiring in September at a somewhat faster pace than they did in August. Thus, companies still show some resilience and optimism in the face of lower demand. Having said this, we expect the eurozone to enter a contraction in the third quarter. Our nowcast, which incorporates the PMI indices, points to a drop of 0.4% compared to the second quarter. The Eurozone\u2019s HCOB PMI figures for services are serving up a bitter pill for the European Central Bank to swallow. Input prices, where wages play an important role, have sped up in September for the second month in a row. Output prices continue to be on the increase as well, but upward pressure has softened a bit again. While the latter may bring some comfort to central bankers, the heat on input prices shows that the risk of a wage-price spiral must remain very much on the radar of the ECB. The main drag continues to come from manufacturing where the order situation deteriorated further. Companies keep reducing the stock of purchased goods. However, the declines in purchasing activity have lost some momentum. Thus, the destocking process may bottom out over the next few months in line with a worldwide trend. This will be an important precondition for the recovery of the manufacturing sector which we expect for the beginning of next year. Turning to France and Germany, de la Rubia said: In terms of the weakness in the manufacturing sector, France is catching up with Germany. Indeed, the French PMI heads further south while Germany\u2019s PMI has marginally increased from a very low level. In the services sector, the French services sector is in a much worse state than the German one. At the same time there are signs of a stabilization in Germany services, but further deterioration in France. This may have to do with the fact the luxury goods business and services play a more important role in France than they do in Germany. When things go south, those are the first to feel it, way more than non-luxury business providers. Business activity in the eurozone continued to shrink in September, as companies suffered their sharpest drop in new orders for almost three years. The worsening in output was once again led by manufacturing but the service sector also declined for the second month running, according to the \u2018flash\u2019 PMI from Hamburg Commercial Bank, compiled by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. At the same time, costs and inflation picked up although factory gate prices increased at the lowest pace in more than 2 1/2 years. The eurozone\u2019s two largest economies \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 were the key drivers of the overall downturn in activity, as we reported earlier. In the rest of the eurozone, business activity was broadly stable. Key findings (any reading below 50 points to contraction): HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite PMI Output Index at 47.1 (August: 46.7). 2-month high. HCOB Flash Eurozone Services PMI Business Activity Index at 48.4 (August: 47.9). 2-month high. HCOB Flash Eurozone Manufacturing PMI Output Index at 43.4 (August: 43.4). Unchanged rate of decline.

Stocks are ending the week under pressure as bond yields lurch to fresh cycle highs following the Fed\u2019s hawkishness and a raft of central bank announcements that cement the view that (in most cases) rates are going to stay higher for longer. The benchmark US 10-year Treasury note yield hit 4.5%, the highest in 16 years as investors fretted about inflation and the ability of central banks to ease in a slowing economy, whilst the two-year rose above 5.2%, its highest since 2006. This morning European stocks are generally lower, taking cue from a very poor performance on Wall Street saw the S&amp;P 500 notch its worst day since March. The FTSE 100 is heading for a weekly decline of around half a percent, whilst the Dax and CAC are looking at 2-3% drops. The yen fell as the Bank of Japan was unchanged with no major changes to the statement, disappointing some who\u2019d thought the central bank might have a few more crumbs on normalisation. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: The German services PMI stopped its slump and nudged up near 50 in September. This is a pleasant surprise, to be sure. However, in terms of growth it means that activity remained broadly flat following the decline recorded in August. Therefore, our nowcast for services, which considers the PMI data, continues to signal a drag in the third quarter. It\u2019s no secret that the German manufacturing sector has been going through the wringer lately. The HCOB PMIs, however, indicate that things aren\u2019t going downhill as fast as before, with the decline in new orders slowing down. In addition, the reduction in purchasing activity is losing momentum. Still, our nowcast for manufacturing production, which includes the PMI figures, is hinting at a drop of more than 2% compared to the second quarter. The goods sector is still jamming to that deflation tune of recent months, according to PMI numbers. Looking at manufacturing input prices, they keep heading south, just not as quick as before. Most probably this is due to energy prices which have spiked over the last few weeks. Factory output prices, by contrast, have been cut at a marginally faster rate than the month before. The HCOB Composite PMI confirms our view that Germany has entered once again into contraction during the current quarter, after the downturn at the tail end of 2022 and early 2023. Our nowcast points to a rather deep GDP slump of 1% compared to the quarter before. Having said this, some important sub-indicators like new business and backlogs of work, which appear to be reaching a bottom, offer hope of an end to this slump as we hit the new year. The picture is also pretty gloomy in Germany, where business activity fell for a third month in September. The HCOB \u2018flash\u2019 PMI survey compiled by S&amp;P Global said weaker demand meant average factory-gate prices rose at their slowest rate for more than 2 1/2 years, despite growing cost pressures. Employment fell for the first time since December 2020, albeit only slightly, as businesses reported shrinking backlogs of work and pessimistic expectations for activity in the year ahead. Key findings: HCOB Flash Germany Composite PMI Output Index at 46.2 (Aug: 44.6). 2-month high. HCOB Flash Germany Services PMI Business Activity Index at 49.8 (Aug: 47.3). 2-month high. HCOB Flash Germany Manufacturing PMI Output Index at 39.2 (Aug: 39.4). 40-month low. HCOB Flash Germany Manufacturing PMI at 39.8 (Aug: 39.1). 3-month high. The French economy contracted at the fastest rate for almost three years in September, according to a closely-watched survey. The flash purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey from Hamburg Commercial Bank and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence showed declines both manufacturing and services sectors accelerated markedly since August, with firms reporting poor demand. Key findings (any reading below 50 indicates contraction; any reading above points to expansion): HCOB Flash France Composite PMI Output Index at 43.5 (Aug: 46.0). 34-month low HCOB Flash France Services PMI Business Activity Index at 43.9 (Aug: 46.0). 34-month low.

Microsoft\u2019s $69bn (\u00a354bn) deal to buy Activision Blizzard, the maker of games including Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, looks set to be cleared after the UK competition regulator said a revised deal addresses its concerns. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) moved to block the biggest tech deal in history in April, citing concerns that Microsoft would dominate the nascent cloud gaming market. While the move angered Microsoft \u2013 the company called it the darkest day in its four decades operating in the UK \u2013 a revised proposal was submitted that included selling cloud gaming rights outside Europe to the French rival Ubisoft. On Friday, the CMA said that the sale of the rights \u201csubstantially addresses previous concerns and opens the door to the deal being cleared\u201d. Mortgage rates in the UK have fallen slightly, according to Moneyfacts. The average two-year fixed residential mortgage is now 6.56%, down from 6.58% yesterday, while the average five-year fix has edged lower to 6.06% from 6.07%. There are 5,295 residential deals available at the moment, slightly up from yesterday. The average two-year buy-to-let deal dropped to 6.46% from 6.48%, and the average five-year deal for buy-to-let landlords was unchanged at 6.36%. Experts expect mortgage rates to fall further in the coming weeks and months amid a \u201crate war\u201d. There are now some five-year residential deals on offer for less than 5%. European shares have opened lower, and global stocks are on track for their worst week in a month, as investors are now expecting US interest rates to stay high for some time. MSCI\u2019s index of global equities dropped 1.7%. The Bank of Japan kept ultra-low interest rates today. The US Federal Reserve also held rates this week, but expectations of swift rate cuts next year receded. In London, the FTSE 100 index slipped 21 points, or 0.3%, to 7,658 in early trading. The Dax in Frankfurt and the Ibex in Madrid both fell 0.6% at the open, as did the Euro Stoxx 600 index of Europe\u2019s leading shares. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said the coming months will be vital for retailers in the run-up to Christmas. Returning consumer confidence helped retail sales regain lost ground after a challenging July. Toiletries, cosmetics, and books performed particularly well as consumers purchased holiday essentials for their late summer getaways. Although white goods and other big-ticket items continued to take a hit as households spent more cautiously. The next few months are vital for retailers as they gear up for the all-important Christmas trading. While cost-of-living challenges continue to loom large, retailers are working hard ensuring customers get the best possible value. Their capacity to do this is limited by the upcoming rise to business rates, which will see retailers paying hundreds of millions more every year and which the chancellor should scrap in his upcoming autumn statement. Consumer confidence in the UK is continuing to improve as inflation slows, but many households are still struggling to make ends meet, according to a survey. GfK\u2019s long-running consumer confidence index increased four points in September, but remains in negative territory, at -21. Expectations for the UK economy over the next 12 months rose six points to -30, 44 points higher than last September. Confidence in personal finances for the coming year edged up by one point to -2, which is 38 points higher than this time last year. With fewer than 100 shopping days to Christmas, retailers will be relieved to see a four-point boost to the major purchase index, a measure of confidence in big ticket purchases, taking it to -20, which is 18 points higher than a year ago. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said: Against the backdrop of falling inflation figures, growth in wages and high interest rates, UK consumer confidence rose this month to minus 21, the best recorded showing since January 2022. While this month\u2019s improved headline score is good news, it\u2019s important to note many households are still struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and that economic conditions are tough. The reality is that consumer confidence remains suppressed, and the financial mood of the nation is still negative. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. A number of UK lenders including NatWest, TSB, Nationwide building society and Virgin Money have now cut their mortgage rates, with some fixed deals going below 5%. Several lenders began to reduce deals after UK inflation slowed unexpectedly to 6.7% on Wednesday despite higher petrol prices. There were more cuts to mortgage rates after the Bank of England decided to leave its base rate unchanged at 5.25% yesterday, rather than raising it as markets had expected. The move triggered hopes that the peak in rates may have been reached. NatWest announced 0.31% reductions across fixed residential and buy-to-let deals. Nationwide reduced selected fixed rates by up to 0.31% from today. The UK\u2019s biggest building society said five- and ten-year fixed rate for first-time buyers and home movers will now start at 4.94%. TSB will reduce some residential deals by up to 0.25% today, which means deals start from 5.09%. Virgin Money said its five-year fixed rates will start from 4.97%. Yorkshire Building Society also launched a sub-5% mortgage this week, lowering its five-year fixed rate to 4.99%. Lewis Shaw, mortgage expert at Shaw Financial Services, said: It\u2019s another sign of the growing rate war. Chances are we\u2019ll see much more of this in the coming few weeks, and not before time, as consumers are worrying, especially with over half a million people set to move onto new rates before Christmas. This could be the present many have been hoping for. Retail sales in Great Britain staged a modest recovery in August, rising 0.4% after July\u2019s washout when they fell 1.1%. Economists had expected a 0.5% increase. Over the three months to August, sales were up 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. Supermarkets and other food stores were the strongest performers, with sales up 1.2% last month following July\u2019s 2.6% drop when supermarkets reported that the wet weather reduced clothing sales and their food sales also fell back. It was the wettest July since 2009 and the sixth-wettest July on record since 1836, according to the Met Office. While weather in August improved on July, it was still a mixed and unsettled month, the ONS noted. Sales at non-food stores (department stores, clothing retailers and others) were up 0.6% last month, following a 1.2% decline in July. However, online sales suffered, falling 1.3% after July\u2019s 1.9% rise when heavy rain and a range of promotions boosted sales. Petrol and diesel sales fell by 1.2% as prices rose sharply.

            "title": "UK on recession alert after big falls in factory output and house prices",
            "date": "2023-09-01T14:20:21Z",
            "content": "Policymakers in the UK have been put on recession high alert after surging interest rates triggered a slump in factory output and the biggest annual drop in house prices since the global financial crisis of the late 2000s. Amid growing evidence that the 14 successive increases in the Bank of England base rate have been slowing the economy, the monthly health checks of manufacturing and the property market both pointed to a tough winter ahead. A report from S&amp;P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (Cips) found the outlook for UK industry was among the weakest recorded outside of financial crashes and the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, one of the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lenders \u2013 the Nationwide building society \u2013 said house prices had dropped by 5.3% in the year to August, the fastest annualised rate of decline since 2009. There was better news for the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, from the Office for National Statistics, whose revisions to past growth figures showed the economy rebounded faster and more strongly from Covid lockdowns than thought. By the end of 2021, the economy was 0.6% bigger than its pre-pandemic level rather than 1.2% smaller as previously thought. Hunt seized upon the news that Britain had the third fastest recovery among the G7 after the US and Canada. He said: \u201cThe fact that the UK recovered from the pandemic much faster than thought shows that once again those determined to talk down the British economy have been proved wrong.\u201d Even so, the current signs of distress from markedly different parts of the economy will add to the Bank of England\u2019s dilemma as it decides whether to raise interest rates again when its monetary policy committee meets later this month. Financial markets believe the rate-setting monetary policy committee will raise borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points to 5.5% and then leave them at that level for a considerable period. The Bank\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, added to speculation that rates would soon hit a plateau during a speech in Cape Town, South Africa, where he said he favoured a \u201cTable Mountain\u201d approach to bring inflation down to the government\u2019s 2% target. Pill accepted there was a risk the Bank\u2019s anti-inflation medicine would cause unnecessary economic damage Rob Dobson, the director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cAugust saw a further deepening of the UK manufacturing downturn. The PMI [purchasing managers index] sank to a 39-month low as output and new orders contracted at rates rarely seen outside of major periods of economic stress such as the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the pandemic lockdowns.\u201d The monthly PMI from S&amp;P/Cips is seen as a guide to what will happen to economic activity over the coming months. August\u2019s reading of 43.0 was sharply down on July\u2019s 45.3, and well below the 50 level that marks the point between expansion and contraction. Dobson said: \u201cManufacturers reported a weakening economic backdrop as demand is hit by rising interest rates, the cost of living crisis, export losses and concerns about the market outlook. While this is being felt across the manufacturing industry, business-to-business companies are especially hard hit. Intermediate goods producers saw the steepest drops in output, new orders and employment as a result.\u201d A separate PMI for the eurozone showed the problems faced by industry were not confined to the UK, although the August reading of 43.5 was slightly less gloomy than the 42.7 recorded in July. Fhaheen Khan, a senior economist at the manufacturers\u2019 organisation Make UK, said: \u201cToday\u2019s data indicates manufacturing production has hit the brakes as slowing demand takes hold of business activity. It is no longer just high inflation that is eroding spending power, but combined with higher interest rates depleting our willingness to spend has made for an unpalatable cocktail.\u201d The Nationwide said the price of the average UK home was now more than \u00a314,500 lower than in August 2022 and the weakness of the housing market was only to be expected given the spiralling cost of servicing mortgages. Robert Gardner, the lender\u2019s chief economist, said: \u201cThe softening is not surprising given the extent of the rise in borrowing costs in recent months, which has resulted in activity in the housing market running well below pre-pandemic levels.\u201d"

            "title": "Australia\u2019s economy is smaller than a year ago on a per capita basis \u2013 this happened during the GFC and 1990s recession | Greg Jericho",
            "date": "2023-09-06T15:00:02Z",
            "content": "The Reserve Bank of Australia has got what it wanted \u2013 after increasing the cash rate by 400 basis points in order to slow the economy, we now have an economy that is growing only due to population growth and even then only due to government spending. Three months ago I suggested \u201cyou should probably get used to hearing the phrase \u2018per-capita recession\u2019\u201d, and well, here we are. In the June quarter, after accounting for population growth, Australia\u2019s economy dropped for the second consecutive quarter by 0.3%. Coincidentally, Australia\u2019s economy on a per capita basis is now 0.3% smaller than it was a year ago: If the graph does not display click here Excluding the pandemic lockdowns, the last time our GDP per capita was smaller than it was a year earlier was during the GFC, and the last time before that was the 1990s recession. So, you know, not good. The past quarter saw quite a jump in our population due to the continual recovery from the pandemic and especially due to more foreign students. If the graph does not display click here Given the population grew by 0.7% our total economy should have grown much faster. That it only grew 0.4% reinforces just how weak things are. Much of the growth was due to increased exports. But a lot of those exports came from drawing down inventories. When inventories fall (as happened in the June quarter) companies are selling things that are sitting in a silo or warehouse. This was the case with mining supplies and grain exports. So in effect that drawdown in inventories cancelled out a lot of the increase in exports. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The same occurred with some household spending. There was a big jump in motor vehicles sales, but that also involved a rundown in inventories due, as the Australian Bureau of Statistics noted, to \u201cthe clearing of quarantine backlogs for motor vehicles\u201d. Take away the 6% increase in sales of motor vehicles and household consumption fell in the June quarter. As it is the increase in household spending was driven by another drop in the savings rate \u2013 down to the 2008 levels: If the graph does not display click here Here we see the real impact of the RBA\u2019s decision to increase interest rates. Households are reducing their savings levels in order to pay for essentials bills, not to go on holiday or have fun: If the graph does not display click here That really leaves us with public spending lifting the economy. In the June quarter public consumption and investment added 0.3 percentage points to GDP growth. Take that away and the economy didn\u2019t grow at all: If the graph does not display click here That\u2019s not to say it is all bad news. The past year has seen a nice increase in business investment \u2013 both in non-dwelling construction and in machinery and equipment \u2013 and also some good growth in public sector infrastructure spending. This hopefully will bolster employment even as people are spending less in the shops: If the graph does not display click here Aside from the drop in GDP per capita, the big news of the national accounts is that the terms of trade (essentially the ratio of the prices of our exports and our imports) fell 7.8% \u2013 the biggest one-quarter fall since the GFC and the fourth biggest on record. This was due to a big fall in the coal and gas prices due to (don\u2019t laugh) climate change, which has seen above-average temperatures in the northern hemisphere, as well as a weaker Chinese economy that saw less demand for our iron ore. With this came a fall in corporate profits, and as a result the increase in wages and salaries drove growth in the income side of the economy: If the graph does not display click here The total amount of compensation of employees rose 1.6% in the June quarter, well above inflation growth (which actually fell across the total economy due to those falling export prices). As a result, real labour costs rose 3.2% in the June quarter. As sizeable jump to be sure, but it is worth noting that the cost of labour in real terms remains about 1.2% below what it was prior to the pandemic. If the graph does not display click here So, if wages are rising now does this means households are better off? The increase in wages combined with an increase in hours worked means that the amount workers are getting per hour has risen. It\u2019s no longer as low as it has been in real terms since 2012; now it is just as bad as it has been since 2013: If the graph does not display click here But real household disposable income per capita is down some 5.3% on where it was a year ago. Households overall are much worse off than they were a year ago and roughly back to where they were before the pandemic. If the graph does not display click here It is thus not surprising that the economy is struggling. When you get down to it, the economy is really about households, and when they struggle, so too does everything else. And that is exactly what the Reserve Bank wanted to happen. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

            "content": "While detained at Miami\u2019s Krome detention center, Andres Domingo was sexually assaulted multiple times. An investigation by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) corroborated Domingo\u2019s claims and his legal team said this automatically made the 25-year-old Guatemalan native eligible for a U-visa, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services regulation. Given to victims of sex crimes or any crime that leads to mental and psychological suffering or abuse, the U non-immigrant status allows victims to remain in the US. Yet, Domingo\u2019s last request for the visa was denied on 25 August. Domingo\u2019s experience underscores the concerns surrounding the rising and systemic mistreatment of detainees in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention centers. It also raises questions about the effectiveness of the system and the protections it offers to vulnerable individuals in its custody. On 26 January, Domingo reported he was sexually assaulted three separate times by three different detainees at Krome that month. In the series of assaults, Domingo said he experienced unwanted sexual advances and harassment by fellow detainees. During the first incident, one detainee allegedly groped and kissed him in the bathroom in the morning; later that night, the same detainee masturbated beside him in their shared cell that holds about 80 detainees. In the second assault, a detainee allegedly followed him to the bathroom and attempted to have sex with him, touched his penis, then followed him to his bed where he laid next to Domingo and groped his butt. Domingo resisted and threatened to report him, with an eyewitness, Eriberto Reyes, confirming Domingo\u2019s version. In the third assault, while showering, Domingo was allegedly targeted again when another detainee attempted to engage in sexual activity. As Domingo fought back, the assailant purportedly scraped his penis with the protruding end of a battery, an account corroborated by two other detainees, Kelvin and Eriberto Reyes. Domingo said he did not immediately report the incidents because he was scared and ashamed. Some of \u201cthe detainees have always made fun of me because I would not want to get out of the bed\u201d, he said. \u201cThe detainees would say I was a maric\u00f3n [derogatory Spanish term to call someone homosexual].\u201d When Domingo finally reported his assaults, he was temporarily moved to another building. He alleged that one of the Ice captains, whom he only referenced as Captain Lopez and had allegedly witnessed one of the attacks, forced him to write a statement that no one had sexually assaulted him. \u201cI was coerced into signing a document that said I was not forced to have sex,\u201d Domingo said. \u201cI felt that those coming to speak to me \u2013 [the Ice officials] \u2013 were bullying me and pushing me to be done with the case \u2026 I feel that the guards and the captain did not take my report seriously because they were making fun of me, they were calling me \u2018motherfucker\u2019\u201d. Two months after he reported the three incidents at Krome, on 3 March, DHS investigated, according to the escalation procedure for such cases. Their findings, reviewed by the Guardian, claimed Domingo\u2019s report of sexual assaults was \u201csubstantiated\u201d. Kenia Garcia, Domingo\u2019s lawyer, quickly filed for the U-visa, following the requirements. \u201cTo apply for the U-visa itself with USCIS [US Citizenship and Immigration Services], you have to have a certification,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is usually from the investigative unit that says, number one: the person was a victim of the crime. And number two: the person cooperated with law enforcement, because that\u2019s the purpose of the U-visa.\u201d Garcia said the issue Domingo now faces with receiving the U-visa is that Ice doesn\u2019t investigate sex crimes for the purposes of issuing a U-visa; only Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a separate investigative unit within Ice, can review such cases. HSI has yet to do this, Garcia said, because HSI officials allege that the sexual assault must be reported to local law enforcement \u2013 in this case, in Miami-Dade \u2013 by Ice or the office of professional responsibility (OPR) before HSI can investigate. Ice and OPR continue to point the finger at HSI, saying they are the ones to take action. Representatives from Ice did not return the Guardian\u2019s request for comment before publication. \u201cThese cases continue to happen for the same reason that over 200 immigrants have died in Ice custody since 2003,\u201d Priyanka Bhatta, a senior attorney with Project South, a non-profit advancing racial justice. \u201cThis is a rogue agency with a proven track record of not being able to care for the people in its custody. This is further proven by the US Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations hearing which concluded that Ice did not have appropriate vetting procedures.\u201d As the matter continues to be drawn out, Domingo said he\u2019s in fear for his life. Following the sexual assaults, he was moved to Broward Transitional Center. There, he said he was attacked by another detainee who \u201cbeat me in the chest and tried to cut me with a cutter after a dispute for the TV channel I was watching\u201d. He was hospitalized twice at the Fort Lauderdale Behavioral Health Center. The first time, for 10 days, was due to his deteriorating mental health condition and chest pains. The second time was for 20 days \u2013 a result of a blood infection he received from when the Krome detainee scraped his penis. Domingo said the transfers have made it difficult for his lawyers to keep up with his whereabouts, jeopardizing his court hearings. He said his cases are now called last because Ice officials told him it\u2019s for his protection \u2013 so he\u2019s never in the same room as his Krome attackers. \u201cI just feel that I continue to be punished for the criminal acts of someone else when I am the victim,\u201d Domingo said. \u201cSince I was moved to another detention center, Ice has failed to take me to my scheduled court hearings twice, and my case has been delayed as a result.\u201d This shuffling act is precisely how the system protects itself \u201cwhile silencing and retaliating against those who came forward to make the complaints\u201d, said Amanda Diaz, a senior national hotline manager at Freedom for Immigrants (FFI). \u201cThe immigration detention system is designed to hinder accountability, and the nature of detention makes it difficult to investigate and seek remedy. Some of these factors include Ice\u2019s constant transferring of people to different detention centers without warning, communication and visitation barriers, and language access failures, to name a few.\u201d Domingo\u2019s case is hardly an outlier. Freedom for Immigrants\u2019 national immigration detention hotline has received thousands of calls from detainees reporting abuse and mistreatment while in Ice detention. Since January 2020, the non-profit group dedicated to abolishing immigration detention has received 307 reports of sexual abuse or harassment from 153 unique individuals. Most callers are from Mexico, El Salvador, Jamaica, Guatemala and Haiti. This year alone, they\u2019ve received 33 reports of sexual abuse or harassment from 20 unique individuals. Most complaints were from El Salvador, Mexico, Colombia and Jamaica natives. Further data from FFI show that Ice has been found to violate Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea) law routinely. Of the cases documented, the DHS office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) investigates only a fraction of these cases. Less than one in four complaints made to the CRCL are investigated. Between 2010 and 2016, DHS recorded at least 33,000 instances of physical abuse and sexual assault. These incidents were primarily committed at Ice and customs and border protection facilities. Less than 1% of these complaints were investigated, according to federal data obtained by FFI in 2017. More recent government records obtained by Futuro Media and NPR have further displayed that these staggering failures of accountability and prevention have persisted. \u201cThese numbers are only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cBecause Ice does not have robust reporting mechanisms in place, and because the agency routinely violates Prea laws, the vast majority of cases go unreported due to Ice\u2019s culture of intimidation, retaliation and secrecy \u2026 People who endure this abuse have little to no path to justice or accountability, and this is by design. Immigration detention is an inherently abusive, secretive and isolating experience.\u201d Domingo fled his home country to the US on two separate occasions. He first fled Guatemala in July 2014 after the Mara 18, one of the largest gangs in Central America, attempted to recruit him. Members attacked Domingo when he refused to join them. During his asylum interview obtained by the Guardian, Domingo said he couldn\u2019t go to the police because law enforcement rarely intervenes in gang recruitment efforts. He feared reporting it would compel the Mara 18 to have him killed. He was deported in January 2020. His second and last entry attempt was on 10 February 2020, following a second attack by another Mara gang member who discovered Domingo had returned. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in conspiracy theories,\u201d Garcia, Domingo\u2019s lawyer, said, \u201cbut this certainly feels like one \u2013 [it\u2019s] that extreme and unusual \u2026 I have begged for my client to have another review so that they may independently corroborate the facts as my client [reported]. They just don\u2019t seem to be making it onto the paper of the interviewer or investigator.\u201d Domingo said all he wants now is justice and a chance at his American dream: to start a carpentry and freight business. He dreams of buying a home and car for his family in Fort Myers, Florida \u2013 his partner of six years, whom he met in the US, and three children \u2013 and seeing them as a free man. \u201cI would like for people to pay for what they have done to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like for them to be persecuted for the sexual abuse of which I was a victim, as the law says they should. I would like for immigration to [follow] their rules and to help me in the U-visa process because I have been a victim of a crime. I would like to be free, to feel safe again, and to continue with my immigration case outside of detention.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-05T16:46:50Z",
            "content": "Amid rumbling scandal over gifts given to conservative justices by wealthy rightwing donors, one such justice, Samuel Alito, became the subject of an ethics complaint filed by a senior Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island said recent public comments by Alito \u201cappear to violate several canons of judicial ethics, including standards the supreme court has long applied to itself\u201d. Whitehouse lodged the complaint in a letter to the chief justice, John Roberts. Alito is an acerbic voice in the conservative bloc that dominates the court, counting Roberts among its members. Earlier this year, Alito was the subject of a report by ProPublica detailing an undeclared fishing holiday with the billionaire Paul Singer. Another conservative justice, Clarence Thomas, has been the subject of multiple reports about undeclared gifts, by ProPublica and other outlets. Both justices deny wrongdoing but Alito has been much more assertive in hitting back at critics. To Roberts, Whitehouse wrote: \u201cThe Wall Street Journal on 28 July 2023 published an interview with Justice Alito conducted by David Rivkin and James Taranto. Justice Alito\u2019s comments during that interview give rise to this complaint.\u201d The interview was headlined \u201cSamuel Alito, the Supreme Court\u2019s Plain-Spoken Defender\u201d. Whitehouse continued: \u201cThe interview had the effect, and seemed intended, to bear both on legislation I authored and on investigations in which I participate. During the interview, Justice Alito stated that \u2018no provision in the constitution gives [Congress] the authority to regulate the supreme court \u2013 period\u2019. \u201cJustice Alito\u2019s comments appeared in connection to my Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act, which the Senate judiciary committee had advanced just one week before \u2026 that bill would update judicial ethics laws to ensure the supreme court complies with ethical standards at least as demanding as in other branches of government.\u201d Like most attempts to rein in the supreme court, including calls for justices to resign or be impeached and removed, Whitehouse\u2019s bill has little chance of succeeding, given Republican opposition. Whitehouse said he was bringing the complaint as the only senator who was part of the majorities on the judiciary and finance committees, both of which have tried to investigate supreme court ethics, arising from reporting about Alito and Thomas. Roberts, however, has rejected calls to testify on the subject. Whitehouse also said Alito, in his Wall Street Journal interview, \u201cexpressed an opinion on a matter that could well come before the court\u201d, something nominees to the court, including Alito, Thomas and other current conservative justices, have long said they will not and should not do. Whitehouse contended that Alito was therefore in breach of the code of conduct for US federal judges, to which supreme court justices are notionally subject. In practice, however, supreme court justices in effect govern themselves, frustrating calls for Alito and Thomas to face action over links with figures potentially with political motives and/or business before the court. Whitehouse said Alito had made matters worse by intruding into a specific matter. \u201cAs the author of the bill in question and as a participant in the related investigations,\u201d Whitehouse wrote, \u201cI feel acutely the targeting of this work by Justice Alito, and consider it more than just misguided or accidental general opining. It is directed to my work.\u201d Whitehouse also pointed to links between David Rivkin, an attorney and one of Alito\u2019s interviewers in the Journal, and Leonard Leo, the rightwing mega-donor whose ties to Thomas and Alito \u2013 Leo was on the Alaska fishing trip with Paul Singer examined by ProPublica \u2013 have attracted widespread attention, particularly given Leo\u2019s role in tilting the court to the right. Whitehouse continued: \u201cThe final unpleasant fact in this affair is that Justice Alito\u2019s opining, apparently at the behest of his friend and ally\u2019s lawyer, props up an argument being used to block inquiry into undisclosed gifts and travel received by Justice Alito. \u201cAt the end, Justice Alito is the beneficiary of his own improper opining. This implicates [legal] strictures against improperly using one\u2019s office to further a personal interest: a justice obstructing a congressional investigation that implicates his own conduct.\u201d In conclusion, Whitehouse told Roberts: \u201cAs you have repeatedly emphasised, the supreme court should not be helpless when it comes to policing its own members\u2019 ethical obligations. \u201cBut it is necessarily helpless if there is no process of fair fact-finding, nor independent decision-making. I request that you as chief justice \u2026 take whatever steps are necessary to investigate this affair and provide the public with prompt and trustworthy answers.\u201d Leslie Levin, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said the senator had \u201copened Pandora\u2019s box with little obvious upside \u2026 we can expect a stream of complaints against all the supreme court justices\u201d. In a statement to the Guardian, Kyle Herrig, senior adviser to the watchdog group Accountable.US, said Roberts \u201csat back and watched while the supreme court corruption crisis reached a fever pitch, causing public trust in his court to plummet\u201d and \u201ccontinues to dodge all responsibility\u201d. \u201cThankfully, Senator Whitehouse recognises the urgency of the situation at hand. It\u2019s far past time for Chief Justice Roberts to clean up his court.\u201d The supreme court did not immediately comment."

            "title": "Childhood in care raises risk of entering English youth justice system eightfold",
            "date": "2023-09-21T09:22:41Z",
            "content": "The largest ever study of care experience and the youth justice system in England has revealed that children who have lived in care are eight times more likely to have received a youth justice caution or conviction than those who have not. Using data collated by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Department for Education, the study monitored the experiences of almost 2.3 million children born in England between 1996 and 1999. Their data was recorded between the ages of 10 \u2013 the minimum age of criminal responsibility in England \u2013 and 17. It revealed that 33% of care-experienced children received a youth justice caution or conviction, compared with 4% of those without care experience. This figure was even higher for some care-experienced minority ethnic groups including black Caribbean (39%), mixed white and black Caribbean (42%), Travellers of Irish heritage (46%) and Gypsy/Roma (50%). The study, led by Dr Katie Hunter, a lecturer in criminology at Manchester Metropolitan University, and supported by Lancaster University, was funded by Administrative Data Research UK. Of the children monitored, 2,241,250 did not have care experience and 50,070 did. Care-experienced people accounted for 2% of the overall dataset but 15% of those with youth justice involvement and 32% of those who received a custodial sentence. At total of 9%of black and mixed ethnicity care-experienced children received custodial sentences \u2013 almost twice as many as white care-experienced children. The proportion of those with no care experience who received a custodial sentence was less than 0.5%. Hunter said minority ethnic care-experienced children faced a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d of disadvantage. Children with experience of care were far more likely to be \u201cjuvenile prolific offenders\u201d \u2013 defined by the MoJ as individuals who have received four or more youth justice cautions or convictions. Care-experienced children with a criminal record had an average of seven cautions or convictions, compared with three for those without care experience, while those who identified as black and mixed ethnicity received on average eight and nine youth justice cautions or convictions respectively. Children with a criminal record who had been in care were more than twice as likely to be given a custodial sentence as those who had not. Indian and Pakistani children with care experience were least likely of all ethnic groups to have experience of the youth justice system (16%), but this was still four times higher than children who have not experienced care. Hunter pointed to a number of reasons why care-experienced children were more likely to have a criminal record and to be over-represented among prolific offenders: they are often criminalised for behaviour that would not result in a youth justice intervention if it had occurred in a non-care setting; children can face excessive surveillance in care; police can unfairly target certain categories of children, including those from broken families. Care-experienced children are also more likely to have mental health and drug problems and to struggle at school, all of which increase the likelihood of being criminalised. Hunter said these disadvantages could be exacerbated by instability and a lack of support available within the care system. During the period covered by the study, the number of children cautioned or convicted in England fell sharply. About 39% of care-experienced individuals born in 1996 received a criminal record, compared with 26% of those born in 1999. The drop was steeper for those without care experience, with youth justice involvement halving from 6% to 3% across the four birth years, so the gap between the two groups widened during this period. While care-experienced children born in 1996 were seven times as likely to be cautioned or convicted as their non-care-experienced peers, those born in 1999 were nine times more likely. Anne Longfield, the chair of the Commission on Young Lives and a former children\u2019s commissioner, said: \u201cThe disproportionate number of care-experienced children who receive a youth justice caution, conviction or custodial sentence is shocking. This is further proof that many of the systems that are supposed to protect and support our most vulnerable young people, particularly black and minoritised children, are instead failing them. \u201cWithout better investment in and reform of children\u2019s mental health services, children\u2019s social care, family support and the education system, we are writing off the life chances of thousands of young people before they even reach adulthood.\u201d David Graham, the national director of the Care Leavers\u2019 Association, said: \u201cThe figure of 33% of such children having contact with the youth justice system is far higher than previous estimates. It is a terrible indictment of the failure of local authorities to parent and support children in their care. If birth parents were told there was a one-third chance their children would end up in the youth justice system, they would do whatever it took to stop this happening. It is time for the government to wake up to this situation and take concrete steps to support children in care to lead positive and thriving lives.\u201d A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of children in care do not have any interaction with criminal justice system \u2026 We have a national protocol in place on reducing the unnecessary criminalisation of looked-after children and care leavers, and are taking action on risk factors that can lead to criminal behaviour, including through our work to improve school attendance.\u201d"

            "content": "The court of appeal judge Lady Justice Thirlwall has been appointed to lead the public inquiry into Lucy Letby\u2019s murder of seven babies in an NHS hospital. The health secretary, Steve Barclay, described Thirlwall as \u201cone of the country\u2019s most senior judges\u201d as he announced her appointment in a statement to the House of Commons on Monday. Thirlwall was called to the bar in 1982 and became a part-time judge in 1998. She was made a senior barrister the following year. She was appointed as a high court judge in the queen\u2019s bench division in 2010 and to the court of appeal in 2017. In 2016 she was appointed to the Sentencing Council, which produces guidelines on sentencing. She was the presiding judge in the 2013 case of Mick and Mairead Philpott and Paul Mosley, who together plotted to set fire to a Derby home, which led to the deaths of six children. Barclay said he had told Thirlwall that the families of Letby\u2019s victims were hoping that the inquiry would be split into distinct sections to avoid having to wait until its completion to get any answers. \u201cI have raised with Lady Justice Thirlwall that the families should work with her to shape the terms of reference,\u201d said Barclay. \u201cWe hope to finalise these in the next couple of weeks so the inquiry can start the consultation as soon as possible. \u201cI have also discussed with Lady Justice Thirlwall the families\u2019 desire for the inquiry to take place in phases so it provides answers to vital questions as soon as possible.\u201d Barclay confirmed, as announced on Wednesday, that the Letby inquiry would be on a statutory footing. The government had initially said it would be a non-statutory inquiry, citing the desire for a shorter timescale, but changed its mind in the face of growing criticism that without the necessary powers to compel people to give testimony under oath or force the disclosure of documents it would be unfit for purpose. Giving the inquiry statutory powers will mean that former and current staff of the Countess of Chester hospital trust, where Letby worked as a neonatal nurse, could be obliged to appear. Barclay told the Commons that the change to a statutory inquiry came after he arranged for the police liaison officer to meet the families of Letby\u2019s victims to discuss with them the form the inquiry should take. He said their wishes were clear. Barclay told MPs: \u201cThis inquiry will examine the case\u2019s wider circumstances, including the trust\u2019s response to clinicians who raised the alarm and the conduct of the wider NHS and its regulators.\u201d Thirlwall was educated at St Anthony\u2019s Girls\u2019 Catholic academy in Sunderland. She told the Times her first job was a Saturday shift on the checkout at her local branch of Littlewoods. She said her most inspiring book was I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the first volume of Maya Angelou\u2019s autobiography, because the author faced \u201cdiscrimination and adversity of every kind with profound strength and determination\u201d."

            "content": "My friend and former colleague Pete Mallaby, who has died aged 62 of Parkinson\u2019s disease, was a teacher at Holland Park school in west London for 20 years. He completed his PGCE at the Institute of Education in London (now UCL Institute of Education) and began teaching at Stockwell Park school in 1982. The following year he moved to Holland Park, where he and I met as young, inexperienced but enthusiastic teachers. Pete rapidly established himself as a well-respected, and one of the first, school teachers of computing and IT. It was an exciting but politically charged time to be working for the Inner London Education Authority. Pete was a proud, openly gay man and an advocate for gay rights. His comfortable manner and sense of social justice made him a compassionate and insightful teacher. He taught with ease and without ego. If pupils were curious about his sexuality, he would always respond simply and truthfully. His honest answers provided a safe space for young people questioning their own sexuality. The introduction of clause 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act, banning the \u201cpromotion\u201d of homosexuality, created a hostile environment that Pete navigated with dignity, helping colleagues to understand this challenging legislation and its implications. It coincided with the HIV and Aids epidemic and a period of immense sadness in Pete\u2019s personal life as friends became ill and died after contracting Aids. Pete was a valued staff member at Holland Park, a teacher-governor, a union representative and a member of the social committee; using his natural gifts as a socialiser to include each and every one of us. In 2000 Pete was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s. It was a devastating diagnosis that he bore with fortitude, eventually taking medical retirement from Holland Park in 2003. It is a testament to his charm that TfL employees made sure he arrived safely at Notting Hill Gate station each morning by ringing ahead to alert transport staff that he was on his way from Brixton. In 2007, following his civil partnership with Shane Wood, he underwent deep brain simulation surgery, which brought some short-term relief from debilitating Parkinson\u2019s tremors. Pete was born in Stockton-on-Tees. County Durham, to Harold and Rena (nee Fraser), who were both office workers. Following secondary education at Ian Ramsey Church of England School, he completed a data processing degree at Leeds University in 1981. As a young boy, he was a regular truant, self-educated in the local library, where he developed an encyclopedic general knowledge. Later he became a quiz show fanatic and won an array of competition prizes. In later years, with Shane, he regularly campaigned for Parkinson\u2019s research and development, hoping that if he could live long enough, a cure would eventually come. He will be remembered for his friendliness, razor-sharp wit and love of a good night out. He is survived by Shane."

            "content": "Judy Deacon didn\u2019t shut herself away after her son, Jesse, was shot and killed by New South Wales police two months ago. Instead, the 79-year-old harnessed her anger. She started lobbying politicians, health professionals and the force itself. Police officers should not be involved in most mental health call-outs, Deacon told anyone who would listen. And if they were, they needed to be better trained. Deacon thinks police officers shouldn\u2019t carry guns but understands they likely will. In that case, she says, weapons should only go to members after they\u2019ve been in the force for \u201ca number of years\u201d and have a proven track record. \u201cI don\u2019t think the reality that he [Jesse] is dead will sink in for me until I see things changed,\u201d Deacon told Guardian Australia this week after the fourth fatal interaction between NSW police and a vulnerable person in as many months. When Deacon heard last week that a woman had died in Newcastle after being Tasered and shot with bean bag rounds, her first thought was: \u201cThis is endless.\u201d She decided it was time to share Jesse\u2019s story. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with people because it\u2019s not my fight, it is everyone\u2019s fight, and everyone has to work together so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d \u2018He was struggling, but on the way up\u2019 In July, Jesse Deacon, 43, was shot dead by police in his Glebe home on the Franklyn Street public housing estate. In the hours before his death, Jesse had gone to his neighbour\u2019s house to ask for a cigarette. They saw his arm was dripping with blood and called triple zero to report that Jesse was self-harming, his mother says. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup When police arrived, they entered the home and found Jesse holding a knife. One officer tried to use a Taser but it failed, so another officer fired his gun. Deacon says Jesse was shy and expressed himself through music. He struggled with his mental health for most of his life. In high school, he was diagnosed with affective psychosis, which leads to hallucinations and delusions. \u201cWe made sure he had every support available to him,\u201d his mother says. \u201cHe appeared normal \u2013 but he was struggling with a lot of demons. When you\u2019ve been mentally ill for decades it takes a while to climb out.\u201d Jesse drifted from living in rental accommodation, boarding houses and sometimes with family. Often, he self-medicated with drugs and was in and out of hospitals. Recently, he was in hospital on remand after he hit someone while experiencing a psychotic episode, Deacon says. But he had been given a home at Franklyn Street after almost six years on the public housing waiting list and was discharged from hospital on the proviso he took anti-psychotic medication fortnightly. \u201cHe seemed like he was on the way up,\u201d Judy says. He was visited twice a week by support staff funded via the NDIS. \u201cHe\u2019d stopped taking methadone, he\u2019d cut his hair, he was smartening up.\u201d When she got a phone call telling her to attend a police station, Deacon thought she would be told Jesse had been hospitalised again. \u201cOn my way, his father rang me crying, and I knew straight away he was dead,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it never entered my head it was a police matter.\u201d \u2018Police training can escalate a situation\u2019 The chief executive of mental health advocacy organisation Being, Priscilla Brice, says when police attend mental health call-outs they assess and deal with any risks before calling in a mental health clinician. That isn\u2019t the right approach, she argues. \u201cIt blows my mind they aren\u2019t part of the initial response,\u201d Brice says, adding specialists should be on the scene from the start. The NSW police acting commissioner, David Hudson, agrees to a certain extent. On Tuesday, he revealed bean bag rounds fired at Krista Kach during the siege in Newcastle last week penetrated her chest and hit her heart, killing the 47-year-old. During the same press conference, he said NSW police were deployed to 64,000 mental health incidents last year and \u201cto be perfectly honest many of those incidents we probably should not have been deployed to\u201d. \u201cShowing up in uniform, showing up with police training, can escalate a situation rather than deescalate it, and we would suggest that perhaps [mental health] clinicians are better placed to resolve some of these incidents.\u201d A NSW parliamentary inquiry is examining how and if police should respond to mental health emergencies. The Greens MP Amanda Cohn, who is chairing the inquiry, has said NSW would not need to reinvent the wheel to come up with alternatives, pointing to the ACT model whereby a paramedic, mental health clinician and police officer respond together in an unmarked vehicle. NSW has trialled a Pacer program. The Police Ambulance and Clinical Early Response pilot stationed 36 mental health clinicians in 10 police area commands and districts with the aim of ensuring police powers were used only when necessary in responding to mental health crises. According to Greens MP Sue Higginson, Kach\u2019s daughter believed if she had been able to talk to her mother without the \u201cheavily weaponised riot squad\u201d, she likely could have de-escalated the situation. Kach\u2019s family said in a statement on Monday: \u201cWe told the police in no uncertain terms that she was not well that day and she needed medical help.\u201d They say NSW police assured them before the shooting incident that they would look after their mother and that she would be cared for by \u201cqualified medical professionals\u201d. A report released in May by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission found almost half the people involved in NSW police operations that resulted in death or serious injury were experiencing a mental health crisis. Among the report\u2019s seven recommendations was an urgent call for better mental health training for officers. On Monday, NSW police announced it was accepting that recommendation and would update its mental health training program. Deacon says Kach\u2019s death \u201cis a tragedy for the victim and their family\u201d. \u201cBut [the police] are also not doing their own people a favour by not giving them the necessary support to handle these situations.\u201d In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Other international suicide helplines can be found at befrienders.org"

            "date": "2023-09-19T11:42:56Z",
            "content": "In a spat over coverage of the relaxation of the US Senate dress code, the Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman, who will now be allowed to wear his signature hoodies and shorts in the chamber, told the data analyst Nate Silver: \u201cI dress like you predict.\u201d Silver, who rose to fame to run the polling site FiveThirtyEight.com but whose predictions for recent elections have proved controversial, had tweeted: \u201cStarting a new political party for people who don\u2019t give a shit either about how John Fetterman dresses or what Lauren Boebert does in a theatre.\u201d Boebert, a far-right House Republican from Colorado, has been ensnared in scandal over her ejection from a Denver theatre earlier this month, for behaviour during the Beetlejuice musical including taking selfies, vaping and groping her date. Silver took Fetterman\u2019s response in good humor, saying of his notional new party, \u201c100% of our members so far think Fetterman is kind of inherently funny and the Boebert story is hilarious.\u201d The relaxation of the Senate dress code, which previously required formal wear for business in the chamber, was instituted by Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader. The New Yorker said he would still wear a suit but the move prompted criticism among Republicans and right-leaning media. Republican senators were mostly restrained in their criticism \u2013 Joni Ernst of Iowa said \u201cI don\u2019t like it; I think we\u2019ve got to maintain a level of decorum\u201d \u2013 but as Fox News pundits weighed in, so did prominent rightwingers including Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor who is campaigning for the presidential nomination. Speaking in Jacksonville, DeSantis said: \u201cThe US Senate just eliminated its dress code because you got this guy from Pennsylvania who\u2019s got a lot of problems ... he wears, like, sweatshirts and hoodies and shorts ... We need to be lifting up our standards in this country, not dumbing down.\u201d Referring to DeSantis\u2019s flatlining challenge to Donald Trump, Fetterman responded: \u201cI dress like he campaigns.\u201d From the US House, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2013 a fierce competitor to Boebert for the crown of most infamous Republican \u2013 called Schumer\u2019s decision \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. \u201cDress code is one of society\u2019s standards that set etiquette and respect for our institutions,\u201d said the far-right conspiracy theorist, who has loudly heckled the president during State of the Union addresses, once while dressed as a balloon. Adding, \u201cStop lowering the bar!\u201d Greene claimed Schumer was acting to \u201cappease\u201d Fetterman. The Democrat, 54, does present an unusual appearance on Capitol Hill: a moustachioed former mayor of Braddock, in Pennsylvania steel country, he stands 6ft 8in (203cm) in his socks and often walks the corridors of power in shorts, short-sleeved shirts and hoodies. In response to Greene, Fetterman pointed to her behaviour in a recent hearing on Republican allegations concerning Hunter Biden, when she displayed explicit pictures. \u201cThankfully,\u201d Fetterman said, \u201cthe nation\u2019s lower chamber lives by a higher code of conduct: displaying ding-a-ling pics in public hearings.\u201d Fetterman also retweeted a message from Tina Smith, a Democratic colleague. Pointing to the looming 30 September deadline for Congress to avoid a government shutdown, the Minnesota senator wrote: \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re bitching about Senate dress code when House Republicans are about to drive the federal government off a cliff? Again? Talk about disgraceful.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-22T20:00:08Z",
            "content": "A report detailing how Clarence Thomas secretly participated in donor events staged by the hard-right Koch network drew more fierce protests and outrage over the conservative supreme court justice\u2019s proliferating ethics scandals. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee who has advanced ethics reform amid reports about Thomas and other justices, said: \u201cOh, my. \u201cMore undisclosed private jet travel, more fingerprints of the billionaire-funded court fixer Leonard Leo\u201d \u2013 a rightwing activist widely linked to Thomas \u2013 \u201cmore engagement with billionaire-funded organisations scheming to influence the court.\u201d Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who chairs the Senate judiciary committee, said: \u201cOnce again, Justice Thomas\u2019s gaggle of fawning billionaires expands and their influence on the court grows larger. \u201cThe Koch brothers are the architects of one of the largest, most successful political operations in history, aimed at influencing all levels of government and the courts. Justice Thomas hid the extent of his involvement with the Koch political network and never reported gifts associated with these engagements.\u201d Kyle Herrig, senior adviser to the campaign group Accountable.us, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Justice Thomas sees his position on our nation\u2019s highest court as a way to upgrade his own lifestyle with no regard for ethics or consequences.\u201d The report linking Thomas to Koch donor summits at Bohemian Grove, an exclusive all-male resort in California, was just the latest blockbuster from ProPublica, the nonprofit newsroom that has hounded the justice over his failure to declare links to and generous gifts from rich rightwing donors often with business before the court. Outlets including the New York Times and Politico have also reported on links between Thomas, his wife, the far-right activist Ginni Thomas, and influential activists and donors. The new report said Thomas attended Koch events at least twice, putting him \u201cin the extraordinary position of having served as a fundraising draw for a network that has brought cases before the supreme court, including one of the most closely watched of the upcoming term\u201d. That case, Loper Bright Enterprises v Raimondo, concerns the right of federal agencies to regulate businesses in areas including labor rights and environmental and consumer protection. Durbin said Thomas should step aside. \u201cThe Koch network has invested tremendous capital to overturn longstanding legal precedent known as Chevron deference, which would handcuff regulators and serve the interests of corporate fat cats,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cAs more details are revealed of Justice Thomas\u2019s undisclosed involvement with the Koch political network, there are serious questions about his impartiality in cases squarely confronting the Chevron doctrine. For these reasons, I\u2019m calling on Justice Thomas to recuse himself from consideration of Loper Bright v Raimondo.\u201d A Koch spokesperson denied wrongdoing, saying: \u201cThe idea that attending a couple events to promote a book or give dinner remarks, as all the justices do, could somehow be undue influence just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Thomas did not comment. He has said he did not declare gifts from donors because he was advised he did not have to. Subsequent filings revealed more such links. Supreme court justices are nominally subject to the same ethics rules as all federal judges. On Friday, Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer now a law professor at the University of Minnesota, said the new ProPublica report showed Thomas \u201cviolated: 1) financial disclosure laws, 2) laws prohibiting judges from participating in partisan fundraising (the Kochs have a super pac) and 3) recusal laws for judges. 28 U.S.C. 455. He simply does not understand or care about the law.\u201d In practice, however, the justices govern themselves. John Roberts, the chief justice, has rebuffed demands for testimony in Congress about reports of links with rightwing donors also involving Samuel Alito, another hard-right justice. With Republicans opposed and holding the House, Democratic-led ethics reform stands next to no chance of success. Calls for Thomas to resign or be impeached have come from figures as influential as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York. But such calls also stand next to no chance. Only one supreme court justice has been impeached: Samuel Chase, unsuccessfully, in 1804-05. In 1969, Abe Fortas resigned, amid a scandal over his financial dealings. Thomas is 75 but has no apparent reason to resign or retire. The senior conservative on the court, he is a key part of a 6-3 rightwing majority, years in the making by activists and Republicans in Congress, that has handed down epochal decisions including the removal of the right to abortion. Herrig, of Accountable.us, added: \u201cAs ethics violations by Thomas and others keep piling up, Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s lack of action becomes more egregious. The chief justice must demand Justice Thomas recuse himself from upcoming cases with Koch network conflicts of interest. We need accountability and reform now.\u201d Media observers also reacted to the new ProPublica report. Jane Mayer of the New Yorker, co-author of Strange Justice, a seminal book on Thomas\u2019s controversial confirmation in 1991, asked: \u201cDoes justice go better with Koch?\u201d Dahlia Lithwick, who covers the supreme court for Slate magazine and hosts the Amicus podcast, wrote simply: \u201cPay. To. Play.\u201d David Rothkopf, a columnist and author of books including Traitor: A History of American Betrayal from Benedict Arnold to Donald Trump, asked: \u201cIs Clarence Thomas the most corrupt supreme court justice in our history? One of the most corrupt senior officials in our history? \u201cThere is no doubt any more.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-20T18:42:01Z",
            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told the UN security council that the way to bring peace in Ukraine and to prevent further wars of aggression is through fundamental UN reform. The Ukrainian president argued that the war had demonstrated the need to limit veto power, give the UN general assembly the power to override vetoes, and expand the council\u2019s permanent members beyond the current five powers, who acquired their privileged position in the wake of the second world war. Addressing the UN security council in New York, the Ukrainian president said the fact that Russia \u2013 the aggressor state in Ukraine \u2013 also has a veto to prevent the security council doing anything to stop the war, made a nonsense of the UN. \u201cAll the UN actions, either by the security council or by the general assembly, that could have stopped this aggression are shattered by the privilege granted to the aggressor with this seat,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cWe should recognise that the UN finds itself in a deadlock on the matters of aggression. Humankind no longer pins its hopes on the UN when it comes to the defence of the sovereign borders of nations,\u201d he added. In the current system, Zelenskiy said, the search for real solutions has been displaced by \u201caspirations to compromise with killers\u201d. He laid out proposals for UN reform as part of his 10-point peace plan. He supported a suggestion, which has been championed by France in the past, that in case of \u201cmass atrocities against human rights\u201d the veto powers of the permanent members \u2013 Russia, the US, UK, China and France \u2013 should be voluntarily suspended. Anticipating that Russia would not relinquish its privilege, Zelenskiy argued the UN general assembly should have the power to override a security council veto, with a two-thirds majority. The president also threw his weight behind widespread and growing calls for the expansion of the security council to accommodate more permanent members, giving broader representation for Asia, a seat for the African Union, the Islamic world, and Germany. Over the past year, the US has also expressed support for security council reform. It is an issue that drives a wedge between Russia, China and the global south, including fellow members of the Brics group: Brazil, South Africa and India. Moscow and Beijing have historically been opposed to any changes in the status quo that would affect their veto. At the beginning of the session, the Russian permanent representative, Vasily Nebenzya, had challenged Zelenskiy\u2019s right to speak first in the council. The Albanian prime minister, Edi Rama, chairing the session, told Nebenzya: \u201cThere is a solution for this. If you agree you will stop the war, President Zelenksiy will not take the floor.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-05T21:30:07Z",
            "content": "The New York police department (NYPD) has agreed to ban several controversial policing tactics used on demonstrators \u2013 as part of a settlement agreement in response to lawsuits about police behavior during the 2020 racial justice protests. The New York state attorney general Letitia James, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Legal Aid Society announced the reforms on Tuesday after the parties sued the city\u2019s police department. James issued a statement noting the agreement will \u201csignificantly\u201d change how the NYPD responds to mass demonstrations in future. The NYPD will adopt a four-tiered response system that emphasizes de-escalation versus flooding protests with police officers, James\u2019s office said, as seen in the 2020 racial justice protests that erupted across the US and internationally after the police in Minneapolis murdered George Floyd in May 2020. The NYPD will also hire a senior executive who will oversee the implementation of the new response system in public demonstrations. City police tactics such as \u201ckettling\u201d, where officers encircle and press upon a group of demonstrators, will be banned, NYCLU, the New York state affiliate of the ACLU, announced in a post on Twitter, now known as X. Police will also no longer be allowed to use low-flying helicopters to intimidate protestors in New York City. Officers will only break up protests as a \u201clast resort\u201d, the NYCLU added, and will only make arrests after giving three warnings for crowds to disperse. \u201cThe right to peacefully assemble and protest is sacrosanct and foundational to our democracy. Too often peaceful protesters have been met with force that has harmed innocent New Yorkers simply trying to exercise their rights,\u201d said James in the statement. \u201cToday\u2019s agreement will meaningfully change how the NYPD engages with and responds to public demonstrations in New York City.\u201d Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, also celebrated the forthcoming changes, calling the reforms balanced. \u201cOur administration is committed to improving our policies to keep New Yorkers safe and protect their civil liberties,\u201d said Adams in a statement, the New York Times reported. Adams noted the reforms would protect public safety while also safeguarding the first amendment rights of demonstrators to exercise free speech. The latest agreement comes as New York City paid out record settlement amounts to protestors injured by police while demonstrating for racial justice in 2020. New York officials announced in July they would pay out a total of $13.7m to protestors who were beaten and arrested by police at a protest for George Floyd in 2020. In March, New York City already agreed to pay $6m to protesters who were detained, arrested and subjected to excessive force during a racial justice protest in the Bronx borough. As of May this year, at least 19 US cities had agreed to pay out a total of more than $80m to protestors injured during 2020 demonstrations, a record amount experts say is only likely to increase."

            "date": "2023-09-21T01:58:09Z",
            "content": "A report ranking climate change misinformation gave Twitter (recently rebranded as X) only a single point out of a 21-point scorecard when assessing policies aimed at reducing inaccurate information \u2013 the worst out of five major tech platforms. The Climate of Misinformation report by Climate Action Against Disinformation looked at Meta, Pinterest, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter for their content moderation policies and efforts to mitigate inaccurate information such as climate denialism. The group, which is made up of dozens of international climate and anti-disinformation organizations including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, released the report to draw attention towards climate misinformation on major platforms and makes the claim that big tech has become a \u201ccomplicit actor\u201d in accelerating the spread of climate denial. Twitter\u2019s rank in the survey was because it failed to meet almost any of the organization\u2019s criteria for climate misinformation policies, which ranged from having clear and publicly available information on climate science to having clearly articulated policies on what actions the company will take against the spread of misinformation. The report noted that billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of the company last year added to the confusion over how policies are enforced and how the company makes content decisions. \u201cElon Musk\u2019s acquisition of the company has created uncertainty about which policies are still standing and which are not,\u201d the report stated. Twitter received its only point in the report for fulfilling one of the researchers\u2019 requirements that platforms have an easily accessible and readable privacy policy. Twitter was also the only platform to lack a clear reporting process for flagging harmful or misleading content for higher review. Tech platforms have long struggled with creating effective or coherent policies on content moderation, while events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election resulted in swaths of misinformation circulating online. Amid conservative backlash and labor cuts in the tech industry, many companies have also deprioritized content moderation and opened the door to potential surges in misinformation on their platforms. Although the other platforms fared better, none ranked especially high on the report\u2019s scale \u2013 Pinterest scored highest with 12 points out of a possible 21. Issues ranged from a lack of clear definitions of what constituted climate misinformation, failure to enforce existing policies in a transparent way and a lack of proof that companies apply these policies equally across different languages. None of the companies release public reports on how their algorithmic changes affect climate misinformation, according to the report. The organization\u2019s authors advocate for a number of changes to big tech\u2019s policies, including establishing clear guidelines on climate and updating privacy policies to show when private data is being sold to advertisers that could be linked to the fossil fuel industry. Although anti-misinformation groups such as Climate Action Against Disinformation have repeatedly advocated for big tech to make investments in their content moderation, the trend in the past year has often been the opposite. Musk has hollowed out Twitter\u2019s moderation capabilities while reversing policies to allow for the targeting of transgender people as well as the spread of anti-vaccine falsehoods. YouTube also reversed its policy to allow for election denialism, while Instagram allowed anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr back onto its platform."

            "content": "Scientists have written to Rishi Sunak asking him to stop \u201cpoliticising\u201d and attacking the Climate Change Committee (CCC), an independent body that exists to advise the government on five-year \u201ccarbon budgets\u201d necessary to meet its 2050 target. This week Sunak spoke about his plans to weaken his government\u2019s environmental policies. When asked about comments from Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, saying that the government would not hit the carbon budget with its current plans, Sunak replied: \u201cI am very happy to get opinions and advice from everybody, and everyone\u2019s entitled to their view.\u201d He added: \u201cFor those who disagree with me \u2026 the question\u2019s for them \u2013 they should explain to the country why they think it\u2019s right that ordinary families up and down the country should fork out five, 10, \u00a315,000? \u2026 I don\u2019t think they need to, and if someone disagrees then they should explain why.\u201d Subsequently Conservative headquarters wrote to journalists outlining measures from the CCC and asking them to demand that the Labour party reveal whether it would adopt them in government. Bob Ward, the director of communications at the Grantham Institute for Climate at Imperial College, said in a letter to Sunak, seen by the Guardian: \u201cMy primary concern is a document that was circulated to journalists by Conservative campaign headquarters after your speech, which attempted to politicise the advice of the Climate Change Committee. \u201cAlthough this document was described as \u2018Questions to Labour on Net Zero\u2019, it included a section on \u2018New measures which the CCC has said would need to be introduced \u2026\u2019 It cited issues described as \u2018road taxes\u2019, \u2018flight taxes\u2019 and \u2018diet change\u2019.\u201d Ward continued in his letter: \u201cWhile your government is perfectly entitled not to accept advice from the committee, it is extremely unhelpful to politicise its role and its advice in this way. I hope that you will find an opportunity to acknowledge this mistake and to reaffirm the importance of the committee offering robust and rigorous independent advice on compliance with the Climate Change Act.\u201d Prof Martin Siegert, a co-director of the Grantham Institute, said this was a \u201ccynical move\u201d to openly add criticism to the body that offered independent advice, adding: \u201cI have listened with concern in recent days. The PM\u2019s focus, and those of cabinet and other ministers and members of government, on claiming the CCC is recommending policies that are unaffordable to the general public. They are clearly not government policy, and can only become policy under this government. When asked where these ideas came from, the response has been that the CCC recommended them.\u201d The government is in charge of appointing the new chair of the committee, and there are fears among the scientific community that Sunak will choose someone who allows him to weaken the next carbon budgets, or that the prime minister will stoke public distaste for the committee in order to change the carbon budgets in parliament. A spokesperson from No 10 responded by sending comments Sunak made to broadcasters earlier in the week in which he said: \u201cLots of people will have lots of different views on this. We\u2019ve been through the numbers. we\u2019re confident that we are on track to deliver all our targets. And I would point out people have predicted we would miss our carbon budgets in the past, but we\u2019ve actually met every single one of them.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-07T05:13:37Z",
            "content": "In the face of growing food security concerns due to climate change, scientists in New Zealand are attempting to grow fruit tissue in labs. While work on lab-grown meat has made headlines in recent years, similar work on fruit is less common. Scientists at Plant &amp; Food Research in the southern city of Christchurch are aiming to change that by growing fruit tissue from plant cells that they hope will one day taste, smell and feel like real fruit. Researchers hope that the program will help safeguard the country\u2019s food security. \u201cHere in New Zealand, we\u2019re good at growing conventional horticultural crops,\u201d said Dr Ben Schon, the lead scientist for the Food by Design program at the government-backed Plant &amp; Food Research, \u201cbut looking into the future, there\u2019s a lot of change coming in the world with population growth, increasing urbanisation and climate change.\u201d The program aims to grow fruit tissue without the parts that are usually discarded like the core of the apple or the rind of an orange. Providing consumers with only the tissue of fruit will help reduce food waste, said Schon. Lab-grown foods could play a pivotal role in sustainable agriculture but are still in very early stages of development, according to Dr Ali Rashidinejad, a senior food scientist at Massey University in Palmerston North who is not involved in the program. Since lab-grown food is a completely new concept, once it is developed, it will then have to prove its safety to regulatory bodies likely through expensive and long clinical trials. \u201cOvercoming such hurdles can take years if not decades,\u201d Rashidinejad said. Consumers will also need to accept the practice; older generations might prove to be hesitant but research shows that younger generations are willing to try new foods if those foods offer health benefits while limiting environmental impact, said Rashidinejad. The Plant &amp; Food Research program, which started 18 months ago, focuses on cells from blueberries, apples, cherries, feijoas, peaches, nectarines and grapes, but they warn that the end goal of harvesting something that is nutritional and enjoyable to eat is some years away and might not be attainable at all. The technology would probably be suitable for growing fruit tissue within cities, said Dr Sam Baldwin, a strategy leader at Plant &amp; Food Research, in the hope that it would reduce the cost and carbon emissions created when transporting food into urban centres. However, it\u2019s unclear how the carbon footprint of such lab-grown fruit would compare to those grown using traditional methods, which may have to be transported long distances if imported. The technology could also offset the food lost in weather events. Earlier this year, Cyclone Gabrielle, decimated parts of Hawkes Bay, an area known as New Zealand\u2019s fruit bowl. The cyclone came as many kiwifruit growers were preparing to harvest their crops. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we realise that we are going to need to produce more food for a bigger population but with less areas to grow and under increasing pressure from a non-conducive climate,\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cBusiness as usual might not be able to address that need.\u201d"

Carmakers in the UK will still be mandated to sell electric vehicles from 1 January or face fines, despite Rishi Sunak\u2019s U-turn on banning new petrol and diesel vehicles, under plans expected to be confirmed by ministers this week. The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold for the first time in almost two years in a knife-edge decision underscoring the risks to the economy, leaving borrowing costs at 5.25% and warning that rates will remain high to tackle inflation. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has said that the current economic situation makes tax cuts \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d. (See 4.29pm.) Boris Johnson is to avoid censure for breaking the rules on ex-ministers taking up new jobs despite the government accepting he committed a breach over his appointment as a Daily Mail columnist. In his interview with LBC\u2019s Tonight with Andrew Marr, Jeremy Hunt also claimed that the government had not yet taken a final decision about whether or not to scrap phase two of HS2. At the end of last week it was reported that Rishi Sunak had \u201cmade up his mind\u201d to cancel phase two of HS2, from Birmingham to Manchester, and also to cancel the final few miles into central London, leading to HS2 ending at Old Oak Common, and not reaching Euston. On Monday Richard Holden, a transport minister, repeatedly refused to commit to the Manchester phase two, and to the Euston extension, when he took questions in the Commons. At his press conference yesterday Sunak also ducked a question about HS2. Asked if the government was committed to the Manchester leg, Hunt told Marr: I\u2019m not going to comment on discussions that are happening at the moment, because as chancellor, you would expect me to be having discussions with the prime minister, when major infrastructure projects overrun in their costs. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re facing with HS2. Hunt said MPs would be worried if they thought costs were running out of control. But he went on: Let me say to you now, Andrew, we haven\u2019t made any decisions on this. We are looking at all the options. But we do need to find a way of delivering infrastructure projects that doesn\u2019t cost taxpayers billions and billions of pounds. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, has said that the current economic situation makes tax cuts \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d. In an interview with LBC\u2019s Tonight with Andrew Marr, Hunt also said that he faced some \u201cvery difficult decisions\u201d in the autumn statement in November, which is his next major opportunity for announcements on tax and spending. Hunt was responding to a question about the Bank of England today leaving interest rates on hold. When it was put to him that this meant government borrowing costs would be lower than they would have been with a rate rise, and when he was asked what he would say to those who claimed this meant there was headroom for tax cuts, Hunt dismissed the idea. He told Marr: Every chancellor wakes up to newspaper headlines at least once a week that say there\u2019s extra headroom and the chancellor might be able to do this or do that. I really really wish it was true but unfortunately it just isn\u2019t. If you look at what we are having to pay for our long-term debt it is higher now than it was at the spring budget. I wish it wasn\u2019t. It makes life extremely difficult, it makes tax cuts virtually impossible and it means that I will have another set of frankly very difficult decisions. All I would say is if we do want those long-term debt costs to come down then we need to really stick to this plan to get inflation down, get interest rates down, I don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to happen but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen before the autumn statement on November 22, alas. Hunt\u2019s comment is likely to anger Tory rightwingers who feel that taxes are already too high and who have been repeatedly calling for cuts. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has posted a message on X/Twitter about the Sky News Starmer story (see 3.54pm), claiming that it shows Labour wants to \u201crejoin the EU in all but name\u201d. But commentators take the view that there is nothing particularly significant in what Keir Starmer said because he was just summarising the stance that Labour has taken on this for a long time. This is from the New Statesman\u2019s George Eaton. Starmer\u2019s \u201cwe don\u2019t want to diverge\u201d is a more explicit statement of existing policy. Labour has long spoken of embracing \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d with the EU. These are from the Critic\u2019s Rob Hutton. Did we think Labour did want to diverge from EU standards? This seems to me the problem with any Tory attack line on this. If Labour take office in 2024 and find a Britain still in alignment with the EU, that\u2019s on the people who\u2019ve been in government since 2020. Paul Waugh from the i says the Labour party doesn\u2019t feel the need to issue a clarification (although it did give a quote to Sky News \u2013 see 3.54pm.) Labour say no need for clarification as they included the clip in their own social media, and it was livestreamed and available for free online. And this is from Rob Merrick from Devex. The mad world of post-Brexit politics\u2026.the Foreign Sec says a policy not to lower food, worker or environmental standards is \u201crejoining the EU\u201d Keir Starmer has said that he does not want the UK to \u201cdiverge\u201d from the EU in terms of standards. He made the comment at the weekend in Canada, at the Global Progress Action summit, but Sky News has only now broadcast the footage. Labour has repeatedly said that it wants a better relationship with the EU, and in an interview with the Financial Times published on Monday Starmer said that he wanted a \u201cmuch better\u201d Brexit deal, with more alignment in areas like veterinary rules. But Sky News claims Starmer\u2019s comment about not diverging surprised EU diplomats. Starmer told the summit in Canada: Most of the conflict with the UK being outside of the [EU] arises in so far as the UK wants to diverge and do different things to the rest of our EU partners. Obviously the more we share values, the more we share a future together, the less the conflict. And actually different ways of solving problems become available. Actually we don\u2019t want to diverge, we don\u2019t want to lower standards, we don\u2019t want to rip up environmental standards, working standards for people that work, food standards and all the rest of it. So suddenly, you\u2019re in a space where, notwithstanding the obvious fact that we\u2019re outside the EU and not in the [European Economic Area], there\u2019s a lot more common ground than you might think. Approached by Sky News for a comment, Labour said that the party did not want to diverge from the EU in the way some Tories want to diverge, but that Starmer was not committed to dynamic alignment either. The spokesperson said: One of the [two contradictory] Brexit arguments was that the UK could become Singapore-on-Thames i.e. the whole deregulation agenda of everything from environmental to labour reforms. We\u2019ve always rejected that, we\u2019re not interested in that sort of divergence. That doesn\u2019t mean we support dynamic alignment. We\u2019re not joining the single market or the customs union. We will not be in a situation where we are a rule taker. Dynamic alignment would mean the UK agreeing to match all EU regulations as they evolve over time, as a condition for securing easy access to the EU market. When Boris Johnson negotiated his Brexit deal he specifically rejected this approach because it would mean the UK being obliged to follow laws made by the EU. Joining the single market would require dynamic alignment, but Labour has ruled that out. Sam Coates from Sky News has posted the Starmer clip on X (formerly Twitter). Carmakers in the UK will still be mandated to sell electric vehicles from 1 January or face fines, despite Rishi Sunak\u2019s U-turn on banning new petrol and diesel vehicles, under plans expected to be confirmed by ministers this week, Gwyn Topham reports. In his interview on the Today programme this morning (see 11.15am) Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, also suggested that Rishi Sunak was guilty of \u201cwishful thinking\u201d when he said the UK was on course to meet it climate change targets. Stark said: Let\u2019s look at where we are on this. In June we said the progress that we\u2019ve seen recently on cutting emissions will not take us to the 2030 target. We\u2019ve been cutting emissions by about 1% per year, outside of the power sector, the one sector we\u2019ve been doing well. That needs to quadruple over the next eight years. What has happened since then is that we\u2019ve had a failed auction for offshore wind, and now a setback from some of the key policies that the prime minister. That is going to make it harder to hit the 2030 goal. We\u2019re going to go away and do the numbers on that. But the key thing is that those goals still remain. The prime minister recommitted to them. So I would say that the wishful thinking here is that we have not got a policy package to hit the legal targets that this country has set in law through the Climate Change Act. Asked if he was saying Sunak was guilty of wishful thinking, Stark replied: I think the government needs to look again at the policies. We need to do more. There\u2019s no real question of that. So, yesterday was not about doing more, it was about doing less. According to the i\u2019s Eleanor Langford, Conservative MPs have been responding very positively to Rishi Sunak\u2019s net zero announcement in a private WhatsApp group. EXC: Leaked WhatsApp messages seen by @theipaper show backbench MPs rallying around the PM despite backlash over rowing back on net zero measures MPs praised Rishi Sunak for \u201cleading from the front\u201d and \u201cseizing the agenda\u201d in a group for all Tory MP A government minister told the group that he\u2019d received dozens of messages of support from local small business owners and constituents following Wednesday\u2019s announcement. One MP told @theipaper that they \u201chaven\u2019t seen an outpouring like this before\u201d for Rishi Sunak Here is John Crace\u2019s sketch of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Today programme interview with Nick Robinson. John wasn\u2019t impressed \u2026 Yesterday Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, issued a strongly-worded press release reprimanding Rishi Sunak for making a major statement on net zero policy less than 24 hours after the Commons started an (arguably overlong) recess. During his visit to Chelmsford today, Sunak was asked about the comment from the speaker, and also about Tory MPs opposed to his policy. In response, Sunak ignored the point made by the speaker, who said an announcement like this should have been made in the chamber where the PM could be questioned by MPs. Sunak just gave a standard answer about being focused on doing the right thing for the country. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP who until recently chaired the Commons standards committee, claims that Sunak was in breach of the ministerial code, which stresses the importance of major announcements being made to parliament. A Nolan principle inscribed in ministerial code is accountability. Sunak made parliament go into recess on Tues to avoid #PMQs. He also made his announcements yesterday the day after the commons had energy security questions. He\u2019s repeatedly breached his ministerial code. Hoyle said yesterday that, if he had the power to recall parliament for the net zero announcement, he would have done so. Currently only the government can recall parliament. Bryant says that should change. Just to be clear, only the prime minister can ask the speaker to recall parliament from a recess. One of the many things we could and should change. In fact, the list of parliamentary rules that Bryant would change goes well, well beyond this. He has recently published a book, Code of Conduct, arguing that, on the basis of the number of misconduct cases we have seen, the current parliament (from 2019) has been the worst in history. He argues for a series of reform to improve standards and curb the power of the executive. Fizzing with righteous anger, and full of good history and juicy anecdote, it\u2019s a must-read for anyone even remotely interested in how parliament operates. It is also not too long, and right about most things, which makes it ideal as a political book. There was a change of personnel at this week\u2019s first minister\u2019s questions in Edinburgh: with Humza Yousaf in New York for Climate Week, his deputy, Shona Robison, took the floor in his stead. No doubt aware that opponents would be eager to bring up Rishi Sunak\u2019s net zero U-turn, the Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, raised climate policy first, but attacked Yousaf\u2019s comments this week that Aberdeen would no longer be the oil and gas capital of Europe. Robison said Ross was \u201cbrave\u201d to raise the issue, saying: Rishi Sunak has essentially pulled the rug from under the net zero ambitions, not just of the UK, but potentially damaging the net zero ambitions of Scotland. As Ross accused the SNP of creating a \u201ccliff edge\u201d for current oil and gas jobs in the north-east, it\u2019s plain that Sunak isn\u2019t the only Tory leader convinced there are votes to be had here in advance of the general election. Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell pointed out: \u201cThis is about the next election not the next generation.\u201d YouGov has released some new polling on whether the Conservatives or Labour, and Rishi Sunak or Keir Starmer, are seen as best placed to handle 10 policy issues. Starmer leads Sunak on seven issues (including asylum and immgiration, by quite a large margin). But they are tied on two, the economy and defence, and Sunak has a narrow lead on Brexit. And, at party level, Labour also leads the Conservatives on seven issues. They are tied on the law and order, and on Brexit, and the Tories are seen as best on defence. Keir Starmer has been tweeting about net zero this morning. Good jobs. Cheaper bills. Real energy security. That\u2019s why my Labour government will make Britain a clean energy superpower. This is not unusual. Labour has for some time now been framing its net zero strategy as a jobs plan. This is justified, and may be electorally sensible, but Tom Belger, the LabourList editor, expresses concern in an article today that this messaging downplays the importance of climate issues. \u201cThe green agenda thus also risks being dismissed as Corbyn-style loony lefty zealotry, despite Starmer\u2019s relentless efforts to shun his predecessor,\u201d he says. No further action will be taken against Boris Johnson after he was accused of committing a \u201cclear and unambiguous breach\u201d of the rules on former ministers, Rishi Sunak\u2019s deputy has said. PA Media reports: Johnson was rapped on the knuckles by the anti-corruption watchdog in June after he gave them only 30 minutes\u2019 notice ahead of a public announcement that he was taking up a new role as a Daily Mail columnist. Johnson landed the job a day after he became the first ever former prime minister to be found to have lied to parliament in the publication of the damning report into his Partygate denials. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), charged with setting conditions on former ministers when they enter new jobs, to prevent a revolving door of appointments, wrote to ministers after the clash with Mr Johnson calling for urgent reform to the rules governing post-ministerial jobs, including sanctions for breaches. Deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden, in a letter to Acoba published today, said the Cabinet Office regarded that it would be \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to take any further action towards Johnson beyond acknowledging the breach. He said the Cabinet Office had accepted the watchdog\u2019s assessment that the \u201crisk surrounding media appointments are limited\u201d and that they were \u201ctypically subject to the conditions that former ministers are already required to abide by\u201d following their exit from high office. \u201cI therefore also accept that it would be disproportionate to undertake further action in these circumstances other than the public exchange of such correspondence (noting that there was a breach),\u201d he said. Dowden said the UK government was \u201cminded\u201d to exempt books, journalism and media appearances from strict business appointment rules in the future. It comes after Dowden in July announced a new ethics scheme designed to strengthen punishments for ex-ministers who breached the guidelines with new appointments. One major change looked to address the breach Johnson was accused of, with a \u201cministerial deed\u201d introduced to legally commit ministers to the rules on accepting jobs after they leave office, binding them by the same restrictions as civil servants. The ethics report said a tightening of the rules could include further sanctions including \u201cfinancial penalties\u201d for breaches. In his letter to Acoba on Thursday, Dowden said the reforms were likely to take a softer approach towards media work in order to support free speech. He continued: \u201cAs part of these reforms, the government is minded that media appearances, books or journalism should in due course be formally exempted from the business appointment rules (whilst still maintaining duty of confidentiality requirements). This recognises also the importance of the rights to free speech within the law. This \u2018minded to\u2019 approach is therefore guiding in the assessment of appropriate steps on this particular issue.\u201d PA describes Acoba as an anti-corruption watchdog. That is standard journalese, but it is misleading because \u201cwatchdog\u201d implies that Acoba can do something about people who break the rules. In July the government announced plans that could lead to people facing a financial penalty if they don\u2019t follow Acoba advice, but previously the body has been dismissed as toothless. Even Lord Pickles, the Tory peer who chairs the body, has described it in those terms. Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, told the Today programme this morning that the policy changes announced yesterday would make it even harder for the government to meet its climate targets for 2030. Asked about the announcements, Stark said: We\u2019re still going over what the prime minister said yesterday in Downing Street, but it\u2019s difficult to escape the idea that we\u2019ve moved backwards from where we were when we did our last assessment of progress. We do that every single year, and we did that in June with what was the government\u2019s old programme. And in June, what we said to the government was that it didn\u2019t look like we were on track for the government\u2019s targets in 2030. Remember, these are legal goals. So I worry about what the government announced yesterday, because it looks like those goals will be even harder to hit with this softer package now around climate policy. In June the CCC said its confidence in the government being able to meet its climate goals from 2030 onwards was \u201cnow markedly less than it was in our previous assessment a year ago\u201d. It said: UK greenhouse gas emissions have so far fallen 46% from 1990 levels. At Cop26, a stretching 2030 commitment was made to reduce them by 68%. In only seven years, the recent rate of annual emissions reduction outside the electricity supply sector must therefore quadruple. Time is now very short to achieve this change of pace. Glimmers of the net zero transition can be seen in growing sales of new electric cars and the continued deployment of renewable capacity, but the scale up of action overall is worryingly slow. The government continues to place their reliance on technological solutions that have not been deployed at scale, in preference to more straightforward encouragement of people to reduce high-carbon activities. The committee has again flagged the risks of a policy programme that amongst other things is too slow to plant trees and roll out heat pumps. Rishi Sunak insists that, even with the changes announced yesterday, the government is on course to meet its 2030 targets. (See 9.16am.) Rishi Sunak has claimed that climate change zealots do not understand the impact the measures they support might have on families. Speaking to the media during a visit to an agricultural college this morning, he said: Lots of people have lots of different views on this. We\u2019ve been through the numbers, we\u2019re confident that we are on track to deliver all our targets. As I said yesterday \u2026 it gets polarised between extremes. There are people who just want to deny climate change is happening \u2013 they\u2019re wrong \u2013 and on the other side there are people who approach this with more ideological zeal where they just don\u2019t care about the impact on families. In fact, many of those criticising Sunak over this have been arguing that the debate over net zero targets isn\u2019t polarised and that it is a rare example of a policy area where, until yesterday, there was a lot of cross-party consensus. Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, was giving interviews this morning while Rishi Sunak was on the Today programme. Here are some of the main points she has been making. Badenoch insisted that many businesses wanted the government to delay net zero targets, as Sunak announced yesterday. She told Times Radio: If you speak to the Department for Transport, you speak to the Net Zero, Energy and Security Departments, you will see that this is something where we\u2019ve been receiving multiple representations across the board. I\u2019m not going to go into the details of who those are, those are private businesses, but we are not just doing this for the fun of it. We are doing it because we are looking at the consequences of forcing people to take on change that they are not ready to take on. She dismissed criticism of the move from Zac Goldsmith, the former minister who resigned complaining Sunak is not sufficiently committed to the environment. Goldsmith, who is a multi-millionaire, yesterday called for an early election because he opposes Sunak\u2019s announcement so strongly. Asked about his comment, Badenoch told Sky News that Goldsmith was a friend. But she went on: Most people in this country don\u2019t have the kind of money that he has. We have to think about what people can reasonably afford. We have people who are not connected to the gas grid who are being made to make changes that are simply not feasible. She criticised the Sky presenter Jayne Secker for suggesting that the policy changes would not help the poor because they did not have cars. Badenoch claimed that was a \u201cludicrous\u201d statement, even when Secker put it to her that a third of people in the country don\u2019t have a car. (The figure for households without a car is a bit lower, at 22%, according to government figures.) Secker also put it to her that poor tenants would lose out as a result of the decision to cancel the requirements for landlords to improve heating efficiency. Badenoch misunderstood the question, and said the changes to the rules affecting boilers would not disadvantage the poor. Scotland will have to push back its ban on new petrol and diesel cars to 2035 following Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement yesterday, the SNP has said. Dave Doogan, the party\u2019s energy spokesman at Westminster, said the Scottish government will not be able to stick to the target of ending the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030 because the country is \u201csnared\u201d into the UK Internal Market Act. In an interview with BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland, Doogan was asked how the SNP government in Scotland would respond to the announcement. He said: We will have to move to 2035 because even if the Scottish government did have the authority to intervene in that particular legislation, which is reserved to the Department for Transport and its agencies, principally the DVLA, we are snared in the United Kingdom into the Internal Market Act, which would see the UK government intervene in any policy undoubtedly which created a difference between the market in Scotland and the market in the rest of the United Kingdom. What we\u2019d have to be very careful if we decided to do that is that we didn\u2019t put our motor manufacturing retail business at a strategic disadvantage by operating in a way that was completely different to that which was in England, resulting in cross-border trade to access vehicles that you couldn\u2019t access in Scotland, so it\u2019s a complex dynamic and of course at the base of all of this is the fact that the UK Government didn\u2019t consult the Scottish government on any of this. Doogan also claimed Sunak\u2019s move was an \u201cunprecedented tragedy for the automotive industry in the United Kingdom\u201d. He explained: The market environment was set out by the Conservative government in 2020 and industry has been gearing up and tooling up and investing in that market environment, only to find out as of yesterday from the Prime Minister that they\u2019re actually now operating in a completely different environment. They\u2019ve been establishing a market supply chain that will provide a greater proportion of electric vehicles by a time of around 2030, where now UK consumers will be in a position to continue to buy internal combustion engine cars, so they\u2019ll have a mismatch between market demand and product availability that they\u2019ve been tooling up for on the basis of Government market instruction. I don\u2019t think it can be underestimated how foolish and irresponsible it is for the UK government to create a market environment and then three years later create an entirely different market environment. Emily Dugan has a summary of how the newspapers are covering Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech yesterday. They divide along left/right lines, but these are probably some of the best headlines Sunak has had from the Tory papers for ages. Here is some reaction to the Rishi Sunak interview from journalists and commentators. From Ian Birrell, the reporter, commentator and former Independent deputy editor Sunak\u2019s interview with @BBCr4today was unconvincing - posing as architect of change after 13 years of Tory rule, bemoaning cost of living despite his high taxes and banging on about honesty after being skewered over deceitful claims on 7 bins, taxing meat &amp; compulsory car sharing From Rob Burley, a Sky News editor Lots of opinion about whether Sunak right or wrong on net zero &amp; his motivations. I\u2019m NOT making a comment about substance, but his performance with @bbcnickrobinson (who\u2019s no slouch) was more effective than recent outings, seems to have something approaching the Sunak mojo back. From the i\u2019s Paul Waugh The PM\u2019s most uncomfortable moment came on a \u2018meat tax\u2019. He said CChange Cttee urged Govt to \u2018implement measures\u2019 for \u2018accelerated change in diets\u2019 . But Ctte actually urged \u201cLow-cost, low-regret actions to encourage a 20% shift away from all meat by 2030\u201d. Nothing re meat tax. From the FT\u2019s Jim Pickard Sunak has a point when he says other major economies (France, Germany, Canada etc) have a 2035 petrol car ban question is why the government has bounced around from a 2040 plan to a 2032 idea to a 2030 pledge to a revised 2035 pledge, that\u2019s what\u2019s annoying business leaders From the Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker In his own less blustery way, Rishi Sunak is equally bad at answering questions as Boris Johnson ever was. From Politico\u2019s Charlie Cooper Struck by parallels between Sunak\u2019s new net zero rhetoric and Brexit messaging Positioning himself as protecting people from a \u201cWestminster\u201d policy agenda, with a warning that not making concessions now could lead to bigger backlash in the future Here are the main lines from Rishi Sunak\u2019s Today programme interview. Sunak declared that he was entering a new phase of his premiership, and that after a year bringing \u201cstability and competence\u201d into government, he now wanted \u201cto change the direction of the country\u201d. He said: What I\u2019m interested in doing is changing the direction of our country. I want to build a better future for our children, and that\u2019s what I think about every day. Now, the first year I\u2019ve had this job, I\u2019ve brought stability and competence into government, into our country, into our economy, and that was necessary and important. But what I want to do now is, in a series of decisions, change the direction of our country. And I believe that, if we want to do that, we have to change the way we do politics. You can\u2019t chase the short-term headline. You\u2019ve got to do the things that are right in the long term. That\u2019s not going to be easy. I know I\u2019ll get criticism and flak for it, as you\u2019ve seen over the last day or two. But I\u2019m not going to be deterred from doing what I think is right for the long-term future of our children. This was interesting for two reasons. First, it\u2019s confirmation that the net zero changes are just the first in a series of announcements Sunak is planning that will mark a break from the past. And, second, instead of just saying he would announce reforms, he claimed it was necessary to \u201cchange the way we do politics too\u201d. Amen to that, a lot of us might say, but Sunak did not explain what he meant beyond saying that he wanted to do things for the long term. This made it sound as if he is just just trying to adopt Keir Starmer\u2019s argument about the country needing something more than \u201csticking-plaster politics\u201d. (Neither of them are wholly convincing on this, and Sunak\u2019s speech yesterday did seem very motivated by the desire to achieve attractive, short-term headlines. When they start talking about raising the state pension age, increasing tax to fund decent adult social care, updating the link between council tax bands and property prices or abolishing the triple lock, you will know they are serious about making difficult announcements for the long term. But media dynamics would make this very risky, and voters might not be appreciative either.) Sunak said the government was confident that it had the measures in place to meet its climate change targets. It was put to him that the Climate Change Committee does not agree. But Sunak said: The secretary of state on behalf of the government under the current law has an ongoing responsibility to ensure that we do have policies and proposals in place that will allow us to meet all our international and domestic obligations, which we remain committed to. We have absolutely confidence and belief that we will hit them. He also said the government had \u201cconsistently over-delivered in all our previous carbon budget\u201d. He insisted that he was not slowing down efforts to tackle the climate crisis. He said: We\u2019re absolutely not slowing down efforts to combat climate change. I\u2019m very proud of our country\u2019s leadership. We\u2019ve decarbonise faster than any other major economy in the G7 - not a fact you hear reported that often. He challenged his political opponents to defend policies that he said would cost families thousands of pounds. He said: For those who disagree with me \u2013 and there are plenty of people as we can see over the last day or two, lots of people who disagree with me \u2013 the questions for them, they should explain to the country why they think it\u2019s right that ordinary families up and down the country should have to fork out \u00a35,000, \u00a310,000, \u00a315,000 to make the transition earlier than is necessary. This was an answer that confirmed that there was a strong, party political flavour to the speech yesterday (even though Sunak explicitly denied this at the time). Soon after he finished last night CCHQ sent out a briefing to journalists headlined \u201cQuestions to Labour on net zero\u201d. Sunak rejected claims that in his speech he tried to take credit for blocking a series of initiatives that were never government policy anyway. When it was put to him that he was not being honest, and that he was trying to frighten people with plans that did not exist, he replied: I reject that entirely. These are all things that have been raised by very credible people about ways to meet our net zero obligations, alongside the very substantive changes that we have announced when it comes to the transition on electric vehicles and how we heat our homes and whether people should be forced, we believe they should not be, to improve the energy efficiency in their homes. He said the Climate Change Committee has floated some of the measures he mentioned. On a tax on meat, he said: If you look at their report it talks about an accelerated shift away from dairy and meat. It said that diets will need to shift away. It also says we have to implement measures to bring that about. And on compulsory car sharing, he said: What it then says euphemistically is one would need to consider demand-side measures to bring that about, which are otherwise known as compulsion or taxes. He rejected claims that his speech was party political. When it was put to him that his speech was \u201call about politics\u201d, he replied: Now. This is absolutely about doing what I believe to be in the long term interests of the country. Q: Is this the real you, now? Are you going to rip up other government policies, like HS2? Sunak says he wants to \u201cchange the direction of the country\u201d. In his first year he has brought \u201cstability and competence\u201d into government. But now he wants to change the direction of the country. He won\u2019t be deterred from doing what he thinks is right, he says. And that\u2019s it. Sunak is off now. He is doing a visit this morning, where he will be speaking to broadcasters again. Robinson quotes from Sunak\u2019s resignation letter as chancellor, in which he said if something sounded too good to be true, it probably wasn\u2019t true. Weren\u2019t you doing that in the speech yesterday? Sunak does not accept that. He says in his speech he accepted change was needed. He just want a \u201crealistic approach\u201d. Q: Yesterday you said in the speech this was not about politics. But shortly afterwards CCHQ put out questions for Labour. This is all about politics, isn\u2019t it? Sunak does not accept that. He says he did not want to take the easy way out. He says supporters of these measures must explain why they are necessary. Q: You said you wanted to be honest. But you then said you were scrapping things that were not government policy. Where was the plan for a tax on meat? Sunak says the climate change committee talked about the need for an \u201caccelerated shift\u201d away from eating meat. Robinson says that is not a tax on meat. Q: And where was the policy for compulsory car sharing? Sunak says the CCC talked about encouraging this. And it mentioned \u201cdemand side\u201d measures, implying compulsion. Q: And what about the requirement for people to have seven recycling bins. Sunak says there were calls for more recycling, implying the need for seven bins. Q: On boilers, you are saying it will be possible to install a new gas boiler up to 2035. So they could be operating up to 2050. Sunak says a boiler typically lasts 15 years. And 2050 is the deadline for net zero. He says people will have to make changes. He says 2035 is a \u201csensible date\u201d. But he says he has also introduced exemptions for households where installing a heat pump does not make sense. Q: Ford says you have undermined consistency. Sunak says Ford made those comments before he made his speech. Since then, other car manufacturers have been more positive. Q: Manufacturers say they won\u2019t have an incentive to invest. Sunak says he does not accept that, because the targets are in line with most other major countries. Sunak says people who disagree with him must explain why they want families to have to pay an extra \u00a35,000, \u00a310,000 or \u00a315,000. Q: No one is suggesting people will have to spend that money now. Sunak says there were policies in place (on boilers) kicking in in just two years. Q: People will be surprised by you saying you are not slowing down. Alok Sharma is at the UN. He was the Cop26 president, and he says there is consternation at the UN about your speech. You will encourage other countries to slow down. Sunak says, at the G20, he made the biggest ever UK contribution to help the poorest countries to transition. He says the UK target for decarbonisation by 2030 is 68%. He says other countries have lower targets. These are the facts that count. Q: But people are concerned about where were are going. Sunak says these are targets for 2030. Q: The climate change committee monitors if the government can meet its target, and it says the UK does not have the policies in place to meet its targets. He says the secretary of state is legally bound to ensure policies are in place to meet these targets. Q: The CCC says you don\u2019t. Sunak says he is confident in his position. And he says the government has \u201cconsistently overdelivered\u201d in meeting its climate target. The cost of new technology is coming down. And take-up of green technologies is increasing. Nick Robinson is interview Rishi Sunak in No 10, in the Thatcher Room. Robinson starts by recalling Margaret Thatcher going to the UN to warn against climate change. Q: But you have not gone to the UN this year, and you are slowing down measures on climate change? Sunak says he is not slowing down the climate targets. He says you cannot look at the events this summer and not think climate change is real. But, as Thatcher would have said, it is not right to assert a goal without having a clear plan to get there, he says. Last night Kwasi Kwarteng became the latest senior Tory to express concerns about Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech. The former PM, Liz Truss, has strongly supported Sunak\u2019s announcement, but Kwarteng, who was Truss\u2019s chancellor (before he was sacked), told Newsnight that he thought it was sending out the wrong signal to investors. He said: I was concerned about pushing out the date for ICEs phase out, the internal combustion engine. Philip [Dunne, the Conservative chair of the environmental audit committee] mentioned the fact that there has been a huge take up for electric vehicles. Of course there has, the target 2030 has really focused the minds of manufacturers. That is what is accelerating and driving a lot of the transition, a lot of the change. And my worry is that, if you push that out, you are sending the wrong signal. As business secretary, I used to go to places all round the country, particularly in Sunderland in the north-east [where Nissan is based], and there was huge amounts of capital that was being deployed because they felt we had very strong and very ambitious targets and they wanted to get behind that movement. And of course there is some concern in the party that if we relax those targets, we won\u2019t crowd in the investment and it will be to the detriment of jobs and wealth creation. Good morning. Politics is 98% moments of routine predictability (interesting to those of us who care about it, but not so much to others), and then perhaps 2% moments of eye-catching wow. Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech yesterday, in which he aligned himself with the net zero sceptics, abandoned what had been a cross-party consensus, and earned himself rave reviews in the Tory papers, was in the latter category. In his London Playbook briefing Dan Bloom says Sunak wakes up to \u201ca political landscape shifted by his own hand\u201d. But will it still look like that in a week\u2019s time? And, crucially, with the polls, will it shift the dial? Here is our overnight story. Sunak\u2019s move is being seen as an example of wedge politics. But wedge politics is about driving a wedge into the opposition (between what their supporters want, and what their leaders are willing to do). This wedge has hit the Conservative party, too. At 8.10am Sunak is on the Today programme. I will be covering the interview live. If you want to contact me, do try the \u201csend us a message\u201d feature. You\u2019ll see it just below the byline \u2013 on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a laptop or a desktop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos \u2013 no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting, too. I can\u2019t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line; privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate); or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest."

            "content": "The Orkney islands are to test two electric ferries for commuting between its outlying islands as part of efforts to cut carbon emissions from shipping. The battery-powered hydrofoil ferries, whose hulls are raised above the water, are part of a three-year, \u00a315.5m demonstration project funded by the UK government, due to start in March 2024. The smaller of the two ferries will carry up to 12 passengers between Kirkwall, Orkney\u2019s main town, and the islands of Shapinsay, Rousay, Egilsay and Wyre on a year-round daily service. The larger vessel will take up to 50 passengers and light cargo between Kirkwall and the outer islands of Westray, Eday, Sanday and Stronsay in a circuit up to five times a day. It is expected to start service in 2025. Councillors and MSPs in Orkney and Shetland, the archipelago north of Orkney, have been pressing the UK and Scottish governments for help in replacing their ageing and highly polluting inter-island ferries. Unlike the state-owned ferry service CalMac, which serves the Hebrides, their inter-island ferries are council-owned and operated. Scottish ministers have rejected their pleas for support to replace them. James Stockan, Orkney\u2019s council leader, said the islands were already leaders in zero-carbon technologies. Orkney is home to a major marine energy research centre, known as Emec, and has one of the UK\u2019s highest number of electric vehicle chargers in relation to population. \u201cThis work is about looking at how we can, in the future, decarbonise our fleet,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst this is tremendous news, this latest development must not be confused with our drive to secure funding for replacement ferries.\u201d Orkney\u2019s vessels, which are being supplied by Artemis Technologies in Belfast, are part of a package of measures aimed at removing or heavily reducing carbon emissions and pollution from shipping. The industry, which is often excluded from climate warming policies worldwide, has faced increasingly vocal demands to reduce its carbon emissions and to cut air pollutants such as sulphur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The UK government funding package, unveiled on Monday, includes \u00a390m for an ultra-low emission boat to service offshore windfarms, powered by electricity with a methanol range extender, based in Aberdeen. A further \u00a320m will be spent on retrofitting an offshore crew transfer vessel that is already in service with electric propulsion. On the Thames in London, \u00a39.2m has been allocated to help build a 40-metre electrically powered catamaran, and install special chargers, to carry freight down the river. The Department for Transport said the vessel would be expected to carry 54,000 parcels a day between Dartford and Tower Bridge Quay. At Portsmouth international port, a new electrical power system will be installed at three berths to give cruise ships and ferries clean power so they can switch off their marine diesel-powered engines, and also to charge Brittany Ferries\u2019 fleet of hybrid battery and liquid natural gas vessels. Similar schemes are being funded in Falmouth, in Cornwall, and in Aberdeen. The technology is also needed for the UK\u2019s large trawler fleets: many trawlers run their diesel engines permanently while in port."

            "title": "Revealed: top carbon offset projects may not cut planet-heating emissions",
            "date": "2023-09-19T21:17:22Z",
            "content": "The vast majority of the environmental projects most frequently used to offset greenhouse gas emissions appear to have fundamental failings suggesting they cannot be relied upon to cut planet-heating emissions, according to a new analysis. The global, multibillion-dollar voluntary carbon trading industry has been embraced by governments, organisations and corporations including oil and gas companies, airlines, fast-food brands, fashion houses, tech firms, art galleries and universities as a way of claiming to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint. It works by carbon offset credits being tradable \u201callowances\u201d or certificates that allows the purchaser to compensate for 1 ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent in greenhouse gases by investing in environmental projects that claim to reduce carbon emissions. But there is mounting evidence suggesting that many of these offset schemes exaggerate climate benefits and underestimate potential harms. In a new investigation, the Guardian and researchers from Corporate Accountability, a non-profit, transnational corporate watchdog, analysed the top 50 emission offset projects, those that have sold the most carbon credits in the global market. According to our criteria and classification system: A total of 39 of the top 50 emission offset projects, or 78% of them, were categorised as likely junk or worthless due to one or more fundamental failing that undermines its promised emission cuts. Eight others (16%) look problematic, with evidence suggesting they may have at least one fundamental failing and are potentially junk, according to the classification system applied. The efficacy of the remaining three projects (6%) could not be determined definitively as there was insufficient public, independent information to adequately assess the quality of the credits and/or accuracy of their claimed climate benefits. Overall, $1.16bn (\u00a3937m) of carbon credits have been traded so far from the projects classified by the investigation as likely junk or worthless; a further $400m of credits bought and sold were potentially junk. The 50 most popular global projects include forestry schemes, hydroelectric dams, solar and wind farms, waste disposal and greener household appliances schemes across 20 (mostly) developing countries, according to data from AlliedOffsets, the most comprehensive emissions trading database, which tracks projects from inception. They account for almost a third of the entire global voluntary carbon market (VCM), suggesting that junk or overvalued carbon credits that exaggerate emission reduction benefits could be the norm. In our analysis, a project was classified as likely junk if there was compelling evidence, claims or high risk that it cannot guarantee additional, permanent greenhouse gas cuts among other criteria. In some cases, there was evidence suggesting the project could leak greenhouse gas emissions or shift emissions elsewhere. In other cases, the climate benefits appeared to be exaggerated or the project would have happened independently \u2013 with or without the voluntary carbon market. The findings come on the eve of the UN climate ambition summit in New York amid mounting concerns that world leaders will make further climate pledges that rely on what non-industry experts increasingly refer to as flawed market-driven solutions rather than justly and rapidly transitioning off fossil fuels. \u201cThe ramifications of this analysis are huge, as it points to systemic failings of the voluntary market, providing additional evidence that junk carbon credits pervade the market,\u201d said Anuradha Mittal, director of the Oakland Institute thinktank. \u201cWe cannot afford to waste any more time on false solutions. The issues are far-reaching and pervasive, extending well beyond specific verifiers. The VCM is actively exacerbating the climate emergency.\u201d The certifiers/registries with most projects in the top 50 said the VCM was an important tool in fighting the climate crisis and that their methodologies and safeguards were continually improving. Independent experts say that to have any chance of being effective, carbon credits must be tied to new and permanent emissions-reducing activities which lead to additional cuts that would not have happened otherwise \u2013 and should not lead to collateral damage to the environment or communities. Evidence of overestimation on how much carbon pollution a project is really saving, either intentionally or unintentionally, is also key to determining whether a project is able to guarantee promised benefits. Our analysis builds on previous independent investigations and academic research into the efficacy and weaknesses of the VCM in mitigating global heating, as the climate breakdown intensifies. It draws on information from public and private sources including academic studies, civil society research, offset project certifiers/registries, private sector databases and ratings, and media investigations. In addition, we assessed the strength and rigorousness of the available evidence and took this into account for our grading of each project. The Guardian/Corporate Accountability classification system assessed whether each offset project could be counted upon to lead to the promised additional, permanent emission cuts \u2013 or not. Assessing the health, social, economic or other local benefits \u2013 or harms \u2013 were beyond the scope of this investigation and did not influence the classification. Strong evidence of at least one fundamental failing recorded means the promised emission reductions \u2013 which is the presumed primary objective of the VCM and every offsets project \u2013 cannot be guaranteed and was therefore classified as likely junk or worthless. According to our research, more than a third of the top 50 projects had some evidence of three or more fundamental failings. In one case, a giant forest conservation project in Zimbabwe was reported to have had so many exaggerated and inflated claims \u2013 and probably shifted emissions elsewhere \u2013 that it was described as \u201chaving more financial holes than Swiss cheese\u201d. Bloomberg reported rating experts who said the project\u2019s emissions cuts were overestimated by five to 30-fold. In the US, the most problematic project is the world\u2019s largest carbon capture and storage plant in Wyoming, which has benefited from generous taxpayer subsidies, but where the vast majority of the captured CO2 has been released into the atmosphere or sold to other fossil fuel companies to help extract hard-to-reach oil, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It is certified by the American Carbon Registry (ACR), which said that new carbon credits have not been issued for 15 years \u2013 although corporations are still retiring or purchasing old ones to offset emissions. Four carbon markets experts said the findings were based on solid methodology and shine a light on the pitfalls of market-driven climate solutions which can enable polluters to keep polluting instead of transitioning off fossil fuels. \u201cAt the heart of carbon markets is what is seen by many as the flawed notion that avoiding or reducing emissions in one place can make up for ongoing emissions elsewhere. Delaying the transition [away from fossil fuels] by purchasing pollution credits only serves to maintain business as usual and increase the likelihood of climate catastrophe,\u201d said Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (Ciel)\u2019s climate and energy program. Recent investigations have found fundamental failings in forest offset projects but the problems, according to our research, appear to be more widespread in the industry. All 10 hydroelectric dams in the top 50 carbon offsets \u2013 including the Teles Pires dam in the Brazilian Amazon and the Karcham Wangtoo plant in the Himalayas, India, which have both faced opposition from tribal communities \u2013 were classified as likely junk in our analysis as the climate benefits would have happened anyway, regardless of carbon credits. A number of previous studies have shown that although large dams cut national emissions, they do not lead to new or additional reductions needed for effective carbon credits. In some cases large dams have been associated with land disputes, displacement, increased poverty and environmental damage \u2013 including some greenhouse gas emissions emitted from water reservoirs. In another example, a program in western Kenya provides water filters so households no longer need to boil water with firewood for filters. Though the potential health and sanitation benefits are not questioned, from an emissions perspective it was classified as likely junk in our analysis due to what appeared to be inflated baseline figures on how many households used firewood to heat water, and exaggerated claims in part due to evidence of low uptake of the filters. Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, which recently published a study that concluded that Verra\u2019s Redd+ forest schemes \u2013 like other major offset projects \u2013 exaggerate climate benefits, said: \u201cThe overall [new] findings align with the research on carbon credit quality which finds widespread over-crediting across many registries and offset project types including those with the most credits on the market \u2013 avoided deforestation and renewable energy.\u201d In response, Verra said many of the issues highlighted in the report would be addressed in its forthcoming new methodology for generating carbon credits. *** Back in 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that there could be no further expansion of oil, gas and coal production if the world wanted to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown. The world failed to heed the warning, and emission cuts are wildly off track, according to the recent UN global stocktake, the most comprehensive analysis of global climate action produced to date. \u201cThe climate breakdown has begun,\u201d said the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, after the hottest atmosphere and ocean temperatures were recorded this summer. \u201cOur climate is imploding faster than we can cope with extreme weather events hitting every corner of the planet.\u201d Scientists have for decades been warning about the risks, yet instead of phasing out fossil fuels, vast amounts of time and resources have been invested into market-based carbon offset schemes and technologies that trade, cap and capture \u2013 rather than cut \u2013 greenhouse gas emissions. Estimated to be worth about $2bn, the voluntary carbon market (VCM) is vast, fragmented and opaque, involving a complex network of developers, registries, traders, brokers and investors that makes it difficult to track and evaluate the effectiveness \u2013 and potential harms \u2013 linked to offset projects. Despite the complexity, there is a strong public interest in calculating the benefits of offset projects given the deepening climate emergency and lack of meaningful progress in reducing fossil fuel production and global emissions. Researchers from Corporate Accountability created a classification system to analyse the effectiveness of the top 50 offset projects, using raw data from AlliedOffsets. Most of the top 50 were primarily promoted as emission avoidance or reduction projects but also included a handful of carbon removals schemes. Carbon credits for each project were certified and issued by one of seven registries; each project had been verified by a third party. The top 50 included three projects in the US, including a tree-planting project in the Mississippi Delta which a 2020 Bloomberg investigation found took \u201ccredit for trees that were already planted, or would have been planted anyway\u201d, and the oil company project in Wyoming which stores only a fraction of the carbon captured. Both were classified as likely junk due to evidence of multiple fundamental failings. American Carbon Registry (ACR), which certified both projects, rejected the findings and sources relied upon for our analysis. ACR said the tree planting project had enabled hundreds of private landowners to reforest over 130,000 acres of marginal and degraded sites in the Mississippi Delta. Forty-seven of the top 50 projects are in Latin America, Africa and Asia, predominantly in countries that have contributed the least to the climate crisis but are being battered by its effects. Five of the seven located in Brazil were classified by this investigation as fundamentally flawed and likely junk, while another is problematic and potentially junk. In neighbouring Peru, all four forestry projects in our top 50 have evidence of multiple failings making the carbon credits likely worthless, according to our analysis. The nine offset projects in India \u2013 five large hydroelectric dams, two solar plants and two wind farms \u2013 were all classified as likely or potentially junk, in part because none would lead to additional emission reductions. One or more fundamental flaws were found in 96% (22 out of 23) of the forest offset projects which are located in Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, Indonesia, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe among other countries. Fifteen of the 16 renewable energy projects, which include dams, solar and wind, are likely junk \u2013 mostly because the project would have almost certainly happened anyway. While renewable energy is essential for the energy transition, these carbon credit projects do not appear to be leading to the claimed additional climate benefits and should not be used by polluters to offset emissions. \u201cThese findings show that the VCM is flawed and basically a fraud, allowing the west to offset their emissions and continue business as usual at the expense of the global south,\u201d said Souparna Lahiri, the New Delhi-based climate adviser for the Global Forest Coalition. \u201cThe carbon market and the rich west, for the last 25 years has actually done nothing to mitigate the climate crisis, rather, protected their high-emitting industry, production, consumption and lifestyle. It\u2019s a story of continuing and widening inequity and climate injustice,\u201d said Lahiri. Almost two-thirds (32/50) of the most traded projects were certified by the US-based non-profit Verra, which operates the world\u2019s most prominent carbon standard or registry, and included 18 forest offsetting projects known as Redd+ schemes. Twenty-eight of the 32 Verra projects the Guardian/Corporate Accountability analysed were classified as likely junk; the other four were problematic and potentially worthless. Verra has faced mounting criticism for its methodology and lax safeguards including a Guardian investigation that found that its forest carbon offsets are mostly junk and could make global heating worse. Verra disputes the criticism of its forest projects. \u201cThere is compelling evidence proving the effectiveness of Redd+ projects,\u201d said a Verra spokesperson who pointed to recent research papers including a 2022 study of 40 Redd+ projects that found deforestation and degradation declined in the first five years of implementation. Verra did not comment on the specific findings of this investigation, but in a statement said: \u201cVerra\u2019s role is to ensure that projects satisfy its program rules, such that they can be registered and receive issuance of credits. Project proponents are free to hold, sell or retire those credits thereafter at their discretion \u2026 Verra is happy to engage with data, reconsider assumptions and consider future improvements based on sound feedback and expert input.\u201d Our analysis found similar issues with offset projects from other certifiers. From the clean development mechanism (CDM), a UN-led program and first international carbon trading scheme, five of the eight offset projects were classified as likely junk \u2013 including the Teles Pires hydropower dam in Brazil which has reportedly damaged Indigenous and traditional communities, harmed biodiversity and fisheries, and is also probably emitting significant carbon emissions. The CDM was established as part of the Kyoto protocol that allows countries to support emissions-reductions projects in other nations while counting them toward their own international climate commitments, and follows a \u201ccomprehensive set of criteria for selecting its projects\u201d, a UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) spokesperson said. Despite its goals, the CDM has faced numerous criticisms for exaggerated claims, and lack of community safeguards. One study found that most of its certified renewable energy projects did not provide real, measurable and additional emission reductions. The spokesperson added: \u201cThe supervisory body is currently working on the creation of a new mechanism [certifier], striving to make it being highest possible integrity to overcome any weaknesses pointed out in the past.\u201d The UNFCCC did not respond to growing concerns that the sustainable development mechanism (SDM), which is replacing the CDM, has already come under fire by civil society groups across the world for promoting activities that do not lead to emissions reductions and risking harm to local communities and ecosystems, among other things. In another case, two out of four of the projects on the Swiss-based Gold Standard Registry (GSR) \u2013 a water filter program in Kenya, and a cooking stove initiative in Ghana that promises to cut emissions and deforestation \u2013 were also classified as likely junk or worthless from a carbon credits perspective. The additional emission cuts claimed are unlikely due to exaggerated claims and inflated baselines, the analysis found. GSR vehemently rejected the methodology of the research and disputed the basis for its findings, saying the company therefore could not comment on the conclusions about its projects. \u201cWe pay close attention to new academic research and best practices and update our methodologies to ensure they take account of the leading science,\u201d said Jamie Ballantyne from GSR. \u201cDespite this, it is inevitable that mistakes will be made \u2013 which is why we have a market-leading grievance process that allows anyone to submit a grievance against any project. What we can\u2019t do is demand changes to individual projects based upon inconsistent evidence every time any allegation is made.\u201d Mary Grady, executive director of ACR, said: \u201cFindings of an \u2018inflated baseline\u2019, \u2018exaggerated claims\u2019, and \u2018not additional\u2019 should be reconsidered.\u201d She said natural tree regeneration was accounted for and would not skew the baseline or benefit calculations; and that the project proponent was legally required to monitor the projects for at least 40 years. In the past year, amid mounting critical evidence and bad publicity some corporations have said they are looking to create their own emission offset schemes \u2013 which experts warn could be even harder to track. Carbon offsets continue to be promoted as a source of climate financing for the global south, and at the recent Africa Climate Summit, hundreds of millions of dollars were pledged to boost the continent\u2019s carbon credit production. Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, said: \u201cIt is clear that the most important climate mitigation approach is direct emissions reductions. Beyond that, the offset market has not been a reliable way to support climate mitigation.\u201d Corporate Accountability researchers: Rachel Rose Jackson and Adrien Tofighi-Niaki Guardian graphics: Andrew Witherspoon \u2022 This article was amended on 6 October 2023 to clarify the response from Gold Standard Registry (GSR). An earlier version said GSR \u201crejected the findings\u201d of the analysis; Jamie Ballantyne did not accept that concrete findings could be drawn from the methodology, and on that basis declined to comment on the findings about GSR projects."

Ohio abortion rights activists suffer blow in suit over referendum language In this year\u2019s only opportunity for US voters to directly weigh in on the right to abortion, an upcoming ballot referendum in Ohio will include language that describes a fetus as an \u201cunborn child\u201d, in a disappointing loss for abortion rights activists in the state who had sued to stop voters from seeing language they say is misleading. Ohioans are to vote on 7 November on a referendum to enshrine abortion rights into the state\u2019s constitution. The outcome could not only determine the future of Ohio\u2019s six-week abortion ban, which is frozen pending litigation, but also for the midwest. The state has become one of the few in the region to permit abortions since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year. The Ohio referendum\u2019s journey to the ballot box has been a long one. In a special election in August, voters resoundingly rejected a GOP-backed ballot measure that would have required all constitutional amendments to garner 60% of the vote, rather than the simple majority currently required for passage. The measure was loudly denounced as an attempt to stymie the abortion referendum and keep it from passing. Weeks after Republicans lost that election, the Ohio ballot board met to decide what language should show up on voters\u2019 ballots regarding Issue 1, the abortion referendum. What did campaigners want the text to say?

Speaking on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on Tuesday, Olena Zelenska said more than 19,000 Ukrainian children had been transferred by force, or deported to Russia or occupied territories. So far, only 386 had been returned. In Russia, \u201cthey were told that their parents don\u2019t need them, that their country doesn\u2019t need them, that nobody is waiting for them\u201d, Zelenska said. \u201cThe abducted children were told that they are no longer Ukrainian children, that they are Russian children.\u201d Earlier, her husband, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told the UN general assembly that Russia was committing genocide in Ukraine and urged world leaders to attend a peace summit to help stop the invasion and future wars of aggression. What did Joe Biden say during the event? The US president said the UN gathering this week was \u201cdarkened by the shadow of war\u201d, which he described as an \u201cillegal war of conquest without provocation by Russia\u201d against Ukraine. \u201cNo nation wants the war to end more than Ukraine,\u201d he said, reiterating US support for Kyiv and its efforts to bring about \u201ca diplomatic resolution to a just and lasting peace\u201d.

Stat of the day: Rupert Murdoch thought $787.5m Dominion suit would cost Fox $50m, Michael Wolff book says In winter 2022, at a hideaway in St Barts, Rupert Murdoch directed \u201csudden fury\u201d at Donald Trump, who he thought would lose the 2024 Republican presidential primary to Ron DeSantis, but who the media mogul also said was likely to cost him $50m, through a lawsuit regarding Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. The lawsuit was filed by Dominion Voting Systems, over Fox News\u2019s broadcast of Trump\u2019s lies. Settled this April, it cost Murdoch considerably more than he predicted: $787.5m, to be precise. Murdoch\u2019s wildly off miscalculation and his anger at Trump \u2013 in conversation with friends at the idyllic Caribbean getaway \u2013 is described by the journalist Michael Wolff in his new book, which also details how Murdoch often wishes Trump dead.

Climate check: Global heating made Greece and Libya floods more likely, study says Carbon pollution led to heavier rains and stronger floods in Greece and Libya this month but other human factors were responsible for \u201cturning the extreme weather into a humanitarian disaster\u201d, scientists have said. Global heating made the levels of rainfall that devastated the Mediterranean in early September up to 50 times more likely in Libya and up to 10 times more likely in Greece, according to a study from World Weather Attribution that used established methods but had not yet been peer-reviewed. The network of scientists, who were racing to understand extreme weather events as soon as they happen, found people were made more vulnerable to the rain because of factors such as building homes on floodplains, chopping down trees and not maintaining dams. Last Thing: \u2018He swam, hooking my arm with his penis\u2019 \u2013 inside the dolphin sex scandal that outraged a nation When someone mentions the year 1990, you might think of the last days of Margaret Thatcher, The Satanic Verses, poll tax, recession and the IRA. Or, you just might think of a man in the north-east of England getting arrested for masturbating a dolphin. The man in question was the animal rights campaigner Alan Cooper. The whole intriguing story has now been turned into a podcast series. The podcast, Hooked on Freddie, revolves around one particular incident, during which a boatload of people watched Cooper swimming with Freddie in the harbour and reported an incident to the police. Cooper describes the event on his website as such: \u201cFreddie was his usual self, sometimes hooking me with his penis to the leg or arm \u2013 it was all perfectly normal, to me at least.

            "date": "2023-09-24T22:40:34Z",
            "content": "Lego has stopped a project to make bricks from recycled drinks bottles instead of oil-based plastic, saying it would have led to higher carbon emissions over the product\u2019s lifetime. The move, first reported by the Financial Times, followed efforts by the world\u2019s largest toymaker to research more sustainable materials, as part of a wave of companies reassessing their contribution to global emissions as the climate crisis hits. The Danish company makes billions of Lego pieces a year, and in 2021 began researching a potential transition to recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), which needs about 2kg of petroleum to make 1kg of plastic. ABS is used in about 80% of Lego blocks. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to make a bike out of wood rather than steel,\u201d said Tim Brooks, Lego\u2019s head of sustainability, referring to how the non-oil-based material was softer and demanded extra ingredients for durability, as well as greater energy for processing and drying. The \u201clevel of disruption to the manufacturing environment was such that we needed to change everything in our factories\u201d to scale up recycled PET use, he said. \u201cAfter all that, the carbon footprint would have been higher. It was disappointing.\u201d The company said in 2021 it had more than 150 people working on sustainability. But Lego\u2019s chief executive, Niels Christiansen, told the FT the toymaker \u201ctested hundreds and hundreds of materials\u201d but could not find a \u201cmagic material\u201d to solve sustainability issues. Instead, Lego aims to make each part of ABS more sustainable by incorporating more bio-based and recycled material. Christiansen said the group will triple spending on sustainability to 3bn Danish kroner (\u00a3350m) a year by 2025 while promising not to pass on higher costs to consumers. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2023. An earlier version said that Lego would triple spending on sustainability to $3bn (\u00a32.45bn) instead of 3bn Danish kroner (\u00a3350m)."

            "title": "Shell signals retreat from carbon offsetting",
            "date": "2023-09-08T10:12:27Z",
            "content": "Shell has become the latest large company to pull back from carbon offsets amid concerns many have no environmental impact, it has emerged, as the Carbon Trust discontinues its \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d labelling scheme based on offsetting. The FTSE 100 oil company, one of the leading proponents of carbon offsetting, abandoned targets to invest up to $100m (\u00a380m) a year in carbon credit schemes and purchase 120m nature offsets a year by 2030 in June, the oil major has confirmed. This is part of what critics argue is a broader watering down of Shell\u2019s climate ambitions. The decision, first reported in Bloomberg, means Shell joins Gucci, Leon, Nestl\u00e9 and other firms in moving away from offsets amid repeated indications that huge numbers of carbon credits do nothing to mitigate global heating. Earlier this year, the Guardian published an investigation that found that the vast numbers of rainforest carbon offsets were worthless. Shell said it still supported carbon credits and welcomed efforts to improve their quality. The move comes as the Carbon Trust, one of the leading environmental certification schemes, discontinued its \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d labelling scheme based on offsets. A director of the trust acknowledged that consumers may have been inadvertently misled by the label due to poor quality offsets. Despite growing scientific evidence that indicates many offsets have no environmental worth the unregulated voluntary carbon market received strong support at this week\u2019s Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi. The Kenyan president, William Ruto, said African countries got nothing for the carbon sinks that serve the world, unveiling new carbon market regulations in his country before the summit. The US climate envoy, John Kerry, told the conference that Africa and the global south would benefit from a growing carbon market. \u201cThis market has to become a market in the billions in order to work effectively. For that, we need to ensure the environmental integrity of this market. This is critical, not only to protect the climate, but also to create a thriving market because people won\u2019t take the risk either of getting involved in a market that doesn\u2019t have the right standards and guidelines,\u201d he said. The African Carbon Markets Initiative, announced at Cop27 last year, aims to produce 300m carbon credits annually by 2030, unlocking $6bn (\u00a34.75bn) in revenue, and more than a dozen times that by 2050. At the summit in Kenya, Cop28 hosts the United Arab Emirates (UAE) committed to buying $450m (\u00a3360m) of carbon credits from Africa, amid reports the a UAE company is striking deals for large areas of land in anticipation of country to country carbon trading under the Paris agreement. But there is significant concern in Nairobi among environmental campaigners about scaling up carbon markets, and there were protests outside the summit, many raising questions about whether they help local communities or store the carbon they claim. \u201cRather than providing real and public funding into African renewables and adaptation, this week rich countries pledged money to prop up carbon markets that have never worked, neither in Africa nor elsewhere. They are wasting money that should be spent on real solutions,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, the director of the climate thinktank Power Shift Africa. The unregulated voluntary carbon market, which grew to $2bn in 2021 has since slumped to $500m this year, according to Barclays, but forecasts say the market could reach tens of billions of dollars in the years to come to fund climate change mitigation. In an analyst note this week, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley said the market was facing a reckoning over quality concerns but said the situation would improve as schemes to improve carbon credit integrity had an impact. Speaking to the Guardian, the Carbon Trust director, John Newton, said there was growing regulation on corporate climate change claims around the world, which had prompted the organisation to replace its current labels. \u201cConsumers want more clarity, better explanations, clearer claims and more evidence. We have looked at best practice round the world to help our customers to make sure they are ready for future regulations. That\u2019s the driver [behind dropping the carbon neutral labelling],\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of conversations with companies. Generally, companies are quite cautious and nervous about the impacts of [offsets]. But they were certainly bought with good intentions. The people we\u2019re working with definitely didn\u2019t go out there thinking these are controversial. I think there was a lot of confidence in the fact that we\u2019re doing the right thing because they come from credible organisations. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on which offsets are bad and which are good. But obviously, if an offset is found to be not helpful, then yes, I think consumers have been misled. If somebody has an offset that\u2019s not credible, then yes, I recognise that. I can\u2019t speak on behalf of every company but from my experience none of the companies we work with intentionally went and looked for the ones that were risky,\u201d he said. When contacted by the Guardian, a spokesperson for Shell said: \u201cShell\u2019s position on carbon credits, including from nature-based solutions, remains unchanged. Carbon credits remain a valuable and additional decarbonisation lever in our portfolio, including from nature-based solutions. \u201cThe carbon market may not be perfectly functioning everywhere yet, however there are ongoing discussions of how it can be improved which we welcome; that is how markets progress.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 and 12 September 2023 to clarify that Shell itself did not say that abandoning targets to invest up to $100m a year in carbon credit schemes and purchase 120m nature offsets a year by 2030 were part of a programme to water down Shell\u2019s climate ambitions.

            "content": "Germany\u2019s interior minister will face a parliamentary committee on Wednesday to answer questions over her decision to fire the country\u2019s cybersecurity chief over allegations he had ties to Russia. Nancy Faeser will appear before an interior affairs select committee amid accusations the dismissal was unfounded. Arne Sch\u00f6nbohm was sacked as president of the German federal office for information security, the BSI, after allegations arose last October that he had turned a blind eye to a firm with links to Russian security circles. Before he led the BSI, Sch\u00f6nbohm was jointly responsible for founding a lobbying group registered as a voluntary association, the Cyber Security Council Germany. At the time of the sacking, Faeser said Sch\u00f6nbohmhad been barred from his office with immediate effect as \u201cnecessary public trust in the neutrality and impartiality of his leadership as president of the most important German cybersecurity agency has been damaged\u201d. Sch\u00f6nbohm has denied the accusations and has taken legal action against his dismissal in which he is demanding compensation. The allegations emerged after Jan B\u00f6hmermann, a German TV satirist, featured Sch\u00f6nbohm\u2019s links to a Russian company in a previous role. The revelations have raised questions about a leading administrator\u2019s judgment at a time when apprehension is rife over the exposure of Germany\u2019s critical infrastructure to potential outside interference, not least due to the country\u2019s previous dependence on Russia for oil and gas. Faeser has defended her decision. She has the backing of her Social Democrats party, which has accused the opposition Christian Democrats of trying to make political hay before regional elections in the state of Hesse, in which Faeser is standing as the SPD\u2019s lead candidate. Wednesday\u2019s session of the committee will ask Faeser to produce concrete evidence to show why she dismissed Sch\u00f6nbohm. She is also expected to be questioned over allegations that she used the domestic intelligence agency to gather information about the former BSI chief. The CDU has expressed its \u201cconsiderable doubt\u201d that Faeser had reason to sack Sch\u00f6nbohm, referring to \u201ccontradictions by the minister \u2026 in her depiction of the events to date\u201d. Faeser has repeatedly rejected the accusations, referring to \u201csound and fury\u201d created by the opposition because she is the leading candidate in the Hesse election. She has rejected claims that it was B\u00f6hmermann\u2019s TV programme that gave her the impulse to sack Sch\u00f6nbohm. \u201cThe decision was not made hastily but rigorously,\u201d she told the weekly Wochentaz. Faeser is due to answer MPs\u2019 questions in the Bundestag after her committee appearance. Issues around asylum and migration policy are expected to be high on the agenda as well as what is being referred to in political circles as \u201cCausa Sch\u00f6nbohm\u201d."

            "date": "2023-09-05T09:57:21Z",
            "content": "The Electoral Commission has admitted it failed a cybersecurity test in the same year that hackers successfully attacked the organisation. The UK\u2019s elections watchdog said it did not pass a Cyber Essentials test, a voluntary government-backed scheme that assesses an organisation\u2019s readiness against cyber-attacks. The commission said it had failed the test in 2021, when it was breached by an unknown assailant. The organisation revealed last month that it had been a target of a \u201ccomplex cyber-attack\u201d that resulted in hackers accessing reference copies of the electoral registers, equating to the names and addresses of 40 million people. It said the attack started in August 2021 and was not detected until October 2022. The commission said it did not pass the test due to two issues unrelated to the hack: an earlier version of Windows software on some laptops and a dated version of staff mobiles. It said those problems were not linked to the attack, which affected the organisation\u2019s email servers. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are always working to improve our cybersecurity and systems. We draw on the expertise of the National Cyber Security Centre, as many public bodies do, to continue to develop and progress protections against cyber-threats. We regularly seek guidance and feedback on our systems to deal with the continued risk of cyber-threats as they evolve and take different forms. We welcome these learnings and act on them.\u201d The Cyber Essentials website states that the scheme is important because vulnerability to basic attacks marks organisations out as targets for \u201cmore in-depth unwanted attention from cybercriminals and others\u201d. Experts said the admission pointed to lax IT security at the organisation. \u201cFailing such basic measures is not a good look,\u201d said Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University. Steven Murdoch, a professor of security engineering at University College London, said: \u201cFailing to meet fundamental patching requirements is a pretty good indication that there are deeper problems with management of and investment in information security.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-05T16:12:26Z",
            "content": "TikTok has begun shifting European citizens\u2019 user data to a newly operational site in Dublin as it moves to address western politicians\u2019 concerns about Chinese state influence over the company. The video-sharing app also announced that an independent UK-based cybersecurity company will vet any transfer of data outside Europe. The Chinese-owned company said a datacentre in the Irish capital has now begun the migration of European user data, with two other datacentres in Norway and a second centre in Ireland to follow by the end of next year. TikTok expects a full migration of personal data of users from the European Economic Area and UK by the end of 2024 to those datacentres, which will then be the default data location for users within this region. Currently, TikTok stores its global user data in the US, Malaysia and Singapore. NCC group, a UK-based cybersecurity company, will independently audit TikTok\u2019s data controls and protections, monitor data flows, provide verification and report any incidents. Stephen Bailey, global director of privacy at NCC group, said: \u201cWe will be conducting security assessments of the TikTok platform, validating the type of data being transferred or accessed in the European datacentres and we will also be conducting security assessments of the TikTok platform from mobile iOS devices and android to look for security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.\u201d The NCC is able to have discussions with national security or regulators without TikTok being involved. The third-party oversight and new datacentres come after TikTok announced Project Clover in March, a data security programme to protect user information across Europe. The US\u2019s equivalent programme, Project Texas, will store data from American users within their own country on servers run by the tech firm Oracle. The announcement of TikTok storing European user data locally follows global concerns and allegations over TikTok data being accessed or manipulated by the Chinese government, which TikTok denies. Last year, TikTok told its European users that staff in China could access their user data to ensure their experience of the platform is \u201cconsistent, enjoyable and safe\u201d. TikTok has also made changes to its popular app as required by the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act that calls for all large online platforms to share data with authorities. Changes include making it easier for European users to report illegal content, turning off personalised recommendations for videos and the removal of targeted advertising for users aged 3-17. Theo Bertram, TikTok\u2019s vice-president of public policy for Europe, said implementing data sovereignty was a \u201creally significant area of investment in our company\u201d and the platform had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on Project Clover. He added: \u201cWhat we heard from the commission is that they are taking action about a fear of things that can happen instead of things that have happened and it is not enough for us to say: \u2018Trust us are keeping data secure\u2019 \u2013 which is why we have brought in NCC group so there is confidence in what we are saying and it being validated by an independent third party company.\u201d Elaine Fox, the platform\u2019s head of privacy for Europe, said that when Project Clover is fully operational \u201cpersonal data of EEA/UK users will go through additional security gateways before it can be accessed\u201d. She added that TikTok stores its global user data in the US, Malaysia and Singapore with strict reviews on access permissions."

            "date": "2023-09-18T07:51:03Z",
            "content": "Sixty-five Australian government departments and agencies were victims of the cyber-attack on legal firm HWL Ebsworth, the national cybersecurity coordinator has revealed. In a speech on Monday, Air Marshal Darren Goldie also revealed that some people and clients with personal information exposed in the hack have yet to be informed. The Russian-linked ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group hacked the law firm in April. Earlier this month, the group published 1.1TB of the data it claimed to have stolen, later established to be 3.6TB worth of data. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In June, an analysis by Guardian Australia of more than 1,000 contracts with HWL Ebsworth published on AusTender over the past decade suggested that at least 60 departments or government agencies that used the firm\u2019s services could have been caught up in the hack. On Monday, Goldie confirmed 65 agencies had been caught up in the incident. \u201cAs of 18 September 2023, a total of 65 Australian government entities have been impacted, as direct clients of the firm through its legal and consulting services. A large number of private sector clients were also affected,\u201d he said. \u201cI stress that these agencies were clients of HWL Ebsworth and did not suffer a cyber incident themselves.\u201d Goldie said after 16 weeks of support, it was \u201can appropriate juncture\u201d for the Australian government\u2019s formal coordinated response to the incident to end, \u201cwith HWL Ebsworth now able to manage its response without formal assistance from the Australian government\u201d. He said individual agencies would continue to assist affected clients and the investigations under way by the Australian federal police and Victoria police would continue. Goldie said he would now lead a review with HWL Ebsworth and stakeholders from federal, state and territory governments on lessons learned from the incident that would inform the way governments respond to future attacks. Guardian Australia reported in June that the National Disability Insurance Agency was scrambling to determine whether its sensitive client information had been caught up in the hack, given that HWL Ebsworth represented the NDIA in appeals cases. In a speech at a summit hosted by the Australian Financial Review on Monday, Goldie confirmed clients were caught up but revealed he held off informing the public quickly to avoid sparking anxiety in those potentially affected. \u201cWhile there is some benefit in getting that information into the public domain early on, I made the decision to allow HWL Ebsworth to notify individuals through NDIS providers and caregivers first before making the information public,\u201d he said. He also confirmed the Australian federal police and the Department of Home Affairs were victims of the hack, while also being agencies responsible for investigating it. A spokesperson for HWL Ebsworth said the firm was nearing the completion of its review of the information in the hack, and has been attempting to inform those affected as swiftly as possible. \u201cThis has not been a simple or quick task as the data set is large and unstructured and includes a complex mix of different types of documents and information,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe continue to be cognisant, however, that clients and other potentially impacted individuals and parties will be concerned to understand what data of theirs is impacted. We are nearing completion of that process.\u201d Goldie said in total around 2.5m documents were taken, with about 1m posted on the dark web. The firm obtained a non-publication order in the New South Wales supreme court in an attempt to prevent dissemination of the data posted on the dark web. The case against the unidentified hackers is due to return to court in early November. BlackCat was one of the top three ransomware groups targeting Australia, according to a recent study by cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. The group is paid to hack others and has been active since late 2021. Cybersecurity company Sophos said the group has consistently targeted large organisations."

            "date": "2023-09-14T08:57:13Z",
            "content": "Home affairs and cybersecurity minister Clare O\u2019Neil\u2019s chief of staff has taken a job with the cybersecurity contractor and arms manufacturer Thales, the Senate has heard. Experienced Labor adviser Andrew Downes has served as chief of staff in O\u2019Neil\u2019s office since mid-last year, but was reported last week to be leaving for the private sector. The Greens senator David Shoebridge told the Senate on Thursday that Downes had accepted a job with French multinational Thales, an arms manufacturer seeking to expand its cybersecurity operations with its proposed acquisition of Australia\u2019s largest ASX-listed cybersecurity company, Tesserent. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup There are no rules governing the movement of government advisers to private industry, even in related fields, unless they seek to become registered third-party lobbyists or in some areas of defence. Guardian Australia is not suggesting Downes has breached any rule or is not entitled to accept a job with Thales. Shoebridge questioned how someone in a position of such power could move into a related industry with no cooling off period to guard against the use of information gained while in office. Shoebridge made the comments while supporting a motion by David Pocock calling for greater transparency around lobbying and a stronger code of conduct for lobbyists. \u201cThere\u2019s a matter that\u2019s literally unfolding as this debate is unfolding and that\u2019s in the office for the minister of home affairs, where the chief of staff for the minister for home affairs is in the process of moving \u2026 from that powerful position as a senior adviser to taking a government relations job with the international arms manufacturer Thales,\u201d Shoebridge told the Senate. \u201cNo cooling off period, literally walking out of being chief of staff one day, and being straight into being a government relations adviser for a major multinational arms manufacturer the next day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s actually worse than that because Thales is in the process, and going through the foreign investment review board process, of taking over one of Australia\u2019s only soverign cybersecurity firms, Tesserent, and there\u2019s been silence from the Australian government to resist that foreign takeover by Thales.\u201d Thales were approached for a response. A spokesperson for O\u2019Neil said: \u201cAll probity processes have been followed.\u201d The majority of registered lobbyists working for third-party lobbyist firms are known to come from government, a fact borne out by a 2018 Guardian investigation. Third-party lobbyists do face some restrictions on immediately moving directly from government, a measure designed to stop them and their clients from privately benefiting from information obtained while in government. The lobbying code of conduct contains cooling-off periods to prevent such a situation, though they are not enforced and contain no real punishment. But in-house lobbyists who work in government relations teams for companies such as Qantas or BHP, for example, face no such restrictions. They are not required to place themselves on the lobbyist register and are not subject to any rules, including cooling-off periods. Shoebridge said the former government was \u201cwoeful, dreadful\u201d but said the Albanese government had promised to do better. \u201cI say to the Albanese government, you came in with all these promises. You came in with all these statements about transparency, and you said things would be different. Well if that\u2019s true, I\u2019ve got a French arms deal to sell you.\u201d"

            "content": "Americans do not trust the government\u2019s economic news \u2013 or the media\u2019s reporting of it \u2013 according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian that presents the White House with a major hurdle as it pushes Biden\u2019s economic record ahead of next year\u2019s election. The US has roared back from the Covid recession by official measures. But two-thirds of Americans are unhappy about the economy despite consistent reports that inflation is easing and unemployment is close to a 50-year low. And the poll suggests many are unaware of or don\u2019t believe the positive economic news the government has reported. The results illustrate a dramatic political split on economic views \u2013 with Republicans far more pessimistic than Democrats. But unhappiness about the economy is widespread. Two-thirds of respondents (68%) reported it\u2019s difficult to be happy about positive economic news when they feel financially squeezed each month (Republicans: 69%, Democrats: 68%). Two-thirds of Americans (65%) believe that the economy is worse than the media makes it out to be rather than better (35%). In August the unemployment rate was 3.8%, close to a 50-year low. But the poll found that 51% wrongly believe that unemployment is nearing a 50-year high rather than those who believe it\u2019s actually low (49%). The lack of confidence in the economy has many academics and politicians puzzled. Some have blamed the US\u2019s polarized politics and this was illustrated in the poll. But Harris\u2019s data also shows that fears are widespread \u2013 and reinforced by disbelief of or ignorance about official figures and a mistrust of the media\u2019s reporting of them. Some 82% of Republicans and 66% of independents believe the economy is worse than the media\u2019s portrayal. But nearly half of Democrats (49%) also said the media viewed the economy too favorably. Overall, the poll found widespread despondency about the state of the economy. More than half of Americans (53%) believe the economy is getting worse instead of better or staying the same. Republicans and independents are more likely to think it\u2019s getting worse (72% and 58%, respectively, v Democrats: 32%), while more Democrats think it\u2019s getting better (32% v Republicans: 8%, independents: 13%). The results paint a difficult picture for Joe Biden, who is making \u201cBidenomics\u201d \u2013 his economic policy record \u2013 a central plank of his re-election platform. The views of those familiar with Bidenomics showed a perhaps unsurprising party split. Some 60% of Democrats believe his plans are improving the US economy overall compared with 12% of Republicans. There is a widespread belief that Bidenomics is good in theory but isn\u2019t being implemented well \u2013 something both Democrats and Republicans agree with (62% v 58%). Biden supporters have just launched a $13m advertising campaign extolling the president\u2019s economic achievements, which include a landmark $1.2tn infrastructure and climate bill, massive investment in domestic microchips production and green energy solutions. His legislative actions are predicted to create 1.5m jobs per year for the next decade. That message may be hard to sell given the widespread disbelief of and ignorance about the health of the US economy highlighted by the poll. As well as being wrong about the unemployment data, respondents were unaware of, or chose to mischaracterize, other major economic data points. The widest measure of economic growth \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 increased at a 2.1% annualized rate last quarter and has been steadily improving since the Covid downturn. But more respondents (59%) believe that the US economy is shrinking this year than those who believe it is growing (41%). More Republicans (72%) and independents (63%) believe the economy is shrinking than do Democrats. But still, a sizeable 44% of Democrats believe the economy is shrinking. The S&amp;P 500 stock market index is up 16% so far this year. But 59% of respondents wrongly said they believe the S&amp;P is down for the year compared with those who said they believe it is up (41%). The majority of all those asked said the S&amp;P was down whether Republican (66%), independent (60%) or Democrat (52%). US wages are, finally, growing faster than inflation. But 75% of those polled wrongfully believe that wages aren\u2019t keeping up with inflation. That view is held by the majority of Republicans (84%), independents (75%) and Democrats (67%). There was some good news for Biden. The poll found that 75% of respondents support at least one of the four main branches of Bidenomics: improving infrastructure, attracting high-tech electronics manufacturing, building clean energy manufacturing facilities and attracting more high-paying union jobs. Still, 51% of Americans believe that government spending under the current administration is having a negative impact on the US economy (Republicans: 72%, independents: 54%, Democrats: 30%) rather than a positive impact (21%) or no impact (28%). And only just over a third of Democrats (35%) believe it\u2019s having a positive impact (Republicans: 11%, independents: 16%). \u201cAll these perceptual-reality gaps underscore Biden\u2019s difficulty in claiming credit for economic gains. Americans either view the economy through their politics or aren\u2019t feeling it in real life, or both,\u201d said John Gerzema, the CEO of Harris Poll. This survey was conducted online within the US by the Harris Poll from 1 to 3 September among a nationally representative sample of 2,055 US adults, where 1,063 were familiar with Bidenomics."

            "content": "Strolling past the colorfully restored Victorian homes of the Fourth Ward, watching the barman hand-carve blocks of ice for old-fashioneds at the jam-packed bar of the Crunkleton, it\u2019s easy to fall for Charlotte\u2019s ample southern charms. And yet, people are not happy \u2013 at least according to the polls. Consumer sentiment in North Carolina is now lower than it was at the height of the pandemic, according to High Point University\u2019s confidence tracker. \u201cPeople are just not feeling particularly good,\u201d said Martin Kifer, director of the university\u2019s survey research center. North Carolina is not alone. Official figures suggest the US pulled off an astonishing recovery from the Covid pandemic and recession. More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered the world\u2019s largest economy. The unemployment rate rose to 14.7%. But the rebound was just as dramatic. Unemployment has hovered near 50-year lows since January 2022 and is now 3.8%. In North Carolina, it\u2019s just 3.3%. More than 100 people are moving to the city every day. But as an exclusive Guardian/Harris Poll survey found this week, two-thirds (68%) of Americans report it\u2019s difficult to be happy about positive economic news when they feel financially squeezed each month. Across the country, poll after poll shows people are not feeling it. That\u2019s not good news for the Biden administration, particularly in a potential swing state where the perceived success \u2013 or failure \u2013 of \u201cBidenomics\u201d, as Biden has dubbed his economic strategy, will be one of the key issues in next year\u2019s election. The election is still a way out, and Biden has proven pollsters wrong in the past. Nevertheless, the economy \u2013 or voters\u2019 perception of it \u2013 will be a defining issue in one of the most consequential elections in US history. Americans are deeply divided on the economy. The Harris Poll shows over half (53%) of Americans believe the economy is getting worse. Some 72% of Republicans share that view compared with 32% of Democrats. But the unhappiness runs deep on both sides. Only a third of Democrats believe that the economy is getting better. Even when Americans say they are doing OK financially, they believe the economy is in trouble. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual survey of economic wellbeing, 73% of households said that they were \u201cat least doing OK financially\u201d at the end of 2022. In 2019, that figure was 75% of households. But back then, 50% said the national economy was good or excellent. By 2022, that number had fallen to just 18%. Some heavyweight voices share the gloom. Both the former treasury secretary Larry Summers and Bill Dudley, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have speculated that having shot out of the pandemic like a coyote chasing a roadrunner, the US may be in a \u201cWile E Coyote\u201d economy and, like Warner Bros\u2019 cartoon canine, the US economy may be heading off a cliff. \u201cFalling back to earth will not be a pleasant experience,\u201d Dudley has warned. Partisanship explains much of the seeming disconnect between economic data and sentiment. But not all of it. Large forces are reshaping the US economy and may explain the nation\u2019s vertigo. Many low-wage workers have been living with that fear of falling for a long time. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Ieisha Franceis\u2019s wages have shot up from $12.50 to $17 since the Durham, North Carolina, resident made the shift from working in fast food to a job at a senior living facility. Wages are \u2013 finally \u2013 running ahead of inflation overall, but for Franceis, \u201ceverything looks the same. Inflation\u2019s not gone down, it\u2019s just not going up,\u201d she said. \u201cThese days $17 an hour is looking a lot like $12.50,\u201d said the low-wage activist. Franceis used to buy her family\u2019s side dishes \u2013 boxes of macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes \u2013 at Dollar General. The Kraft macaroni and cheese (\u201cthe good stuff\u201d) has gone. \u201cNow they only carry a cheaper brand with the powdered cheese.\u201d At the average grocery store, that Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese is more than $2. \u201cThe Dollar Tree went from everything being $1 to everything being $1.25. Now they even have a $5 section and a $10 section. Huh? This was a dollar store,\u201d she said. \u201cBidenomics\u201d means little to Franceis. \u201cWhat we need is higher wages and more unions,\u201d she said. Even entrepreneurs are finding the new, post-Covid economy taxing. Cocktail queen Tamu Curtis saw her business boom during lockdown. A Los Angeles transplant, she started giving cocktail classes online and saved enough to open her bricks-and-mortar shop. The Cocktailery \u2013 nestled between an Anthropologie and a Warby Parker inside an old streetcar station \u2013 opened in September 2021 when the vaccines started rolling out. \u201cI thought, \u2018OK, everybody is going to run and get the vaccines. We are saved!\u2019 Of course, it didn\u2019t work out that way,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cThat was a plot twist.\u201d Up and running now for over a year, business has been strange. \u201cThis has been the craziest summer. It\u2019s so slow,\u201d she said. Retail sales have collapsed but classes have boomed. \u201cPeople will spend money on experiences. On travel. We spent two years filling our houses with stuff. Maybe we just don\u2019t need that any more.\u201d On top of that, she said, \u201cinflation is killing me.\u201d An order of cocktail bitters that used to cost her $700 shot up to $1,500. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can pass on. I can\u2019t sell a bitter for $42. There\u2019s a max people will pay.\u201d At the same time, rent is high and financing is getting tougher as interest rates rise. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d she said. And more so for a minority, woman-owned business. She hasn\u2019t been able to get a traditional bank loan yet or a line of credit from her bank, Charlotte-based Bank of America. \u201cNow the banks aren\u2019t lending the way they were.\u201d Post-Covid has been an easier ride for other local business people but still, existential questions remain, ones that may point to a wider national malaise. Desmond Wiggan and his partner Aubrey Yeboah launched their business, BatteryXchange, in 2019, just before the pandemic. The company sets up battery-charging stations for mobile devices, and the idea had originally been to target people at conferences or out on the town. \u201cSuddenly there were no people,\u201d said Wiggan. BatteryXchange retooled and now rents its equipment to healthcare providers and others who use the service to help keep their customers online. It worked and business is booming, as is Wiggan\u2019s profile. He has just returned from a business symposium on swanky Martha\u2019s Vineyard. A copy of Propel, a local Black business magazine, sits on his office table. Wiggan\u2019s headshot is above a message from Michelle Obama: \u201cSuccess isn\u2019t about how much money you make, it\u2019s about the difference you make.\u201d But Wiggan has some wider concerns. He spent two years living in China and has seen first-hand that other countries think on a longer timescale. Back in the US, he said, it\u2019s all about the next election cycle. On top of that, another likely hot election issue worries him. \u201cThe age gap of our leaders. They are old. The torch has got to be passed. \u201cThese other countries are starting to sniff us out,\u201d he said. Foreign students were getting their education in the US then going home because they see their country looking to the future, he said. \u201cThey are thinking 2060, not every four, eight years when we go back and forth.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Why people feel so bad about an economy that \u2013 technically \u2013 appears strong is a question that is vexing not just the White House but Nobel economic laureates. Historians will have a better answer. For now, the reasons look manifold. As High Point University\u2019s Kifer points out, \u201cthe perception of the economy is not the economy.\u201d The disconnect between the official figures and how people feel may be temporary. Nor is it unusual for the hangover of a recession to outlast what looks like the beginning of a recovery. High Point\u2019s own consumer confidence index started in 2010, two years after the peak of the 2008/2009 recession. It wasn\u2019t until September 2011 that confidence started rising. The US\u2019s pandemic recession began in February 2020 and ended two months later, making it the shortest recession on record. The body blow it dealt to confidence is, however, proving hard to shift. And things are different this time. For one, there is relatively high inflation \u2013 something never directly experienced by Americans under 40. Slowing increases have done little to calm people\u2019s nerves and most people in North Carolina expect inflation to get worse next year, according to another HPU poll. The mood of economic despondency is fueled by other fires, too, illustrated by life in North Carolina and felt across the country. Politics plays a huge role. The University of Michigan\u2019s national consumer confidence index shows Republican confidence soared under Trump and dropped under Biden while Democrats\u2019 did the opposite. But it\u2019s not the only factor. While people may not have lost their jobs, America\u2019s middle class has lost $2tn in wealth since 2020 thanks to inflation and the fastest increase in interest rates since the 1980s, according to data compiled by economists at the University of California, Berkeley. That fall comes after outsized gains from stimulus cheques, rising house prices and other assets for those who rode out the pandemic with little financial cost. Still, the psychological pain of losing is about twice the pleasure of winning, according to Nobel-winning psychologist and economist Daniel Kahneman. Losses loom larger than gains. Then there are the epochal issues of our day \u2013 ones that will spread far beyond North Carolina and the Biden presidency. North Carolina has been voted the best state for business for two consecutive years and business is still good. But there are signs of a slowdown. According to the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance, the Charlotte area expects businesses to invest $2.3bn in the region this year and create 7,200 jobs. That\u2019s down from $8bn in investment and 20,000 jobs last year. Uncertainty is a large part of that drop, said Danny Chavez, chief business recruitment officer of the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance. Concerns about the direction of interest rates and political change are part of it \u2013 businesses are waiting to see what happens next year, a natural part of the cycle. There is also something more. The number of jobs created per investment is also decreasing as tech takes jobs. Financial services and manufacturing are extremely important to the region. They remain so, said Chavez. \u201cBut in terms of jobs, both those industries are highly vulnerable to automation and AI,\u201d he said. While Charlotte is better positioned than most to ride out that change, Chavez said the region \u2013 and the rest of the US \u2013 is also increasingly competing with global players. India and China are challenging the US\u2019s rank as the world\u2019s largest economy. Biden\u2019s economic plans are playing to the long term and the US has proved resilient to big shocks before. The president also has a track record of beating expectations. If hiring stays steady and inflation keeps receding, maybe Americans will hear the good news soon. That may or may not happen before the 2024 election. But the polls may also reflect a wider anxiety about the existential challenges the US (and other economies) face. Perhaps those challenges explain some of the national mood. It\u2019s hard to measure existential dread. Longer term, neither Bidenomics nor Trumponomics is likely to fix America\u2019s broken healthcare and childcare systems or the climate crisis. Nor do they offer clear solutions to the global trade winds that threaten American exceptionalism or the challenges presented by AI and automation. Little wonder then that so many in the US feel like Wile E Coyote, running off the cliff, treading air, waiting for the fall."

            "date": "2023-09-26T17:31:25Z",
            "content": "The UK economy will shrink this year and in 2024, according to a report by a leading US thinktank that said stubborn inflation and a shortage of workers would damage the prospects for growth more than most analysts expect. The Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) said a drop in GDP this year of 0.3% would be followed by a fall of 0.2% next year while the eurozone and the US were on course for growth this year and next. Ahead of revised forecasts by the International Monetary Fund in a fortnight, which are expected to show the UK expanding this year and staging a modest recovery in 2024, the PIIE president, Adam Posen, said he was gloomy about the UK\u2019s prospects. Posen, who spent three years on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said factors related to the underlying weakness of the UK economy and the fallout from Brexit would leave the UK behind while most other developed economies expanded. He said the UK was also suffering from an unequal recovery that benefited better-off households while the bottom half of the income scale continued to be affected by falling real incomes. Low-income households in the US and the eurozone had, by contrast, fared better in the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Posen said: \u201cThe UK won\u2019t be in recession all of next year, but the recovery will be held back by higher-than-expected inflation and in response, the Bank of England will need to keep interest rates higher for longer.\u201d Cuts to government spending next year will also drag on economic growth as Jeremy Hunt soothes jittery financial markets with austerity measures, including tax increases, he added. The central bank held rates at 5.25% at its meeting last week, and betting on financial markets showed investors expect there will be no change at the next meeting in November. Posen said the next move could be upwards should inflation prove to be more stubborn than the central bank\u2019s forecasts predict, despite a weakening of economic growth. Karen Dynan, a co-author of the report, said high interest rates would limit growth in the US to 1.6% next year. The eurozone is forecast to expand by 1% after growth of 0.6% this year. \u201cWhile inflation appears to be receding in most countries, it remains decidedly above central bank targets,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, most central banks will need to keep their policy rates high over the coming year, with the resulting tight financial conditions holding back demand and slowing economic activity.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-01T17:48:13Z",
            "content": "The US jobs market is holding steady as interest rates sit at a 22-year high, with US employers adding 187,000 jobs in August, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The number of new jobs added in August is the same as the number of new jobs in July, showing that the labor market, down to levels seen before the pandemic, is resilient even with high interest rates. President Biden on Friday afternoon touted August\u2019s jobs figures, as they came in above economists\u2019 expectations, which was pegged closer to 170,000 new jobs. \u201cAs we head into Labor Day, we ought to take a step back and take note of the fact that America\u2019s now in one of the strongest job-creating periods in our history,\u201d Biden said. \u201cSome experts said to get inflation under control, we needed higher unemployment and lower wages, but I\u2019ve never thought that was the problem.\u201d The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the jobs market and other indicators that point to whether the economy is slowing down and inflation is dropping toward their target level. The Fed in July raised interest rates for the 11th time in under two years, bringing rates up to a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, making mortgage rates and other loans more expensive. Even at the beginning of this year, employers were adding as many as 517,000 jobs a month, as seen in February. But over the last few months, the number of new jobs has started to slow. In August, the unemployment rate was 3.8%, the highest it\u2019s been in over a year. The unemployment rate has been holding relatively steady over the last year, reaching a record low of 3.4% in February and then coming down again during the spring and summer. The healthcare, leisure and hospitality and social assistance industries have continued to see job growth in August, while transportation and warehousing lost a good chunk of jobs, largely because of the bankruptcy of the trucking company Yellow. About 30,000 employees from the company were laid off as a result of the company\u2019s closing. Other recent data has pointed to easing in the labor market, including BLS\u2019s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (Jolts), which showed there were 8.8m job openings in July, 338,000 fewer than in June. There were 1.5 job openings for every unemployed worker, according to the survey, the lowest rate since September 2021. Payroll firm ADP also released data that showed the number of jobs added by private employers dropped 30,000 in August, down to 177,000 jobs. Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, an outplacement firm, said in a report that US employers announced 75,151 layoffs in August, the highest level since 2020. Fed officials have emphasized that their goal is to achieve a \u201csoft landing\u201d, to bring inflation \u2013 which reached a peak of 9.1% last summer \u2013 down to 2% without dramatically affecting the jobs market. So far, the drop in inflation, which was 3.3% in July, has not had as severe of an impact on the labor market, as some had feared. But officials say there is still some way to go to bring inflation down to 2%, and the full effects of their rate hikes have yet to be felt. Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said in a closely watched speech on 25 August that the central bank\u2019s fight against inflation would continue, and officials would \u201ckeep at it until the job is done\u201d. \u201cIt is the Fed\u2019s job to bring inflation down to our 2% goal, and we will do so,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe have tightened policy significantly over the past year. Although inflation has moved down from its peak \u2013 a welcomed development \u2013 it remains too high.\u201d Complicating the picture for the Fed is that even as interest rates remain high, consumer spending has remained robust as people keep spending on things like concerts and vacations. The impact that a new, higher level of spending will have on prices remains unclear, especially as other sectors, like the housing market, are seeing contractions because of interest rates. \u201cWe are navigating by the stars under cloudy skies,\u201d Powell said."

            "title": "Strikes aren\u2019t bad for the US economy. They\u2019re the best thing that could happen | Robert Reich",
            "date": "2023-09-19T17:00:30Z",
            "content": "America is in the midst of the biggest surge in labor activity in a quarter-century. The United Auto Workers (UAW), the Writers Guild of America, the actors\u2019 union known as Sag-Aftra, Starbucks workers, Amazon workers, the Teamsters and UPS, flight attendants. The list goes on. More than 4.1m workdays were lost to stoppages last month, according to the labor department. That\u2019s the most since 2000. And this was before the UAW struck the big three. Some worry about the effect of all this labor activism on the US economy, and view organized labor as a \u201cspecial interest\u201d demanding more than it deserves. Rubbish. Labor activism is good for the economy in the long run. And organized labor isn\u2019t a special interest. It\u2019s the leading edge of the American workforce. What accounts for this extraordinary moment of labor activity? Not that workers enjoy striking. Even where unions have funds to help striking workers offset lost wages, they rarely make up even half of what\u2019s forgone. Large corporations whose operations are hobbled by strikes often lay off other workers, as the big three and their suppliers are now threatening to do. The reason workers go on strike is their expectation that the longer-term gains will be worth the sacrifices. Today\u2019s labor market continues to be tight, despite efforts by the Fed to slow the economy and make it harder for workers to get raises. So employers (like UPS) are more inclined to give ground to avoid a prolonged strike. But something far more basic is going on here. As I travel around the country, I hear from average working people an anger and bitterness I haven\u2019t heard for decades. It centers on several things. The first is that wages have barely increased while corporate profits are in the stratosphere. Average weekly non-supervisory wages, a measure of blue-collar earnings, were higher in 1969 (adjusted for inflation) than they are now. The American dream of upward mobility has turned into a nightmare of falling behind. Whereas 90% of American adults born in the early 1940s were earning more than their parents by the time they reached their prime earning years, this has steadily declined. Only half of adults born in the mid-1980s are now earning more than their parents by their prime earning years. Nearly one out of every five American workers is in a part-time job. Two-thirds are living paycheck to paycheck. Meanwhile, executive compensation has gone through the roof. In 1965, CEOs of America\u2019s largest corporations were paid, on average, 20 times the pay of average workers. Today, the ratio is over 398 to 1. Not only has CEO pay exploded. So has the pay of top executives just below them. The share of corporate income devoted to compensating the five highest-paid executives of large corporations ballooned from an average of 5% in 1993 to more than 15% today. Corporate apologists claim CEOs and other top executives are worth these staggering sums because their corporations have performed so well. They compare star CEOs to star baseball players or movie stars. But most CEOs have simply ridden the stock market wave. Even if a company\u2019s CEO had done nothing but play online solitaire, the company\u2019s stock price would have soared. Stock buybacks have also soared \u2013 a huge subsidy to investors that further tips the scales against working people. The richest 1% of Americans owns about half the value of all shares of stock. The richest 10%, over 90%. Why don\u2019t corporations devote more of their income to research and development, or to higher wages and benefits for average workers? In a word, greed. Small wonder that unions are more popular than they\u2019ve been in a generation. A Gallup poll published in August found that 67% of Americans approve of unions, the fifth straight year such support has exceeded the long-term polling average of 62%. Joe Biden has pitched himself as the most pro-union president in recent history. More surprisingly, Republican politicians are trying to curry favor with union workers as well. Both parties know that much of the working class is up for grabs in 2024. American workers still have little to no countervailing power relative to large American corporations. Unionized workers now comprise only 6% of private-sector workforce \u2013 down from over a third in the 1960s. Which is why the activism of the UAW, the Writers Guild, Sag-Aftra, the Teamsters, flight attendants, Amazon warehouse workers and Starbucks workers is so important. In a very real sense, these workers are representing all American workers. If they win, they\u2019ll energize other workers, even those who are not unionized. They\u2019ll mobilize some to form or join unions. They\u2019ll push non-union employers to raise wages and benefits out of a fear of becoming unionized if they don\u2019t. They\u2019ll galvanize other workers to stage wildcat strikes for better pay and working conditions. For far too long, America\u2019s top executives, Wall Street traders and biggest investors have siphoned off almost all the economic gains. This is unsustainable, economically and politically. It\u2019s not economically sustainable because the only way businesses can sell the goods and services American workers produce is if workers have enough money to buy them. If most gains continue to go to the top, the economy will become ever more susceptible to downdrafts and crashes. Today\u2019s mainstream media emphasize the feared negative effects of the current wave of strike on the US economy, forgetting that the wave of strikes in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s helped create the largest middle class the world had ever seen \u2013 the key to America\u2019s postwar prosperity. Stagnant wages and widening inequality are politically unsustainable because they foster anger and bitterness that\u2019s easily channeled by demagogic politicians (re: Donald Trump and his enablers in the Republican party) into bigotry, paranoia, xenophobia and authoritarianism. The current wave of strikes isn\u2019t bad for America. It\u2019s good for America. Labor is not a \u201cspecial interest\u201d. It is, in a real sense, all of us. Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good.

            "date": "2023-09-12T13:24:14Z",
            "content": "President Vladimir Putin has described the recent indictments of Donald Trump as \u201cpolitical persecution\u201d as the Russian leader waded back into a US presidential campaign for the third consecutive election cycle. Putin made the remarks during an economic forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok, where he is also due to hold meetings with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, this week. \u201cEverything happening to Trump is political persecution of a political rival. That\u2019s what it is. And this is happening before the eyes of the United States public and entire world,\u201d Putin said during a question-and-answer session. \u201cAs for the persecution of Trump, I believe that everything happening at the moment is good. Because it demonstrates the rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others about democracy.\u201d Putin\u2019s words align with those of supporters of the former US president, who has been accused of inciting the crowds that rioted at the Capitol in January 2021 after Trump\u2019s defeat to Joe Biden. Trump was indicted last month for inciting public officials to violate their oaths of office and filing false documents as he promoted claims that the election had been stolen through ballot box manipulation. Putin said Trump\u2019s offers to negotiate with Russia over its war in Ukraine had \u201cpleased him\u201d, but said he thought that US policy toward Russia would not change, regardless of whether Trump becomes president in 2024. \u201cEven though they accused him of having a special relationship with Russia, which is complete nonsense, he imposed sanctions on Russia more than anyone else while he was president,\u201d Putin said. \u201cTherefore, it is difficult to say what to expect from the future president, no matter who the president is, but it is unlikely that anything will change radically.\u201d US intelligence officials have accused Putin of personally authorising influence operations against Democratic candidates in support of Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Yevgeny Prigozhin, a former Putin ally who also managed online influence operations, admitted in November that he had interfered in the US elections. \u201cGentlemen, we interfered, we are interfering and we will interfere,\u201d he said in the run-up to the US midterms. Prigozhin was killed last month when his private jet crashed en route from Moscow to St Petersburg. On Tuesday, Putin also accused the British intelligence services of training Ukrainian forces to launch attacks on Russian nuclear infrastructure, citing an unspecified attackinvolving powerlines that could result in an emergency shutdown of a major power plant, he said. \u201cThe saboteurs said during interrogation they had been trained under the supervision of British instructors,\u201d he said, offering no evidence to back up the claim. \u201cDo they realise what they are playing at? Are they provoking us to take some kind of retaliatory action against Ukrainian nuclear power plants?\u201d \u201cI know that my words will make them howl again about threats, nuclear blackmail and so on,\u201d Putin said. \u201cRest assured that what I have just said is the complete, absolute and pure truth. We have the guys in custody and they are testifying. I know about a possible reaction: they will tell you whatever you want at gunpoint. No, that\u2019s not so. The administration of British security services knows that I am telling the truth.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-29T14:48:18Z",
            "content": "Dianne Feinstein, the oldest serving member of the US Senate who blazed a trail for women in American politics, has died. She was 90. Feinstein\u2019s death at home in Washington on Thursday night brought down the curtain on a storied career that included gun control advocacy \u2013 she spearheaded the first federal assault weapons ban \u2013 and documenting the CIA\u2019s torture of foreign terrorism suspects. Joe Biden led tributes, calling Feinstein a \u201cpioneering American\u201d and \u201ctrue trailblazer\u201d. The president said in a statement: \u201cDianne was tough, sharp, always prepared, and never pulled a punch, but she was also a kind and loyal friend, and that\u2019s what Jill and I will miss the most.\u201d For Democrats, news of the death of the first woman to represent California in the US Senate, who was also the longest-serving female senator in US history, has significant political implications. Faced with growing questions about her age and fitness, Feinstein was due to retire at the end of her term. The race to succeed her in a safe Democratic seat has attracted high-profile candidates, Adam Schiff, a former House intelligence chair, squaring off against fellow members of Congress Katie Porter and Barbara Lee. The Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has promised to install a Black woman in any vacant seat. Before entering national politics, Feinstein was the first woman to be mayor of San Francisco. She ran for the position twice before in 1978 the assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk, like Feinstein a member of the board of supervisors, saw her step into the top job. Leaving office in 1988, Feinstein ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1990 before winning her Senate seat in 1992. She did so alongside Barbara Boxer, making California the first state to send two women to the Senate. Feinstein became the first woman to be a California senator because she was sworn in first, to complete an unfinished term. Feinstein was also the first Jewish female senator. Feinstein had compiled a formidable record, notably piloting a federal assault weapons ban in 1994 and, as the first woman to head the influential Senate intelligence committee, investigating CIA torture after 9/11. \u201cThe CIA\u2019s actions are a stain on our values and our history,\u201d Feinstein said, defending the release of a report that revealed CIA use of \u201ccoercive interrogation techniques in some cases amounting to torture\u201d on at least 119 detainees. But she sometimes drew opprobrium from the left. During Republican George W Bush\u2019s presidency she backed the 2002 Iraq war resolution, only to later express regret. Feinstein defended surveillance programmes exposed in 2013 by the National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, a leak she called \u201can act of treason\u201d. In 2020 she attracted considerable criticism for her work leading Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee, particularly in the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, the third conservative forced on to the supreme court by Republicans under Donald Trump. Feinstein was admitted to hospital for shingles earlier this year, returning to the Senate after more than two months\u2019 absence. The senator and her aides resisted calls for her to retire with immediate effect. Feinstein, a six-term senator, left her mark on Washington. In November 2022, she said it was \u201can incredible honor to become the longest-serving woman senator in our nation\u2019s history, and I\u2019m forever grateful to the people of California who sent me here to represent them. \u201cIt has been a great pleasure to watch more and more women walk the halls of the Senate. We went from two women senators when I ran for office in 1992 to 24 today \u2013 and I know that number will keep climbing.\u201d Of changes in women\u2019s roles in US public life, and challenges from the reactionary right, she said: \u201cWe have seen tremendous progress, but we still have work to do. \u201cWhen I came to the Senate, Roe v Wade [the 1973 supreme court ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion] was the law of the land, a fundamental right and a clear signal that women have the right to choose what is best for themselves. The supreme court recently overturned that right. And women continue to struggle to achieve pay equality \u2013 women still only make 84 cents on the dollar compared to men in the same position and often struggle to secure workplace rights.\u201d On Friday there were tributes to Feinstein across the nation. Barack Obama described her as \u201ca trusted partner\u201d in the fight to guarantee affordable healthcare and economic opportunity. \u201cThe best politicians get into public service because they care about this country and the people they represent,\u201d the former president said. \u201cThat was certainly true of Dianne Feinstein, and all of us are better for it.\u201d Feinstein\u2019s loss was felt keenly on Capitol Hill. During a speech on the Senate floor, the Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, came close to tears as he turned to look at his colleague\u2019s empty desk. His voice trembling, Schumer said: \u201cToday, we grieve. We look at that desk and we know what we\u2019ve lost. But we also give thanks. Thanks to someone so rarefied, so brave, so graceful a presence, that someone like that served in this chamber for so many years.\u201d He added: \u201cAs the nation mourns this tremendous loss, we\u2019re comforted in knowing how many mountains Dianne moved, how many lives she impacted, how many glass ceilings she shattered along the way. America is a better place because of Senator Dianne Feinstein.\u201d Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter: \u201cDianne Feinstein was a force to be reckoned with. She was one of the most powerful voices in the Senate, and she blazed a trail for generations of women who followed her into elected office. I was so grateful to have her as my role model, my mentor, and a dear friend.\u201d Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a statement: \u201cFor a long time, between 1994 and the tragedy in Newtown in 2012, Dianne was often a lonely but unwavering voice on the issue of gun violence. The modern anti-gun violence movement \u2013 now more powerful than the gun lobby \u2013 simply would not exist without Dianne\u2019s moral leadership.\u201d Political activists also praised her legacy. Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible, a progressive grassroots movement, said: \u201cDianne Feinstein was an icon of the Senate. In her decades of trailblazing public service, she broke ground and helped solidify what women could do in American politics again and again. \u201cDuring her time as California\u2019s senator, she was a ground-breaking champion for gun safety, and a force accountability and transparency on the CIA\u2019s use of torture, who expected better from our country in its darkest moments.\u201d"

            "title": "Key takeaways from Michael Wolff\u2019s book on Murdoch, Fox and US politics ",
            "date": "2023-09-21T13:38:25Z",
            "content": "Michael Wolff\u2019s new book, The Fall: The End of Fox News and the Murdoch Dynasty, was eagerly awaited even before the Guardian published the first news of its contents on Tuesday \u2013 and before the stunning news on Thursday that Rupert Murdoch will finally step down as chairman of his rightwing media empire. In a feeding frenzy over Wolff\u2019s book, other outlets reported more revelations familiar in tone and sometimes in cast list from the gadfly author\u2019s blockbusting trilogy of Trump tell-alls: Fire and Fury, Siege and Landslide. In response, Fox News pointed to a famous impersonation of Wolff by the comedian Fred Armisen when it said: \u201cThe fact that the last book by this author was spoofed in a Saturday Night Live skit is really all we need to know.\u201d Nonetheless, what have we learned about Rupert Murdoch, Fox and US politics from The Fall so far? Here are some key points: Murdoch did not expect Dominion to prove so costly Dominion Voting Systems sued Fox News for $1.6bn, over the broadcast of Donald Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud in 2020. According to Wolff, in winter 2022, an irate Rupert Murdoch told friends of his then wife, Jerry Hall: \u201cThis lawsuit could cost us fifty million dollars.\u201d When the suit was settled, in April, it cost Fox a whopping $787.5m. Murdoch thought Ron DeSantis would beat Trump Murdoch reportedly predicted the Florida governor would beat Trump for the Republican nomination next year, siphoning off evangelical voters because \u201cit was going to come out about the abortions Trump had paid for\u201d. But it seems Murdoch\u2019s radar was off again: a few months out from the first vote in Iowa, notwithstanding 91 criminal charges, Trump holds gigantic polling leads over DeSantis, whose campaign has long been seen to be flatlining. Murdoch wishes Trump dead \u2026 Murdoch, Wolff says, directs considerable anger Trump\u2019s way, at one point treating friends to \u201ca rat-a-tat-tat of jaw-clenching \u2018fucks\u2019\u201d that showed a \u201crevulsion \u2026 as passionate \u2026 as [that of] any helpless liberal\u201d. More even than that, Wolff reports that Murdoch, 92, has often wished out loud that Trump, 77, was dead. \u201cTrump\u2019s death became a Murdoch theme,\u201d Wolff writes, reporting the mogul saying: \u201c\u2018We would all be better off \u2026?\u2019 \u2018This would all be solved if \u2026\u2019 \u2018How could he still be alive, how could he?\u2019 \u2018Have you seen him? Have you seen what he looks like? What he eats?\u2019\u201d \u2026 but Lachlan just wipes his bottom on him Rupert Murdoch\u2019s son, Lachlan Murdoch, is in pole position to take over the empire. According to Wolff, the younger man is no Trump fan either. As reported by the Daily Beast, Wolff writes: \u201cIn the run-up to the 2016 election, the bathrooms at the Mandeville house featured toilet paper with Trump\u2019s face, reported visitors with relief and satisfaction. [Lachlan] told people that his wife and children cried when Trump was elected.\u201d Rupert has choice words for some Fox News stars The Daily Beast also reported on the older Murdoch\u2019s apparent contempt for some of his stars. Considering how, Wolff says, Sean Hannity pushed for Fox to stay loyal to Trump, the author writes: \u201cWhen Murdoch was brought reports of Hannity\u2019s on- and off-air defence of Fox\u2019s post-election coverage, he perhaps seemed to justify his anchor: \u2018He\u2019s retarded, like most Americans.\u2019\u201d Hannity may have been on thin ice Also reported by the Daily Beast: Wolff says Murdoch considered firing Hannity as a way to mollify Dominion in its defamation suit, with Lachlan Murdoch reportedly suggesting that a romantic relationship Hannity had with another host could be used as precedent, given the downfalls of media personalities including Jeff Zucker of CNN. DeSantis may have kicked Tucker Carlson\u2019s dog According to the Daily Beast, and to a lengthy excerpt published by New York magazine, Wolff writes that in spring of this year, Ron DeSantis and his wife, Casey DeSantis, visited another leading Fox host, Tucker Carlson, and his wife, Susie Carlson, for a lunch designed to introduce Murdoch\u2019s favored Republican to his most powerful primetime star. What Wolff says follows is worth quoting in full: The Carlsons are dog people with four spaniels, the progeny of other spaniels they have had before, who sleep in their bed. DeSantis pushed the dog under the table. Had he kicked the dog? Susie Carlson\u2019s judgment was clear: She did not ever want to be anywhere near anybody like that ever again. Her husband agreed. DeSantis, in Carlson\u2019s view, was a \u2018fascist\u2019. Forget Ron DeSantis. Carlson saw a presidential run as a way to escape Carlson has said he \u201cknows\u201d his removal from Fox after the Dominion settlement was a condition of that deal. Dominion and Fox have said it wasn\u2019t. On Wednesday, New York magazine published Wolff\u2019s reporting that Trump openly considered making Carlson his vice-presidential pick. But Wolff also fleshes out rumours Carlson considered a run for president himself \u2013 reported by the Guardian \u2013 and says the host seriously pondered the move \u201cas a further part of his inevitable martyrdom \u2013 as well as a convenient way to get out of his contract\u201d. This, Wolff says, left Rupert Murdoch \u201cbothered\u201d \u2013 and \u201cpissed at Lachlan for not reining Carlson in\u201d. Wolff is no stranger to gossip \u2026 \u2026 often of a salacious hue. Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chief, features prominently throughout The Fall, a font of off-colour quotes and pungent opinions, including that Trump, whom he helped make president, is a \u201cdumb motherfucker\u201d. Ailes died in disgrace in 2017, after a sexual harassment scandal. According to a New York Times review, Wolff describes the Fox-host-turned-Trump-surrogate Kimberly Guilfoyle \u201csettl[ing] into a private plane on the way to Ailes\u2019s funeral\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat was also clear, if you wanted it to be, was that she was wearing no underwear.\u201d Jerry Hall called Murdoch a homophobe Sticking with the salacious, the Daily Beast noted a focus on \u201cMurdoch\u2019s attitude towards homosexuality\u201d. Hall, the site said, is quoted as responding to a discussion of someone\u2019s sexuality by asking: \u201cRupert, why are you such a homophobe?\u201d Repeating the charge, the former model reportedly told friends: \u201cHe\u2019s such an old man.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-26T14:09:01Z",
            "content": "Suella Braverman has been accused of \u201cdog-whistle\u201d politics by a senior patron of LGBT+ Conservatives before a speech in which she will say that Britain should not grant asylum to people who simply express a fear of discrimination for being gay. Comments the home secretary\u2019s office said she would make were drawing criticism even before her speech to a rightwing US thinktank, and Labour challenged Conservative LGBT+ MPs and others to condemn the remarks. Speaking to the American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC, Braverman will argue that the UN\u2019s 1951 refugee convention must be reformed to tackle a worldwide migration crisis. She will argue that case law arising from the convention has lowered the threshold so that asylum seekers need only prove that they face \u201cdiscrimination\u201d instead of a real risk of torture, death or violence. She will say the change has increased the number of those who may qualify for asylum to \u201cunsustainable\u201d levels, adding: \u201cLet me be clear, there are vast swathes of the world where it is extremely difficult to be gay, or to be a woman.\u201d \u201cWhere individuals are being persecuted, it is right that we offer sanctuary. But we will not be able to sustain an asylum system if, in effect, simply being gay, or a woman, and fearful of discrimination in your country of origin, is sufficient to qualify for protection,\u201d she will say, in pre-briefed comments that have already drawn fire. Andrew Boff, a Conservative London Assembly member and patron of the LGBT+ Conservative group, said Braverman should stop engaging in \u201cdog whistle\u201d politics and focus on the \u201cbasket case\u201d that was her department. \u201cTalking about the victims of persecution as if they are the problem is incredibly unhelpful and really paints us an an uncaring party. I\u2019m deeply unhappy with it.\u201d \u201cWe have a proud record when it comes to gay rights, on things like HIV and equal marriage. I don\u2019t want us to become one of those parties like Fidesz,\u201d he added, referring to Hungary\u2019s ruling party, which has become steadily more socially conservative and authoritarian. The Labour MP, Ben Bradshaw, said on Twitter: \u201cAny LGBT or other Tories prepared to condemn Braverman for this? She doesn\u2019t seem to grasp that simply being gay is enough to result in persecution or death in many countries.\u201d However, Michael Fabricant, a Tory MP and another patron of the Conservative LGBT+ group, said that claiming to be gay \u201cshould not provide the key to entry to our country\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s unwise to make broad generalisations. If someone claims to be gay in order to seek asylum, that should not lift the bar to entry to the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if someone has experienced persecution from the country from which they are escaping, it presents a different and far more persuasive case. Each application should be considered carefully on its merits.\u201d The police minister, Chris Philp, told broadcasters that the UN\u2019s refugee convention needed a rethink because people were using it to claim asylum on the basis of persecution they did not face. He told Times Radio:\u201cWhen I was immigration minister I came across a number of cases when people had claimed to be gay, produced photographs of them and a sort of same-sex partner and it turned out on further investigation it was a sibling, it wasn\u2019t a same-sex partner at all,\u201d he added. Gideon Rabinowitz, director of policy and advocacy at Bond, an umbrella body for UK NGOs, said Braverman was engaging in \u201cdivisive and dangerous\u201d rhetoric after the number of LGBTQ+ refugees and asylum-seekers globally had increased in recent decades."

            "date": "2023-09-21T17:35:16Z",
            "content": "The taxation of property in the eastern German state of Thuringia would normally be a subject of strictly local concern. But last week a vote to cut stamp duty in the regional parliament in Erfurt made national headlines. Ignoring a cross-party taboo on collaborating with the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party, local Christian Democrats and liberals co-opted its support to force the measure through. Loud condemnation duly followed. But with the AfD running second in national polls, there are grounds for fearing that this will not be the last occasion on which the cordon sanitaire surrounding the party is breached. The Thuringia vote is just one sign of changing and volatile times in European politics, as the radical right expands its influence on the mainstream. New PopuList research by 100 political scientists in 31 countries, reported in our new digital Europe edition, finds that almost one-third of Europeans voted for anti-establishment parties in national elections held last year. Half of that number voted for the far right, which is increasing its vote share among these disaffected voters most rapidly. Illiberal, nationalist parties hold power in Italy, Hungary and Poland. They have a share of it in Finland and Sweden and anti-establishment forces have every chance of acquiring it in forthcoming elections in the Netherlands and Slovakia. Austria\u2019s Freedom party, ostracised at the time of its emergence in the 1990s, is well ahead in the polls, with elections due next year. As Europe seeks to meet immense challenges relating to migration, the transition to net zero and growing geopolitical instability, the trend is deeply concerning. A nativist hostility to immigration still drives most radical-right parties. But the researchers found that the climate emergency, the cost of living crisis, various culture wars and post-lockdown conspiracy theories have allowed them to diversify and forge new coalitions of voters. Perhaps most insidiously, the higher profile of the radical right is normalising agendas that until recently would have been seen as beyond the pale. The AfD \u2013 which has embraced climate change denialism in the past \u2013 has successfully weaponised anxieties about net zero measures, orchestrating a backlash which (as in Britain) is seeping into mainstream politics. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, hopes to use next year\u2019s European elections to effect a merger between the centre right and her own radical-right grouping in the European parliament. Should that project succeed, ensuring that EU values and norms are upheld in countries such Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary and a Law and Justice-led Poland will become even harder. Europe\u2019s apparent rightwards drift is not a fait accompli. But there is a risk that, as mainstream parties accommodate more and more of the radical right\u2019s agenda, it becomes one. Years of austerity, followed by the pandemic and the Ukraine-related cost of living crisis, have led to chronic economic insecurity for less well-off Europeans. That has created an opening for ugly political movements and populist leaders to exploit. In Poland, for example, which goes to the polls in a few weeks\u2019 time, the Law and Justice party has ruthlessly demonised minorities and irregular migrants, but also offered generous welfare benefits to struggling families. If progressive forces are to shift the dial in a more inclusive, liberal direction, they will need to restore faith in the capacity of mainstream politics to deliver in anxious economic times. The latest PopuList research underlines the urgency of the task."

Addressing the UN general assembly on Tuesday, the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, echoed Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s warning, citing the crisis in Guatemala after recent \u201cinstitutional ruptures\u201d in the African nations of Burkina Faso, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Sudan. \u201cIn Guatemala, there\u2019s the risk of a coup, which would prevent the winner of democratic elections taking office,\u201d Lula said. Lula\u2019s remarks followed comments on Monday from Francisco Mora, the US\u2019s ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS), about the \u201ctroubling\u201d situation in Guatemala. Mora said Washington was \u201cdeeply concerned about the unprecedented actions of those seeking to undermine democracy in Guatemala by discrediting and obstructing a smooth transition of power\u201d. \u201cSuch anti-democratic behaviour, including ongoing efforts by the public ministry and other corrupt individuals to suspend the president-elect\u2019s political party, all subverts the clear will of the Guatemalan people,\u201d Mora said. \u201cIn a healthy democracy, institutions don\u2019t tamper with ballot boxes after election results have been officially certified by the appropriate authority. Such interference and lawfare \u2026 strikes at the very heart of the democratic process and represents an assault on the rule of law.\u201d Lula\u2019s alert was quickly rejected by Guatemala\u2019s outgoing rightwing president, Alejandro Giammattei, as \u201cunnecessary international interference\u201d. \u201cContrary to the untruths \u2026 we have heard from this podium today, on 14 January I will hand power to [the person] elected by the sovereign majority will of the people of Guatemala,\u201d Giammattei told the general assembly. Political observers had hailed Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s surprise election as a powerful correction to the democratic deterioration in Latin America, where countries such as El Salvador, Nicaragua and Venezuela have taken an alarming authoritarian turn in recent years. Concerns have also been raised over the erosion of democratic institutions in Mexico under its president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and the deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in Peru under Dina Boluarte. Speaking at the UN, Lula hailed his 2022 election victory over Brazil\u2019s far right former president Jair Bolsonaro as a \u201ctriumph of democracy\u201d over \u201chate, misinformation and oppression\u201d. But the Brazilian leftwinger was criticised by some for denouncing the democratic crisis in Guatemala and the US embargo on Cuba but failing to mention the dismantling of democracy in Nicaragua or Venezuela. Pamela Ruiz, a Central America analyst for Crisis Group, said it was hard to predict what the coming weeks had in store for Guatemala. But she believed it was possible members of Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s party \u2013 or even Ar\u00e9valo himself \u2013 could face criminal charges after the official electoral process ended on 31 October. \u201cIf Ar\u00e9valo is not allowed to take office there could be very grave consequences for this country,\u201d Ruiz said, describing a mood of trepidation among ordinary citizens who feared \u201cthe corrupt\u201d elites would \u201cdo whatever it takes to stop him getting in\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a very scary statement,\u201d Ruiz added, \u201cbecause \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 is pretty much implying a coup.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-09-22T15:48:46Z",
            "content": "The historic US autoworkers\u2019 strike escalated on Friday as the United Auto Workers president, Shawn Fain, called on 38 additional plants across 20 states to join the strike. During a live stream update on Friday morning, Fain announced the additional strikes at automaker plants as contract negotiations with the big three automakers remain far apart on economic issues. The strike is the first to hit all three of the US\u2019s largest vehicle manufacturers at the same time and is becoming increasingly political. Fain invited Joe Biden to the picket line on Friday and, according to The Washington Post, Biden will visit the picket lines next Tuesday. \u201cWe invite and encourage everyone who supports our case to join us on the picket line, from our friends and families all the way up to the president of the United States. We invite you to join us in our fight,\u201d said Fain. Fain noted there had been some real progress in negotiations with Ford, including eliminating a lower wage tier, additional job security, conversion for all temporary workers, reinstating cost of living adjustment that was eliminated in 2009, and the right to strike over plant closures. \u201cThe companies know how to make this right,\u201d said Fain during the live stream. \u201cStellantis and GM in particular are going to need some serious pushing.\u201d \u201cThe world is watching, and the people are on our side. We\u2019ve seen poll after poll come out saying the American people support what we are doing,\u201d added Fain. Politicians on both sides have seized on the dispute. Donald Trump will make a speech in Detroit next Wednesday, a day after Biden\u2019s visit, where he will attempt to woo UAW workers. Other Republicans have thrown their support behind the strikers despite the party\u2019s long-term antipathy towards organized labor. Senator Tim Scott, a presidential hopeful, has maintained the traditional party line and said striking workers should be fired. Progressive Democrats have already come out in support of the UAW and on Sunday, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Cori Bush are set to appear in Wentzville, Missouri, at a solidarity rally where General Motors autoworkers have been on strike. The UAW began striking on 15 September through a \u201cstand up\u201d strike strategy with walkouts at targeted plants to keep the automakers guessing. Three plants with about 13,000 workers walked out last Friday, a Stellantis plant in Toledo, Ohio, a Ford plant in Wayne, Michigan, and a General Motors plant in Wentzville, Missouri. The surprise strategy reportedly caused the automakers to prepare for strikes at the wrong plants, causing further disruptions. The automakers have responded to the strikes with temporary layoffs, with Stellantis announcing 300 layoffs at three plants, General Motors announcing 2,000 temporary layoffs in Kansas, and 600 layoffs announced at the Ford plant in Wayne, Michigan. Autoworkers have called for substantial wage increases and the return of benefits conceded during the 2008 economic recession but never reinstated once the automakers returned to profitability. The UAW has criticized the multibillion-dollar profits reported by the big three automakers in the past decade, including exorbitant executive salaries and billions funneled to Wall Street through stock buybacks and dividends. The automakers have characterized the union\u2019s asks as \u201cunsustainable\u201d."

            "date": "2023-09-18T20:07:35Z",
            "content": "Five detained Americans and two of their family members have been allowed to leave Iran and are on their way back to the United States after the Biden administration reached a deal in which Washington freed five jailed Iranians and allowed Tehran to access $6b in oil revenue, but only for humanitarian purposes. The agreement comes as the United Nations general assembly kicks off in New York, but it\u2019s too soon to say if the deal between the two archenemy nations will lead to further negotiations down the road. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi described the release of the Americans as \u201cpurely a humanitarian action\u201d. Joe Biden held what the White House described as \u201can emotional call\u201d with the freed Americans as they traveled back to the United States. Michael McCaul, the Republican leader of the House foreign affairs committee, worried the deal would incentivize \u201cfuture hostage-taking\u201d and \u201cfree up funds for Iran\u2019s malign activities.\u201d Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman, credited \u201call of you who didn\u2019t allow the world to forget me\u201d for his release. Hunter Biden sued the IRS, arguing that the tax authority broke the law by failing to protect his privacy when two agents went public with claims of political meddling in their investigation. You can read our latest full report here: Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour has written about how this deal may signal new direction in western diplomacy: In a statement, Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, welcomed the release of the five Americans from Iranian custody, but criticized the Biden administration for allowing Tehran to access $6b in oil revenue: I am immensely relieved that five Americans held hostage by Iran are finally reunited with their families and on their way home. I wish them peace, strength, and health as they rebuild their lives in freedom. I am very concerned that this $6 billion hostage deal incentivizes future hostage-taking. Even though the Administration claims these funds are limited to humanitarian transactions, we all know that transactions are difficult to monitor and that money is fungible. There is no question this deal will free up funds for Iran\u2019s malign activities. Republicans have generally called for harsh measures against Tehran, and during his presidency, Donald Trump went as far as to authorize a drone strike that killed top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in 2020. Democrats, meanwhile, have tried to find common ground where they can with Iran, such as the 2015 deal Barack Obama reached to curb its nuclear weapons program \u2013 which Trump announced the US would withdraw from in 2018. In domestic political news, NBC News reports that the far-right Republican troublemaker Matt Gaetz is highly likely \u2013 in the estimation of one source, \u201c100% in\u201d \u2013 to run for governor in Florida in 2026. By then, the current hard-right Republican governor, the presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, will either be in the White House or at the end of his two-term time in state office. On Monday, NBC quoted one \u201clongtime Florida Republican lobbyist\u201d as saying that at a reception in Tallahassee on Sunday, \u201cthere was a lot of talk about it \u2026 and Gaetz was telling people to basically expect him to be in\u201d. Another \u201cFlorida Republican operative\u201d was quoted as saying: \u201cHe\u2019s 100% in. I think Gaetz is an instant frontrunner and from what I hear he\u2019s already won the Trump primary\u201d, meaning Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement. Gaetz, 41, told NBC: \u201cMany did encourage me to consider running for governor one day.\u201d He also aimed a dig at DeSantis, saying: \u201cBut we have an outstanding governor who will be in that position through 2026.\u201d Gaetz\u2019s \u201conly political focus right now\u201d, he added \u2013 other than opposing almost everything Kevin McCarthy does as US House speaker, including proposing ways to fund the federal government \u2013 \u201cis Trump 2024\u201d. Some further reading: The Iranian nationals who were released in a prisoner swap with the United States have landed in Tehran, state-run PressTV reports: Reuters reports that the two individuals arriving in Iran after transiting Qatar are Mehrdad Moin-Ansari and Reza Sarhangpour-Kafrani. Another two Iranians released by the United States will stay in the country, while a fifth will go to an undisclosed country to join his family. The White House announced that Joe Biden this morning \u201cheld an emotional call with the families of the seven American citizens who are returning home to the United States from Iran.\u201d \u201cEach family member who joined the call spoke with the president,\u201d it added in a statement, which also confirmed the group had departed Doha, Qatar for the United States. The five Americans released by Iran today in a prisoner swap have departed Doha, Qatar for the United States, Reuters reports, citing a source familiar with the matter. Qatar helped broker the deal between the two archenemy nations, and the group of former detainees along with two American family members that had been prevented from leaving Iran were flown earlier today from Tehran to the Gulf nation. World leaders meeting at the United Nations in New York on Monday warned of the peril the world faces unless it acts with urgency to rescue a set of 2030 development goals to wipe out hunger and extreme poverty and to battle climate change, Reuters reports. The news agency further writes: Their declaration, adopted by consensus at a summit before the annual U.N. General Assembly, embraces a 2015 \u201cto-do\u201d list of 17 Sustainable Development Goals that also include water, energy, reducing inequality and achieving gender equality. \u201cThe achievement of the SDGs is in peril,\u201d the declaration reads. \u201cWe are alarmed that the progress on most of the SDGs is either moving much too slowly or has regressed below the 2015 baseline.\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the summit of leaders that only 15% of the targets are on track and that many are going in reverse. Earlier this month, Guterres called on G20 leaders to ensure a stimulus of at least $500 billion per year towards meeting the goals. He called on countries to act now. The leaders are meeting in the shadow of geopolitical tensions - largely fueled by the war in Ukraine - as Russia and China vie with the United States and Europe to win over developing countries, where achieving the Sustainable Development Goals are key. \u201cInstead of leaving no one behind, we risk leaving the SDGs behind ... the SDGs need a global rescue plan,\u201d Guterres told the summit. The U.N. said this month that there are 745 million more moderately to severely hungry people in the world today than in 2015, and the world is far off track in its efforts to meet the ambitious United Nations goal to end hunger by 2030. The United Nations General Assembly is getting underway in New York with world leaders flying in and the biggest leaders getting ready to deliver their headline speeches tomorrow. Joe Biden has already traveled north and has a couple of Democratic fundraising events this evening in the Big Apple. Tomorrow, the US president will speak at the UN headquarters, following the major opening address by the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. Guterres will be followed by Brazil\u2019s Lula and then Biden. We expect Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who appeared by video link last year but is attending in person this year, to make his speech around noon local time at a crucial time in the counteroffensive against Russia\u2019s invasion 1.5 years ago. The Ukraine war will be the dominant topic, especially in the absence of Russia and China\u2019s leaders. But Reuters adds: With the world on track to break the record for the hottest year in history, world leaders, business leaders, celebrities and activists have converged on midtown Manhattan for Climate Week and the U.N.\u2019s Climate Action Summit, again focusing the world\u2019s attention on the climate crisis. The annual climate gathering coincides with the start of the United Nations General Assembly, bringing heads of state and top government officials together with private-sector leaders to focus on climate change in a year marked by a record number of billion-dollar disasters, including eight severe floods. The main event will take place Wednesday when Guterres will host his own Climate Action Summit, a high-profile event meant to reverse backsliding on Paris climate agreement goals and to encourage governments to adopt serious new actions to combat climate change. \u201cThere is lingering doubt that ... we can meet our climate goals. There is too much backtracking; so we\u2019re really hoping that this summit can be used as a moment to inspire people,\u201d Selwin Hart, special adviser on climate to the secretary-general, said in an interview. The five Americans freed from imprisonment in Iran are now on a flight bound for the US, Reuters reports. Citing an unnamed source, the news agency just reported that an aircraft has departed Doha, the capital of Qatar, where the Americans had been taken as an interim stage, en route for the States. Five detained Americans and two of their family members have been allowed to leave Iran, in a deal with the Biden administration that saw Washington release five jailed Iranians and $6b in oil proceeds, which Tehran can only spend on humanitarian supplies. The agreement comes as the United Nations general assembly kicks off in New York, but it\u2019s too soon to say if the agreement between the two archenemy nations will lead to further negotiations down the road. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi described the release of the Americans as \u201cpurely a humanitarian action\u201d. Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman, credited \u201call of you who didn\u2019t allow the world to forget me\u201d for his release. Hunter Biden sued the IRS, arguing that the tax authority broke the law by failing to protect his privacy when two agents went public with claims of political meddling in their investigation. Businessman Siamak Namazi said in a statement released on his behalf, \u201cI would not be free today, if it wasn\u2019t for all of you who didn\u2019t allow the world to forget me,\u201d the Associated Press reports. Namazi was among the five Americans released by Iran today in exchange for the freeing of five Iranians detained in the United States and access to $6b in money from oil sales Tehran can spend only on humanitarian supplies. Namazi continued: Thank you for being my voice when I could not speak for myself and for making sure I was heard when I mustered the strength to scream from behind the impenetrable walls of Evin Prison.\u201d A dual US-Iranian national, Namazi was detained in 2015 while visiting family in Tehran. Months later, his father, Baquer, was detained when he came to visit him in jail, before being released in 2022. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly in New York, Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi cast Tehran\u2019s release of five Americans as \u201ca humanitarian action\u201d, and hinted that similar deals could be possible, Reuters reports. \u201cThis was purely a humanitarian action \u2026 And it can certainly be a step based upon which in the future other humanitarian actions can be taken,\u201d the Iranian leader, who was elected in 2021, told reporters. In his remarks to reporters, secretary of state Antony Blinken said seven, not five, Americans had been released by Iran. Blinken included in that number two Americans who had been prevented from leaving the country. \u201cJust a few minutes ago, I had the great pleasure of speaking to seven Americans who are now free, free from their imprisonment or detention in Iran, out of Iran, out of prison, and now in Doha enroute back to the United States, to be reunited with their loved ones,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cFive of the seven, of course, had been unjustly detained, imprisoned in Iran, some for years. Two others had been prevented from leaving Iran.\u201d In a briefing to reporters, secretary of state Antony Blinken said the $6bn in money from oil sales released to Iran can only be used to buy humanitarian supplies: The Guardian\u2019s Patrick Wintour reports today\u2019s prisoner swap with Iran may be a prelude to bigger deals between the United States and one of its top global antagonists: Soon after her release, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe remarked that freedom for a former Iranian political prisoner is never complete since those freed always recall those left behind. But when five Americans released from Iranian captivity touch down in Qatar on their way back to their families, the mood will be simple, joyous and emotional. By contrast, the drawn out diplomacy that has led to this moment has been the polar opposite \u2013 complex, fraught and calculating. Iranian-US relations, always one long bargain, are in flux, with currents heading in different directions, some towards confrontation and others towards a de-escalation of tensions. It has been unclear for months whether Joe Biden\u2019s administration favoured one option above the other, or indeed preferred the status quo. But in taking the decision to release $6bn of Iranian oil proceeds frozen in a South Korean bank account by US sanctions the US president prioritised securing the release of the five, some of whom have been in jail for a decade. That is a tribute to the public campaigns calling for their release, but it may also signal a new direction in western diplomacy to Iran. Biden has taken a double risk; he is taking flak from Republicans who argue the deal will encourage further state hostage-taking and who feel emboldened to claim that confrontation with Iran remains the only viable strategy, as it has ever since Donald Trump in 2018 abandoned the nuclear deal signed in 2015 by Barack Obama. He also faces criticism from less partisan sources. The deal, after all, has been struck at a time when the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, is selling Iranian-made drones to Russia to hammer down on Ukrainian cities. Some in the diaspora feel that by acting so soon after the first anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini in a Tehran police cell, the Biden team has shown it puts American self-interest ahead of Iranians\u2019 struggle for human rights. It is at minimum a pragmatic admission that Raisi is politically secure, and the protests are over. Iran\u2019s state-owned PressTV reports the United States has released five jailed Iranians as part of the conditions of today\u2019s prisoner swap: Most of the Iranians were jailed for breaching US sanctions against Tehran, but it\u2019s not clear if all want to return to the country, and as PressTV reports, only two are on their way back to Iran. Here\u2019s video of the moment the plane carrying the five Americans freed from detention in Iran arrived in Doha, Qatar: The freed Americans have disembarked at Doha International Airport in Qatar, where they were met by US and Qatari officials, Reuters reports. Switzerland\u2019s ambassador was aboard the plane they arrived on, a witness said. US officials embraced the now-former detainees at the airport. Joe Biden has confirmed the freeing of \u201cinnocent Americans\u201d from Iran, while announcing new sanctions on a former president and the country\u2019s intelligence agency for wrongfully detaining its citizens: Today, five innocent Americans who were imprisoned in Iran are finally coming home. Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, Emad Sharghi, and two citizens who wish to remain private will soon be reunited with their loved ones\u2014after enduring years of agony, uncertainty, and suffering. I am grateful to our partners at home and abroad for their tireless efforts to help us achieve this outcome, including the Governments of Qatar, Oman, Switzerland, and South Korea. I give special thanks to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad, and to the Sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq, both of whom helped facilitate this agreement over many months of difficult and principled American diplomacy. As we celebrate the return of these Americans, we also remember those who did not return. I call on the Iranian regime to give a full account of what happened to Bob Levinson. The Levinson family deserves answers. Today, we are sanctioning former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence under the Levinson Act for their involvement in wrongful detentions. And, we will continue to impose costs on Iran for their provocative actions in the region. The president also urged Americans to avoid travel to the country, which has repeatedly jailed US citizens: And as we welcome home our fellow citizens, I once more remind all Americans of the serious risks of traveling to Iran. American passport holders should not travel there. The U.S. State Department has a longstanding travel warning that states: \u201cDo not travel to Iran due to the risk of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens.\u201d All Americans should heed those words and have no expectation that their release can be secured if they do not. Iran remains one of the United States\u2019s major antagonists, but Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi is nonetheless expected to arrive in New York today for the United Nations general assembly. The city\u2019s role as host of the global body means leaders from all over the world, even countries on poor terms with the United States, travel there occasionally for the global body\u2019s annual summits. Here are photos of Raisi in Iran, as he boarded his flight to the United States: Five Americans detained in Iran are on their way home after the Biden administration brokered a deal for their release in exchange for unfreezing $6b in oil money. Here\u2019s the latest on the prisoner swap, from the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Wintour: Five US prisoners detained in Iran, some for nearly a decade, have left the country by plane to Qatar, as part of a controversial prisoner swap involving the unfreezing by the Biden administration of $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) of Iranian oil money. Tehran and Washington had agreed to swap five prisoners each, including the conservationist Morad Tahbaz, a British-American citizen. In an elaborate and delicate diplomatic deal, months in the making, the five Americans were taken from hotels in Tehran to a plane bound for Qatar, the first stage in a journey that would take them on flights to Washington. Qatar has been acting as the mediator for the deal, commencing with the electronic transfer of the Iranian cash to bank accounts in Qatar and Switzerland. The prisoners were allowed to board the plane only after the cash transfer was completed. Apart from Tahbaz, the identity of only two other Americans has been made public. Republican senators in the US and some former Iranian political detainees have accused Joe Biden of striking a deal that will only encourage Iran to keep hostage-taking as a central part of its diplomatic arsenal. The US state department says the money that is being released is oil money owed to Iran and frozen by the Trump administration in 2018 when the US left the Iran nuclear deal. Arguing that he\u2019s a \u201cprivate citizen\u201d, Hunter Biden\u2019s defenders have increasingly turned to lawsuits as a tactic against the ongoing onslaught of Republican allegations against him. The suit filed today against the IRS comes after two agents went public with allegations that the investigation into the president\u2019s son\u2019s alleged failure to pay income tax was hamstrung by political considerations. Last week, a FBI agent contradicted the testimony of one of the IRS whistleblowers, the New York Times reported. Earlier last week, Biden\u2019s attorneys sued Garrett Ziegler, a former Donald Trump White House aide, for improperly spreading embarrassing images and emails from the president\u2019s son online. Here\u2019s more on that suit, from Reuters: The lawyers of U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against an aide in the White House of former President Donald Trump over the aide\u2019s alleged role in publication of embarrassing emails and images. The lawsuit accuses Garrett Ziegler, a former aide to Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, of violating California\u2019s computer fraud and data access laws, and demands a jury trial. The 14-page complaint was filed in a California federal court. Ziegler and other unnamed defendants are accused of obtaining \u201ctens of thousands of emails, thousands of photos, and dozens of videos and recordings\u201d belonging to the president\u2019s son and spreading them online. The suit accuses the former Trump aide of \u201caccessing, tampering with, manipulating, altering, copying and damaging computer data that they do not own.\u201d A computer fraud sentence can carry prison time or a fine in California. Data that has been accessed and copied includes Hunter Biden\u2019s credit card details, financial and bank records, and \u201cinformation of the type contained in a file of a consumer reporting agency,\u201d the suit says. At least some of the data \u201coriginally was stored on the plaintiff\u2019s iPhone and backed-up to plaintiff\u2019s iCloud storage,\u201d and accessed by \u201ccircumventing technical or code-based barriers that were specifically designed and intended to prevent such access.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s legal and political problems are connected to his drug use and his quest for business deals in foreign countries. Now they\u2019re at the center of the impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, as well as the federal prosecution of Hunter and his counteroffensive of lawsuits against those involved in helping the GOP make their case. Last week, the Guardian\u2019s Mary Yang put together a recap of the complicated saga, including the IRS whistleblower allegations that are at the center of the lawsuit he filed against the tax agency today: Federal prosecutors indicted Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, over illegally possessing a firearm in Delaware on Thursday. The indictment comes a month after the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed the US attorney David Weiss, a Trump nominee, to oversee the investigation as special counsel. Hunter Biden has been at the center of a years-long investigation into his tax affairs that was set to close with a guilty plea. But that plea deal fell apart at a Delaware courthouse after the Trump-appointed judge said she could not agree to the agreement, which ensured Biden would avoid jail time in a separate case of illegally possessing a gun while using drugs. Amid the controversy, the president has repeatedly said he supports his son and Hunter has been seen regularly at family events. Asked if President Biden would pardon his son in the event of any conviction, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told reporters: \u201cNo.\u201d But the younger Biden has been embroiled in a list of unrelated controversies for years, including his overseas dealings and struggles with addiction, which ex-President Trump and his allies have regularly sought to use as fodder for attacks. Here\u2019s a comprehensive timeline of the moments that have propelled Hunter Biden into the limelight: Good morning, US politics blog readers. Hunter Biden has filed a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service, the Associated Press reports, alleging that the tax authority released his information illegally. The suit targets the actions of two agents who claimed to be whistleblowers and gave interviews to Congress and others about the long-running investigation into his business dealings, alleging those actions violated Biden\u2019s right to privacy. Biden is seeking $1,000 in damages per unauthorized disclosure of his personal information, attorneys fees and the release of all documents related to the case. Last week, Hunter Biden was indicted on gun charges related to lying about his drug use while purchasing a firearm, a development that came about after a plea deal intended to resolve the federal investigation into his conduct collapsed. The same week, Republican speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy announced the chamber would begin an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden over the long-running corruption allegations against Hunter, despite Republicans having neither definitive proof, nor necessarily the votes (yet) to successfully impeach the president. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Biden is heading to New York City for fundraisers ahead of an appearance at the United Nations General Assembly and meetings with foreign leaders on Tuesday and Wednesday. McCarthy and the House Republicans continue to squabble over an agreement to fund the government ahead of an end-of-the-month deadline after which it will shut down. One conservative House Republican does not think impeaching Biden is a good idea."

            "content": "Palestine\u2019s president has drawn angry condemnation from US, German and Israeli officials for comments in which he suggested that Nazi Germany had murdered 6 million Jews during the Holocaust for their \u201csocial role\u201d as money lenders, not because they were Jewish. Mahmoud Abbas, 87, made the remarks at a meeting of the Fatah Revolutionary Council last month, which were later aired on Palestinian television and only translated and made public by the Middle East Media Research Institute. Abbas said: \u201cThey say that Hitler killed the Jews for being Jews and that Europe hated the Jews because they were Jews. \u201cNo. It was clearly explained that they fought them because of their social role and not their religion.\u201d Abbas later clarified that he was referring to \u201cusury, money and so on\u201d. \u201cWe just want to make this point clear \u2013 this was not about Semitism and antisemitism.\u201d Abbas, who has a long history of making antisemitic remarks, also repeated a discredited theory that European or Ashkenazi Jews were the descendants of a nomadic Turkic tribe that converted to Judaism during the medieval period. \u201cWhen we hear them talk about Semitism and antisemitism \u2013 the Ashkenazi Jews, at least, are not Semites,\u201d Abbas added. Abbas\u2019s remarks were almost immediately condemned as \u201cpure antisemitism\u201d by Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, and Joe Biden administration\u2019s ambassador for antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt. \u201cI am appalled by President Abbas\u2019 hateful, antisemitic remarks at a recent Fatah meeting,\u201d said Lipstadt, one of the most prominent researchers into the Holocaust. \u201cThe speech maligned the Jewish people, distorted the Holocaust, and misrepresented the tragic exodus of Jews from Arab countries. I condemn these statements and urge an immediate apology.\u201d In a statement, the EU also described Abbas\u2019s comments as \u201chistorical distortions [that] are inflammatory, deeply offensive, can only serve to exacerbate tensions in the region and serve no-one\u2019s interests\u201d. \u201cThey play into the hands of those who do not want a two-state solution, which President Abbas has repeatedly advocated for,\u201d it added Abbas was also condemned by German diplomats in Israel. \u201cHistory is clear,\u201d Germany\u2019s mission in the West Bank city of Ramallah said. \u201cMillions of lives were erased \u2013 this cannot be relativized.\u201d \u201cWe strive to promote a dignified and accurate memory of the victims.\u201d The German ambassador to Israel, Steffen Seibert, added: \u201cThe Palestinians deserve to hear the historical truth from their leader, not such distortions.\u201d Dani Dayan, the chairman of Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, described Abbas\u2019s comments as \u201cdeeply entrenched \u2026 in antisemitic stereotypes\u201d. \u201cThe PA Chairman\u2019s statement is not only an example of Holocaust denial and distortion, they use deeply entrenched antisemitic stereotypes. These reprehensible remarks must be unequivocally condemned by global leaders. We can\u2019t stay silent. Condemnation also came from J Street, the prominent liberal and pro-peace US Jewish lobby group was also scathing. \u201cIf this report and transcript are accurate, Abbas should be universally condemned and he should make an immediate apology. There is no possible excuse for making antisemitic statements like these and it is by no means Abbas\u2019s first offence.\u201d Abbas drew similar charges after delivering what he described as \u201ca history lesson\u201d to the rarely convened Palestinian National Council in 2018 and in response to his doctoral thesis on nazism and Zionism."

            "date": "2023-09-21T21:50:28Z",
            "content": "Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: Ukrainian cities from east to west were hit overnight in Russia\u2019s largest wave of missile attacks in more than a month, as at least two were killed and dozens wounded on United Nations World Peace Day. The Russian strikes, the biggest since 15 August, came a day after reports of sabotage at a Russian military airfield in Chkalovsk, near Moscow, and in the week Volodymyr Zelenskiy presented a Ukrainian \u201cpeace formula\u201d to the UN general assembly summit in New York. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visited the US Capitol, Pentagon and the White House. Zelenskiy\u2019s visit to Washington was a much tougher one than the hero\u2019s welcome he was given nine months ago, as Republicans proposed a stopgap bill that does not include funding for Ukraine. President Zelenskiy, speaking at the start of talks with Joe Biden, said he looked forward to their discussions with a \u201cspecial emphasis on air defense\u201d. The US president is expected to announce a \u201csignificant\u201d new military aid package worth $325m (\u00a3264m) but it will not include Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). Poland, one of Ukraine\u2019s staunchest allies, has announced an end to its arms transfers to the country, a day after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Warsaw of playing into Russia\u2019s hands by banning Ukrainian grain imports. Poland is one of Kyiv\u2019s main weapons suppliers and has been one of the loudest cheerleaders for the Ukrainian cause since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022, but relations have soured over recent days amid the growing row over grain. The UK\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service authorised charges against five people suspected of spying for Russia. The three men and two women, aged between 29 and 45, are accused of \u201cconspiring to collect information intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy\u201d, the CPS said. A new US military aid package for Ukraine worth $325m will include air defense systems and the second tranche of cluster munitions fired by a 155mm Howitzer cannon, Reuters reported, citing a US official. NBC shared a full list of the capabilities included in the package, ahead of the announcement expected later today. AIM-9M missiles for air defense Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) Avenger air defense systems .50 caliber machine guns to counter Unmanned Aerial Systems 155mm artillery rounds, including DPICM 105mm artillery rounds Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems Over 3m rounds of small arms ammunition 59 light tactical vehicles Demolitions munitions for obstacle clearing Spare parts, maintenance, and other field equipment US president Joe Biden, speaking at the Oval Office at the start of talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the US remains committed to providing support in Kyiv\u2019s efforts to defend itself against Russia\u2019s invasion. Addressing Zelenskiy directly, he said: \u201cYour bravery has inspired the world,\u201d and added that he was \u201cdetermined to show\u201d that \u201cwe stand with you\u201d. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in brief remarks before a White House meeting with Joe Biden, said he looked forward to a discussion \u201cabout everything, with a special emphasis on air defence\u201d. Asked if he was worried that Ukraine is losing Poland as a friend over the grain dispute, Zelenskiy said: I want to thank the Polish people, Polish society for their support. That\u2019s it. US House speaker Kevin McCarthy denied Volodymyr Zelenskiy a joint session of Congress, which would have given him the opportunity to deliver a speech and address everyone, CNN reported, citing a source. McCarthy also avoided being seen with Zelenskiy publicly. He denied official photographers access to the room where House leaders met the Ukrainian president, the source added. But he took photos with Zelenskiy during a closed-door meeting, and a source shared with CNN photos from the room. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is now holding a meeting with Joe Biden, told the US president that he looked forward to their discussions with a \u201cspecial emphasis on air defense\u201d, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Ken Thomas reports. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has shared a video showing his visit to the Pentagon earlier today, where he met with US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, Gen Mark Milley, chair of the US joint chiefs of staff, as well as other officials. The Ukrainian president said he thanked the US for its support during his meeting with Austin, and that the pair discussed US deliveries of artillery systems and long-range capabilities to Ukraine. The US president Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden welcomed their Ukrainian counterparts, Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Olena Zelenska, at the White House in Washington. Asked by a journalist how important his visit was, the Ukrainian leader replied: Very important. The US will provide a new military aid package worth $325m (\u00a3264m), NBC News is reporting, citing two US officials. The package will include more air defence and artillery capabilities to support Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, Pentagon press secretary Pat Ryder said. Ryder, briefing reporters, described the meeting between US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy as \u201cvery warm\u201d and \u201cvery engaging\u201d and that the pair had a \u201cgreat conversation\u201d. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, greeted Ukraine\u2019s president and first lady, Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Olena Zelenska, in the early afternoon at the Pentagon, where the Ukrainian leader also met Army Gen Mark Milley, chair of the US joint chiefs of staff. Joe Biden\u2019s decision not to provide Atacms missiles to Ukraine will disappoint Ukrainian officials, who had been \u201cvery optimistic\u201d that the US president would approve the 300km-range missiles, the Financial Times\u2019 Christopher Miller writes. Ukraine wants Atacms to help its forces strike deep behind Russian lines to disrupt their supplies and demoralise the entrenched enemy troops. In recent days, the Biden administration was reported to be moving towards approval of supplying the missiles. Volodymyr Zelenskiy told CNN on Tuesday that he was sure the negotiations were \u201con the finishing line\u201d. US officials have said in the past that the Pentagon has concerns over the inventory of Atacms for US defence needs and the White House wants to ensure it does not supply weapons that could be used to hit Russian territory, for fear of being seen by Moscow as a direct combatant. The latest package of US military aid package for Ukraine, to be announced by President Joe Biden today, will include \u201csignificant\u201d air defense capabilities to help Ukraine protect its people, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. These capabilities will help Ukraine\u2019s defenses \u201cahead of what is likely to be a tough winter\u201d with renewed Russian attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure in an attempt to \u201cdeprive innocent people of necessities like heat and electricity\u201d, he told reporters. The package the president will announce today will also include weapons and equipment to help Ukraine maintain its momentum in the counter offensive. That includes additional ammunition for US provided HIMARS systems, anti armor capabilities, artillery ammunition and more DPICMS. Here\u2019s more from White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan\u2019s briefing, where he spoke to reporters ahead of a meeting between President Joe Biden and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this afternoon. The US leader will \u201cemphasise the continued need for the American people to step up and support Ukraine as they battle on the frontlines of the free world\u201d, Sullivan said. Thursday\u2019s meeting with be the sixth in person meeting between the US and Ukrainian presidents, and it is Zelenskiy\u2019s third visit to the White House during the Biden administration. Sullivan said the pair have talked \u201cmany times\u201d \u201cby phone and on video\u201d since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, and that Ukrainian and US officials are in \u201cconstant daily communication\u201d. The US will not be providing Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) as part of a new military aid package to Ukraine, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Sullivan, briefing reporters, said President Joe Biden will announce a new package on Thursday that will include air defense systems and other weaponry to help Kyiv ahead of a tough winter. The US leader is \u201cconstantly speaking\u201d to his military and European counterparts, as well as to the Ukrainian themselves, about \u201cwhat is needed on the battlefield at any given phase of the war\u201d, Sullivan said. He has determined that he would not provide ATACMS, but he has also not taken it off the table in the future. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he discussed the battlefield situation and Ukraine\u2019s priority needs, including air defense, during his meeting with US lawmakers in Washington today. Posting to X, formerly known as Twitter, the Ukrainian president said Kyiv is \u201csincerely grateful\u201d for US support and that it \u201ccan clearly see that victory is getting closer\u201d. He wrote: I emphasized that a Ukrainian victory will ensure that neither Russia nor any other dictatorship destabilizes the free world again. To win, we must all stand together and work together. Here\u2019s a roundup of the key developments of the day so far: Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited the US capitol. He met with leaders of the Republican-led House of Representatives and House national security committees, before a private session with the full US Senate. Asked how the meeting went, Zelenskiy told reporters that they had a \u201cgreat dialogue\u201d. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer spoke to reporters after Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with senators and said: \u201cThere was a single sentence that summed it all up, and I\u2019m quoting him verbatim, Mr Zelenskiy said: \u2018If we don\u2019t get the aid we will lose the war.\u2019\u201d The Ukrainian president continued his whirlwind tour of Washington with a visit to the Pentagon. He will shortly be arriving at the White House for a meeting with Joe Biden. Poland said it will no longer arm Ukraine and instead focus on its own defence, as the two allies clashed at a key moment in Kyiv\u2019s fightback against the invasion by Russia. Kyiv said it would hold talks with Warsaw in the coming days over an escalating dispute on Ukrainian grain exports, as the neighbours reiterated their \u201cclose\u201d ties. Former European Council president Donald Tusk accused Poland\u2019s government of \u201cstabbing a political knife in Ukraine\u2019s back\u201d for electoral purposes ahead of Poland\u2019s October poll. At least two people were killed in the biggest Russian strikes on Ukraine since 15 August. The massive Russian attack hit at least six cities across Ukraine and wounded at least 21. The attack, carried out on the International Day of Peace, coincided with the United Nations general assembly summit in New York, where Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had delivered a speech and presented a Ukrainian \u201cpeace formula\u201d. The strikes damaged energy infrastructure in central and western Ukraine, Ukrainian national grid operator Ukrenergo said. It said on the Telegram messaging app that the attacks caused electricity shutdowns in five regions \u2013 Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Rivne, and Kharkiv. Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi said on the Telegram messaging app that the Russian missiles were launched in several waves from 10 Russian warplanes, and that Ukrainian air defences shot down 36 out of 43 missiles launched. A Ukrainian intelligence source has claimed to Reuters that Ukraine\u2019s security service and navy struck the Saky airbase in Russian-occupied Crimea overnight, inflicting \u201cserious damage\u201d. Earlier, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had shot down 19 drones over Crimea and the Black Sea. Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea in 2014. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong now. Joe Biden will announce a new military aid package for Ukraine that will include air defense systems and other weaponry to help Kyiv ahead of a tough winter, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. Sullivan, briefing reporters, said the timing of the package coincided with the White House visit by Ukraine President Volodomyr Zelenskiy. Five Bulgarians living in the UK have been charged by the Crown Prosecution Service, accused of being engaged in a conspiracy to spy for Russia between August 2020 and February this year. The three men and two women, aged between 29 and 45, are, the CPS said, accused of \u201cconspiring to collect information intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy\u201d. Orlin Roussev, 45, from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk; Bizer Dzhambazov, 41, and Katrin Ivanova, 31, both from Harrow, west London, will now appear in Westminster magistrates court on 26 September for an initial hearing. They will be joined by Ivan Stoyanov, 31, from Greenford, west London, and Vanya Gaberova, 29, from Churchway, north-west London. All five have been charged with offences contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. Roussev, Dzhambazov and Ivanova were previously charged with \u201cpossession of false identity documents with improper intention\u201d in February contrary \u2013 news of which emerged in August. Prosecutions for espionage in British courts are very rare, with cases of spying by foreign nationals often dealt with through expulsions. However, relations between the UK and Russia have deteriorated sharply following Moscow\u2019s decision to launch the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February last year. There have been a number of high-profile Russian plots in recent years, including the murder in 2006 of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko and the attempted murder in 2018 of the Russian defector Sergei Skripal. Read the full story here: Volodymyr Zelenskiy is finding his latest visit to Washington a much tougher occasion than the hero\u2019s welcome he was given nine months ago. Zelenskiy was given a standing ovation when he delivered an address to a joint sitting of Congress in December. This time, he addressed the Senate in a closed session, but House Republicans turned down a request to address both chambers again. They are also reported to have turned down an administration briefing on Ukraine. Zelenskiy arrived on Capitol Hill in the midst of a bitter spending battle that could trigger a government shutdown, and he faced difficult conversations when he met congressional leaders behind closed doors. Republicans have proposed a stopgap bill that does not include funding for Ukraine, an omission that the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, called \u201can insult to Ukraine and a gift to Putin\u201d. \u201cI cannot think of a worse welcome for Zelenskiy,\u201d Schumer said. The Republican leadership in the Senate is broadly pro-Ukrainian, but the party is more divided in the House, where the speaker, Kevin McCarthy, faces a restive group on the right hostile to military support for Kyiv. McCarthy made clear to his party that he would approach Biden\u2019s pending request for an additional $24bn in support for Ukraine with considerable scepticism. \u201cIs Zelenskiy elected to Congress? Is he our president? I don\u2019t think I have to commit anything and I think I have questions for him,\u201d McCarthy told ABC News. \u201cWhere\u2019s the accountability on the money we\u2019ve already spent? What is the plan for victory? I think that\u2019s what the American public wants to know,\u201d McCarthy added. Democrats too said they would have questions if the Ukrainian delegation came with requests for drone technology. Party leaders are wary of providing weapon systems that could be used to strike Russian territory, and congressional sources say Zelenskiy will be quizzed on Kyiv\u2019s role in recent strikes on Moscow and other targets deep within Russia. After his visit to the Hill, Zelenskiy was scheduled to cross the Potomac to the Pentagon for a meeting with the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley. Then in mid-afternoon, he is due at the White House to meet Joe Biden. The US president is expected to announce a new $325m military aid package on the occasion of the visit, but the package will reportedly not include the 300km-range Atacms missiles Ukraine has been asking for.

Bulgaria\u2019s National Security Agency accused the three clerics of implementing Moscow\u2019s \u201chybrid strategy to purposefully influence the sociopolitical processes in Bulgaria in favour of Russian geopolitical interests\u201d. The agency, which only identified the men by their initials and nationalities, banned them from entering the country for five years. The Russian embassy in Sofia said in a Facebook post that one of the men was the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church in Sofia, Archimandrite Vassian. The post said: The current Bulgarian leadership has set itself the task of destroying \u2026 the sociopolitical, cultural and humanitarian ties between our states. The Facebook post described the decision as \u201crude [and] flagrant\u201d. A member of the EU and Nato, Bulgaria is a Slavic and Orthodox country with close historical and cultural ties to Russia. Relations, however, have been strained since Russia launched its war against Ukraine, with Sofia expelling 70 Russian diplomatic staff last year. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer spoke to reporters after Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with senators and said: There was a single sentence that summed it all up, and I\u2019m quoting him verbatim, Mr Zelenskiy said: \u2018If we don\u2019t get the aid we will lose the war.\u2019 Joe Biden is due to welcome the Ukrainian president following his visit to the Pentagon. The two leaders are expected to discuss additional US aid and funding that could be given to Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has now arrived at the Pentagon. He was greeted by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin. The Ukrainian president was seen shaking hands following a meeting with senators from both parties. After he emerged from the Old Senate Chamber where the meeting took place, he walked back through the corridor, flanked by Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell. Asked how the meeting went, Zelenskiy told reporters that they had a \u201cgreat dialogue\u201d. Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News reports that the Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, was non-committal about the aid package the government wants to give Ukraine following his meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. One of Ukraine\u2019s staunchest allies has announced an end to its arms transfers to the country, a day after Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Warsaw of playing into Russia\u2019s hands by banning Ukrainian grain imports. Poland is one of Kyiv\u2019s main weapons suppliers and has been one of the loudest cheerleaders for the Ukrainian cause since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022, but relations have soured over recent days amid the growing row over grain. Read more here: House foreign affairs chairman Michael McCaul told reporters Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s message for House lawmakers Thursday was \u201cthat he\u2019s winning\u201d. McCaul stressed: \u201cThe majority of the majority support this,\u201d but said there had to be confidence in a clear strategy for victory for Ukraine. He said: War of attrition is not going to win this. That\u2019s what Putin wants. He wants to break the will of the American people and the Europeans. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will not be speaking in a joint session of Congress like he did in December. Speaker Kevin McCarthy said this morning he turned down a request from Zelenskiy to address a joint session of Congress, NBC reports. McCarthy said that there wasn\u2019t enough time for a joint address given the busy legislative week and said what they are doing for Zelenskiy \u2013 a meeting with members \u2013 is the same as what they did for the prime ministers of the UK and Italy on recent visits. Plus, McCarthy said, Zelenskiy had already addressed Congress. The refusal was first reported by Punchbowl. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is now on Capitol Hill, where he will press lawmakers to approve more aid to help his military fight off the Russian invasion. Here he is arriving at the Capitol, accompanied by Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries: Later on, Punchbowl News saw him with the Senate\u2019s Democratic majority leader Chuck Schumer, and top Republican Mitch McConnell: According to Politico, all senators are invited to hear him talk, while House members will need to be invited by Jeffries or Republican speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has expressed resistance towards Zelenskiy\u2019s demands for more help. The first grain ship to sail from Ukraine since Russia reimposed its Black Sea blockade in July reached Istanbul on Thursday, marine traffic monitors said. Ukrainian officials said the Palau-flagged Resilient Africa vessel was carrying 3,000 tonnes of wheat when it left Ukraine\u2019s Chornomorsk port on Tuesday, AFP reports. It was destined for Israel, according to marine traffic websites, representing the first successful Black Sea voyage since Russia pulled out of a UN-backed deal to export Ukrainian grain. Ukraine is testing a new sea route that avoids international waters and follows those controlled by Nato members Bulgaria and Romania. It had earlier successfully sent several cargo ships along that route that were not carrying Ukrainian grain. These voyages became safer after Russia was forced to pull back its warships following a series of successful Ukrainian missile strikes on the Kremlin-controlled peninsula of Crimea, where Moscow\u2019s Black Sea fleet is based. Russia also stepped up attacks on Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea port infrastructure after abandoning the grain deal. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, has spoken to the media after Ukraine\u2019s president met with congressional leaders in the US Capitol. He said that he had asked Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cwhat do you need?\u201d, and that Ukraine\u2019s president said they needed air cover, and the kind of long-range artillery that could hit the Russians occupying Crimea. McCarthy said, from the descriptions that Zelenskiy had given him of battle conditions, that \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t send our [US] troops in under those conditions\u201d without the provision of greater air cover. He said that the US and Ukraine could not afford the situation to become a war of attrition, saying Putin wanted to break the will of the Amercian people and the Europeans, and they could not let that happen. He expressed some frustration with the Biden administration, saying they needed to see a plan for victory, accountability, but told reporters he believed he could get Republicans sceptical about more aid and supplies for Ukraine on side. Shaun Walker in Warsaw offers this analysis for the Guardian on that deterioration in the relationship between Poland and Ukraine: To hear the Polish president compare Ukraine to a drowning person and the Ukrainian president describe Poland as acting in Moscow\u2019s interests will come as a shock to many. Poland was one of the few western countries that had an ambassador who stayed in Kyiv through the first days of the Russian invasion, and its president, Andrzej Duda, has been a frequent visitor to the Ukrainian capital. Poland welcomed more than 2 million refugees in the first weeks of the war and millions of Polish people helped out with housing and other volunteer support for displaced Ukrainians. This all makes the intensity of the rhetoric in the rift over grain imports harder to understand, but it may have more to do with internal politics in Poland than with real issues between the two capitals. Polls suggest parliamentary elections on 15 October will be an extremely close-run race, and the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is looking for boosts to its support wherever possible. \u201cThis is primarily about the election and the motives are quite clear,\u201d said Wojciech Przybylski, the editor-in-chief of the journal Visegrad Insight. PiS is hoping to \u201cflex a muscle with their key electoral groups\u201d, he added, including those involved in agriculture in the east of Poland, who have been most affected by the influx of Ukrainian grain. The nationalist PiS party is also facing a challenge from the far-right Konfederecja party, which advocates for less help to Ukraine and focusing on Poland\u2019s internal issues. \u201cThere has been a persistent motif in government communications since May, with PiS seeking support among nationalist and anti-Ukrainian voters,\u201d said Przybylski. Read more of Shaun Walker\u2019s analysis here: Poland\u2019s ruling party pivots away from Ukraine in attempt to shore up votes Some very strong words from former European Council president Donald Tusk. He has accused Poland\u2019s government of \u201cstabbing a political knife in Ukraine\u2019s back\u201d for electoral purposes ahead of Poland\u2019s October poll. Sky News quotes him saying at a news conference in Kalisz that the Polish government \u201chave jeopardised our interests, gave away almost all weapons that could be useful on the front and in the end they are ruining this investment in relations. This is completely unacceptable. \u201cThe worst thing is that today this escalation, if it continues, both sides \u2013 Kyiv and Warsaw \u2013 are close to wasting what was a great opportunity for the entire region, for Poland and Ukraine \u2013 Polish-Ukrainian solidarity against Russian aggression, help for Ukraine to win the war with Russia, Polish-Ukrainian friendship and a rational, assertive policy when it comes to the burdens we bear.\u201d Here are some more images that have been released of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, at the US Capitol in Washington. Suspilne reports, citing local authorities, that one person has been killed and two injured in Bilozerka in Kherson region. It reports that, according to the regional military administration, \u201csince the beginning of the day, five people have been killed and ten more injured due to Russian attacks.\u201d Here is another image from Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s visit to the US Capitol today. A framed flag signed by frontline Ukrainian fighters in Bakhmut and presented to the US Congress in 2022 is sitting at one end of the table where private meetings between Zelenskiy and congressional leaders will take place. The UK\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service has authorised charges against five people suspected of spying for Russia. The three men and two women, aged between 29 and 45, are accused of \u201cconspiring to collect information intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy\u201d, the CPS said. Nick Price, the head of the CPS\u2019s special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: \u201cThe CPS has authorised a charge of conspiracy to conduct espionage against three men and two women suspected of spying for Russia. They are all due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 26 September. Read more here: UK prosecutors authorise charges against five people suspected of spying for Russia Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived at the US capitol. Zelenskiy will meet with leaders of the Republican-led House of Representatives and House national security committees, before a private session with the full US Senate. He is also scheduled to give an address in the evening at the National Archives museum. Russia\u2019s government has announced it was temporarily limiting exports of petrol and diesel fuel to avoid shortages on the domestic market, AFP reports. The exchange price of domestic petrol soared to a record high this week, in part due to a weaker ruble, rising global oil prices and repair work at refineries curbing supplies. The announcement comes weeks after Moscow decided to extend a voluntary cut of oil exports until the end of the year in a coordinated move with Saudi Arabia aimed at propping up global crude prices. The government said: The government introduced a temporary restriction on exports of motor gasoline and diesel fuel to stabilise the domestic market. The decision was made to stabilise fuel prices on the domestic market,\u201d it said, without specifying what kind of measures would be introduced. It said the restrictions would help \u201csaturate the fuel market\u201d and lower prices at the pump. Farmers in some regions have been unable to harvest grain due to a shortage of fuel needed for agricultural machinery, local media outlets have reported. The rising fuel prices come as Russia\u2019s central bank warns economic growth is set to slow down in the second half of 2023, with inflation above the bank\u2019s target of 4%. Russian officials have largely shrugged off the economic effects of Moscow\u2019s dragging offensive in Ukraine, despite persistently high inflation and a weaker ruble. The Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has pitched himself as a potential peacebroker between Moscow and Kyiv, has sat down with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for their first face-to-face meeting. Lula\u2019s refusal to take sides in the war has irked some western governments and meant his relationship with Zelenskiy has been an uneasy one. But on Wednesday, Ukrainian and Brazilian diplomats described the meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York as relaxed and productive. A portrait of the two leaders suggested a distinctly stiff atmosphere. But Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, insisted the \u201cice-breaking\u201d encounter had been \u201cvery warm and honest\u201d. In a slip of the tongue, Kuleba called Lula \u201cPresident Putin\u201d. Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, Mauro Vieria, said the pair had enjoyed a long and friendly discussion. Lula told reporters he had urged Ukraine\u2019s president to seek a negotiated peace, \u201cso that never again was there a territorial occupation such as the one Russia has done\u201d. With peace talks, \u201cthere are no victims, there are no deaths, there is no gunfire,\u201d Lula added, urging both sides to make concessions. Lula said: I know it\u2019s difficult, both for him [Zelenskiy] and Putin ... but I think this is the only path towards finding a solution. The path of dialogue, of peace, of conversation. Nobody is going to get 100% in a war. Noone can win everything. Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be seeking fresh aid to fight Russian invaders despite signs of war fatigue among US lawmakers during his visit in Washington. After another overnight wave of deadly missile attacks on his country, Zelenskiy said on social media early Thursday that he and his wife had \u201carrived in Washington, DC\u201d and that air defenses were among his top priorities in the US capital. His most crucial meeting is likely to be with leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties at the US Congress, where a new multibillion-dollar aid package for Kyiv is at risk of being blocked. He is due to visit Congress at 9am local time (2pm BST) He is also set to meet at the White House for talks with Joe Biden and will later visit the Pentagon. The White House said the Ukrainian leader\u2019s visit came at a \u201creally critical time\u201d as Ukraine\u2019s slow-moving counteroffensive against Russian forces grinds forward into fall. Biden is \u201clooking forward to getting a battlefield perspective directly from Ukraine\u2019s commander in chief,\u201d National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. Ukraine said it had struck a military airfield on the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula, the latest claimed attack on the Black Sea territory Kyiv has vowed to recapture, AFP reports. The army\u2019s communication department said in a statement on social media: On the night of September 21, the Defense Forces of Ukraine launched a combined attack on a military airfield of the occupiers near the city of Saky in the temporarily occupied Crimea. A source in Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service whose forces were involved in the attack said that there were at least a dozen warplanes and Pantsir missile defence system at the airfield at the time of the attack. A source in Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service whose forces were involved in the attack said that there were at least a dozen warplanes and Pantsir missile defence systems at the airfield at the time of the attack. The airfield also housed a training centre for operators of drones that Russia uses to target Ukraine, the source said, adding that the strikes had \u201cinflicted serious damage to the equipment of the occupiers\u201d. The SBU source said Ukraine had used drones that had \u201coverwhelmed Russian air defenses\u201d and then launched Neptune cruise missiles. The source added: The occupiers cannot feel safe in the occupied peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv has vowed to take back the peninsula. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has arrived in Washington to hold talks on securing more US weapons, saying \u201cair defence\u201d is Kyiv\u2019s priority, as Moscow hit Ukraine with another barrage of missiles. The Ukrainian president is set to hold talks with Joe Biden on his second visit to the US during the Russian invasion. Russia hit cities across Ukraine with a barrage of missiles ahead of the talks. He said on Telegram as he arrived from New York: Today there are important negotiations in Washington. Air defence for Ukraine is among the top issues. More air defence, more support for Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines. Zelenskiy slammed Moscow\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d overnight attack which killed several people in the southern city of Kherson and wounded many in various regions. He thanked those countries that had \u201cprovided Ukraine with anti-missile systems\u201d. He said: Most of the missiles were shot down. But only the majority. Not all. We are working to completely rid Russia of its terrorist potential,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have to come to this result. His visit to Washington is set to involve some difficult conversations: Ukrainian cities from east to west were hit overnight in Russia\u2019s largest wave of missile attacks in more than a month, as at least two were killed and dozens wounded on United Nations World Peace Day. The strikes, the biggest since 15 August, came a day after reports of sabotage at a Russian military airfield in Chkalovsk, near Moscow, and in the week the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, presented a Ukrainian \u201cpeace formula\u201d to the UN general assembly summit in New York. The Ukrainian army chief, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said Ukraine\u2019s air defence successfully shot down 36 out of 43 Russian cruise missiles launched from 10 warplanes in multiple waves. Twenty of those were shot down over Kyiv, according to Sergiy Popko, the head of the city\u2019s military administration, who said they were of the X-101/555/55 type launched from Tu-95MS strategic aircraft. Falling debris in the city however resulted in damage to buildings and a fire at a service station in the Darnytskyi district, where seven people were injured, including a nine-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman who were taken to city hospitals. Four others received treatment at the scene, as confirmed by the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko. Additionally, in the southern city of Kherson, two men aged 29 and 41 were killed in an attack on a dormitory. Four others, including a 61-year-old woman in serious condition, were admitted to hospital. Kharkiv also experienced several strikes, damaging civilian infrastructure, and injuring two individuals, according to the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. In Lviv, an industrial area was hit, resulting in building damage and a fire. Read the full story here: A US official who recently visited Poland dismissed suggestions that Mateusz Morawiecki\u2019s comments were a sign of cracks in Western solidarity with Ukraine. The official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity about the Polish prime minister\u2019s comments, said: We\u2019re all human and there are moments of tension... But that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s going to be some dramatic shift in alliance unity or even Poland\u2019s fundamental position and determination to support Ukraine for as long as it takes. Poland holds a parliamentary election on 15 October, and the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has come in for criticism from the far right for what it says is the government\u2019s subservient attitude to Ukraine. The Confederation party, which has given voice to anti-Ukrainian sentiments, is third in many polls and has emerged as a possible kingmaker. Analysts say PiS\u2019s tougher rhetoric on Ukraine is a response to Confederation\u2019s increasing popularity Marek Swierczynski, a defence analyst at think-tank Polityka Insight said that while it was probably true that Poland currently had no more weapons to give to Ukraine, Morawiecki must have known that the timing of his comments meant they would land \u201clike a grenade into a cesspit\u201d. He said: In my opinion it is more of an escalation of the campaign... to gain a few percent more of the anti-Ukrainian electorate in Poland. Here\u2019s more from AFP on the ongoing dispute between Ukraine and Poland over grain exports: Kyiv said it would hold talks with Warsaw in the coming days over an escalating dispute on Ukrainian grain exports, as the neighbours reiterated their \u201cclose\u201d ties. Poland \u2013 which holds parliamentary elections next month \u2013 has extended an embargo on Ukrainian grain, going against a European Commission decision to end the restrictions. The issue has led to a diplomatic spat between the allies during the Russian invasion. Kyiv\u2019s agriculture ministry said in a statement: The next negotiations will take place in the coming days, during which the issues prepared by both sides will be discussed. It said Ukrainian agriculture minister Mykola Solsky held a telephone conversation with his Polish counterpart Robert Telus. The statement read: The ministers discussed the situation as well as Ukraine\u2019s proposal for its settlement, and agreed to find a solution that takes into account the interests of both countries. It added that \u201cthe parties confirmed the close and constructive relations\u201d. Ukraine has filed a lawsuit at the World Trade Organisation against its three EU neighbours \u2013 Poland, Slovakia and Hungary \u2013 over the bans on Ukrainian grain. Warsaw holds parliamentary elections next month. Its populist right-wing government has strong support in agricultural regions and has presented the ban as protecting Polish farmers. Earlier, Poland\u2019s prime minister said his country would no longer send arms to Ukraine in order to focus on its own defence, a few hours after Warsaw summoned Kyiv\u2019s ambassador amid a row over grain exports. At least two people were killed in the biggest Russian strikes on Ukraine since 15 August. The massive Russian attack hit at least six cities across Ukraine and wounded at least 21. The attack, carried out on the International Day of Peace, coincided with the United Nations general assembly summit in New York, where Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had delivered a speech and presented a Ukrainian \u201cpeace formula\u201d. The strikes damaged energy infrastructure in central and western Ukraine, Ukrainian national grid operator Ukrenergo said. It said on the Telegram messaging app that the attacks caused electricity shutdowns in five regions \u2013 Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Rivne, and Kharkiv. Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi said on the Telegram messaging app that the Russian missiles were launched in several waves from 10 Russian warplanes, and that Ukrainian air defences shot down 36 out of 43 missiles launched. A Ukrainian intelligence source has claimed to Reuters that Ukraine\u2019s security service and navy struck the Saky airbase in Russian-occupied Crimea overnight, inflicting \u201cserious damage\u201d. Earlier, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had shot down 19 drones over Crimea and the Black Sea. Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea in 2014. Poland said Wednesday it will no longer arm Ukraine and instead focus on its own defence, as the two allies clashed at a key moment in Kyiv\u2019s fightback against the invasion by Russia. In a mounting row over grain exports from Ukraine, Poland summoned the Ukrainian ambassador on Wednesday to protest remarks at the UN by Zelenskiy. Polish government spokesperson Piotr M\u00fcller on Thursday said Poland will only be carrying out previously agreed supplies of ammunition and armaments, including those resulting from the contracts signed with Ukraine. Slovakia and Ukraine\u2019s agricultural ministers have agreed to set up a licensing system for trading in grains, which would allow a ban on imports of four Ukrainian commodities to Slovakia to be lifted once the system is set up, Reuters reports the Slovak Agriculture Ministry said on Thursday. Ukraine\u2019s agricultural minister, in a phone call with his counterpart from Poland, has agreed to work out a solution to a trade dispute that is in the interests of both countries, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. Belgium is considering whether to supply its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, prime minister Alexander De Croo said at the sidelines of the UN general assembly. Here is an image sent over the news wires of the site of the strike in Rivne. Ukraine\u2019s agricultural minister, in a phone call with his Polish counterpart, has agreed to work out a solution to a trade dispute that is in the interests of both countries, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. Reuters reports the ministry said in a statement that the two sides had confirmed their \u201cclose and constructive ties and agreed to work out an option to cooperate on export issues in the near future\u201d. Poland announced restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports on Friday after the European Commission decided not to extend a ban on imports into Ukraine\u2019s five EU neighbours. Ukraine and Slovakia earlier announced that the two nations had come to an agreement. Slovakia and Ukraine\u2019s agricultural ministers have agreed to set up a licensing system for trading in grains, which would allow a ban on imports of four Ukrainian commodities to Slovakia to be lifted once the system is set up, Reuters reports the Slovak Agriculture Ministry said on Thursday. Ukraine also agreed to halt a complaint over the import ban that it had filed against Slovakia with the World Trade Organization. Poland\u2019s agricultural minister is reportedly currently in a phone conversation with Ukraine\u2019s equivalent. There have been some more words out of Poland concerning its escalating dispute with Ukraine sparked by concerns about Ukrainian grain imports entering Poland. On Wednesday, Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called a halt to arms shipments to its invaded neighbour, saying his country had decided to prioritise its own defence. \u201cWe are no longer transferring weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland with more modern weapons,\u201d the prime minister said. In his UN address earlier in the week, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, suggested decisions by Poland, Hungary and Slovakia to defy an EU move end a grain import ban were hypocritical and detrimental to his country. His words prompted a furious response from Poland, which summoned the Ukrainian ambassador. Morawiecki later told Polsat News television: \u201cI am warning Ukraine\u2019s authorities. Because if they are to escalate the conflict like that, we will add additional products to the ban on imports into Poland. Ukrainian authorities do not understand the degree to which Poland\u2019s farming industry has been destabilised. We are protecting Polish farmers.\u201d This morning, Reuters reports that Polish government spokesperson Piotr M\u00fcller has said Poland will only be carrying out previously agreed supplies of ammunition and armaments, including those resulting from the contracts signed with Ukraine. State assets minister Jacek Sasin has also spoken on the issue, to radio broadcaster Plus. He said: \u201cAt the moment it is as the prime minister said, in the future we will see.\u201d Shaun Walker reports from Kyiv on Ukraine\u2019s awkward allies \u2013 the far-right Russians fighting on Kyiv\u2019s side: Before Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last year, Denis Nikitin was known as a notorious Russian nationalist, who built links between far-right groups across Europe and was once a major figure on Russia\u2019s football hooliganism scene. These days, Nikitin runs the Russian Volunteer Corps (RDK, to use its Russian abbreviation), a controversial unit of Russian citizens that fights alongside the Ukrainian army. RDK, along with another group of Russians fighting on Kyiv\u2019s side, performed several cross-border raids earlier this year, briefly seizing villages inside Russia before retreating back into Ukraine. Ukrainian officials suggest that after the full military defeat of Russia and the collapse of the Putin system, RDK and units like it could be part of a pro-Ukrainian force that marches into Russia, perhaps seizing permanent control of parts of Russian territory. But RDK are complicated allies for Ukraine. Many of its members have far-right views. Nikitin, who grew up in Russia and Germany, has been banned from the Schengen zone since 2019 and has a reputation as one of Europe\u2019s most notorious neo-Nazis. He goes by the name White Rex, also the name of a brand of clothing he set up that uses far-right imagery.

Reuters reports it said on the Telegram messaging app that the attacks caused electricity shutdowns in five regions \u2013 Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Dnipropetrovsk, Rivne, and Kharkiv. Overnight Russia launched its most concerted missile and drone attack on Ukrainian cities since mid-August, with Ukrainian sources stating that Kyiv, Cherkasy, Rivne, Lviv, Kharkiv and Kherson regions were all attacked. Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi said on the Telegram messaging app that the Russian missiles were launched in several waves from 10 Russian warplanes, and that Ukrainian air defences shot down 36 out of 43 missiles launched. Suspilne has more detail on the claims Ukraine is making about an attack on the Saky airbase in Russian-occupied Crimea. On its Telegram channel, it writes: There were at least 12 combat aircraft (Su-24 and Su-30) at the airfield at that moment, as well as Pantsir Manpads. The airfield also housed a base for training UAV operators. It is these drones that the Russians use to coordinate their own airstrikes, as well as being a combat strike drone. Drones were used to defeat the enemy, which overloaded the Russian air defence system, and Neptune missiles were launched. Russia\u2019s defence ministry has claimed it shot down 19 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and the Black Sea last night. The claims have not been independently verified. A Ukrainian intelligence source has claimed to Reuters that Ukraine\u2019s security service and navy struck the Saky airbase in Russian-occupied Crimea overnight, inflicting \u201cserious damage\u201d. Earlier, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had shot down 19 drones over Crimea and the Black Sea. Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea in 2014. More details soon \u2026 Here are some more images sent to us over the news wires showing the aftermath of Russia\u2019s overnight attack on cities in Ukraine. Reuters has a quick snap to say Ukraine\u2019s army chief claims air defences shot down 36 out of 43 Russian missiles fired in the overnight attack. Oleksiy Kuleba, former governor of Kyiv region, and now the deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, has provided a status update on the overnight attacks on Telegram. Kuleba writes: Tonight, Russia launched a massive missile attack on Ukraine. Civilians, hostels, a service station, a hotel, energy and civil infrastructure are targeted. Kyiv city, Kyiv region \u2013 there are damaged and damaged houses. Cherkasy region \u2013 demolition of the rubble of the destroyed hotel continues, 10 people are injured, two are in serious condition. Rivne region \u2013 part of the regional centre is without electricity. Lviv region, Kharkiv region \u2013 were also hit. Kherson oblast is constantly under fire. During the night, the enemy killed three people and wounded five. Sincere condolences to their relatives. All affected people are receiving help. Local authorities and all necessary services are on site. The liquidation of the consequences of shelling is ongoing. Difficult months are ahead \u2013 Russia will attack energy and critically important facilities. Do not ignore air raid warnings. Take care of your own safety. Attempts by the Russians every day and every night to sow panic and terror by shelling our peaceful communities are only confirmation of the inhuman nature of the occupiers. Energy and civilian infrastructure was hit in an early morning Russian missile attack on Ukraine\u2019s western Rivne region, Reuters reports local governor Vitaliy Koval said on Thursday. The Russian defence ministry claims to have downed 19 drones over the Black Sea and Crimea regions, and three further drones launched at the Belgorod, Kursk and Oryol regions by Ukraine. Tass reports in a statement the ministry said: \u201cOn the night of 20-21 September, an attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack with aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicles on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation was stopped.\u201d Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that the number of injured in Kharkiv as a result of Russian missile attacks has increased to three, citing the prosecutor\u2019s office in the region. Belgium is considering whether to supply its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, prime minister Alexander De Croo said. Belgium is replacing its F-16s with F-35 fighter jets and its defence ministry had said earlier the F-16s were too old for Ukraine to use in battle, though De Croo said they might still be of use, for example in training pilots. \u201cI have asked Defence to see what use our F-16s could have in Ukraine,\u201d Reuters reports De Croo told Belgian broadcaster VRT, speaking on the sidelines of the UN general meeting in New York. \u201cWe need to consider all options.\u201d Here are photos from Russia\u2019s missile strikes, which have killed two people: More now on the strikes Russia launched on Ukraine overnight. Two people were killed in the biggest strikes since 15 August, according to the Associated Press. The massive Russian attack hit at least six cities across Ukraine and wounded at least 21. The attack carried out on the International Day of Peace coincided with the United Nations general assembly summit in New York, where the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, delivered a speech and presented a Ukrainian \u201cpeace formula\u201d. The missile attack came a day after reports of sabotage at a Russian military airfield in Chkalovsk near Moscow. Here is what we know: In the southern city of Kherson, near the front lines, two people were killed in Thursday\u2019s attacks and at least five injured after a strike hit a residential building, said regional governor Oleksand Prokudin. Seven people were injured in Kyiv, including a nine-year-old girl, reported the mayor, Vitalii Klitschko, and some residential and commercial buildings were damaged. At least six strikes hit the Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv, damaging civilian infrastructure, said regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. The city\u2019s mayor added that two people had been sent to hospitals. Seven were injured and at least one person was rescued from under rubble in Cherkasy, in central Ukraine, according to Ihor Klymenko, minister of internal affairs of Ukraine. An industrial zone was hit in the western region of Lviv, damaging buildings and starting a fire, but no information on casualties was immediately available, Klymenko added. Regional governor Vitalii Koval reported strikes in the city of Rivne in the northwest region of the same name, without immediately providing details. Poland will no longer send arms to Ukraine in order to focus on its own defence, the Polish prime minister has said, a few hours after Warsaw summoned Kyiv\u2019s ambassador amid a row over grain exports. \u201cWe are no longer transferring weapons to Ukraine, because we are now arming Poland with more modern weapons,\u201d Mateusz Morawiecki said, in response to a question about whether Warsaw would continue to support Kyiv despite the grain exports disagreement. Poland has been one of Ukraine\u2019s staunchest supporters after Russia invaded in February 2022 and is one of Kyiv\u2019s main weapons suppliers. It also hosts a million Ukrainian refugees, who have been supplied with various forms of state aid. Zelenskiy is likely to find his latest visit to Washington a much tougher occasion than the hero\u2019s welcome he was given nine months ago. Zelenskiy was given a standing ovation when he delivered an address to a joint sitting of Congress in December, but on Thursday morning there will be minimal ceremony, and the Ukrainian president faces difficult conversations behind closed doors when he meets congressional leaders who are in the midst of a bitter spending battle that could lead to a government shutdown. Democrats too will have questions if the Ukrainian delegation comes with requests for drone technology. Party leaders are wary of providing weapon systems that could be used to strike Russian territory, and congressional sources say Zelenskiy will be quizzed on Kyiv\u2019s role in recent strikes on Moscow and other targets deep within Russia. After his visit to the Hill, Zelenskiy will cross the Potomac to the Pentagon for a meeting with defence secretary Lloyd Austin and the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley. Then in mid afternoon, he is due at the White House to meet Joe Biden. The US president is expected to announce a new $325m military aid package on the occasion of the visit, but the package will reportedly not include the 300km-range ATACMS missiles Ukraine has been asking for. Explosions rocked Ukrainian cities overnight, as a massive Russian attack started fires and injured at least 14 people. Seven people were injured in Kyiv, including a nine-year-old girl, reported the city\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and some residential and commercial buildings were damaged. At least six strikes hit the Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv, damaging civilian infrastructure, said regional governor Oleh Syniehubov. The city\u2019s mayor added that two people had been taken to hospital. Five were injured and at least one person was buried under rubble in Cherkasy, where a social infrastructure building was damaged, said regional governor Ihor Taburets. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. Our top story this morning: Explosions rocked Ukrainian cities overnight, as a massive Russian attack started fires and injured at least 14 people. Seven people were injured in Kyiv, including a 9-year-old girl, reported Mayor Vitali Klitschko, and some residential and commercial buildings were damaged. And Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will meet US president Joe Biden at the White House this afternoon, as Biden is expected to announce a new $325m military aid package. The package will reportedly not include the 300km-range ATACMS missiles Ukraine has been asking for. More shortly. Elsewhere meanwhile: Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed the UN security council on Wednesday, saying there had been 574 days of \u201cpain, losses and struggle\u201d since Russia\u2019s invasion of his country. He said peoples and governments had lost confidence in the UN\u2019s ability and willingness to defend sovereign borders and that the UN had been \u201cineffective\u201d but that it was \u201ccapable of more\u201d. Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the west of \u201cselectively\u201d turning to UN norms and principles on a case-by-case basis \u201cbased on their parochial geopolitical needs\u201d. Speaking at the UN\u2019s security council, he said this had resulted in the \u201cshaking of global stability\u201d and the \u201cexacerbation of new hotbeds of tensions\u201d that risked global conflict. More than a dozen European countries, as well as Australia and Canada, asked the world court on Wednesday to decide whether it has jurisdiction in a case brought by Kyiv alleging that Russia abused the genocide convention to provide a pretext for the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine brought the case to the international court of justice (ICJ), the highest UN court for disputes between states, days after Russia launched a full-scale war on its smaller neighbour on 24 February last year. Poland said on Wednesday it will no longer arm Ukraine and instead focus on its own defence, as the two allies clashed at a key moment in Kyiv\u2019s fightback against the invasion by Russia. In a mounting row over grain exports from Ukraine, Poland summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to protest remarks at the UN by Zelenskiy. Iran\u2019s president, Ebrahim Raisi, in a lengthy set-piece speech to the UN general assembly, accused the US of fanning the flames of violence in Ukraine, prompting protests from Israel\u2019s representative to the UN. Russia has \u201cdeliberately and repeatedly\u201d targeted medical facilities in the Ukrainian city of Kherson, causing damage to children\u2019s hospitals, maternity wards and a regional clinic, according to a new study. The Swedish investigation into the Nord Stream sabotage last year is at a sensitive stage and the investigator, Mats Ljungqvist, hopes to conclude it before the end of the year, he told Reuters on Wednesday. Ukraine\u2019s first lady urged world leaders on Tuesday to help return Ukrainian children forcibly taken to Russia, where she said they were being indoctrinated and deprived of their national identity. Speaking on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Olena Zelenska said more than 19,000 Ukrainian children had been transferred by force or deported to Russia or occupied territories. Ukraine claimed to have shot down 17 drones overnight on Tuesday. The air force reported that Russian troops had launched a total of 24 unmanned aerial vehicles at Ukraine. Ukraine reported that Russia hit an oil refinery in Kremenchuk, causing a fire and halting operations. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, reported on Wednesday that three settlements in the region had lost power as a result of cross-border shelling by Ukrainian armed forces, and that one woman had been wounded. He later reported that a man had been killed and another wounded by shelling near the village of Maksimovka. Brazil\u2019s president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva met on Wednesday for more than an hour with Zelenskiy and discussed ways to achieve a peaceful end to the war in Ukraine. \u201cWe had a good conversation about the importance of paths to building,\u201d Lula posted on messaging platform X, formerly known as Twitter, after their meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN general assembly."
