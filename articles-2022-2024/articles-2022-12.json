            "content": "The lead-up to Arizona\u2019s midterms saw tactics designed to disrupt the American democratic process in a battleground state where election denialism ran rampant. Though voters broadly rejected election deniers, the grip of their ideas remains strong among large portions of the right in the state, which is now at the forefront of the fight over democracy in the US. \u201cVoters in swing states sent a message that they were not receptive to election denialism. They didn\u2019t send that message everywhere,\u201d said Daniel I Weiner, director of the Brennan Center\u2019s elections and government program. Weiner added: \u201cThere is going to continue to have to be built a greater consensus amongst Americans across the ideological spectrum that this is out of bounds. This election was reassuring. It certainly doesn\u2019t mean the election denialism has gone away, though.\u201d As soon as voters started dropping off their ballots, people in tactical gear with guns started monitoring them. One rural Arizona county kicked off, then backed away from, plans to hand count all ballots. Arizona\u2019s Republican gubernatorial candidate, Kari Lake, said she wouldn\u2019t concede if she lost. After election day brought printer problems in Maricopa county, the state\u2019s largest by population, the bluster and election denialism grew. The county has said those problems did not prevent voters from casting a ballot and that they will be investigated, but still some Republicans want a \u201cre-vote,\u201d a new election, and some statewide candidates who lost have refused to concede their races. Others are filing or preparing to file lawsuits, as legal letters fly from the state attorney general\u2019s office and the Republican party. One county refused to certify its results, only doing so under court order. Maricopa county supervisors faced a vengeful crowd, some part of a traveling group in a \u201cQAnon-themed Scooby Doo van\u201d that invoked God and country to condemn this year\u2019s election. \u201cI never could have imagined in county government that we\u2019d see this kind of vitriol towards us, but I think that these people have been sold a story, a narrative, and they believe that very strongly,\u201d said Bill Gates, the Republican chairman of the Maricopa county board of supervisors. \u201cAnd that narrative is that we are traitors, that we have violated the law, that we\u2019re Rinos [Republicans In Name Only]. They didn\u2019t come up with it on their own.\u201d In this closely watched, tightly divided state that will help decide the 2024 election, skepticism of election results has found an audience with some Republican leaders, as the state has shifted away from Republicans in the past decade. While other states have embraced election conspiracy theories as well, Republicans in the Arizona senate encouraged such claims when the chamber initiated a so-called audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa county by a group called the Cyber Ninjas. Their practices and results were widely criticized by elections experts and actual auditors, but they set Arizona at the forefront of a growing anti-democratic movement. Some of the movement\u2019s biggest names receive extensive fundraising hauls and social media attention by casting doubt on elections. The Arizona Republican party, led by Kelli Ward, has embraced Trumpism and election lies, casting out moderate Republicans like those who typically win statewide elections and setting the tone for an adversarial relationship between the state party and some elected Republicans who have defended elections. \u201cIt has nothing to do with patriotism. It\u2019s a machine, a money-making effort,\u201d said Rusty Bowers, the Arizona House speaker who was voted out in his Republican primary. \u201cThey found how to do it. The formula works \u2026 It would seem obvious to somebody with rational thinking that I am being played for my wallet.\u201d While Republicans lost key positions statewide, they still hold one-vote majorities in both chambers of the Arizona legislature, and many moderate Republican votes were driven out of the legislature during their primaries. State government will be divided, with a Democratic governor and Republican-led legislature, so extreme election laws are unlikely to become law \u2013 but the forthcoming session should see lots of election-related fireworks. Already, one incoming Republican lawmaker has vowed not to vote for anything until the state redoes the 2022 election. The elections committee in the Arizona senate will be chaired by Wendy Rogers, one of the most vehement election deniers in the state, who is fundraising on the idea of redoing the election. Election deniers faced consequences The fever hasn\u2019t yet broken, but the signs of slowing have started to appear. Certainly, losing big offices \u2013 Democrats won the races for governor, US Senate, secretary of state and attorney general in Arizona, and generally outperformed midterm expectations nationwide \u2013 show that there are consequences for alienating moderate voters who swing elections here. Such consequences, elections experts say, are critical for hindering the spread of election denialism. \u201cThe only way out of this situation, this morass that we seem to find ourselves in, is if there\u2019s accountability for those who are undermining our elections and who are attacking the legitimacy and the integrity of the process,\u201d said Tammy Patrick, a former Maricopa county elections officer. The courts can also send a message that refusing to follow election law \u2013 as in Cochise county, which initially refused to certify its votes \u2013 will not be tolerated. A federal judge sent such a message on 1 December, in response to a lawsuit filed by Lake, the GOP governor candidate, and the Republican secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem, which sought to prevent the use of machines to tabulate votes. The US district court judge John Tuchi approved sanctions against Lake and Finchem\u2019s attorneys, sought by Maricopa county, calling the lawsuit \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d. Some, including former prosecutors in Arizona, want to see criminal charges against the Cochise supervisors for abdicating their duty as elected officials. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of criminalizing a bunch of stuff,\u201d said Alex Gulotta, the Arizona director for the voting rights group All Voting is Local. \u201cOn the other hand, if people are willing to break the law and break the law and break the law and continue to break the law when they\u2019re told they\u2019re breaking the law and break the law again, then at some point, you have to hold those people accountable.\u201d Will it get better or worse? Those grappling with threats to democracy since 2020 see some signs that the movement is petering out, though they acknowledge 2024 could see more activity given the high stakes of the presidential election. The protests leading up to election certification in Arizona were small \u2013 one traveling protester, David Clements, said he was heading back to New Mexico after several days of protests because \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem like the people of Arizona cared\u201d. The courts stepped in and made it clear, in multiple instances, that election shenanigans wouldn\u2019t be tolerated. The Arizona Republican party is seeing efforts from some moderates, including the former Republican gubernatorial candidate Karrin Taylor Robson, who lost in the primary, to realign the party under a broader tent that could start to win elections again. Taylor Robson called on Ward to resign, saying Ward and Lake were the \u201cmegaphones\u201d of the false election narratives that sunk the party in 2022. The state party, though, is full of Republican foot soldiers who are closely aligned with Ward. It has often run farther to the right than the state itself and censured moderate Republicans, including the current governor, Doug Ducey. Getting the party\u2019s activists to choose a mainstream, moderate Republican to run the party is a tall order. Ward is not expected to run again, though her Maga allies are sure to seek the leadership position. Gates, the Maricopa supervisors chairman, said he didn\u2019t know for sure if the noise would die down. Candidates and outside parties still could and would file lawsuits, as was their right, he said. If, after that, people continued to question the results, then he would know the narrative continued. \u201cIf the thought is to re-create a so-called audit on the lines of what happened in 2021, I think that\u2019s not in the best interest of the state and could lead to even more election denialism in 2024,\u201d Gates said. Bowers, the outgoing Arizona House speaker and one of the few vocal Republican defenders of elections inthe state, said he didn\u2019t know how to break through the propaganda his party members have been fed. They seem to have \u201csurrendered rationality\u201d. He said many friends had been driven to vote Democratic for the first time. He himself didn\u2019t vote for any election deniers and instead \u201cwrote in some good people\u201d. The party, though, seems stuck on the 2020 election, and he thinks it will only get worse. People had found success, at least in growing their social media followings and raising money, by leaning into fear and blaming others for their losses, he said. \u201cHatred has a great grip on the heart. And when you feed it, it gets tighter and tighter,\u201d Bowers said."

            "title": "The biggest losers in the US midterm elections? Republican mega-donors",
            "date": "2022-12-06T07:00:05Z",
            "content": "With the power balance in Congress at stake in this year\u2019s midterm elections, the GOP money machine kicked into high gear. Spending on advertisements and drumming up votes was fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars from the party\u2019s mega-donors and Super Pacs. Many donors\u2019 spending figures marked new records. Their return on investment, however, is probably not what they had hoped: some donors who spent eight figures notched zero wins in the Senate, while others spent far more money on losing candidates than winners. In the midterms, some of the biggest losers were Republican donors. Among the clearest of those losers is Mehmet Oz, who self-funded much of his own failed run for office \u2013 loaning his Pennsylvania US Senate campaign about $22m, or about 55% of the roughly $40m he raised. Meanwhile, candidates backed by Peter Thiel, the rightwing tech investor hyped pre-election as a new GOP \u201ckingmaker\u201d, lost in Arizona and Washington, calling into question his judgment and contributions\u2019 value. Other mega-donors and Pacs came out behind despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars collectively on multiple candidates who lost, according to Open Secrets, a campaign finance watchdog, and federal campaign records. Among those is Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate Leadership Fund Super Pac, which spent $239m; the billionaire financier Jeff Yass, who spent $47m; the hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, who spent $67m; the packaging giants Elizabeth and Richard Uihlein, who spent $77m; and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, who spent $34m. By contrast, Democratic candidates in high-profile Senate races generally had a larger share of small donations. GOP mega-donor and Super Pac money couldn\u2019t overcome weak candidates that many swing voters viewed as extreme. The results highlight that \u201ccandidate strength matters\u201d, said Gunner Ramer, political director at Longwell Associates, a conservative communication firm. \u201cVoters have real concerns over crime, inflation, gas prices and the economy \u2026 but all these really poor candidates \u2013 these crazy, extreme Republicans \u2013 got beat up hard.\u201d In Pennsylvania, Oz\u2019s self-funding functioned as a double-edged sword that benefited him in the primaries and made him attractive to GOP base voters \u201cwho still think that you can buy a race\u201d, said Sam Chen, a political strategist in Allentown. But once in the general election, Chen said, it meant that Oz received relatively few small donors in part because he was viewed as a self-funder. Still, he wasn\u2019t alone: McConnell\u2019s Pac put up $47m. That combined with Oz\u2019s personal spending accounted for nearly half of the stunning $140m Oz forces spent in the campaign. Two largely billionaire-funded single-candidate Pacs also went all in on Oz: Honor Pennsylvania spent about $15m, and its largest donor was Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, who gave it at least $8.8m; and American Leadership Action Pac, funded by Wall Street tycoons or mega-donors like Susquehanna International Group CEO Jeff Yass, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman and Actua CEO Walter Buckley, dropped another $15m. Though the outside spending in Pennsylvania set a new record, Oz was a \u201cuniquely weak candidate\u201d, Chen noted, and his failure highlights how wealth and Super PAC money \u201cis not the end all be all\u201d. \u201cSmall dollar donations, the grandma who writes you a $5 check, they are locked in and voting for you \u2026 and they are probably the type of person who tells their neighborhood, their soccer mom group, their bible study that they gave you contributions,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThose contributions mean a lot more.\u201d In Arizona, Thiel spent at least $17.5m backing Blake Masters\u2019 failed US Senate bid, while Thiel\u2019s Pac, Saving Arizona, which received significant funding from mega-donor Richard Uihlein, spent at least $21.5m. Thiel\u2019s potential to become a powerbroker was the subject of intense media attention in part because he funded a breed of rightwing populist GOP candidate that broke with the party establishment. Voters, however, were \u201ccompletely repelled\u201d by Masters, Ramer said, and though Thiel had success in primary races across the country, his money couldn\u2019t overcome swing voter skepticism in the Arizona general election. McConnell\u2019s Senate Leadership Fund ended with a mixed record, but spent far more on losing races. Data released just ahead of the election by a marketing industry analyst found McConnell had shelled out $178m for advertising in five states \u2013 New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia and Ohio. Campaign finance records show the Senate Leadership Fund spent nearly $140m in four of those five states in which GOP candidates did not win, though Georgia is yet to be decided. The Club For Growth Super Pac, one of the nation\u2019s most prolific outside spenders, also fared poorly. Its primary funders were Uihlein and Yass, who put at least $46m into the Pac. It backed Masters with over $7m and spent $15m in Nevada attempting to unseat Democratic senator Catherine Cortez Masto. It also spent $12m total on winning campaigns in Ohio and North Carolina. Meanwhile, the Sentinel Action Fund spent over $10m in Nevada and New Hampshire, and didn\u2019t put any money in winning Senate races. Its primary funder is Tim Mellon, grandson of banking tycoon Andrew Mellon, who spent about $40m during the election cycle. Focus groups run by Longwell Associates found Pacs\u2019 ads were probably ineffective because voters didn\u2019t like the Trump-backed, extreme GOP candidates that the Pacs supported \u2013 such as Adam Laxalt in Nevada, Don Buldoc in New Hampshire or Masters. \u201cYou can hit Catherine Cortez Masto on gas prices and tie it to Joe Biden, but at least a meaningful slice of voters just were not buying it,\u201d Ramer said. \u201cAt the end of the day, if they don\u2019t like the Republican candidate, and it becomes a lesser-of-two-evils thing, then it may not move the votes the way that Club for Growth was hoping, and that is a reflection on Adam Laxalt.\u201d Many of the mega-donors\u2019 spending totals come with a caveat. They may not include all the donors\u2019 contributions, and Pac records may omit spending by some individuals altogether. Pacs are required by law to disclose their donors, but more are shielding their contributors\u2019 identities by exploiting a loophole that allows donors to give to a Pac\u2019s affiliated dark money nonprofit, which does not have to disclose its donors. The nonprofit then gives those donations to the Pac, circumventing disclosure laws. Pacs only \u201chave the facade of being transparent\u201d, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of Open Secrets, adding that the loophole adds another layer of uncertainty to the nation\u2019s already murky campaign finance disclosure laws. Regardless, the money means little to the GOP if the party continues nominating extremist and Trump-backed candidates in swing states, Ramer said. \u201cThe gap between what it takes to win in a Republican primary and what it takes to win in November is continuing to grow, and that is a difficulty the party will be dealing with in future elections.\u201d Whether the funders will have a change of heart is another matter. Republican mega-donors \u201cclearly have money to burn and they may lose, and they may be dissatisfied with their return on investment, but they are also clearly risk takers \u2013 and it\u2019s a low risk to them because of how much money they have\u201d, said Krumholz. \u201cIt shows the limits of their money.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-07T20:19:00Z",
            "content": "The US supreme court heard arguments on Wednesday in Moore v Harper, one of this term\u2019s highest profile and most contentious cases which has the potential to fundamentally reshape elections for Congress and the presidency. The justices appeared to be starkly divided along predictable ideological lines as they mulled over the power of state courts to strike down congressional districts drawn by state legislatures because they violate state constitutions. Republicans from North Carolina who brought the case argue that a provision of the US constitution known as the elections clause gives state lawmakers virtually total control over the \u201ctimes, places and manner\u201d of congressional elections, including redistricting, and cuts state courts out of the process. The Republicans are advancing a concept called the \u201cindependent state legislature theory\u201d, never before adopted by the supreme court but cited approvingly by four conservative justices. The direction of questioning at Wednesday\u2019s hearing suggested that three of those conservative justices \u2013 Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas \u2013 were open to the idea of adopting the theory, despite decades of precedent from their own court dismissing it. They seemed to have the slightly more tentative backing of Brett Kavanaugh, who was part of the legal team in 2000 that assisted George W Bush through Bush v Gore, the case that in modern times put the independent state legislature theory on the map. On the other side of the argument, the three liberal-leaning justices were profoundly critical of the notion that state legislatures should be given free rein to control federal elections virtually unrestrained by state constitutions and judicial review from state courts. Questions from John Roberts suggested he might be seeking a more narrowly-drawn compromise position. Which left all eyes on Amy Coney Barrett, the third of Donald Trump\u2019s three appointees. Potentially, she might find herself casting the decisive vote. Though it gives little clue as to which side of the fence Barrett will be standing on when the ruling comes down, she did ask several probing questions of the lawyer representing North Carolina\u2019s Republicans. She said that those pushing for state legislatures to be freed up from oversight had a \u201cproblem\u201d defining their terms, and she questioned whether the theory had any bearing in legal text. For their part, the liberal justices \u2013 Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor \u2013 robustly argued that incorporating the theory into constitutional law would be a threat to democracy. Elena Kagan cited three recent supreme court rulings that all counter the theory. Kagan made an impassioned speech about the potential impact of siding with North Carolina\u2019s Republicans. \u201cThink about consequences, because this is a theory with big consequences \u2026 This is a proposal that gets rid of the normal checks and balances on the way big governmental decisions are made in this country, at exactly the time when they are needed most.\u201d She warned that a broad ruling could unleash state legislatures to carry out extreme forms of gerrymandering, tear up voter protections and even certify election results according to their own political interests. Moore v Harper came about after the North Carolina state supreme court struck down districts drawn by Republicans who control the legislature because they heavily favored Republicans in the highly competitive state. The court-drawn map used in last month\u2019s elections for Congress produced a 7-7 split between Democrats and Republicans. North Carolina is among six states in recent years in which state courts have ruled that overly partisan redistricting for Congress violated their state constitutions. The others are Florida, Maryland, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. State courts have become the only legal forum for challenging partisan congressional maps since the supreme court ruled in 2019 that those lawsuits cannot be brought in federal court. In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers will not have to wait for the court\u2019s decision to produce a new congressional map that is expected to have more Republican districts. Even as Democrats won half the state\u2019s 14 congressional seats, Republicans seized control of the state supreme court. Two newly elected Republican justices give them a 5-2 edge that makes it more likely than not that the court would uphold a map with more Republican districts. One of the striking features about Wednesday\u2019s legal debate was how the usual ideological positions of the two sides were turned on their heads. The conservative justices, who have often invoked states\u2019 rights in previous rulings \u2013 not least in last year\u2019s seminal decision to overturn abortion rights \u2013 sounded at times to be almost anti-federalist. After the US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, accused the petitioners of making an \u201catextual, ahistorical, and destabilizing interpretation of the elections clause\u201d, Thomas intervened. \u201cI must say, it seems a bit ironic that you\u2019re on the other side of the federalism issue,\u201d he said, apparently unaware of the irony of his own position. By contrast, lawyers speaking against the state legislature theory turned on several occasions to the historical record of the founding fathers as well as close textual analysis of the constitution \u2013 tactics normally associated with the rightwing supermajority. \u201cOver 233 years, this court has never second-guessed a state court interpretation of its own constitution in any context,\u201d said Neal Katyal, a lawyer representing Common Cause, an ethics-in-government group which is opposing what it claims is an attempted Republican power grab in North Carolina. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 December 2022. An earlier version incorrectly described Amy Coney Barrett as \u201cthe newest addition to the [supreme] court\u201d."

            "date": "2022-12-18T14:47:58Z",
            "content": "Tunisia has been plunged into political uncertainty after it recorded the lowest electoral turnout in its recent history following President Kais Saied\u2019s suspension of parliament and subsequent redrawing of the country\u2019s political map. Its main opposition alliance called on Saied to \u201cleave immediately\u201d as voters overwhelmingly snubbed the the legislative election in what officials at the country\u2019s Instance Sup\u00e9rieure Ind\u00e9pendante pour les \u00c9lections (ISIE) said was a participation rate of 8.8%. Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, president of Tunisia\u2019s \u201cSalvation Front\u201d alliance, which boycotted the vote and has accused Saied of a coup against Tunisia\u2019s democracy said the president had \u201clost all legal legitimacy\u201d. An abstention rate of more than 91% \u201cshows that very, very few Tunisians support Kais Saied\u2019s approach\u201d, Chebbi told Agence France-Presse. Since suspending parliament in July of last year, Saied has introduced a new constitution, greatly reducing the prominence of the country\u2019s political parties, who he characterised as enemies of the people. He reserved particular ire for the Ennahda movement, part of the opposition alliance, which has dominated the political scene since the country first led the wave of Arab Spring protests against autocracy in 2011. In the place of traditional parties, on whom Saied has placed much of the blame for the withering economy and ingrained unemployment, the president has encouraged individuals to run in the election on programmes intended to serve their immediate community. The result, 1,055 self-funded candidates competing for 161 seats, led to a unique electoral contest, with many voters unsure of who was running and a number of constituencies only featuring a single candidate on the ballot. \u201cI came out to support a friend from the neighbourhood,\u201d 19-year-old Omar said of his vote for the one candidate competing at the busy inner Tunis district around Rue de Marseille. \u201cPresident Saied is bringing change to the country and I\u2019ll always support that,\u201d he told a translator. With many political parties absent, the buildup to the vote was been remarkably low-key, with some voters not even aware that an election was taking place. \u201cI don\u2019t have any hope,\u201d said dentist Lamia Kamoun, explaining that she hadn\u2019t decided whether to vote. \u201cI had hope in the country, not now \u2026 Things have got worse.\u201d By about 1pm on Saturday, two polling stations in the working-class district of Kabaria, near Tunis, had only recorded about 100 votes each, out of a possible 1,800 registered voters across both centres. One ISIE official there said that they had no intention of voting in an election they regarded as holding no significance. \u201cThis is just my job,\u201d they said, gesturing around the empty schoolyard. Closer to the city centre, near the city\u2019s historic medina quarter, one polling station had only recorded about 40 voters out of a possible 900. Speaking from the booths, one official explained that the vote didn\u2019t really stand comparison with previous elections, as it was a unique contest. ISIE president, Farouk Bouasker, appeared to channel the rhetoric of Saied, who has made great play of conspiracies, attributing the low turnout to \u201cthe absence of corrupt political money\u201d. Initial results should be announced on Monday, with the final results not expected until January. The new body is not expected to sit before March, after tied or close contests are rerun. Opposition groups have previously attacked Saied\u2019s political programme, they had not before said he should quit office. \u201cWhat happened today is an earthquake,\u201d Chebbi said. \u201cFrom this moment we consider Saied an illegitimate president and demand he resign after this fiasco,\u201d he said. He added there should be a short transitional period under a judge followed by presidential elections and a national dialogue. Max Gallien, from the Institute of Development Studies, said that Tunisia was \u201con track to deliver the lowest turnout of any election in modern global history, with half the participation of the previous record holders (Haiti 2015 at 18%, Afghanistan 2019 with 19%).\u201d"

Now the pioneering teenager is about to put his knowledge into practice as the youngest elected Black mayor anywhere in the US. On Tuesday, as the Georgia Senate runoff was capturing the attention of the nation, Smith, 18, was steadily amassing the votes he needed to become the next leader of the small city of Earle, population 1,785. \u201cYou have to start somewhere, you really do,\u201d Smith, who graduated from Earle high school last summer after three years as Student Government Association president, told the Washington Post. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be 30 or 40 and become a mayor when I could be one right now.\u201d Smith, who lives at home with his parents, said his mother could not stop crying about his success, which came with a 235-183 vote defeat of Nemi Matthews, the city\u2019s street and sanitation superintendent. Matthews was one of the first to offer his best wishes, writing: \u201cI congratulate mayor-elect Jaylen Smith for a well ran race, I wish you well.\u201d Smith credited younger voters, having proved his credentials to them by negotiating a deal with a high school cafeteria vendor, among other issues. \u201cI worked time after time to get them what they wanted,\u201d he said, adding that his achievements in school matters had made him \u201cpassionate and determined\u201d to serve the wider community. While not the first 18-year-old to become an elected mayor \u2013 an honor that fell to Michael Sessions in Hillsdale, Michigan, in 2005 \u2013 Smith is the youngest Black candidate to achieve the feat. \u201cI\u2019m excited for Jaylen and the entire community in Earle as he becomes the youngest-ever African American mayor elected in the country,\u201d Frank Scott Jr, mayor of Little Rock, Arkansas, and president of the African American Mayors\u2019 Association, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m proud of his willingness to enter into public service at such a young age and his aspirational goals for the city.\u201d Smith said he consulted several mayors across the state before his campaign, and thanked them for their guidance. In his own message posted to Facebook, he said it was \u201ctime to build a better chapter\u201d for his city. Among his first orders of business after he is sworn in next month, Smith said, would be to move the city\u2019s police department to 24-hour operation. Other policy goals include ridding Earle of abandoned homes, creating jobs for city youth and providing transportation for elderly or infirm residents to grocery stores. Smith was set to return to Earle high school on Thursday, for a celebration of what supporters billed as \u201ca monumental moment for our town\u201d."

Amid a lackluster start to Trump\u2019s own campaign and a string of scandals and setbacks to hit the former US president due to his links to far-right extremists and his own legal problems, a field of potential rivals is starting to emerge for a contest that only a few months ago many thought was Trump\u2019s alone for the taking. They include multiple ex-members of Trump\u2019s own cabinet, including his own former vice-president, his former UN ambassador and his former spy chief. Adding to that are a raft of rivals with their own political power bases, such as Florida\u2019s increasingly formidable rightwing governor, Ron DeSantis. Now the hints of ambitions to taking on Trump are coming thick and fast, especially in the wake of the defeat of a host of Trump-backed candidates in November\u2019s midterm elections which have triggered a reckoning with Trump\u2019s grip on the Republican party. \u201cI can tell you that my wife and I will take some time when our kids are home this Christmas \u2013 we\u2019re going to give prayerful consideration about what role we might play,\u201d former vice-president Mike Pence, 63, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation last month. Maryland\u2019s term-limited Republican governor, Larry Hogan, and Nikki Haley, South Carolina\u2019s former governor and US ambassador to the UN, have said the holidays would also be a time for deliberation. \u201cWe are taking the holidays to kind of look at what the situation is,\u201d Haley said in November. Hogan, a fierce critic of Trump, told CBS last week \u201cit won\u2019t be shocking if I were to bring the subject up\u201d with his family during the break. Come January, he said, he would begin taking advice to \u201ctry to figure out what the future is\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any pressure or any rush to make a decision ... things are gonna look completely different three months from now or six months from now than they did today,\u201d Hogan, 66, added. Others in the running are also readily apparent. Former secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s team has reached out to potential campaign staff in early primary states, the Washington Post reported over the weekend. \u201cWe figured by the first quarter next year, we need to be hard at it if we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d Pompeo, 58, said in an interview with Fox News. The Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, is reportedly talking to donors to determine his ability to fund the 18-month \u201cendurance race\u201d of a nomination process. Hutchinson has said that Trump\u2019s early declaration, on 15 November, had \u201caccelerated everyone\u2019s time frame\u201d. \u201cSo the first quarter of next year, you either need to be in or out,\u201d the outgoing, 72-year-old governor told NBC News earlier this month. New Hampshire\u2019s governor, Chris Sununu, 48, said this week he did not believe Trump could win in 2024. He has voiced concerns that the Republican party could repeat the nomination experience of 2016, when he was a contender, when a large, divided field allowed Trump\u2019s \u201c drain the swamp\u201d insurgent candidacy to triumph. \u201cWe just have to find another candidate at this point,\u201d Sununu told CBS News. While Trump could be the Republican nominee, he added, he was \u201cnot going to be able to close the deal\u201d. The Virginia governor, Glenn Youngkin, 56, has said he is \u201chumbled\u201d to be part of the 2024 discussions but in the convention of most candidates, he says he is focused on his day job. Youngkin telegraphed his fiscal conservative credentials to wider Republican big-money interests by pushing $4bn in tax cuts through the Virginia legislature and meeting with party mega-donors in Manhattan in June. \u201c2024 is a long way away,\u201d he recently told Fox News. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Helping to break the gender-lock on potential candidates is also the South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem. Her name has emerged as a potential Trump running mate, but she recently said he did not present \u201cthe best chance\u201d for Republicans in 2024. \u201cOur job is not just to talk to people who love Trump or hate Trump,\u201d Noem, 51, told the New York Times in November. \u201cOur job is to talk to every single American.\u201d The biggest dog in the potential race \u2013 aside from Trump himself \u2013 is by far Florida\u2019s DeSantis, who recently won re-election in his state by a landslide. Some of the Republican party\u2019s biggest donors have already transferred their favors from Trump, 78, toward the 44-year-old governor. The Republican mega-donor and billionaire Ken Griffin, who moved his hedge fund Citadel from Chicago to Miami last year, described Trump as a \u201cthree-time loser\u201d to Bloomberg a day after the former president\u2019s declaration. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do. It\u2019s a huge personal decision,\u201d Griffin said of DeSantis. \u201cHe has a tremendous record as governor of Florida, and our country would be well-served by him as president.\u201d Similarly, Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the private-equity giant Blackstone, told Axios he was withdrawing his support from Trump for 2024 but stopped short of backing DeSantis. \u201cAmerica does better when its leaders are rooted in today and tomorrow, not today and yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time for the Republican party to turn to a new generation of leaders.\u201d DeSantis has yet to rule a run in or out, but has signaled his interest by beginning to plant ads on Google and Facebook that target an audience beyond Florida. But in the post-midterm political environment, with Trump-backed candidates performing poorly in most contests, and the former president besieged by investigations and questions about his associations, the running is open. Maryland\u2019s Hogan has described Trump as vulnerable, and \u201che seems to be dropping every day\u201d. Hutchinson has said \u201cyou never know when that early frontrunner is going to stumble\u201d. Polls suggest Trump trails DeSantis in a nomination head-to-head, but leads over Pence and Haley. Other potential names in the pot include the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, 65; Florida senator Rick Scott, also 65; former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, 60; and Texas senator Ted Cruz, 52, who ran for the Republican nomination in 2016. In a provocatively titled \u201cOK Boomers, Let Go of the Presidency\u201d column last week, former George W Bush adviser Karl Rove warned that 2024 may resemble 1960 when voters were ready for a generational shift. In that year, they went for the youngest in the field, John F Kennedy, aged 43. \u201cAmericans want leaders who focus on the future,\u201d Rove wrote in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe country would be better off if each party\u2019s standard bearer came from a new generation \u2026 It\u2019s time for the baby boomers and their elders to depart the presidential stage. The party that grasps this has the advantage come 2024\u201d."

            "date": "2022-12-04T07:00:07Z",
            "content": "In one of the clearest signs that the 2024 Republican presidential primary will feature rivals to Donald Trump, a host of likely candidates have released or will soon release books purporting to outline their political visions. Such books often sell poorly, but that is rarely their point. They are markers of ambition. To judge from the political bookshelves, after midterm elections in which many Trump-endorsed candidates suffered humiliating losses, the former president will not be the only declared candidate for long. Among the first rank of likely challengers, Trump\u2019s vice-president, Mike Pence, released a memoir last month and Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, will follow suit in February. Other possible candidates include the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo (book out next year); the Missouri senator Josh Hawley (one book done, another coming); the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley (two books out already); and the South Carolina senator Tim Scott (book published in August, including an inadvertent admission that he is going to run). Even Marco Rubio, the GOP\u2019s great slight hope until Trump took him to the cleaners in 2016, has another book coming. Matt Dallek, a professor of political management at George Washington University, said: \u201cThese books serve as a way to generate free media and a way to put one\u2019s name and platform, to an extent that it exists, in the eyes of voters you\u2019re looking to reach. \u201cIt gives TV producers a hook. And so even though most of these books are, to be generous, pablum \u2013 filled with aphorisms and clich\u00e9 \u2013 from the perspective of the candidate, it allows them to get their story out there, to put themselves before the public and to take a free media ride.\u201d In short, these are not works of great literature, or even the sort of thing the great essayist Christopher Hitchens produced via \u201cthe junky energy that scotch can provide, and the intense short-term concentration that nicotine can help supply \u2026 crouched over a book or keyboard [in] mingled reverie and alertness\u201d. It\u2019s hard to picture evangelical hero Pence or culture warrior DeSantis like that, hunched over a desk, hammering out passages of memoir and policy to meet a publishing deadline. But perhaps their ghostwriters did. The announcement this week of DeSantis\u2019s book \u2013 The Courage to Be Free: Florida\u2019s Blueprint for America\u2019s Renewal \u2013 made the biggest splash. After all, the governor who won re-election in a landslide and declared his state \u201cwhere woke goes to die\u201d is Trump\u2019s only serious polling rival. DeSantis has released a campaign book before, namely Dreams From Our Founding Fathers: First Principles in the Age of Obama, published in 2011 when he was aiming for Congress. According to his publisher, HarperCollins, the Ivy League-educated ex-navy lawyer will now offer \u201ca first-hand account from the blue-collar boy who grew up to take on Disney and Dr Fauci\u201d. True to DeSantis\u2019s success in pursuing distinctly Trumpist policies, the announcement was replete with such culture-war themes. Daniel Uhlfelder, a former Democratic candidate for Florida attorney general, tweeted: \u201cRon DeSantis, who has led a statewide effort to ban books, is writing a book called The Courage to be Free. This is not a joke.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Trump books are a publishing phenomenon but books about what the agent Howard Yoon recently called the \u201cmilquetoast\u201d Biden administration have not sold so well. Neither, it seems safe to say, will the flood of Republican books. Asked if she was eager to read DeSantis\u2019s book, Molly Jong-Fast, host of the Fast Politics podcast, laughed and said, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d She also pointed to the common fate of such books: bulk sales to political groups rather than bookstore crowds. \u201cThe DeSantis book is something the Heritage Foundation gives people at a lunch, and then goes on a shelf. This is book that is swag. When the Kochs have their big shindig with donors, it\u2019ll be given away. Of course, that means publishers at least know it will earn out the advance.\u201d In sales terms, Pence has an advantage. His campaign book, So Help Me God, is also in large part a Trump book. Pence has refused to testify to the House January 6 committee but on the page he provides detailed if partial testimony, written from the rooms where it happened. The result was a New York Times bestseller. Jong-Fast said: \u201cThe reason to read his book is because he\u2019s such a liar. I think if you went through with a fine-tooth comb, you could find a lot of inconsistencies. But \u2026 at least Pence is charismatic. The irony is he\u2019s probably more charismatic than Ron DeSantis.\u201d It is possible to write a good campaign book. Barack Obama wrote two. Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance was published in 1995, as he set out for the Illinois senate. The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, came two years before the presidential run of 2008. \u201cAnd he probably read them,\u201d Jong-Fast said. \u201cAnd also he knows good writing. So many people don\u2019t. The constant problem with conservatives is that you\u2019ve alienated most of the writers. Remember, Trumpworld didn\u2019t have any intellectuals because they couldn\u2019t find any. The thought leader was Newt Gingrich.\u201d Asked what Guardian readers might glean from the new campaign books, and from DeSantis in particular, Dallek said: \u201cIf you know nothing or little about him, you could probably learn about the biggest political fights he\u2019s had, you could get a sense of the soundbites he likes to use, you know, his war against so-called woke culture. Probably some sense of a why he thinks Florida is the greatest place on Earth, some of the attacks he\u2019s going to use against Joe Biden, if he were to run. \u201cBut it will not be the most informative place to go if you want to learn about Ron DeSantis. There are many other places, including profiles in the Guardian, that would probably be much more fruitful.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-18T14:47:58Z",
            "content": "Tunisia has been plunged into political uncertainty after it recorded the lowest electoral turnout in its recent history following President Kais Saied\u2019s suspension of parliament and subsequent redrawing of the country\u2019s political map. Its main opposition alliance called on Saied to \u201cleave immediately\u201d as voters overwhelmingly snubbed the the legislative election in what officials at the country\u2019s Instance Sup\u00e9rieure Ind\u00e9pendante pour les \u00c9lections (ISIE) said was a participation rate of 8.8%. Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, president of Tunisia\u2019s \u201cSalvation Front\u201d alliance, which boycotted the vote and has accused Saied of a coup against Tunisia\u2019s democracy said the president had \u201clost all legal legitimacy\u201d. An abstention rate of more than 91% \u201cshows that very, very few Tunisians support Kais Saied\u2019s approach\u201d, Chebbi told Agence France-Presse. Since suspending parliament in July of last year, Saied has introduced a new constitution, greatly reducing the prominence of the country\u2019s political parties, who he characterised as enemies of the people. He reserved particular ire for the Ennahda movement, part of the opposition alliance, which has dominated the political scene since the country first led the wave of Arab Spring protests against autocracy in 2011. In the place of traditional parties, on whom Saied has placed much of the blame for the withering economy and ingrained unemployment, the president has encouraged individuals to run in the election on programmes intended to serve their immediate community. The result, 1,055 self-funded candidates competing for 161 seats, led to a unique electoral contest, with many voters unsure of who was running and a number of constituencies only featuring a single candidate on the ballot. \u201cI came out to support a friend from the neighbourhood,\u201d 19-year-old Omar said of his vote for the one candidate competing at the busy inner Tunis district around Rue de Marseille. \u201cPresident Saied is bringing change to the country and I\u2019ll always support that,\u201d he told a translator. With many political parties absent, the buildup to the vote was been remarkably low-key, with some voters not even aware that an election was taking place. \u201cI don\u2019t have any hope,\u201d said dentist Lamia Kamoun, explaining that she hadn\u2019t decided whether to vote. \u201cI had hope in the country, not now \u2026 Things have got worse.\u201d By about 1pm on Saturday, two polling stations in the working-class district of Kabaria, near Tunis, had only recorded about 100 votes each, out of a possible 1,800 registered voters across both centres. One ISIE official there said that they had no intention of voting in an election they regarded as holding no significance. \u201cThis is just my job,\u201d they said, gesturing around the empty schoolyard. Closer to the city centre, near the city\u2019s historic medina quarter, one polling station had only recorded about 40 voters out of a possible 900. Speaking from the booths, one official explained that the vote didn\u2019t really stand comparison with previous elections, as it was a unique contest. ISIE president, Farouk Bouasker, appeared to channel the rhetoric of Saied, who has made great play of conspiracies, attributing the low turnout to \u201cthe absence of corrupt political money\u201d. Initial results should be announced on Monday, with the final results not expected until January. The new body is not expected to sit before March, after tied or close contests are rerun. Opposition groups have previously attacked Saied\u2019s political programme, they had not before said he should quit office. \u201cWhat happened today is an earthquake,\u201d Chebbi said. \u201cFrom this moment we consider Saied an illegitimate president and demand he resign after this fiasco,\u201d he said. He added there should be a short transitional period under a judge followed by presidential elections and a national dialogue. Max Gallien, from the Institute of Development Studies, said that Tunisia was \u201con track to deliver the lowest turnout of any election in modern global history, with half the participation of the previous record holders (Haiti 2015 at 18%, Afghanistan 2019 with 19%).\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-08T15:57:46Z",
            "content": "The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, was given a significant boost as his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) won a landslide victory in his home state of Gujarat, a sign of the party\u2019s enduring popularity before a general election due in 2024. Gujarat has long been a stronghold of the Hindu nationalist BJP, which has won seven consecutive elections there since 1995, but Thursday\u2019s results were the BJP\u2019s biggest electoral success in the state on record. It looks on course to win a record 156 seats out of 182, giving it an 80% majority, the highest achieved by any party in the state\u2019s history. The BJP pulled out all the stops in election campaigning, and in recent weeks Modi held more than 30 rallies to bolster support. Amit Shah, the home minister who is also from Gujarat and is Modi\u2019s closest ally, appeared at several campaign roadshows. The opposition National Congress party, once India\u2019s dominant political force, lost more than 60 seats as it continues to flounder nationally. The relatively new Aam Aadmi party, which controls Delhi and Punjab, fought hard to build up a presence in Gujarat and secured four seats in the face of the powerful BJP political machinery. The state\u2019s BJP chief minister, Bhupendra Patel, said of the result: \u201cThis is a victory of the unwavering faith of people of Gujarat in BJP\u2019s good governance.\u201d However, the BJP was also dealt a blow as it lost state elections held in the small northern state of Himachal Pradesh on Monday. The state is known for swinging back and forth between parties every election \u2013 it has not re-elected an incumbent government for 30 years \u2013 and this time it was handed back to Congress, in a silver lining for the embattled party. The Gujarat results are an important victory for Modi, who became prime minister in 2014 and has his sights set on winning a third term in 2024. Modi is extremely popular in his home state, where he was chief minister for 13 years and is still celebrated by many for bringing in business and raising prosperity. Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist agenda has also proved popular among majority Hindu voters, despite criticism that it is causing religious polarisation and a steep increase in communal violence, particularly targeting the Muslim minority. In April, the homes of several Muslim families in Gujarat were demolished by bulldozers on instruction of the state, one of hundreds of demolitions that Muslim families and activists across India have been subjected to. The BJP played on the divisions between Hindus and Muslims as part of its election strategy. \u201cThis was certainly a historic victory for the BJP,\u201d said Rahul Verma, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, a Delhi thinktank. \u201cThey are, in all senses, the dominant party with very robust organisational machinery on the ground presided over by a charismatic leader at the top. The connect that Modi continues to have with his home state is phenomenal.\u201d However, while concerns over inflation, unemployment and the government\u2019s failures during the Covid pandemic have done little to dent overall support for Modi in his home state, Verma said the BJP\u2019s strident victory in Gujarat was also due to the local opposition Congress party being in disarray and the vote being fragmented by the entry of AAP into the fray. Verma said there were signs from Gujarat that younger voters, who are more affected by the economic issues and a lack of jobs for graduates, were turning away from the BJP, having previously made up a solid part of the BJP\u2019s base. \u201cIt seems that the younger generation is not voting for the BJP in the same proportion as the older generation, and the younger voters are a bit shy and turning away because of the economic concerns,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, even after the loss of Himachal Pradesh and a recent defeat in local elections in Delhi, Verma said that nationally the BJP remained in a \u201cformidable position\u201d. \u201cEven if at state level the BJP faces some issues going forward, when Modi is on the ticket, given his level of popularity, he pulls the BJP up nationally,\u201d Verma said."

            "date": "2022-12-05T21:36:05Z",
            "content": "Rudy Giuliani, who served as Donald Trump\u2019s hard-charging attorney during failed legal efforts to overturn his presidential election defeat, was accused of \u201cweaponizing\u201d his law license during a turbulent first hearing of a disciplinary panel in Washington DC mulling ethics charges against him. The former New York mayor became argumentative on Monday as Hamilton Fox, of the DC disciplinary counsel\u2019s office, suggested Giuliani had insulted the US constitution with a series of \u201cfrivolous\u201d and ultimately futile lawsuits on the former president\u2019s behalf. Giuliani is facing charges of violating attorney conduct rules in what is expected to be a two-week hearing before the Washington DC board of professional responsibility. It is seen as an important first case that could lead to further steps against Trump\u2019s team of election-result denying lawyers. \u201cA constitutional democracy like ours does not work unless the loser honors the decision of the voters,\u201d Fox said, referring to a blitz of post-election litigation that Trump tapped Giuliani to lead after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. In at least one state, Fox said, Giuliani appeared personally, having put together the band of lawyers at short notice to try to keep the outgoing president in office. \u201cMr Giuliani was responsible for filing a frivolous action asking a court in Pennsylvania to deny millions of people the right to vote,\u201d Fox said. The Pennsylvania lawsuit led to a bizarre and much mocked press conference that Giuliani hosted at the Four Seasons Landscaping company in Philadelphia. The venue, next to a sex shop, was close to the glitzy Four Seasons hotel that many assumed Giuliani had intended to book. Giuliani grew visibly angry and evasive during his testimony on Monday, leading to rebukes from board chair, Robert Bernius. He responded \u201cnot that day\u201d to a question whether he had co-authored the Pennsylvania lawsuit. \u201cI\u2019m asking you what time it is, and you\u2019re telling me how to make a watch,\u201d Fox said. The exchange prompted an intervention from Bernius, who reminded Giuliani that his years of legal experience would make him aware he was required to answer questions honestly as a witness. Giuliani was charged in June with ethical misconduct, and lost his license to practice law in Washington DC, one year after his New York license was suspended as a state appeals court found he made \u201cdemonstrably false and misleading\u201d statements that widespread voter fraud undermined the election. Giuliani has not been charged with any criminal misconduct in relation to election lawsuits. He also learned last month that he would not face charges after a federal investigation into his lobbying activities on Trump\u2019s behalf in Ukraine. The FBI raided Giuliani\u2019s New York apartment and office in May 2021, seizing multiple electronic devices. During Monday\u2019s first session, Giuliani said: \u201cI believe that I\u2019ve been persecuted for three or four years, including false charges brought against me by the federal government,\u201d he said. On the Pennsylvania lawsuit, Fox said that Giuliani wanted a federal judge to throw out almost 700,000 mail-in ballots, and had suggested that 7m ballots could ultimately be invalidated. But he noted no specific allegation of fraud was presented to that court, nor any proof offered that it had occurred. The lawsuit failed in district court, and an appeals court refused to hear a revised complaint."

            "date": "2022-12-14T06:59:58Z",
            "content": "The Victorian Greens and Legalise Cannabis will typically share the balance of power in the upper house, after the state\u2019s electoral commission finalised the election results on Wednesday. The Greens quadrupled their representation in the upper house, with Labor losing three seats to hold 15, meaning it must win over at least six of the 11 crossbench MPs to pass legislation without the support of the opposition. The state\u2019s Greens leader, Samantha Ratnam \u2013 who was elected in the Northern Metropolitan region \u2013 said the party would work \u201ccooperatively\u201d with the Labor government to achieve \u201cprogressive reform\u201d. \u201cWe went into this election with a mission to be in a position to push this Labor government to go further and faster on climate action, housing affordability, strengthening integrity and more,\u201d she said. The Andrews government has surpassed its 2018 Danslide election result following the 26 November vote, with Labor\u2019s lower house tally now 56 out of 88 seats \u2013 one more than the 55 it won at the previous election. But Labor will need to negotiate with the upper house to pass legislation. Election analyst Ben Raue said the Greens and Legalise Cannabis would be the \u201ceasiest pathway to a majority\u201d for the Labor government. \u201cThey\u2019ll have other options, but they are not easy options,\u201d he said. Without the support of the Greens, the Andrews government would need the support of all but one of the crossbench MPs to pass legislation. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Ratnam \u2013 who was previously the party\u2019s only upper house MP \u2013 will be joined by Aiv Puglielli in the North-Eastern Metropolitan region, Katherine Copsey in the Southern Metropolitan region and Sarah Mansfield in the Western Victoria region \u2013 the party\u2019s first regional seat. Legalise Cannabis will be represented by two MPs as it enters the Victorian parliament for the first time. The minor party has vowed to push for cannabis decriminalisation despite the premier, Daniel Andrews, refusing to budge on the issue. Alongside the progressive parties, the upper house will also include One Nation\u2019s first Victorian MP, Rikkie-Lee Tyrrell. Incumbent MPs \u2013 the Liberal Democrats\u2019 David Limbrick and Shooters, Fishers and Farmers MP Jeff Bourman \u2013 were both re-elected for the South-Eastern Metropolitan and Eastern Victoria regions respectively. The Coalition won an extra three upper house seats, boosting its representation to 14, including Moira Deeming and Renee Heath. Animal Justice\u2019s Georgie Purcell was elected to the Northern Metropolitan region, while former Labor MP and powerbroker Adem Soumyurek secured the final spot in the Northern Metropolitan region for the conservative Democratic Labour party, ousting Reason MP Fiona Patten. The Animal Justice party enacted a sting against the state\u2019s so-called preference whisperer Glenn Druery by gaining the support of other parties working with him \u2013 only to direct its own preferences to others at the last minute. Druery described the stint as the \u201cmost elaborate sting in minor party history\u201d. Victoria\u2019s Legislative Council is the only jurisdiction in Australia still using a particular type of group voting system that allows parties to allocate voters\u2019 preferences when they choose just one party above the line on the ballot paper. In 2018 Druery helped eight of the 11 crossbenchers get elected by directing their preferences to one another. Druery has helped to direct preferences to just three of the state\u2019s 11 crossbench MPs \u2013 Bourman, Somyurek and Limbrick."

            "date": "2022-12-02T14:00:18Z",
            "content": "There is a bias all journalists share. It is baked into the profession, inseparable from craft skills, such as news sense. It is not ideological or party political. Rather, it skews the judgment towards whatever interpretation of the evidence makes for the best, most exciting story. This, surely, is one of the reasons that so much of the media reporting of the Victorian election campaign was off the mark \u2013 particularly in the last week, when multiple outlets were predicting a late swing to the Coalition and against Labor. Now the results are in, and while there has been a slight shuffle in the deck of Victoria\u2019s electorates, the main message is that Victoria has not changed much since 2018, when Labor won a landslide victory and the Liberal party was humiliated. That\u2019s despite the trauma of lockdowns, the government involvement in several Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission inquiries and the rising levels of debt. But \u201cnothing changes\u201d does not a headline make. So, while there was a lot of good reporting during the election \u2013 important investigative stories, close grained seat by seat reporting and courageous experiments such as The Age\u2019s citizens agenda \u2013 we also saw considerable coverage that was simply wrong, and oddly disassociated from what reporters on the ground were hearing and seeing. The media were not the only ones to blame. The Liberal party, too, ran a campaign that rested on false assumptions, although the facts were reasonably clear. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The first is the myth of premier Daniel Andrews\u2019 unpopularity \u2013 despite the fact that he has had consistently high popularity ratings. One of the main messages coming from the Liberals was that voting for them was the only way to get rid of him. Yet the evidence and the public opinion polls have consistently suggested that Andrews has in fact united the majority of Victorians, not only through the traumas of the Covid pandemic but also in support of his ambitious infrastructure projects, and their remodelling of Australia\u2019s fastest growing city. You wouldn\u2019t want to overstate his unifying effect, given the primary vote was down \u2013 37.1% compared to 42.9% in 2018 \u2013 but the lost votes went not to the Liberal party but to independents and minor parties. The preferences returned to Labor. This was hardly a vote for change. True, Labor suffered big swings in the outer suburbs \u2013 a reflection, I suspect, of anger about lack of services and general neglect rather than as many in the media suggested, anger over pandemic management. We saw the same factors at play in the country, where the National party retained its seats and won back others from independents who were seen as too close to the government. But as for \u201ctoxic Dan\u201d as one headline put it, who was supposedly a drag on the Labor vote, the polls have never showed that he was on the nose, nor that voters were waiting for him with that culturally bereft cliche of political reporting, the baseball bat. And yet much of the media and political class had trouble believing that it was so. Once a narrative takes hold, it is hard to shift. So in what way is Victoria different? What are we missing, and what is the Liberal party apparently missing? We can look to history and in particular the last three elections for evidence. Victorians largely support immigration and reject the politics of race, which Matthew Guy tried to use so disastrously in 2018 with his African gangs law and order campaign. Second, more than in other states, Victorians expect their governments to be active, to step up to solve social problems. Henry Bolte and Jeff Kennett were active Liberal premiers. Daniel Andrews is an activist from Labor. So Victorians largely like the idea of the Suburban Rail Loop. Polls have consistently shown this to be the case. Melburnians have largely signed on to the Andrews view that the value it will deliver will put the bean counters and the naysayers on the wrong side of history. The debt it racks up is good debt, he says, because it is an investment. Victorians mostly adopt the idea of the social contract. They are more likely to believe in collective effort. During the Covid lockdowns, in his daily media conference the premier spoke largely over the heads of hectoring reporters and made a deal with the public. Tolerate restrictions until most of us are vaccinated, and then different approaches will be taken. He has stuck to that deal \u2013 arguably too rigidly, given he has continued to wind back public health measures even as Covid continues to kill and injure. But it has added to his image as someone who gets things done, and does what he says he will do. The surveys tell us that Victorians are concerned about political integrity. So why didn\u2019t the Ibac investigations count against Andrews? Perhaps the voters saw a distinction, which the media has largely failed to draw, between being questioned by Ibac and being directly implicated in allegations of corruption. Or perhaps they just believe that the Liberal party is no better. So this is the state of Victoria \u2013 wellspring of Australia\u2019s two main political parties, yet increasingly misunderstood by one of them, and sections of the media. At least since John Howard was prime minister, the Liberal party has drifted away from its Victorian small-l liberal roots and towards New South Wales, and the right. That means Labor has become the natural party of government in Victoria \u2013 in office for three-quarters of the last four decades. I have painted a pretty picture for progressives, but there are dangers in all this. Any long-term government becomes encrusted with networks of influence and cronyism. It is hard for a successful government to continually refresh itself. Andrews is a powerful, hard-headed leader who runs a centralised and controlling style of government. Increasingly, we can expect the pathologies of the Labor party to be writ large on the culture of the state. Given the state of the Liberal party, another Labor win in 2026 seems more than likely \u2013 whether or not Andrews is still leader. If that happens, by 2030 most Victorians under the age of 40 won\u2019t have much memory of any other colour of government. Power relationships and networks of influence will have hardened. The arteries will grow sclerotic. For this reason, we have to hope that the Liberal party is able to reconnect with liberalism. Government is improved when oppositions are strong \u2013 when they present real alternative governments, including a narrative and a vision, rather than a grab bag of promises. This time around the Liberal campaign was better than in 2018. It neutralised climate change as an issue by committing to real action \u2013 and thus held off further defeats by teal candidates. But it devised no compelling narrative of what kind of government it would be, given the chance. Instead, the main messages were disconnected from the audience. Victoria needs political parties \u2013 and a media \u2013 that speaks to its best instincts. Otherwise, in a decade\u2019s time, we might not be living in such a pretty place after all.

            "content": "TikTok\u2019s recommendation algorithm pushes self-harm and eating disorder content to teenagers within minutes of them expressing interest in the topics, research suggests. The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) found that the video-sharing site will promote content including dangerously restrictive diets, pro-self-harm content and content romanticising suicide to users who show a preference for the material, even if they are registered as under-18s. For its study the campaign group set up accounts in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, registered with ages of 13, the minimum age for joining the service. It created \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d accounts, the latter containing the term \u201closeweight\u201d in their usernames, which CCDH said reflected research showing that social media users who seek out eating disorder content often choose usernames containing related language. The accounts \u201cpaused briefly\u201d on videos about body image, eating disorders and mental health, and also liked them. This took place over a 30-minute initial period when the accounts launched, in an attempt to capture the effectiveness of TikTok\u2019s algorithm that recommends content to users. On \u201cstandard\u201d accounts, content about suicide followed within nearly three minutes and eating disorder material was shown within eight minutes. \u201cThe results are every parent\u2019s nightmare,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, CCDH\u2019s chief executive. \u201cYoung people\u2019s feeds are bombarded with harmful, harrowing content that can have a significant cumulative impact on their understanding of the world around them, and their physical and mental health.\u201d The group said the majority of mental health videos presented to its standard accounts via the For You feed \u2013 the main way TikTok users experience the app \u2013 consisted of users sharing their anxieties and insecurities. Body image content was more harmful, the report said, with accounts registered for 13-year-olds being shown videos advertising weight loss drinks and \u201ctummy-tuck\u201d surgery. One animation that appeared in front of the standard accounts carried a piece of audio stating \u201cI\u2019ve been starving myself for you\u201d and had more than 100,000 likes. The report said the accounts were shown self-harm or eating disorder videos every 206 seconds. The researchers found that videos relating to body image, mental health and eating disorders were shown to \u201cvulnerable\u201d accounts three times more than to standard accounts. The vulnerable accounts received 12 times as many recommendations for self-harm and suicide-related videos as the standard accounts, the report said. The recommended content was more extreme for the vulnerable accounts, including methods of self-harm and young people discussing plans to kill themselves. CCDH said a mental health or body image-related video was shown every 27 seconds, although the content was dominated by mental health videos, which CCDH defined as videos about anxieties, insecurities and mental health conditions, excluding eating disorders, self-harm and suicide. The group said its research did not differentiate between content with a positive intent \u2013 such as content discovering recovery \u2013 or negative content. A spokesperson for TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese firm ByteDance and has more than 1 billion users worldwide, said the CCDH study did not reflect the experience or viewing habits of real-life users of the app. \u201cWe regularly consult with health experts, remove violations of our policies and provide access to supportive resources for anyone in need,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re mindful that triggering content is unique to each individual and remain focused on fostering a safe and comfortable space for everyone, including people who choose to share their recovery journeys or educate others on these important topics.\u201d TikTok\u2019s guidelines ban content that promotes behaviour that could lead to suicide and self-harm, as well as material that promotes unhealthy eating behaviours or habits. The UK\u2019s online safety bill proposes requiring social networks to take action against so-called \u201clegal but harmful\u201d content being shown to children. A DCMS spokesperson said \u201cWe are putting a stop to unregulated social media causing harm to our children. Under the Online Safety Bill, tech platforms will need to prevent under-18s from being exposed to illegal content assisting suicide and protect them from other harmful or age-inappropriate material, including the promotion of self-harm and eating disorders, or face huge fines.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

            "date": "2022-12-03T18:18:52Z",
            "content": "And that\u2019s Strictly over for another week \u2013 get ready for a MASSIVE SEMI next SUNDAY, when our four remaining couples will be dancing TWO DANCES; kick-off is at 7.15pm, so please join me then. Thank you for joining in, and enjoy your FREE SATURDAY next weekend - I\u2019m taking the daughter ice skating. Have a great week! Friends for life DRINK! In your family forever DRINK! Like Ellie and Johannes last week, this feel like a couple who might actually be mates. They\u2019ve been amazing to watch. They take to the floor to dance their final dance, to \u2018So Long, Farewell\u2019 from The Sound of Music. CUTE. Craig and Motsi both save Molly and Carlos, but (PLOT TWIST) Anton saves Kym and Graziano. So it\u2019s all down to Shirley, who saves\u2026Molly and Carlos. Which means KYM AND GRAZIANO are leaving Strictly. It\u2019s a real shame \u2013 Kym was a fabulous dancer, but last night Molly and Carlos were better. So hard to lose anyone at this stage, particularly as they\u2019re all so well-matched, dance-wise. Molly and Carlos are up first \u2013 I loved this Charleston last night, and Molly is bringing the same energy second time round. Part of me would love her to be in the Final, after weathering so many dance-offs. But I also don\u2019t want to hoof out any of the others. Kym and Graziano are up next \u2013 I really enjoyed this dance last night, even though the judges weren\u2019t that fussed. Maybe it\u2019s because I spent a large part of the early 80s playing \u2018Fame\u2019 and dreaming of a career in the performing arts, before discovering I can\u2019t sing OR dance. Nice work Kym \u2013 if you\u2019re leaving us tonight, it\u2019s on a high. Who\u2019s joining Molly and Carlos in the dance off? Fleur and Vito are safe, along with Hamza and Jowita. Which means KYM AND GRAZIANO in the dance off. Oof, that\u2019s a tough one. But based on last night\u2019s dances, I think Molly definitely has the edge. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of a medley from The Cher Show. I didn\u2019t even know there WAS a Cher Musical. When did that happen? How have I missed it? There are three Chers, all wearing really uncomfortable-looking outfits featuring sparkly merkins of varying lengths. The sound quality is dreadful, like they\u2019re singing at the bottom of a well. Cher may have Found Someone, but it definitely isn\u2019t a sound engineer. I think Tess\u2019s white pantsuit is my fave Tess outfit of the season, and I\u2019m also here for Claudia\u2019s zebra print boots. Good choices all round. Next week Will is doing his Couple\u2019s Choice to a medley of 90s indie classics. I feel baggy pants and a bucket hat coming on. So which two couples are the first to go through to next week\u2019s semi-final? For the first time this season, I really don\u2019t mind which two dances I have to watch again. They were all fabulous. Helen and Gorka are safe, along with Will and Nancy. First couple in the dance-off: MOLLY AND CARLOS. Poor Molly. She\u2019s spent so much time in that bottom two she\u2019s started leaving a toothbrush by the dance-off sink. I feel for her, she did a great job last night. Last night on Strictly: my favourite show of the series so far. Everyone stepped it up a notch, the music was brilliant and dance appropriate (mostly - not sure it entirely did Hamza any favours), and we were all done and dusted in barely more than an hour. So basically the stuff of liveblogger dreams. Highlights: Helen\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice. I know I bitch about the whole concept being fired into the sun, but that dance will go down in the Strictly Hall of Fame, and could take Helen all the way to the glitterball. Also Will\u2019s dreamy Foxtrot, Molly\u2019s fun Charleston, Kym\u2019s pants, Hamza\u2019s subtle Samba, Fleur showing us what a HUGE musical theatre star she\u2019s going to be Gorka in a corset/guyliner, Johannes as a Pink Lady. Loved every minute. Lowlights: Tess\u2019s banana, Claudia\u2019s pyjamas. Coming down the stairs. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH! Tess dressed as a Greek goddess, Claudia in a black vest. Absolutely no issue with either. And we\u2019re off! Tonight\u2019s opening pro dance is a number from Guys and Dolls, which I\u2019ve never seen and don\u2019t know the plot of, so I can\u2019t get excited about it. But there are many chairs, so feel free to belatedly drink. The very opposite of the casual weather happening right now. Didn\u2019t catch the name, but he\u2019s dressed like a recruitment consultant. The football has ruined everything. Oh wow, apparently it was Darren Bett. Or as I refer to him, Darren Better In Plaid. Evening all, and welcome back for this week\u2019s quarter final results! Last night was a FABULOUS Musicals Special, but if we\u2019re ever going to make it to Christmas we need to wave goodbye to another couple. I don\u2019t make the rules, but if I did I\u2019d take all six through because they\u2019re all brilliant. Don\u2019t forget that next week\u2019s massive semi is on SUNDAY at 7.15pm, when our remaining five couples will be doing TWO DANCES. Usually this means an under-rehearsed hot mess, but because of scheduling shenanigans they\u2019ve got an extra day. So that\u2019s a bonus. Kick off tonight is at 5.40pm \u2013 join me then! Strictly results? On a Saturday afternoon? In this economy? Apparently so. On the upside, we can all go out and party afterwards \u2013 I\u2019m planning to go to Bath for a drink or two, because for the first time in over a decade, I CAN. Thank you for being my fabulous chorus line this evening \u2013 you are all awesome. See you tomorrow, and enjoy the rest of your Friday! That\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s dancing \u2013 how fabulous was that? It\u2019s time to vote for who you\u2019d like to see in next week\u2019s semi-final. Will and Helen are at the top of the leaderboard, and right now it\u2019s Hamza and Kym in the dance-off danger zone. I feel like the public will probably save Hamza, so maybe Kym and Molly for the dance-off? Nobody deserves to be there \u2013 they were all great tonight. Scores: 9,10,9,10 \u2013 a total of 38 for Fleur and Vito. Anton thought it was marvellous, and Craig agrees \u2013 it had class, style and sophistication. Motsi thought it was the magic at the end of a great show. Shirley loved everything about it \u2013 Fleur was a star today. Fleur looks divine, I love this look. This Quickstep takes a while to get going, but it has lovely style and elegance. Some cute Charleston sections too \u2013 Fleur could absolutely smash it as a musical theatre star, and she looks very much in her element. FABULOUS. This week they\u2019re dancing the Quickstep to \u2018I Got Rhythm\u2019 from An American In Paris. I mean technically this was a Gershwin orchestral piece first, then a movie, then a stage musical. But honestly I\u2019m too exhausted to CLIMB this hill tonight, let alone die on it. Incidentally, the music in this VT is Sweden\u2019s entry for Eurovision 2020, which never actually happened. I probably need to get out more. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Helen and Gorka. Shirley thought it was off the charts, nothing like the timid Helen we saw in Week 1. Anton makes lots of vowel noises \u2013 it makes him ecstatic to see Helen dance. Craig wanted Helen to use her centre more, and the crowd are having none of it so Gorka sticks his butt in his face. Gorka is quite thirsty these days, isn\u2019t he? Motsi thought it was more Meine Dame than Mein Herr \u2013 it was ALL about Helen. Bob Fosse DRINK. Anyone else rooting for Helen right now? Gorka in a corset is very much a yes from me, and I\u2019m not sure any of us recognise this Helen compared to the version we saw in Week 1. It\u2019s sexy and sassy and PACKED with attitude, and Helen is very much the star of her own show. Totally fabulous in every possible way. This week they\u2019re dancing Couple\u2019s Choice to \u2018Mein Herr\u2019 from Cabaret. Sally Bowles is some big shoes to fill, and this is going to require every ounce of Helen\u2019s new-found confidence and power. Bonus drink if any of the judges say \u2018Bob Fosse\u2019. Scores: 9,10,10,10. What\u2019s Craig saving his ten for? Only Fleur and Helen left! Motsi absolutely loved that, she felt a flush of emotion going up AND down. Shirley has felt Will\u2019s competitive spirit all the way through, but tonight it came from the soul. Anton thought it was a complete performance \u2013 it was dramatically strong and beautifully poignant. Craig thought it was thoroughly gorgeous, he loved loved loved it. Tens all round? COME ON. Well, this is quite lovely. Will is emoting beautifully, even though he\u2019s dressed like a gas fitter. Some nice footwork (spotted a heel turn there) and a great connection between these two. GORGEOUS storytelling. Maybe I\u2019m a bit giddy because it\u2019s Friday, but I\u2019m loving ALL the dances this evening. This week they\u2019re dancing the Foxtrot to \u2018Sun And Moon\u2019 from Miss Saigon. It\u2019s such a beautiful song, and in an evening of upbeat mega-jazz hands, this could really stand out as a moment of quiet, classy elegance. In training, Will\u2019s talking about emotion. BONUS DRINK. Scores: 8,9,9,8 \u2013 a total of 34 for Kym and Graziano. Craig thought it was amazing \u2013 great straight leg and hip action, she did brilliantly. Motsi thought it had all the cheekiness and energy that a Cha Cha should have, Kym was shining all the way through. Shirley was impressed with how much Kym moved her body, and the solo bit was incredible. Anton wanted Kym to have her weight a bit more forward, but the performance and timing were immaculate. Can we all just take a moment to celebrate Kym absolutely smashing it for the sexy grandmas everywhere. She looks INCREDIBLE, and this Cha Cha is probably my favourite of the series. Lovely straight leg action, fabulous PE pants. I want to go out dancing with these two. This week they\u2019re dancing the Cha Cha to \u2018Fame\u2019 from the musical of the same name. Feels very poignant in the week that Irene Cara passed away, and I\u2019m sure this is going to be a fitting Strictly tribute. Headbands and legwarmers at the ready. Scores: 9,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Hamza and Jowita. Anton was a bit overwhelmed by that \u2013 it had great fluidity and bounce. Hamza\u2019s body was rippling and Anton was impressed. Craig agrees \u2013 Hamza had fantastic hip action but there was a very minor issue with his knees. Motsi loved the body action, it was really great. Shirley thought Hamza portrayed the music really well, it was beautifully delivered, and she could see the improvement in his turned-in feet. This is a really interesting Samba, with really balletic qualities \u2013 it\u2019s lost some of the Latin flavour and the pacing makes it a bit stiff in places, but it\u2019s very much still a Samba. Still issues with Hamza\u2019s turned-in feet but you can\u2019t fault his rhythm. Lovely stuff. This week they\u2019re doing the Samba to \u2018They Live In You\u2019 from The Lion King, our second Lion King Samba of the season. What do you mean you\u2019ve blocked the memory of Richie and Gio as Timon and Pumbaa from your mind? That one ended quite badly for Richie, but I already know this going to make me cry. In a good way. Scores: 9,10,10,9 \u2013 a total of 38 for Molly and Carlos. The screaming is LOUD. Shirley was NOT expecting that \u2013 it had clarity and Molly looked like she was having a ball. I just said that! Anton thought Molly really upped her game, but Craig had an issue with Molly\u2019s elbow. It was, however, the first time he\u2019s seen her with full-on power and energy. Motsi thought Molly was shining \u2013 THAT\u2019S the way we start the show. I can\u2019t stop looking at Tess\u2019s dress. Is it a recycled raincoat, or maybe she\u2019s a human Marigold? Molly has all the right characterisation for this dance and her swivel is lovely, but her foot placement can look a bit untidy. Lots of fab Charleston content though, and she looks like she\u2019s having a ball. Enjoyed that very much \u2013 what a fabulous start. This week they\u2019re dancing the Charleston to \u2018Hot Honey Rag\u2019 from Chicago. Georgia and Giovanni did a brilliant Charleston to this back in 2015 \u2013 can Molly and Carlos bring the same energy? Out come the stars! Would kill for Kym\u2019s outfit and Fleur\u2019s victory roll. Also Gorka in guyliner *swoons* Tess as one of those plastic bananas you keep your banana in, Claudia in foil gift wrap. Grim. Out come the judges! LOVE Motsi\u2019s pink frock, and Shirley\u2019s gold tablecloth is stunning. As it\u2019s a feem week, we get a bonus opening pro dance. According to my notes, tonight\u2019s show \u2018opens with a dance extravaganza performed by our professional dancers alongside West End legends Marisha Wallace, Ivano Turco and Trevor Dion Nicholas.\u2019 I\u2019m not big on musical theatre, so forgive me in advance if I have no idea what\u2019s going on in this medley. But I do know from watching It Takes Two earlier that it was choreographed by much-missed Strictly goddess Oti Mabuse. Johannes as a Pink Lady is giving me LIFE. OK so There\u2019s Something About Jamie, Grease, Rent, Six, Hamilton, Clueless (maybe?), Dreamgirls, and one I don\u2019t know. If you\u2019d like a bonus \u2018have a drink for every musical Heidi hasn\u2019t seen in a theatre\u2019, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s seven drinks. Grease is the only one I\u2019ve seen. And we\u2019re off! It\u2019s the quarter-final, and it\u2019s MUSICALS WEEK, hence the Greatest Showman lip-synching alongside all the slo-mo dancing and soundbites. We\u2019re nearly there, folks. Take a sip of warm interval wine (place your order at the bar now) for any occurrence of the following: Hats Pyrotechnics Wigs Chairs Theatrical metaphors The Grand Final is only two weeks away, and right now it\u2019s really hard to call exactly who is going to be there. Hamza, definitely. Will, probably. But could be any two of the four remaining women. So let\u2019s look at tonight\u2019s dances and see what we can predict. Helen and Gorka have Couple\u2019s Choice tonight that will probably nudge them through to next week. Kim\u2019s doing a Fame-themed Cha-Cha, which is likely going to feel like a quite emotional tribute to the late Irene Cara. Which means I have to put Molly and Fleur in the danger zone, even though I don\u2019t really want to. Can we keep them all? Foxtrotting to the Final \u2013 Hamza and Jowita, Will and Nancy, Helen and Gorka, Kym and Graziano Dodging the dance-off \u2013 Fleur and Vito, Molly and Carlos Just caught the end of It Takes Two, which I NEVER watch, and very much enjoyed the Jersey Boys interlude. One day I\u2019ll have put enough hours into this show to earn my seat on the Friday panel. Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! We\u2019ve made it Week 11, which can only mean three things: It\u2019s Musicals Week! Gird your sparkly loins for jazz hands, pyrotechnics, and a dancefloor stuffed with giant props and superfluous backing dancers. It\u2019s also the quarter finals! When this season started it was still summer, and now heated blankets are all the rage. It\u2019s the shortest show of the series, before we move to TWO DANCES next week. Remember those 140 minute liveblog marathons in the early weeks? 65 minutes tonight. Easy peasy. It\u2019s also FRIDAY, which all feels a bit weird. Bloody football. Curtain up is at 8pm, so gather your favourite snacks/drinks/blankets and settle in for the show! See you in a bit."

            "content": "I\u2019ll be back next Saturday for one final spin around the Strictly dancefloor. The Grand Final is a VERY long show that kicks off at 7.15pm, so bring ample supplies. But the big question is, who\u2019s going to lift the Glitterball on Saturday? Feel free to join in with my annual Twitter poll, or just make your prediction in the comment box. Thank you SO much for joining me on this wonky weekend \u2013 see you next week! Hx Will and Nancy take to the floor for their final dance, to \u2018Don\u2019t You Forget About Me\u2019 by Simple Minds. Already deleted from the Strictly WhatsApp group, I\u2019m afraid. Hey, I don\u2019t make the rules. What happened to the Strictly pro dance this evening? Wasn\u2019t Craig supposed to be doing a turn? I need more information. They both say lovely things about the show and the crew, but notably do NOT thank each other for being amazing or declare themselves to be friends for life. I\u2019m choosing to read plenty into this because we\u2019ve been hearing the same speech for twelve weeks and god knows we need new material. Eek, this is TENSE. Craig and Motsi both save Fleur and Vito but (GASP) Anton saves Will and Nancy because Fleur did a dodgy dismount. So it\u2019s all down to Shirley\u2026who saves (based on the MICRO DETAILS)\u2026FLEUR AND VITO. I\u2019m not sure that decision should have been QUITE that hard, but fair play to the judges for milking that moment until mastitis set in. Fleur and Vito are up first \u2013 I didn\u2019t think this was that great last night, but the judges didn\u2019t agree. So very happy to watch this again \u2013 my opinion hasn\u2019t changed, but would argue that Fleur is the stronger dancer overall. Will and Nancy are up next \u2013 I actually weirdly enjoyed this, but I think the whole PJ &amp; Duncan Let\u2019s Get Ready To Rhumble vibe of it just made me laugh. Might be an age thing? Also can we take a moment to acknowledge what a great street dancer Nancy is? So who\u2019s joining Fleur and Vito in the bottom two? It\u2019s\u2026WILL AND NANCY, which means Helen and Gorka are safely through. So it\u2019s Fleur vs. Will in the dance-off. Fleur scored 39 for her Charleston and Will scored 38 for his Couple\u2019s Choice, so it\u2019s incredibly close. If Shirley gets the deciding vote, she may well decide to even up the male/female balance next week and plump for Will. WHO KNOWS. Let the montages begin! Get used to it, everyone \u2013 there will be SCORES of them next Saturday. I might make Strictly Standing an ongoing game next year, just for fun. Time for some Rylan filler. Apparently It Takes Two with the evicted couple is on straight after this. I won\u2019t be sticking around for that \u2013 it\u2019s a school night and I\u2019ve got to be in Bristol by 0730 tomorrow. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of the lovely Lewis Capaldi singing his latest single Pointless. Dance-wise, it\u2019s Gio and Katya doing some lovely contempo-wafting in their jimjams. So which two couples are going through to next Saturday\u2019s GRAND FINAL? Molly and Carlos are safe (and understandably DELIGHTED), along with Hamza and Jowita. First couple in the bottom two: FLEUR AND VITO. Well, that\u2019s tough for them. If she\u2019s up against Helen, they\u2019re probably out. But if it\u2019s Will, they might be OK. TENSION. If you feel around under Tess\u2019s armpits, you might find 50p and the TV remote. Last night on Strictly: TWO DANCES, most of them quite good considering that\u2019s quite a lot of dances in not very many days and everyone seems quite knackered. Highlights: Cable knit Bez, Tess and Claud in asymmetric fabulousness, Hayley on vocals. Lowlights: Paso overload, wild overscoring, Couple\u2019s Choice twisting Will\u2019s Mellor, man. And we\u2019re off! TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess being throttled by a sofa, Claudia in who the hell knows I couldn\u2019t stop looking AGHAST at Tess. That was a very confusing beginning. Where\u2019s the opening pro dance? Much love to the Eastenders character (not sure who he is) who just threw a packet of fags onto Dot\u2019s coffin. The perfect ending \u2013 enjoyed that very much. Right, who\u2019s for some Strictly? There were Christmas decorations in Albert Square, but the trees at the funeral church are in full autumn colour. This is a whole new level of Eastenders time travel. Lofty\u2019s finally arrived (sans Michelle, sadly), and Kathy has a lovely hat. Mary the punk! She looks amazing. Apparently Lofty is on his way, and Ian Beale is skulking in the bushes. Not sure why. I love that they\u2019re giving Dot the full horse and carriage East End funeral. Colin\u2019s turned up, and Sharon is still there. I\u2019ve just looked up whether Leonard Fenton, who played Dr. Legg, is still with us, but sadly he died earlier this year. Of all the episodes of Eastenders that could have been shown in this pre-Strictly timeslot, this is the only one that could possibly make any sense to a lapsed viewer like me. I\u2019m absolutely delighted. OMG that\u2019s RICKAAAAY. No Bianca though, she\u2019s in Germany and Robbie\u2019s in India. No news on Wellard at this time. Kathy Beale/Mitchell is still there! And I think that\u2019s Brian Conley, which is confusing. I don\u2019t know who this character is, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s Strictly\u2019s James Bye. Am reasonably confident I will only recognise the Eastenders people who have been on Strictly, unless they\u2019re pre-1990. Right, haven\u2019t watched Eastenders in about twenty years, but apparently this is some kind of tribute to Dot Cotton so might give it a watch. Is that Sonia? I really hope she\u2019s going to play her trumpet at Dot\u2019s funeral. Evening all, and welcome back to this week\u2019s Results Show! Bit odd doing this on a Monday, but we\u2019re back to business as usual for the GRAND FINAL on Saturday. How quickly has that come round? Getting to Halloween felt like a very slow and laborious Waltz, but we\u2019ve been Quickstepping ever since. Tonight we lose one final couple \u2013 arguably the worst time to go out other than Week 2. Based on last night\u2019s scores the dance-off SHOULD be Will and either Helen or Fleur, so I guess this is when we find out just how big Will\u2019s fandom is. My heart says all five couples should be in the Grand Final, but then my head points out to my very tired hands that the Grand Final is already nearly three hours long so actually can we get rid of two couples please. A Grand Final with over a quarter of the couples we started with twelve weeks ago is stupid anyway. Tonight\u2019s show kicks off at 8.15pm \u2013 see you then! Thank you SO much for joining in on this chilly Sunday \u2013 I\u2019ll be back tomorrow night (forgoing my Monday DanceFit class, for the love of Strictly) for the Results. Kick off is at 8.15pm \u2013 see you then! Hx \u2026and the voting is open! Who do we reckon is going out tomorrow? Hamza and Jovita are at the top of the leaderboard, and Will and Nancy are at the bottom \u2013 with Helen and Fleur on the same score above him. Will and Fleur for the dance off? You have the power to decide. Let\u2019s have a recap! Some great dancing this evening considering it was TWO DANCES, but also some wild over-scoring. Whoever goes, it\u2019s going to be a FABULOUS final next week. Love that Bez from the Happy Mondays is in the Strictly audience, looking like John Craven in a cable knit sweater. I\u2019ve never felt older, frankly. Scores: 9,10,9,10 \u2013 a total of 38 for Will and Nancy. Anton thought it was brilliant and Will smashed the place up. Craig was nervous it was going to be dad dancing but it went very well. Motsi thought it was a great comeback, and Shirley thought it was a \u2018daddy cool\u2019 dance. OK, NOT what I expected. It\u2019s been a weird night. I never went to the Hacienda in the early 90s because I was a) too square and b) living in Wiltshire. This has Midlife Crisis Dad at a Festival energy but you can\u2019t fault Will\u2019s commitment to authentic Madchester moves. The synchronicity is fabulous, but I fear the judges are going to hate that with the force of a thousand suns. Their second dance is Couple\u2019s Choice to a medley of Stone Roses/Happy Mondays songs, so get ready to put your bucket hat on and swagger like it\u2019s 1990. We\u2019re either going to be mad for it, or wishing we were mashed off our faces. Could go either way. Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Molly and Carlos. Craig cracks me up, he gives even fewer hoots than Motsi. Shirley thought Molly got the temperature exactly right \u2013 one of the best Paso Dobles she seen. Anton didn\u2019t think Molly would be able to pull that off, but she did. Craig agrees \u2013 absolutely fantastic. Motsi just goes with \u2018perfection \u2013 thank you\u2019 \u2013 TENS ALL ROUND? Well, this has ALL the drama, and Molly\u2019s dress is spectacular. If you can earn a place in the Final with pure attitude, Molly is right there. LOVED that. Shirley\u2019s on her feet. As are all of you, right? Their second dance is the Paso Doble to \u2018Survivor\u2019 by 2WEI ft Edda Hayes, which is essentially a haunted cover version of the Destiny\u2019s Child banger. From the Tomb Raider soundtrack, apparently \u2013 is this actually \u2018All The Songs We Didn\u2019t Use In Movie Week\u2019 week? Scores: 9,10,9,9 \u2013 a total of 37 for Hamza and Jowita. Motsi doesn\u2019t give a HOOT anymore. Motsi thought that was definitely enough \u2013 beautiful, soft, pure and authentic. Shirley loved how musical and highly tuned Hamza\u2019s body is, but today he was a bit twisted and there were some footwork errors she has never seen him make. Anton thought it was a joy, but a bit lumpy in places. Craig thought Hamza dances the music rather than the steps \u2013 he loved it. This is as lovely as expected, I\u2019m mostly just watching Hamza\u2019s feet to see if he\u2019s sorted out his pigeon toes. Lovely connection between these two \u2013 a few lumps and bumps but this has to get Hamza through to the final, surely? Was that ever in doubt? Their second dance is the Waltz to \u2018What The World Needs Now\u2019 by Burt Bacharach. I love how we\u2019ve made it to Week 11 and they\u2019re rolling out a Waltz. Love this song, and fully expecting this to be totally dreamy. Scores: 9,10,8,10 \u2013 a total of 37 for Helen and Gorka. Craig wanted more from a few of the details, but otherwise it was amazing. Motsi thought it was intense to watch \u2013 that\u2019s the dance to take her into the Final. Shirley loved the timing and the footwork, but Helen\u2019s frame kept collapsing. Anton felt a frisson \u2013 it had everything he wanted, and he loved the clarity of the dance. Helen looks spectacular in that dress, and she is NOT here to play. This Argentine is wants to be pure filth and Helen\u2019s legwork is gorgeous, but this couple is far too platonic for it to feel sexy, and now it all feels a bit Flowers In The Attic. Probably just me. Their second dance is the Argentine Tango to \u2018Here Comes The Rain Again\u2019 by Eurythmics. An Argentine is a big ask in a two dances week, but it\u2019s a great dance for Helen off the back off her sexy/sassy Couple\u2019s Choice last week. Now or never, right? Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Fleur and Vito. A VERY good night for them. Anton was really impressed \u2013 Fleur is having exactly the night she wants for a semi final. Craig wanted less control, but otherwise it was A-MAY-ZING. Motsi loved how authentic it was, and Fleur gave it everything. Shirley loved how free the performance was \u2013 this kind of dance really suits Fleur. I love Fleur, but that outfit is ghastly, not helped by a pair of 80s plimsolls (or daps, if you\u2019re from the west country). Enjoying the energy of this, but it\u2019s a bit frantic in places, which makes it feel a bit untidy. Fabulous characterisation though. Their second dance is the Charleston to \u2018Tu Vuo\u2019 Fa L\u2019Americano\u2019 by Fiorello. This is a jazzy number, and could also have appeared in Movie Week as it\u2019s on the soundtrack to The Talented Mr Ripley. I have high hopes for Fleur and Vito bringing a whole new level of energy to this dance \u2013 she\u2019s already showed how great she is at characterisation and storytelling. We\u2019re half way through! This show feels VERY long this evening, possibly because it\u2019s Sunday and I\u2019m tired and grumpy. Ready for round two? Scores: 7,9,7,9 \u2013 a total of 32 for Will and Nancy. There were lots of things missing for Shirley \u2013 he had the arrogance, but he didn\u2019t have the oval shape in the arms and he needed to extend the cape more. Anton loved the flamenco section and the way Will partnered Nancy, and his storytelling is very strong \u2013 although it needed to breadth, and he felt like Will was trying too hard. Craig agreed with Shirley \u2013 the capework needed air and the dance lacked flow, not Will\u2019s dance. Motsi believes that Will was fighting for his place \u2013 she could feel the drive and intention, and he was committed. Oh hello, this is right up my Paso street. Will\u2019s caping like he\u2019s trying to put out a chip pan fire, and his footwork is sublime. I\u2019d like even more of a Spanish line, but the flamenco section was fab. Enjoyed that. Their first dance is a Paso Doble to \u2018Uccen\u2019 by Taalbi Brothers. This is proper Spanish Guitar Paso stompy Paso music, so I\u2019m expecting plenty of Spanish line, cape-waving and Flamenco. Scores: 8,9,9,10 \u2013 a total of 36 for Molly and Carlos. Motsi thought it gave quality, class and technical skill \u2013 everything you would love to see, Molly gives. Shirley thought it had inner magic and it was beautiful to watch. Anton thought it was super performance, this style of dancing really suits Molly. Craig thought it was a bit in and out of character \u2013 there were too many stops and that cooled it down emotionally. He was a bit disappointed, even though her hand shaping was exquisite. Molly really is a gorgeous dancer, but she\u2019s been great since Week One and that\u2019s no way to win Strictly, I\u2019m afraid \u2013 the people need a journey. That said, this American Smooth is stunning \u2013 it\u2019s got drama, style and class, and some lovely changes of pace. Loved that. Their first dance is the American Smooth to \u2018Easy On Me\u2019 by Adele. They are TESTING the Dave Arch singers this evening. This is going to be lovely, isn\u2019t it? Scores: 9,10,10,10 \u2013 a total of 39 for Hamza and Jowita. Craig loved the detail and the lifts were crazy spectacular, but Hamza has a lazy left foot swivel. Motsi thought everything was on point \u2013 exceptional. Shirley wasn\u2019t expecting it to have so much movement, and she loved the swivel turns and the timing of the lifts. Anton thought Hamza brought everything to the semi final \u2013 well done. As ever, Hamza\u2019s timing is impeccable and he has lovely energy \u2013 just a joy to watch. His footwork goes a bit wild on occasion but the lifts are great and these two are clearly having a BALL. One of my favourite Charlestons of the series. Their first dance is the Charleston to \u2018Pencil Full Of Lead\u2019 by Paolo Nutini, following in the swivelly footsteps of at least four other Strictly couples, mostly recently Anita and Gleb in 2015. Ooh, remember Gleb? We liked him. I think he does Dancing With The Stars in the US now. Scores: 8,9,9,9 \u2013 a total of 35 for Helen and Gorka. Anton thought it was beautiful \u2013 soft and romantic. Craig thought there was quite a bit of gapping (SEE?), and it was a bit rigid in places, but Helen is a lovely dancer. Motsi thought it was magic, one of those moments that makes Strictly Come Dancing. Shirley thought it was a dreamy performance and their bond really came throught, but it lacked a bit of swing and sway. Well, this is dreamy. Helen looks gorgeous, and I love this partnership \u2013 I feel like there\u2019s a lovely connection between these two, and Gorka really gets Helen. Some gappy bits in this Waltz, but a nice bit of storytelling. Their first dance is the Waltz to \u2018Only One Road\u2019 by C\u00e9line Dion. How have these two not done a Waltz yet? This is arguably one of Celine\u2019s most underrated ballads \u2013 I love it, and am very much hoping the Dave Arch singers are going to do it justice. Scores: 8,9,8,10 \u2013 a total of 35 for Fleur and Vito. Shirley liked the powerful message and she liked the flamenco arms, but she wanted more rounded shape and detail in the footwork. Anton thought it was an exceptional performance \u2013 Fleur\u2019s best dance of the season. Craig thought she lost the footwork in places, but she did provide power and aggression. Motsi loved how Fleur channels her power into the storytelling, she loved it. Does anyone else want to talk about Fleur\u2019s power, and recommend what she should do with it? You do you, babe. Excellent skirt caping to open, and Fleur is giving it ALL the drama. Some nice upper body shaping too, if you can drag your eyes away from Vito for a moment. He does a very good job of making this dance all about Fleur \u2013 enjoyed that very much. Their first dance is the Paso Doble to \u2018The Time Is Now\u2019 by Moloko. I love this song, and it definitely lends itself to a coolly dramatic Paso. Out come the stars! Feels weird that there are only five couples left \u2013 for weeks it felt like one of those dinner parties where nobody wants to leave. Hamza\u2019s one set of bagpipes short of a picnic blanket. Tess in neon pink, Claudia in sparkly black. Two shoulders between them, both fabulous. Out come the judges! Motsi\u2019s tiger pantsuit is a stripy nightmare. And we\u2019re off! We started to fifteen couples, but now we\u2019re down to five. Tonight it\u2019s TWO DANCES \u2013 cue wispy version of Europe\u2019s \u2018The Final Countdown\u2019. Enjoy these credits\u2026in six days it\u2019s all over! If you watched the Masterchef Final, can you not spoil the result down below? Means Strictly people can follow along and watch Masterchef later. Ta! I\u2019m inventing a parlour game called \u2018Strictly Standing\u2019, which only has one rule \u2013 if any of the judges stand up at the end of the dance or while giving their verdict, you have to stand up too. If you\u2019d like to play the grown-up version, you have to keep drinking (small sips, obvs) until they sit down again. Looking down the list of dances tonight, we\u2019ve got three Paso Dobles and two Waltzes. So now we know the answer to \u2018what\u2019s the dance equivalent of a Bounty and a Milky Way in a box of Celebrations?\u2019 Tomorrow\u2019s exit could be anyone, frankly. Dance-off history says tonight\u2019s battle for a place in the final is between Molly and Fleur, but if both of them end up at the top of the leaderboard (which is infinitely possible) it could easily be two of the others. Everyone is so closely matched now, and I have no idea how tonight is going to pan out. EXCITING. Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! It\u2019s a Surprise Sunday Semi on a School Night\u2013 this time next week we\u2019ll be gearing up for the Grand Final, which means it\u2019s nearly Christmas. In the past two days I\u2019ve done Bath Christmas Market with my mum, ice skating with my daughter, and a snowy Wiltshire dog walk this morning, so I feel like I\u2019ve been mulled and wrapped in tinsel. This week we\u2019ll address the big questions \u2013 can Molly survive another dance-off? What WILL Will do in his Couple\u2019s Choice? Will the extra two days of rehearsals this week make any difference to the quality of this week\u2019s TWO DANCES? It doesn\u2019t really matter, because traditionally this week is where wild over-scoring reaches a glittery climax. Although other than Craig, I\u2019m not really sure where the judges can go from here. I\u2019ll be keeping a beady eye on proceedings up here from 7.15pm, and would be delighted if you could scatter a few sequins in the comment box below. See you in a bit!"

            "date": "2022-12-14T19:19:04Z",
            "content": "In a poll regarding potential Republican nominees for president in 2024, the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, led Donald Trump by a whopping 23 points. Republican and Republican-leaning voters dealt the significant blow to the former president\u2019s ego in a survey carried out by USA Today and Suffolk University and released on Tuesday. Worse was to come for Trump on Wednesday, with the release of a Wall Street Journal survey which gave DeSantis a 14-point lead, 52%-38%, in a hypothetical primary matchup, and a CNN poll that said 62% of Republicans wanted their party to nominate someone else in 2024. In messages seen by the Guardian, one veteran Trump insider said: \u201cHe IS in trouble.\u201d There was good news for Trump in another poll covering the same time period as the USA Today survey, by Morning Consult, which gave him an 18-point lead over DeSantis. Furthermore, the polling website FiveThirtyEight still shows Trump in the lead in most polls. But David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, told USA Today: \u201cRepublicans and conservative independents increasingly want Trumpism without Trump.\u201d That much has been clear in the rise of DeSantis, a former US military lawyer and hard-right congressman who has pursued distinctly Trumpist hardline and theatrically cruel policies as governor of Florida, in particular on immigration and education. On Tuesday, DeSantis continued to court the Republican base, saying he would petition the Florida supreme court to convene a grand jury to investigate \u201cany and all wrongdoing\u201d with respect to Covid-19 vaccines \u2013 despite more than 83,000 people having died from Covid in his state. Last month, the governor marked a crushing re-election victory with a confident speech, declaring his state \u201cwhere woke goes to die\u201d to chants of \u201ctwo more years\u201d. Trump declared his third consecutive run for the Republican nomination shortly after those midterm elections. But he has shown precious little momentum, particularly after elections in which most of his endorsed candidates for key state posts and in Congress went down to defeat, contributing to a disappointing Republican performance. In Washington on Tuesday the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said Trump had cost the party in key seats, backing primary candidates who proved unable to win over voters in the midterms. \u201cWe ended up having a candidate quality test,\u201d McConnell told reporters at the Capitol. \u201cLook at Arizona. Look at New Hampshire. And the challenging situation in Georgia, as well. \u201cOur ability to control the primary outcome was quite limited in 22 because the support of the former president proved to be very decisive in these primaries.\u201d Trump is also in extensive legal jeopardy, over his attempted election subversion, the retention of White House records and his business affairs. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the former president\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, was found in criminal contempt during a secret trial during a tax fraud investigation in 2021. USA Today said its poll showed that among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, enthusiasm for another Trump run is receding. \u201cIn July, 60% of Republicans wanted Trump to run again. In October, that number had dipped to 56%. Now it has fallen to 47%, an almost-even split with the 45% who don\u2019t want him to run for a third time.\u201d The poll put Joe Biden, the president, up 47%-40% in a notional rematch with Trump. Biden is 80, Trump 76. Biden has said he will decide on whether to run again over the Christmas holidays. The new USA Today poll put DeSantis, 44, ahead of Biden in a notional match-up, 47%-43%. CNN found that just as 62% of Republicans wanted someone other than Trump, 59% of Democrats said Biden should not run again. Paleologos sounded a familiar note of caution, saying a big primary field could divide Republican opposition to Trump and hand him the nomination again. \u201cAdd in a number of other Republican presidential candidates who would divide the anti-Trump vote and you have a recipe for a repeat of the 2016 Republican caucuses and primaries, when Trump outlasted the rest of the divided field.\u201d Another likely candidate, Mike Pence, is edging closer to announcing a run. Speaking in New Hampshire, an early voting state, on Tuesday, the former vice-president told Fox News the reception accorded his recent memoir \u201chas been a great source of encouragement as we think about the way forward and what our calling might be in the future\u201d. Pence said he and his wife, Karen, would make a decision on whether to mount a run next year, after \u201cprayerful consideration\u201d over the holiday period. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to travel, we\u2019ll continue to listen,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-12-01T23:36:10Z",
            "content": "Polls have closed in the City of Chester byelection as Rishi Sunak faces his first electoral test as prime minister. Labour is expected to hold the seat. It had a majority of 6,164 at the last election and polls had indicated a double-digit lead over the Conservatives in the expected share of the vote this time. A result is expected at about 3am. Voter turnout was verified early on Friday as 41.2% (or 28,541 votes), a sizeable drop on the 71.7% turnout (54,560 votes) in 2019. This is the first Westminster byelection since the resignations of Boris Johnson and then Liz Truss as prime minister and the financial fallout from Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budget. The byelection was triggered by the resignation of the Labour MP Chris Matheson in October after allegations of sexual misconduct. Parliament\u2019s bullying and harassment watchdog and the standards commissioner found Matheson had violated the Commons\u2019 sexual misconduct policy. Labour\u2019s candidate in Chester is Samantha Dixon, a local councillor and former leader of Cheshire West and Chester council. In the past month, senior party figures, including the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, the former leader, Ed Miliband, and the Leeds East MP Richard Burgon, visited the constituency to campaign. Rayner and Keir Starmer tweeted good luck to Dixon on Thursday morning. The Labour leader tweeted: \u201cSam will be a fantastic representative of her community, and as their MP would do the people of Chester proud.\u201d Louise Gittins, Labour leader of Cheshire West and Chester council, said after polls closed she was \u201cquietly confident\u201d about her party\u2019s chances. \u201cI think it\u2019s gone well, bearing in mind it\u2019s December and it was dark at half four,\u201d she said. In terms of how large she thinks Labour\u2019s win will be, she said: \u201cI think we need to be in line with national polling. We\u2019d like to think over 60% share of the vote to send a real message to the government that enough is enough. I think the country has had enough of the Tories.\u201d Andy Carter, Conservative MP for Warrington South said: \u201cThis is a seat that has gone to Labour six times over the last seven elections. I\u2019m not expecting that to change.\u201d Rob Herd, the candidate for the Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cI think there is a massive discontentment with the Conservatives. I think we\u2019ll see that with tonight\u2019s results. Chester\u2019s always been a bit of a bellwether for the national curve.\u201d The Conservative candidate is Elizabeth Wardlaw, a nurse who is also a local councillor in Cheshire East. The constituency went from being the most marginal in the country in 2015, when Labour won by just 93 votes, to a firmly safe seat for the party in recent years. Labour won by 9,176 votes in 2017 and by 6,164 in 2019. In 2010, the Conservatives took the seat from Labour with a 2,583 majority. The Conservatives lost two byelections in June, one to Labour in Wakefield and the other to the Liberal Democrats in Tiverton and Honiton."

            "title": "Tunisians go to polls in election set to cement rule of strongman president",
            "date": "2022-12-17T15:44:10Z",
            "content": "Tunisians have gone to the polls to elect a new parliament, 11 years to the day since a vendor\u2019s self-immolation sparked the fall of their ruling tyrant and triggered a wave of popular revolts across north Africa and the Middle East. In the troubled decade since, other regional states that once cracked under the strain of popular revolts have been increasingly smothered by counterrevolutions that clawed back civic gains and political freedoms championed by their citizens. Although Tunisia was the only nation to emerge from the Arab spring protests with a democratic government, there are fears that Saturday\u2019s election will cap its dalliance with democracy and cement the return of strongman rule. The current president, Kais Saied, who in July last year ousted Tunisia\u2019s ruling government and has since revamped the constitution to give himself largely unfettered powers, is expected to preside over a new legislature with little aegis, and weakened political parties. Polling stations opened at 8am local time (7am GMT) on Saturday and were scheduled to close at 6pm. Voter turnout appeared lower during the morning hours, although Associated Press reporters saw people queueing outside several voting stations in the capital, Tunis. Saied and his wife, Ichraf, cast their ballots in Ennasr, a northern suburb of Tunis, on Saturday morning. Saied called on people to vote \u201cwith your hearts and your conscience to reclaim your legitimate rights to justice and freedom\u201d. He also warned against supporting those he claimed had abused power and \u201cdepleted the country of valuable resources after bribing people to elect them under the old electoral law\u201d. That the elections fall on the anniversary of Mohamed Bouazizi setting himself alight to protest against his treatment at the hands of the authorities is highly symbolic, and brings down the curtain on an era that came to be known as the Arab spring \u2013 in the place where it all began. Opposition groups and the main political parties have said they will boycott the vote, calling it undemocratic and a fig leaf of legitimacy for a power grab that would shred hard-won freedoms. Nejib Chebbi, head of an anti-Saied coalition including the Islamist Ennahda party, said the election, which is taking place during an economic crisis that is fuelling poverty, amounted to a \u201ca still-born farce\u201d. Saied, however, says a referendum held on constitutional reform in July provided a mandate to push through the changes and claims that Tunisians are seeking political certainty after a decade of stumbling and often crumbling democracy. \u201cTunisia is the last domino to fall in the region,\u201d said Hamish Kinnear, Middle East and north Africa analyst at the risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft. \u201cLooking forward, however, nothing is inevitable. Saied may be dominant now \u2013 but could face heavy domestic opposition to his plans to introduce structural economic reforms.\u201d For the time being, however, those who support Tunisia\u2019s new strongman appear to gravitate to the certainty that he offers. \u201cWhat made Saied popular, and fortified his presidential powers, is that Tunisians had lost patience with their elected leaders as they watched nine successive governments in 10 years issue big promises and consistently falter, particularly on the economic front,\u201d said Prof Safwan Masri, dean of Georgetown University in Qatar and author of Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly. \u201cBut the economic situation has not improved under Saied, and his popularity, always shallow, has been waning.\u201d In nearby Egypt \u2013 whose leadership supported Saied\u2019s grab for power \u2013 a revolution ignited by the ousting of Tunisia\u2019s Zine Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 has long since reverted to the type of oppressive state rule that characterised the era of its long-ruling tyrant, Hosni Mubarak. Although Egypt\u2019s revolutionaries were among the loudest and largest in the region, their quest to forge a political ecosystem in which citizens shaped their destinies was largely swamped by a resurgent police state that seized on the failings of the short-lived government of Mohamed Morsi, who was forced from office and jailed in 2013. \u201cForging democracy from the rubble of authoritarian states is a herculean task,\u201d cautioned Kinnear. \u201cHosni Mubarak may have been swept aside in a popular revolution and replaced with an elected leader, but other parts of the old regime \u2013 such as the military \u2013 remained intact and later helped to restore authoritarian rule. Democracy remains fragile even once it is established.\u201d Masri said the jury remained out on whether Tunisia could still succeed in its democratic experiment. \u201cThe social bedrock of democratic Tunisia \u2013 its strong civil society and labour movement, along with its commitment to women\u2019s rights and the visible role women play in public life \u2013 cannot be overlooked. As tempting as it is to look at all countries in the region through the same prism, that can be quite misleading. The situation is quite different than it is, say, in Egypt, where the army and labour movement have inverse strengths compared to Tunisia.\u201d HA Hellyer, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the election would not necessarily mark the end of an era. \u201cThe post-2011 era has seen revolution and counterrevolution, but not a final chapter by any means. What we\u2019re seeing are cycles that keep on unfolding, where populations insist on pushing, and then retreating, and status quo systems try to manage. Kais Saied is another note in the story in that regard, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s crystallised anything yet.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report"

            "date": "2022-12-12T01:23:35Z",
            "content": "Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said her government will pare back its policy agenda to \u201cfocus on the economy\u201d, after months of poor polling and increased pressure over living costs in New Zealand. After a successful 2020 election, Ardern\u2019s Labour party held a single-party majority in parliament this term, giving extensive freedom to the government\u2019s policy agenda. With a tough election year ahead, however, the prime minister has indicated the government would reprioritise and cut spending, rather than push forward all of its policy plans. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really focused on making sure, during this particularly tumultuous economic time we\u2019re in, that we are trimming back and making sure that the economy is our priority,\u201d Ardern said in a Monday morning interview with national broadcaster RNZ. \u201cWe have had as a government a lot on our agenda \u2026 Going into 2023 we do need to make sure we are totally focused, we prioritise, and that we will be making sure that where we need to pare back we will.\u201d The government faces difficult headwinds going into the next election. The increased cost of living, a backlash to the country\u2019s Covid response and concerns about crime have all contributed to a decline in popularity for the governing party and its leader. Polling in early December showed that support for Labour had dropped to its lowest point since it came into power in 2017, and the party would not be able to form a government with its available coalition partners. Personal support for the prime minister had also dropped to its lowest level ever, with her approval rating at 29% compared with opposition leader Christopher Luxon\u2019s at 23%. A key contributor to this decline has been the rising cost of living: overall inflation is at 7.2%, food prices are up 8.3% year on year, and interest rates have risen considerably after a series of reserve bank hikes. While these economic challenges are not unique to New Zealand, they have contributed to a souring public view of the incumbent government, and eroded the hefty mandate for reform the last election provided. The opposition has accused the government of fuelling inflation with the cost of the Covidresponse \u2013 and in recent interviews, Ardern said she would be cutting back on spending in response to the changing economic landscape. \u201cInternationally, we\u2019re seeing economies slow and many forecasting recession in different parts of the world,\u201d she said last week. \u201cThat\u2019s why we will be focused on making sure that we trim back.\u201d The government also has a number of contentious items on its agenda for the next year, including the controversial \u2018three waters\u2019 reforms to change water governance, world-first efforts to regulate agricultural emissions, changes to hate speech laws and a merger of the country\u2019s two public broadcasters. Ardern would not comment on which specific policies may face the chopping block. She said over the summer months, cabinet members would be asked to re-evaluate their legislative agenda, \u201cand just [ask] ourselves whether or not either from a spending perspective, investment perspective, or just from a focus perspective, those are things we should be prioritising at this point in time.\u201d"

            "content": "Voters in the Greater Manchester constituency of Stretford and Urmston go to the polls on Thursday in a byelection called after the sitting Labour MP quit to become Andy Burnham\u2019s mayoral deputy. Labour will be hoping for a comfortable win after the party\u2019s comfortable victory in Chester earlier this month. Kate Green, a former shadow education secretary, resigned in November after being nominated as Greater Manchester\u2019s deputy mayor for policing and crime. She had been an MP since 2010 and in 2019 won a 16,417 majority. Stretford and Urmston includes the Old Trafford area around Manchester United\u2019s stadium, as well as the Trafford shopping centre. It is often described as the birthplace of the NHS after Trafford general hospital became the first NHS hospital, when it was opened by the Labour health secretary Aneurin Bevan on 5 July 1948. The constituency has been Labour since its creation in 1997, when Bev Hughes won it in Tony Blair\u2019s landslide. She went on to be Blair\u2019s children\u2019s minister before quitting in 2010 and being made a peer by Gordon Brown. Burnham appointed her his first deputy when he won the inaugural Manchester mayoral election in 2017. Labour\u2019s byelection candidate is Andrew Western, the leader of Trafford council. The Conservatives have fielded a PR executive, Emily Carter-Kandola, 29. Tory big-hitters have been conspicuous in their absence from the campaign trail, with a few backbenchers and local councillors turning up to canvass. The result, expected in the early hours of Friday morning, will be watched keenly by Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers and MP for the wealthier Trafford seat of Altrincham and Sale West. In parliament since 1997, he has a majority of 6,139 and would be vulnerable in the next general election if recent polling is right. Western was runner-up in the seat in 2019. Labour will be hoping for another byelection win in early 2023 when voters in West Lancashire go to the polls to elect Rosie Cooper\u2019s successor. She announced her resignation in order to take up the job as chair of Mersey Care NHS foundation trust, a few years after being targeted in a far-right plot."

            "title": "Chandeliers and avatars: how conflict spawned a new lexicon in Ukraine",
            "date": "2022-12-27T05:30:14Z",
            "content": "It was once a superstition only among Ukrainian air crew: the word \u201clast\u201d, especially in the context of a last or final meeting, should be avoided as it denotes a premonition of death. In its place air crew would say krajne, which translates very roughly to English as \u201con the edge\u201d. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, krajne has gained far wider usage, employed by soldiers and some civilians in a country where everyone knows someone who is serving at the front. The conflict is spawning a new lexicon. Some of the words and phrases that have entered wider usage in Ukrainian society date back to the beginning of the war in 2014, others to military usage in the Soviet era, military slang that has become popularised again, and others are entirely new coinages. There is \u201cavatar\u201d for a drunken soldier, derived from a Ukrainian expression to get drunk or \u201cblue\u201d \u2013 a reference to the James Cameron blockbuster about blue aliens. A \u201cchandelier\u201d describes a white phosphorous airburst named for the falling points of brilliant white light, \u201cat zero\u201d is the frontline, and the chilling neologism \u201cto the basement\u201d describes the risk of what will happen to Ukrainians if captured by Russian forces. \u201cA lot of the new words began appearing in 2014,\u201d says Les Beley of the Potebnya linguistics institute at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. \u201cBut some words are even older \u2026 In general, the process is that there is certain lexicon of words that had a narrow usage in the military that now have a much wider context. \u201cThat includes some army slang that was common in the Russian and the Ukrainian language that had its origin in the Soviet war in Afghanistan. \u201cTwo-hundreds\u201d was military slang for dead and wounded whose origin was the fact that when bodies were transported from Afghanistan in that era, the weight of the coffin was 200 kilos.\u201d The incursion into civilian language of military slang in times of war \u2013 and other neologisms - is not a new phenomenon. As conflict alters societies, it also changes the way they talk about conflict. Some language serves to create a distance from the horrible reality or reinforce social solidarity, but in other cases it provides a useful tool to talk about the reality of the experience. \u201cWe have all the people serving in the army. We have millions of volunteers,\u201d says Beley. \u201cThis process is part of reality we live, and this reality requires this lexicon. Language constantly changes and adapts.\u201d Some slang has emerged as an ironic response to Russia\u2019s use of euphemism, he says, both officially \u2013 calling the war a \u201cspecial operation\u201d for instance \u2013 and more widely among Russian soldiers. Perhaps most famous in this sense have been Ukrainian memes that use the word for \u201ccotton\u201d for explosions targeting Russian forces. \u201cRussians don\u2019t talk about an explosion. They\u2019ll often say klapok, which is a loud noise or clap. If you run those letters through Google Translate, it will also come up with the word for \u2018cotton\u2019, which is used to mock the Russians,\u201d Beley explains. Some of the derogatory terms levelled at the Russian invaders have a history that goes back centuries. One coined during the current war has been \u201corc\u201d, borrowed from JRR Tolkein\u2019s Lord of the Rings, although the origin of is current usage is obscure. Beley also notes how modes of communication in emails and text have changed during the invasion. \u201cWe have a new set of rules. In the past the etiquette was always simply to say, \u2018Hello.\u2019 Now it is usual to start with \u2018How are you\u2019 and end the conversation with \u2018Take care of yourself\u2019.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-12T05:00:51Z",
            "content": "In the camps on the flanks of the Nyiragongo volcano in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they listen carefully. Not for warning of an eruption but to the dull thuds of distant mortar and artillery fire. Some days there are none, and hopes are raised. On other days, the sounds of war make clear to every one of the thousands of villagers huddled in their makeshift shelters that they will not be going anywhere very soon. \u201cWe want to return home to cultivate our fields and keep our cows, sheep and goats because we are here and we are hungry. We are suffering a lot,\u201d said Nsambimana Ashiwe, 64, at a displacement camp in Kanyaruchinya, a few miles south of the frontlines. Last week, fighting broke out again between the M23 group, the rebel militia that has seized a swath of the east of the country since launching an offensive just over a year ago, and national armed forces, despite pledges by both sides to abide by a ceasefire. The violence will undermine slim hopes of mitigating a growing humanitarian crisis in the region and averting a durable regional proxy conflict that analysts and diplomats fear could bring chaos to central Africa. In an interview, one of the leaders of M23 insisted that the militia would strictly respect the current ceasefire, reaffirmed during talks in Nairobi, but threatened to resume further advances if necessary. \u201cThe M23 aims to definitively resolve the deep causes of conflict through dialogue and to do that the M23 is making an effort to discourage the efforts of [the government] to impose a military solution,\u201d Bertrand Bisimwa, the self-styled president of M23, said via WhatsApp. \u201cConquering territory has never been a motive for our struggle \u2026 Right from the start of the armed conflict imposed on us by Kinshasa, we have warned the government that we would silence the guns which fire on us wherever they have been set up.\u201d Analysts point out that M23 has yet to cede any territory despite a pledge to withdraw. Instead, there have been clashes around the town of Masisi, to the west of Goma, the capital of North Kivu. There are also reports of fighting outside Bwiza, about 25 miles north of the city, after Congolese troops advanced. Bisimwa said the fighting was a result of \u201cacts of provocation and harassment\u201d by armed groups allied to DRC\u2019s government, \u201cwhich sometimes push us to develop strategies to contain their attacks\u201d. The fighting has displaced at least 400,000 people since March, according to the UN, with many of them gathering in squalid camps north of Goma. But those fleeing the fighting are just a fraction of the millions of civilians caught in power struggle between regional states that risks drawing in actors from across Africa, and even competing great powers. Neighbours Rwanda and Uganda have been directly implicated in the war, and Kenya has also become involved. The US has intervened and Russia has made efforts to exploit opportunities to win influence and so access to valuable natural resources. The result is an intractable conflict with massive humanitarian consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see many people with an interest in having a solution to this and that is worrying,\u201d said Pierre Boisselet, the head of research on violence at Ebuteli, a thinktank in Kinshasa. One fear has been that M23, a force of several thousand irregular fighters, would repeat the success of its first major offensive 10 years ago and seize Goma, a city of 2 million people. Analysts say the force has \u201ca clear superiority on the battlefield\u201d over the weak Congolese military and other armed groups aligned with Kinshasa. Rwanda has repeatedly been accused of supporting M23 since its foundation more than a decade ago and of using the militia as a proxy to project power, seize territory, exploit valuable natural resources and fight historic enemies. The UN said in August it had \u201csolid evidence\u201d that Rwandan troops had been fighting alongside M23, and Bisimwa did not directly deny a close relationship with Rwanda, saying there were people in the neighbouring country who \u201cknow our problems\u201d. \u201cRwanda is threatened by the same genocidal ideology which caused the genocide of the Tutsi there in 1994 and which permeates DRC from top to bottom,\u201d he said. M23 is mainly drawn from Tutsi communities within DRC, while most of the displaced people in the camps around Goma are Congolese Hutus. \u201cThey fled because when the M23 comes, they kill people,\u201d said Theo Musekura, the president of a displaced people\u2019s committee in the Kanyaruchinya camp. The Rwandan government in turn alleges that DRC\u2019s government works with the FDLR, a Hutu faction present in DRC since the 1994 genocide of Tutsis in Rwanda. Adding to the international ramifications of the conflict, the UN has a force of 20,000 headquartered in Goma, and hundreds of Kenyan soldiers recently arrived as part of a newly formed east African peacekeeping force. \u201cM23 clearly want to be taken seriously, so the Kenyans have to make a difference,\u201d said Richard Moncrieff, a Great Lakes expert with the International Crisis Group. \u201cTheir presence makes it politically more difficult to move on Goma. As for the UN, they don\u2019t seem to be anywhere in this fight.\u201d Uganda has sent troops into DRC to help the fight against Islamist militants further south. Uganda is also accused of helping M23 alongside Rwanda, which is otherwise a regional rival. In early December, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said: \u201cAny external support to non-state armed groups in the DRC must end, including Rwanda\u2019s assistance to M23.\u201d Blinken noted \u201cthe resurgence of hate speech and public incitement against Rwandaphone communities, recalling the real and horrible consequences of such rhetoric in the past\u201d. DRC\u2019s president, Felix Tshisekedi, faces new elections next year and has little incentive to make concessions necessary for peace. Boisselet said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that Rwanda is backing M23 one way or another but Tshisekedi has not been terribly good at delivering jobs, development and all that the Congolese really want, and [the fighting in the east] helps rally support around him and provides an external factor to explain everything that is wrong.\u201d Officials in Kinshasa accused M23 of killing almost 300 civilians in two villages in November. The UN said 131 were killed in a \u201creprisal\u201d attack. The rebels deny responsibility. Civil society groups have struggled to find a way to improve the situation. Lucha, a youth movement founded in Goma in 2012 during the last major surge of violence by M23, is working to help displaced people in and around the city. Standing in drizzle by the roadside just north of Kanyaruchinya, Adela Mufasano, 54, said she and her children needed to go home. \u201cThe kids sleep on the rocks,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the rain comes, it\u2019s a catastrophe.\u201d Andre Bahati Musarumu, 60, watching men play cards in front of a tent in the camp, also said he wanted the situation to end. \u201cWe want to go home to look for food. The government needs to decide between negotiation and war.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-28T08:00:46Z",
            "content": "A war is raging that has cost more than an estimated 600,000 lives. Its victims have borne witness to shocking human rights abuses and, tragically, civilians have been deliberately targeted. Tens of thousands of women have been raped. It has lasted two years and is happening today, yet the chances are you don\u2019t even know where it is. Though it is far deadlier than the war in Ukraine, the western media have mostly ignored it. On 4 November 2020, when Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, a Nobel Peace prize winner, announced a military offensive in the disputed territory of Tigray, it was difficult to imagine how catastrophic it would become. A population of more than 6 million people, under a government blockade, has been pushed towards mass starvation \u2013 with young children dying of acute malnutrition. Tigray has become a centre of weaponised rape and an internet blackout that has added to the psychological torture faced by victims, and by families such as mine desperate to hear from our loved ones. Before the war, Tigray was home to 47 hospitals, 224 health centres and 269 functional ambulances; today more than 80% of the hospitals have been damaged or destroyed at the hands of Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers, and ambulance services are no more. The statistics and the scale of human suffering mean the eyes of the world should be on Tigray, yet two years later it feels as though no one is watching. What is particularly tragic is that the lack of attention is not because the international community and media lack resources. This year we have seen what is possible when the world decides a conflict and the lives destroyed by it are worth caring about. My family are from Tigray, and we have had limited communication with our relatives since the war began. The last I heard from my aunt was a short voice note in March saying they had run out of money and medication, and things were dire. We haven\u2019t heard from her since. With limited communication in some regions, some Tigrayans living abroad have only learned of the loss of their loved ones after more than a year. Many Tigrayans in the diaspora are now resigned to the fact that when communication lines are fully restored, they will probably learn of more loss and suffering. On 2 November this year there were muted celebrations as a peace deal was signed by the warring parties. Some hoped this could be the first step towards justice and a lasting peace. Yet weeks later came reports of Eritrean troops looting towns, and displacing, arresting and killing civilians in Tigray. It remains uncertain how the perpetrators of civilian abuses will be effectively investigated and brought to justice \u2013 especially as the abuses are continuing. For the west, this war, which has taken place for the most part in the dark, raises important questions about how the media report on conflicts and humanitarian crises. It reminds us of the dark reality that not all conflicts, not all humanitarian crises are equal, no matter how horrific the human cost. It\u2019s a tragedy that Tigray has become a forgotten catastrophe. As I write this, much of Tigray is still inaccessible or uncontactable, civilians are unable to access their money, they are starving, the health crisis is immense and they are still being terrorised by militia and soldiers. The question remains, how did the international community ignore hundreds of thousands of people dying? And what does it mean that such abuses of justice are allowed to occur? When all is said and done, our global consciences must reckon with the fact that, while this human bloodbath happened, we chose not to watch. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 December 2022. The number estimated to have died in the war is at least 600,000 people. An earlier version said it was up to 600,000 lives Magdalene Abraha is a writer and publisher at Jacaranda Books Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2022-12-27T10:27:15Z",
            "content": "Taiwan will extend its compulsory military service from four months to one year amid mounting military tensions with China, the island\u2019s president has announced. Under the plans due to come into effect in 2024, conscripts will undergo more intense training, including shooting exercises and combat instruction used by US forces. Conscripts will be tasked with guarding key infrastructure, enabling regular forces to respond more swiftly in the event of any attempt by China to invade. The announcement of the change came after Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry reported that 71 Chinese air force jets and drones had entered the island\u2019s air defence identification zone within 24 hours on Monday \u2013 the largest reported incursion to date. \u201cAs long as Taiwan is strong enough, it will be the home of democracy and freedom all over the world, and it will not become a battlefield,\u201d President Tsai Ing-wen told a news conference after a national security council meeting. \u201cTaiwan wants to tell the world that between democracy and dictatorship, we firmly believe in democracy. Between war and peace, we insist on peace. Let us show the courage and determination to protect our homeland and defend democracy.\u201d The defence authority also plans to raise the monthly wage of regular conscription soldiers from about NT$6,500 (US$211) to NT$26,307 (US$856), almost in line with the minimum wage. Since 2013, Taiwan has required men over 18 to serve four months in the military, with the first five weeks in a basic training boot camp. The new plan will put mandatory recruits on eight-week basic training. Chen Chi-mai, mayor of Kaohsiung city and the acting chairperson of the ruling Democratic Progressive party, told reporters on Tuesday that it was essential to strengthen national security, the official news agency CNA reported. Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force, but China\u2019s growing assertiveness towards the island it claims as its own, as well as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have prompted debate about how to boost defence. Tsai said \u201ca few things\u201d had been learned from that war which have been incorporated into Taiwan\u2019s defence reforms, and noted that Ukraine\u2019s ability to hold off much larger Russian forces had given the international community time to render assistance. Previous governments cut compulsory service for men from more than two years to four months to please younger voters during a period of easing tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan\u2019s efforts to bolster the readiness of its defence forces accelerated after the visit to the island from the US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in August. China immediately staged military drills around Taiwan in response to Pelosi\u2019s visit. The de facto US embassy in Taiwan welcomed the announcement on conscription reform. \u201cThe United States\u2019 commitment to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defence capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,\u201d the American Institute in Taiwan said. A survey conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in December found that 73.2% of respondents were in favour of an extension to compulsory service. Joseph Wu, Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, told the Guardian in an exclusive interview earlier this month that the Chinese military threat was \u201cgetting more serious than ever\u201d, with a five-fold increase in warplane incursions into the island\u2019s defence zone since 2020. Wu said the drills conducted after Pelosi\u2019s visit were also aimed at scaring off other governments which might support Taiwan. As part of the efforts to ramp up the island\u2019s combat strength, on Friday Tsai inaugurated new military facilities at an army base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, which she said offers \u201ca better living environment\u201d for military personnel, according to a statement released by the president office.

            "content": "The elite US military academy at West Point is removing Confederate monuments from its Hudson Valley campus in New York state, in accordance with a congressional review and orders set in motion by the Pentagon. The removal, which includes a portrait of Gen Robert E Lee in Confederate uniform, began on 18 December. The academy, America\u2019s oldest, said the operation to either take down or modify displays memorializing the Confederacy would be a \u201cmulti-phased process\u201d. Robert E Lee was a graduate and superintendent of West Point who was appointed commander of the Confederate army toward the end of the US civil war. The academy also has a stone bust of the general, bronze plaques dedicated to him, a gate, road and academic facilities bearing his name. Across the US over the past few years, statues and other public monuments linked to the Confederacy have been taken down as part of a wider societal reckoning with slavery and its enduring legacy. Many roads, military bases, university buildings and other structures have also been renamed. Stone markers at West Point that commemorate the Confederacy will be modified \u201cwith appropriate language and images\u201d said the academy superintendent, Lt Gen Steve Gilland. Among the items to be sent to storage or relocated is a bronze triptych which includes an image of a hooded figure appearing with the words \u201cKu Klux Klan\u201d. Gilland wrote to the West Point community last week saying that West Point\u2019s memorialization, history, and museum (MHM) committee will comply with the recommendations of a congressional commission reviewing Pentagon property honoring the Confederacy \u201cwhile still conveying the Plaza\u2019s central message of reconciliation\u201d. In 2020, Donald Trump attempted to veto the committee\u2019s recommendations but members of Congress voted to override his veto. The naming commission has noted that it was not created \u201cwith any intention of \u2018erasing history\u2019\u201d. \u201cThe facts of the past remain and the commissioners are confident the history of the cvil war will continue to be taught at all service academies with all the quality and complex detail our national past deserves,\u201d the commission said. \u201cRather, they make these recommendations to affirm West Point\u2019s long tradition of educating future generations of America\u2019s military leaders to represent the best of our national ideals,\u201d it added."

            "date": "2022-12-06T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "The chairman of NatWest has told staff he \u201cnever felt so embarrassed internationally\u201d as he did at the International Monetary Fund meeting in the wake of the UK\u2019s disastrous mini-budget, as he warned about government plans to boost the competitiveness of City firms. Sir Howard Davies told hundreds of employees at NatWest \u2013 which is still 48% owned by the state \u2013 that ex-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s package of unfunded tax cuts for the wealthy in late September, which triggered a market meltdown, caused \u201cquite a significant problem\u201d and \u201cscarring\u201d of the UK\u2019s reputation, according to a recording reviewed by the Guardian. \u201cI was at the IMF conference while all this was going on and Kwarteng was there. It was embarrassing, because he was then summoned back home to be sacked \u2026 The perception of the UK was terrible,\u201d Davies told hundreds of staff at the private event held for the group\u2019s legal, governance and regulatory affairs division in early November. Davies, who has been chairman of the former Royal Bank of Scotland since 2015, said banking peers and regulators, including those at the European Commission, tried to comfort him the way colleagues would if you had an ill parent. \u201cIt was a bit like that, [with] people coming in to say \u2018I\u2019m terribly sorry to hear about your economy and your government, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not so bad\u2019. And you say, \u2018well actually, it probably is. Really \u2013 it\u2019s about as bad as you think\u2019. \u201cIt was awful, I\u2019ve never felt so embarrassed internationally,\u201d he said. Kwarteng returned from the meeting in Washington in mid-October to be sacked by then-prime minister Liz Truss. Davies, who also led the Financial Services Authority (FSA) before it was split in the wake of the 2008 banking crash, told employees he was concerned about the way the government was planning to boost competitiveness of City firms. The Treasury is planning for force regulators at the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority to consider how regulation may impact the way UK-based banks and other financial firms compete with international rivals. Campaigners and former politicians including ex-business minister Sir Vince Cable have already warned that the rules, which are being introduced through the wide-ranging financial services and markets bill, would be a \u201crecipe for excessive risk-taking\u201d, and could create the same conditions that have since been blamed for the 2008 banking crash. Davies, who served as chair of the FSA between 1997 and 2003, said he was \u201cnot keen on\u201d the competition clause, which went further than the guidance laid out prior to the financial crisis. At that time, he said the FSA only had to prove that issues such as competitiveness were \u201ctaken into account\u201d and were not something \u201cyou were trying to achieve directly\u201d. \u201cIn my view, to give the regulator the objective of promoting competitiveness, could be the thin end of a rather peculiar wedge. I mean, why would \u2026 the regulators not come in and tell us to cut our cost-income ratio? That would improve our competitiveness. And if they had a competitiveness objective, it seems that would give them an \u2018in\u2019 to the way we run our business, which I think would be a bit tricky, really, and that is one reason why the regulators aren\u2019t really keen on it either.\u201d He claimed the ministers were talking about the new competition rules as one of the \u201csupposed benefits of Brexit\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s something which is driven by this notion that we must be able to identify some things that we have done which we wouldn\u2019t have done [without] Brexit. It\u2019s not a great place to start in my view to think about how you best regulate a financial sector and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say on that,\u201d he told staff. NatWest and the Treasury declined to comment."

            "date": "2022-12-30T16:00:01Z",
            "content": "It has been an extraordinary year, so extraordinary, in fact, it required a new word to sum it up: \u201cpermacrisis\u201d. This entered the Guardian\u2019s lexicon for the first time in March, an apt word for the annus horribilis that was 2022. \u201cPermacrisis\u201d went on to become Collins Dictionary\u2019s word of the year and was one of several that broke through, while others gained fresh significance. A trawl of words used by this newspaper for the first time and examples of the uncommonly common \u2013 lesser-used words and terms frequently repeated due to a running story \u2013 also tells the tale of 2022 and points to the news cycles that informed our reporting. The year began with the terms \u201cPartygate\u201d, \u201clockdown-busting\u201d, \u201crule-breaking\u201d and \u201c(Sue) Gray\u201d dominating the most commonly used uncommon words in January, marking the fallout from Downing Street parties held during lockdown. In February, the word \u201cscurrilous\u201d came to the fore after Boris Johnson\u2019s longstanding policy chief Munira Mirza used it to describe the then prime minister\u2019s behaviour when he falsely linked Keir Starmer to the failure to bring the paedophile Jimmy Savile to justice. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, March was notable for the start of the horror for Ukrainians, with several placenames \u2013 Kharkiv, Bucha, Odesa, Mariupol, Kyiv, Kherson and others \u2013 appearing with distressing frequency. The invasion also led to #IStandWithUkraine appearing on the website. The #IStandWith hashtag later joined \u201cgoblin mode\u201d and \u201cmetaverse\u201d as Oxford\u2019s top three words of the year. Given the events that preceded it, the first use of the term \u201cpermacrisis\u201d in the Guardian was particularly apt, in a headline on an article advising parents on how to talk to children about troubling world events. Politics was never far from the news. Rishi Sunak\u2019s wife, Akshata Murthy, had previously been the subject of Guardian reports connected to her \u201cnon-dom\u201d status, and she was in the headlines again in April after a leak led to her confirming her use of the tax loophole. In May, every headline writer\u2019s dream term rocketed in popularity again when the \u201cWagatha Christie\u201d trial opened in London\u2019s high court, with Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy taking the stand. When news broke in June that a Google AI researcher had been suspended after claiming that the company\u2019s flagship text generation chatbot had become sentient, it pushed \u201csentient\u201d into the top 10 common uncommon words used on the Guardian website that month. It also introduced the acronym \u201cLaMDA\u201d to Guardian readers, with the unusual mix of capitals and lower-case letters distinguishing the bot\u2019s name from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda, as per the Guardian stylebook). In July, it was not words but numbers that came to the fore, marking a month of heatwaves and record temperatures after the UK registered a maximum temperature over 40C, surpassing the previous record of 38.7C. August was a month of firsts, with two entirely new concepts appearing on the Guardian\u2019s pages. \u201cQuiet quitting\u201d is really just a term for doing the job you were hired to do, no more, no less, leaving on time and not taking out-of-hours emails and calls. The Observer explained it for the first time in August, as the term was going global, but it also merited an entire vignette in the Guardian\u2019s First Dog on the Moon. Another term that made its Guardian debut in August was \u201csplooting\u201d, when squirrels, dogs, cats, marmots and other mammals lie on their bellies \u2013 where there is less fur \u2013 on hot days to help them cool down. September\u2019s lexicon was marked by the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the national mourning period of 10 days. The Queen\u2019s coffin was seen by millions around the world resting in Westminster Hall on a raised platform called a \u201ccatafalque\u201d \u2013 one of several words connected to the funeral and the monarchy that were used with far more frequency that month. Later that month, the politics pages documented the rise and stupendous fall of Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng with mentions of the pair\u2019s disastrous \u201cmini-budget\u201d, a term that will surely haunt both individuals for years to come. Another scandal broke in November, when it was revealed that Manston, the asylum centre in Kent, was dangerously overcrowded. The centre opened in January 2022 and in November it was discovered to be housing 2.5 times more people than designed for. As football fans geared up for the World Cup in Qatar, a term more readily associated with fashion made an appearance on the Guardian\u2019s sports pages. The \u201cbucket hat\u201d went from the subject of a cheery feature on Welsh fans to a news story when rainbow versions of the hats were confiscated from fans entering Qatari stadiums amid the LGBTQ+ protests that marked the early stages of the tournament. And finally, in December, viva magenta, described as an \u201caudacious\u201d shade of carmine red, made its debut as the colour that captured the zeitgeist of 2022. \u201cIt depicts optimism and joy,\u201d Leatrice Eiseman, the executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said of the selection. \u201cAnd we know we are all greatly in need of that.\u201d Jonnie Robinson, the British Library\u2019s lead curator for spoken English, who compiles an annual blog with his favourite sports word of the year, said tracking word frequencies in this way clearly showed the \u201clexical innovation\u201d that marks the constant evolution of language. \u201cIt also reveals typical processes used when forming new words, like blending (eg perma[nent]+ crisis) and affixation (Party + the \u2018pseudo\u2019 suffix -gate), and captures the playful appeal of innovative forms like splooting required to describe new phenomena. \u201cHow well any of these forms endure remains to be seen, but their presence in the Guardian confirms and, no doubt, reinforced their prominence in popular discourse during 2022.\u201d The words identified in this article were found by searching the Guardian API programatically for \u201csignificant terms\u201d and manual searches to find new words which appeared on Guardian\u2019s pages for the first time in 2022. \u201cSignificant terms\u201d were gathered by first creating a background to count the frequency of terms across all content available in the Guardian API, some of which date back as far as 1899, to present. A foreground query, which counts the frequency of terms in each subset (a given month, in a given section), was also carried out. Those terms that were a lot more frequent in the foreground set were considered \u201csignificant\u201d."

            "date": "2022-12-12T23:01:10Z",
            "content": "Kwasi Kwarteng disregarded warnings that his \u00a345bn mini-budget could trigger a backlash on the financial markets, Treasury officials told MPs today. The department\u2019s permanent secretary, James Bowler, said he was \u201cabsolutely confident Treasury officials set out the right advice\u201d to the then chancellor. He conceded that they could not persuade Kwarteng to change his view, saying \u201cofficials advise but ministers decide\u201d. Bowler took over as the top civil servant in the Treasury in October after his predecessor, Sir Tom Scholar, was sacked by Liz Truss\u2019s government. Cat Little and Beth Russell, who stepped up to lead the department during the gap and now are joint second permanent secretaries, outlined the advice the former chancellor received. Russell told the Commons Treasury select committee on Monday: \u201cCat and I are confident that we gave all the advice to ministers on the economic and fiscal backdrop, the impacts and the market position and particularly around the financing requirement, which was a big issue because of the cost of the measures.\u201d Asked if there was more they could have done, she said: \u201cUltimately the decisions here are for the ministers. It\u2019s our job to make sure we give the best advice possible on the impacts and the consequences, and I think we both feel we did that on the situation in the markets.\u201d The mini-budget delivered by Kwarteng on 23 September was meant to be a plan for growth, but instead spooked investors in the financial markets and led to the downfall of Truss as prime minister. Bowler told MPs the financial chaos, as well as the coronavirus pandemic and the response to the war in Ukraine, has dented morale in the Treasury. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough year for Treasury civil servants,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of crisis upon crisis, so Covid, Ukraine energy, so the mini-budget came on top of that. \u201cPolitical change, so four chancellors since the summer, and in some quarters negative commentary on Treasury civil servants, none of that has been helpful. In terms of morale I think that has had an impact but staff understand they\u2019re working on really, really important areas.\u201d Bowler started as permanent secretary on 10 October after Scholar was sacked on 8 September, with his ousting being partly blamed for the financial crisis. \u201cI think Tom\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t normal,\u201d Bowler said. Britain\u2019s economy returned to growth after the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that GDP rose by 0.5% in October. Despite the encouraging report the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has warned the economy was \u201clikely to get worse before it gets better\u201d."

            "content": "I\u2019m hosting our family\u2019s Christmas for the first time this year. With less than three weeks to the day, I\u2019m making a list, and checking it twice. What should we cook? How do we put a tree up? Do we continue traditions or seize the opportunity to make our own? And, maybe most importantly, what isn\u2019t even on the radar? After a couple of years of touch-and-go Christmases, I know I\u2019m not alone in these predicaments. So I\u2019ve enlisted the help of a few experts to guide us through it. The plan: \u2018Sometimes pillow cases go missing\u2019 Darcie Naughton hosted her first Christmas last year in Melbourne after Covid prevented a trip back to her native Western Australia. Eight adults and her two-year-old gathered in her two-bedroom apartment, while she was 30 weeks pregnant. \u201cGetting the house properly clean\u201d ahead of time helped, and she reassuringly adds that hosting was less stressful than \u201chaving to travel somewhere for lunch with a baby who sleeps over lunchtime\u201d. \u201cAt home we just popped her down for her normal nap before everyone arrived.\u201d As the owner of a design and decorating studio, Emma Blomfield is in charge of planning parts of Christmas every year \u2013 no matter who is hosting. She proposes making an achievable list of chores that can be chipped away at over the next few weeks, such as hanging art or finally replacing that lightbulb, checking bedding sets (\u201csometimes pillow cases go missing\u201d) and inspecting serving ware for holes, chips and cracks. Check you have a full set of cutlery and, if not, try to borrow before you buy. Chairs, tables, crockery and glassware can all be rented and returned too, if you can\u2019t source them for free. As for the meal, Angela Metri, founder of produce box the Spread Method, recommends first deciding whether you\u2019re actually a planner, or just someone who would \u201clike to be a planner\u201d. If planning eases (rather than exacerbating) stress, start contacting local producers, such as butchers and fishmongers, now and map out a menu. Blomfield notes this step will also allow you to ensure you have appropriate serving ware. But if you thrive in last minute-ness, Metri suggests heading to a farmer\u2019s market a few days before 25 December and asking vendors for their recommendations. \u201cIt\u2019s the most personalised help you could receive and you don\u2019t need to plan much. The produce is really fresh to boot.\u201d The decorations: \u2018Start from the back then zigzag out\u2019 Alana Arena\u2019s Dancer and Dasher create opulent, ostentatious, OTT trees for celebrities. For her clients, \u201csparse trees are just not a thing\u201d. \u201cThe tree goes up straight after Halloween\u201d in Arena\u2019s house, but there\u2019s no need to worry if you\u2019ve left it a little later this year. Don\u2019t own a tree or decorations? See what you can borrow from nearby family and friends before you go shopping. This will save money and storage space come 26 December. If buying a new tree, Arena suggests choosing a fake one \u2013 \u201creal trees should stay in the ground\u201d. If you want it to heave with lights, tinsel and ornaments, find one with \u201csturdy, thick tendrils\u201d as they\u2019re perfect for decorating. When setting up the tree, prioritise a spot with power access, in view of the living room or dining table. While Arena says pre-lit trees \u201csave so much time\u201d, if you\u2019re lighting it yourself she suggests going from side-to-side to \u201chide the cords more easily\u201d. \u201cI start from the back of the branch then zigzag it to the front,\u201d she says. \u201cI also leave more lights through the interior \u2026 so it glows from the centre out.\u201d Once your tree is lit, start with the largest and most special decorations, giving them prime position, followed by the tree topper, then the rest from largest to smallest. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning As for the table setting, if you need to hit up an op shop for more serving ware, Blomfield suggests sticking with a theme. Crockery and cutlery doesn\u2019t need to belong to the same set as long as there is \u201cconsistency in terms of colour or shape\u201d. To decorate, Blomfield searches for flowers, branches and Christmas bush cuttings to create a big bouquet, or stretch along the table \u201cin little bud vases\u201d. Arena adds that extra tree decorations work scattered along the table, or as gifts atop each napkin. Blomfield suggests tying or folding napkins \u2013 whether paper or linen \u2013 and resting them on a plate with a handwritten name card \u201con a beautiful piece of paper\u201d. The guests: little touches go a long way Whether you have people staying over in a spare room, on a blow-up mattress, or on the couch, Blomfield says small touches make a big difference: nice linen, a side table with a phone charger and a glass of water, maybe even a pair of earplugs and a sleeping mask, or a chocolate on the pillow. Extra special, hotel-like touches \u2013 say slippers or a robe \u2013 can double as gifts. And if children are attending, focus on creating a bit of magic. It could involve making a Santa sack together, or leaving cookies out. \u201cMy aunt and uncle once went and stamped out little hoof prints in the dirt outside and they found an old antler,\u201d Blomfield says. \u201cWe thought that Rudolph had left his antler behind.\u201d The meal: \u2018We all know people who love the soggy chip\u2019 When preparing any special meal, \u201cyou have to choose the thing you\u2019re happy to spend: time, money or effort\u201d, Metri says. If you \u201cdon\u2019t mind effort but need to keep costs low, then be prepared to spend time and effort to make a thoughtful plan\u201d, including what you\u2019ll buy, where you\u2019ll buy it and how you\u2019ll allocate your budget. But if you \u201chate cooking, spend on high-quality ready made foods\u201d. Think about what your loved ones enjoy eating and choose a showstopper (a splurge to budget everything else around), something to pass around (potatoes, vegetables), something colourful (a salad) and something fun (like a \u201creally good bread to mop up sauces\u201d \u2013 she suggests a tearable option like fougasse). Your showstopper should \u201ctrigger a sense of festivity and celebration \u2026 Don\u2019t feel pressured to cook a whole turkey if that doesn\u2019t actually feel very celebratory,\u201d Metri says. \u201cJewelled rice might be festive in one home yet never seen in another.\u201d If you are going to brave a well-worn family recipe, surrender expectations: \u201cDifferent ingredients, equipment, timing and cooking experience \u2026 guarantee different results,\u201d Metri says. Naughton chose not to worry about traditions. She bought \u201cfresh veggies and seafood at the markets\u201d and served homemade focaccia, oysters, prawns, ham and \u201cheaps of really great salads\u201d. Importantly, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. \u201cHosting is one of the most beautiful ways to say I love you. Even if your dishes don\u2019t turn out perfectly, trust me, your guests will appreciate the effort,\u201d Metri says. \u201cWe all know people \u2026 who love the slightly soggy chip.\u201d The schedule 3 weeks before Christmas Figure out what you need and don\u2019t have (a long enough table? Collapsible chairs? A blow-up mattress? Enough plates?) and start asking around to see what you can borrow. 2 weeks before Christmas Finalise your menu and shopping list (including drinks, ice and kids\u2019 food). 1-2 weeks before Schedule your visits to the deli, farmers\u2019 markets, butcher, specialty stores, fishmonger and bakery and call ahead if you can \u2013 they\u2019ll love you for it. Order anything else you need online. 3-4 days before Start making anything that will keep well in the fridge, freezer or pantry. You can freeze pickles, desserts, flavoured salts or pastry-based dishes. 2-3 days before Head to the supermarket for your big shop \u2013 drinks, snacks and anything else you need before the day (delegate this job to someone who won\u2019t be cooking, if you can). Begin the household tidy-up. The day before Buy bread, seafood and anything else you need extra fresh. Slow-cook large pieces of meat overnight. On the day Prepare easy, on-the-spot options like tinned seafood with crusty bread, sashimi or crudit\u00e9s (raw vegetables) served with dips. Set a hard deadline for when you\u2019ll stop cooking, so you can be present with your guests. This can be especially hard to do, but they will remember your presence more than you rushing around trying to finish a sauce."

Kwarteng announced a raft of tax cuts without any reduction in spending in September, which led to the pound crashing against the dollar, pension funds nearly collapsing, a \u00a365bn Bank of England bailout, soaring mortgage costs, and the cost of government borrowing increasing. He also said he would remove the cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses. The MP for Spelthorne, who was sacked by Truss after 38 days, has now said that the then prime minister and her team had lost perspective on the budget and its political or financial consequences. \u201cPeople got carried away, myself included,\u201d Kwarteng told the Financial Times. \u201cThere was no tactical subtlety whatsoever. \u201cThere was a brief moment and the people in charge, myself included, blew it.\u201d The article in the FT quoted an unnamed aide describing Truss, who left Downing Street after 49 days once her position became untenable among Conservative MPs, as \u201covercaffeinated\u201d in her decision-making process. \u201cShe was in this mode where everything had to be done immediately. I was worried she was going to blow up. She kept on saying she only had two years to do things,\u201d before a potential election by January 2025. Kwarteng said he had urged Truss to \u201cslow down\u201d over reforms, but a cabinet minister told the FT that she felt \u201cinvincible, almost regal\u201d. The budget unravelled within minutes of its delivery but worse was to come after Kwarteng signalled in a TV interview that more tax cuts were coming. The resulting market shock led to Kwarteng being sacked and replaced by Jeremy Hunt. The former health secretary then got rid of two-thirds of the tax cuts in Kwarteng\u2019s budget, including to the top rate of income tax. Three days later, Truss announced her resignation outside No 10. She reportedly told allies: \u201cI lost a battle, but I haven\u2019t lost the war.\u201d The former prime minister is considering launching an economic thinktank, according to an ally. The source told the Times: \u201cShe stands by her central argument on the need to grow the economy. \u201cShe\u2019ll be making the case.\u201d"

            "content": "The elite US military academy at West Point is removing Confederate monuments from its Hudson Valley campus in New York state, in accordance with a congressional review and orders set in motion by the Pentagon. The removal, which includes a portrait of Gen Robert E Lee in Confederate uniform, began on 18 December. The academy, America\u2019s oldest, said the operation to either take down or modify displays memorializing the Confederacy would be a \u201cmulti-phased process\u201d. Robert E Lee was a graduate and superintendent of West Point who was appointed commander of the Confederate army toward the end of the US civil war. The academy also has a stone bust of the general, bronze plaques dedicated to him, a gate, road and academic facilities bearing his name. Across the US over the past few years, statues and other public monuments linked to the Confederacy have been taken down as part of a wider societal reckoning with slavery and its enduring legacy. Many roads, military bases, university buildings and other structures have also been renamed. Stone markers at West Point that commemorate the Confederacy will be modified \u201cwith appropriate language and images\u201d said the academy superintendent, Lt Gen Steve Gilland. Among the items to be sent to storage or relocated is a bronze triptych which includes an image of a hooded figure appearing with the words \u201cKu Klux Klan\u201d. Gilland wrote to the West Point community last week saying that West Point\u2019s memorialization, history, and museum (MHM) committee will comply with the recommendations of a congressional commission reviewing Pentagon property honoring the Confederacy \u201cwhile still conveying the Plaza\u2019s central message of reconciliation\u201d. In 2020, Donald Trump attempted to veto the committee\u2019s recommendations but members of Congress voted to override his veto. The naming commission has noted that it was not created \u201cwith any intention of \u2018erasing history\u2019\u201d. \u201cThe facts of the past remain and the commissioners are confident the history of the cvil war will continue to be taught at all service academies with all the quality and complex detail our national past deserves,\u201d the commission said. \u201cRather, they make these recommendations to affirm West Point\u2019s long tradition of educating future generations of America\u2019s military leaders to represent the best of our national ideals,\u201d it added."

            "date": "2022-12-23T09:00:04Z",
            "content": "The number of US service members who have been exposed to toxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d is much higher than the military has claimed, a new independent analysis of Department of Defense data has found. A Pentagon report that aims to assess the scope of PFAS chemical exposure on its bases, as well as health threats posed to service members, estimated about 175,000 troops across 24 facilities had drunk contaminated water. But an analysis of the military\u2019s report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-profit that tracks PFAS pollution, found the numbers are probably much higher and could top more than 640,000 people across 116 bases, and potentially even millions of people when past service members are factored in. Moreover, the report seemed to omit health issues linked to PFAS exposure, such as kidney disease, testicular cancer and fetal effects. The overall report is \u201cfrustrating\u201d, said Scott Faber, senior vice-president of government affairs with EWG. \u201cThe Department of Defense is trying to downplay these risks rather than aggressively seeking to notify service members and clean up its legacy pollution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has long history of looking the other way when it comes to PFAS pollution.\u201d The DoD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. PFAS are a class of about 12,000 chemicals often used to make products resist water, stain and heat. They are called forever chemicals because they do not naturally break down and persist in the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, liver disease, high cholesterol, thyroid disorders, birth defects and autoimmune dysfunction. PFAS are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million people nationally, and contamination has been found in and around hundreds of DoD bases at high levels because the chemicals are the main ingredient in firefighting foam the military uses. Congress mandated the DoD report in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, but the military has not published it on the department\u2019s PFAS website, so it is unavailable to the public or service members except upon request. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that ought to bother every American,\u201d Faber said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that they purposefully underestimated how many service members were exposed \u2026 it\u2019s that they didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d The DoD\u2019s analysis, dated April 2022, seemed designed to reduce the exposure estimates in several key ways, EWG noted. It only included bases where levels for two types of PFAS \u2013 PFOS and PFOA \u2013 exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s previous health advisory limit of 70 parts per trillion (ppt). But the EPA lowered that level in June to less than 1 ppt for each compound. Though the report came out about two months before the change, the military often lobbies the EPA on environmental rules, the pending change was publicly known, and the military likely rushed to get its report out ahead of the EPA\u2019s formal announcement, Faber said. \u201cThis is clearly what it appears to be,\u201d he said. The numbers also did not include four large bases \u2013 Fort Bragg, Yakima Training Center, Fort Leavenworth and Picatinny Arsenal \u2013 where levels ranged from 98 ppt to 647 ppt. The levels peaked at over 21,000 ppt at Horsham air national guard base in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. The report also only considered military members who were on bases at the time of the analysis, meaning it is a \u201csnapshot in time\u201d. The military began using firefighting foam with PFAS over 50 years ago. \u201cThe real question is how many millions of service members drank the contaminated water over the last half century?\u201d Faber asked. The numbers would probably be higher if the military also included other kinds of PFAS. PFOA and PFOS are two of the most common, but thousands more are in commercial use, and the EPA also has health advisory limits for two other compounds. Though Congress required the DoD to include an assessment of health risks to troops, the military excluded risks for fetal and maternal health because it \u201cfocused on military members and veterans\u201d, the department wrote. EWG noted that about 13,000 service members give birth every year, and many live on DoD facilities. The military also made no mention of increased testicular and kidney cancer risks. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking and there was no explanation,\u201d Faber said. It is unclear what\u2019s next for the report. Congress has ordered the DoD to phase out firefighting foam that uses PFAS by October 2023, and develop a cleanup plan. The military already missed a deadline to submit a cleanup plan to Congress, but Faber noted it has new political leadership in place, and the Biden administration has been more serious about addressing PFAS contamination than Trump. \u201cThe next few years will be critical to resetting when it comes to the DoD addressing toxic chemicals, like PFAS,\u201d Faber said."

            "date": "2022-12-27T10:27:15Z",
            "content": "Taiwan will extend its compulsory military service from four months to one year amid mounting military tensions with China, the island\u2019s president has announced. Under the plans due to come into effect in 2024, conscripts will undergo more intense training, including shooting exercises and combat instruction used by US forces. Conscripts will be tasked with guarding key infrastructure, enabling regular forces to respond more swiftly in the event of any attempt by China to invade. The announcement of the change came after Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry reported that 71 Chinese air force jets and drones had entered the island\u2019s air defence identification zone within 24 hours on Monday \u2013 the largest reported incursion to date. \u201cAs long as Taiwan is strong enough, it will be the home of democracy and freedom all over the world, and it will not become a battlefield,\u201d President Tsai Ing-wen told a news conference after a national security council meeting. \u201cTaiwan wants to tell the world that between democracy and dictatorship, we firmly believe in democracy. Between war and peace, we insist on peace. Let us show the courage and determination to protect our homeland and defend democracy.\u201d The defence authority also plans to raise the monthly wage of regular conscription soldiers from about NT$6,500 (US$211) to NT$26,307 (US$856), almost in line with the minimum wage. Since 2013, Taiwan has required men over 18 to serve four months in the military, with the first five weeks in a basic training boot camp. The new plan will put mandatory recruits on eight-week basic training. Chen Chi-mai, mayor of Kaohsiung city and the acting chairperson of the ruling Democratic Progressive party, told reporters on Tuesday that it was essential to strengthen national security, the official news agency CNA reported. Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force, but China\u2019s growing assertiveness towards the island it claims as its own, as well as Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have prompted debate about how to boost defence. Tsai said \u201ca few things\u201d had been learned from that war which have been incorporated into Taiwan\u2019s defence reforms, and noted that Ukraine\u2019s ability to hold off much larger Russian forces had given the international community time to render assistance. Previous governments cut compulsory service for men from more than two years to four months to please younger voters during a period of easing tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan\u2019s efforts to bolster the readiness of its defence forces accelerated after the visit to the island from the US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, in August. China immediately staged military drills around Taiwan in response to Pelosi\u2019s visit. The de facto US embassy in Taiwan welcomed the announcement on conscription reform. \u201cThe United States\u2019 commitment to Taiwan and steps Taiwan takes to enhance its self-defence capabilities contribute to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region,\u201d the American Institute in Taiwan said. A survey conducted by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation in December found that 73.2% of respondents were in favour of an extension to compulsory service. Joseph Wu, Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, told the Guardian in an exclusive interview earlier this month that the Chinese military threat was \u201cgetting more serious than ever\u201d, with a five-fold increase in warplane incursions into the island\u2019s defence zone since 2020. Wu said the drills conducted after Pelosi\u2019s visit were also aimed at scaring off other governments which might support Taiwan. As part of the efforts to ramp up the island\u2019s combat strength, on Friday Tsai inaugurated new military facilities at an army base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, which she said offers \u201ca better living environment\u201d for military personnel, according to a statement released by the president office.

            "content": "UK ministers have pledged to end rough sleeping among military veterans next year after announcing more than \u00a38.8m to fund hundreds of supported housing places that had faced closure. Johnny Mercer, the minister for veterans affairs, and Rishi Sunak will host homeless former members of the armed forces, as well as charities at Downing Street on Wednesday to mark the launch of a scheme called Operation Fortitude. The scheme will enable veterans at risk of homelessness to access supported housing and wraparound specialist care in health, accommodation and education. Charities providing mental health support to vulnerable veterans of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq living in supported housing at Catterick barracks warned more than a year ago they were about to run out of money, leading to fears about a return to homelessness and lost lives. Mental health services at a housing facility there had to be cut when new funding was not immediately provided despite pleas to Sunak when he was chancellor. Those services could now be reinstated. When the Guardian reported the plight of the veterans, Dave Karan, 33, who did two tours of Afghanistan, 2008 and 2010, said: \u201cYou do your bit for Queen and country and then have mental issues and physical injuries and there is no support network. The veterans will be hit hard.\u201d The Riverside Group, a charity that operates the Catterick housing, had warned of the risk of collapse of the majority of supported housing services for veterans, undermining counselling and training for people with post-traumatic stress disorder and problems with substance or alcohol misuse. A total of 131 military veterans of all nationalities were counted sleeping rough in London between July and September this year \u2013 5% of the capital\u2019s rough sleeping population. Forty-three of them were UK nationals, according to figures from the Greater London authority. The money being pledged will fund services for two years in more than 900 supported housing units in England. A referral scheme will enable veterans at risk of homelessness to access supported housing and specialist help. Mercer said the funds would help bring forward by a year the government\u2019s target of ending rough sleeping among veterans by the end of 2024, which was announced when Boris Johnson was prime minister. Lee Buss-Blair, the director of operations for Riverside, said the funding would \u201cmake a significant difference to the lives of vulnerable veterans\u201d. \u201cNot only will it support the government\u2019s commitment to end veteran rough sleeping, but it will also provide organisations the resources to support veterans into work,\u201d he said. \u201cVeterans have so much to offer employers and communities, and thanks to this funding, providers will be far better placed to support them to realise their potential.\u201d Mercer said: \u201cNo one, not least those who have served this country, should be homeless. That\u2019s why today we are committing \u00a38.5m in funding and supporting a dedicated pathway, set up in collaboration with our charity partners, so veterans can not only get the housing support they need this Christmas, but also the vital backing required to help them get on their feet again.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-05T17:44:17Z",
            "content": "The explosions at the Engels-2 and Dyagilevo airbases, if confirmed as Ukraine\u2019s, would mark its deepest attack so far into Russia and against key military facilities used in the Kremlin\u2019s war. Engels-2 airbase The Soviet-era Engels-2 airbase, named after the Communist philosopher, Friedrich Engels, is home to Russia\u2019s 121st heavy bomber aviation regiment, which includes the Tu-95 and Tu-160 strategic bomber squadrons whose missiles have devastated Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. \u201cBased on the location of the airbase, its jets have played a major role in the recent bombings in Ukraine,\u201d said Rob Lee, a senior fellow at the US-based Foreign Policy Research Institute, of the Saratov region facility \u2013 450 miles east of Ukraine. Lee said any Ukrainian attack on the Engels-2 base was likely to be aimed at disrupting Russian plans to strike Ukrainian infrastructure. \u201cUkraine has been warning for weeks now that Russia was preparing for a fresh wave of missile attacks on its energy grid. This could have been a pre-emptive strike,\u201d he said. Citing satellite images from Engels-2, Der Spiegel last month reported that Russia was preparing a new large-scale missile attack on Ukraine. Lee estimated that Russia kept about 15 to 16 Tu-95MS bombers at the Engels-2 airbase and 15 Tu-160s, which represents the largest share of the country\u2019s Tu-160 arsenal. Gleb Irisov, a former Russian air force lieutenant who left the military in 2020, described Engels-2 as a \u201ckey airfield for the country\u2019s strategic aviation\u201d. \u201cIf indeed Ukraine managed to hit the base, it shows the country is making a lot of progress in their ability to reach bases far away from the battlefield.\u201d Dyagilevo airbase The airbase in Dyagilevo, less than 150 miles from Moscow, also houses the 121st heavy bomber aviation regiment whose jets are believed to have attacked Ukraine. It also serves as the base for Russia\u2019s only Il-78 tanker regiment, a strategically vital division responsible for the air-to-air refuelling of the country\u2019s military aviation. \u201cDestruction of strategic bombers will undoubtedly get more attention, but, if Russia loses Il-78 tanker aircraft, that might be the biggest issue for Moscow,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe production of new tanker aircraft is notoriously slow so this could turn out to be the most damaging part for Russia.\u201d Lee said that one of the main issues for the Russian air force was that many of its aircraft were not housed in hangars, leaving them exposed to attacks. \u201cIt is clear that Russia didn\u2019t prepare plans to defend airbases deep inside the country,\u201d Lee said. \u201cDespite the fact that this isn\u2019t the first attack on Russian soil, Moscow has been very slow to react and protect its jets.\u201d The explosions While it was not immediately clear what caused the explosion at either military base, Baza, a Russian media outlet with sources in the security services, reported that the Russian airfield at Engels-2 was attacked by a drone. Lee believes the drones would have been launched by Ukraine from within Russian territory. \u201cThe unmanned aerial vehicle attacks have a relatively short range and they wouldn\u2019t have been able to fly all that way from Ukraine,\u201d Lee said. The Israeli satellite imaging company ImageSat International shared images it said showed burn marks and objects near a Tu-22M aircraft at the Dyagilevo airbase: The explosion at the Engels-2 airfield led to anger among some prominent Russian pro-war bloggers who blamed the country\u2019s military for the inability to protect its airbases. \u201cThe sheep in the rear continue to demonstrate their absolute unsuitability \u2026 Even now, the airfields with strategic aviation are not covered by air defence systems,\u201d Voenniy Osvedomitel, a popular commentator, wrote on his Telegram channel."

            "date": "2022-12-13T16:59:09Z",
            "content": "Scientists have confirmed a major breakthrough has been made that could pave the way for abundant clean energy in the future after more than half a century of research into nuclear fusion. Researchers at the US National Ignition Facility in California said fusion experiments had released more energy than was pumped in by the lab\u2019s enormous, high-powered lasers, a landmark achievement known as ignition or energy gain. The technology is far from ready to turn into viable power plants \u2013 and is not about to solve the climate crisis \u2013 but scientists hailed the breakthrough as evidence that the power of the stars can be harnessed on Earth. Dr Arati Prabhakar, the policy director at the White House Office of Science and Technology, said: \u201cLast week \u2026 they shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers going in. This is such a tremendous example of what perseverance really can achieve.\u201d Fusion energy raises the prospect of plentiful clean power: the reactions release no greenhouse gases nor radioactive waste by-products. A single kilogram of fusion fuel, which is made up of heavy forms of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium, provides as much energy as 10m kilograms of fossil fuel. But it has taken 70 years to reach this point. Speaking at the announcement on Tuesday, Jill Hruby, of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), said the US had \u201ctaken the first tentative step towards a clean energy source that could revolutionise the world\u201d. The National Ignition Facility is a vast complex at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, near San Jose. It was built to perform experiments that recreate, briefly and in miniature, the processes unleashed inside nuclear bombs, enabling the US to maintain its nuclear warheads without the need for nuclear tests. But the experiments are also stepping stones towards clean fusion power. To achieve the reactions, researchers fire up to 192 giant lasers into a centimetre-long gold cylinder called a hohlraum. The intense energy heats the container to more than 3m degrees celcius \u2013 hotter than the surface of the sun \u2013 and bathes a peppercorn-sized fuel pellet inside in X-rays. The X-rays strip the surface off the pellet and trigger a rocket-like implosion, driving temperatures and pressures to extremes only seen inside stars, giant planets and nuclear detonations. The implosion reaches speeds of 400km per second and causes the deuterium and tritium to fuse. Each fusing pair of hydrogen nuclei produces a lighter helium nucleus, and a burst of energy according to Einstein\u2019s equation E=mc2. Deuterium is easily extracted from seawater, while tritium can be made from lithium which is found in the Earth\u2019s crust. In the latest experiment, researchers pumped in 2.05 megajoules of laser energy and got about 3.15MJ out \u2013 a roughly 50% gain and a sign that fusion reactions in the pellet were driving further fusion reactions. \u201cThe energy production took less time than it takes light to travel one inch,\u201d said Dr Marvin Adams, at the NNSA. Immense hurdles remain, however, in the quest for fusion power plants. While the pellet released more energy than the lasers put in, the calculation does not include the 300 or so megajoules needed to power up the lasers in the first place. The NIF lasers fire about once a day, but a power plant would need to heat targets 10 times per second. Then there is the cost of the targets. The ones used in the US experiment cost tens of thousands of dollars, but for a viable power plant, they would need to cost pence. Another issue is how to get the energy out as heat. Dr Kim Budil, the director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said with enough investment, a \u201cfew decades of research could put us in a position to build a power plant\u201d. A power plant based on alternative technology used at the Joint European Torus (JET) in Oxfordshire could be ready sooner, she added. \u201cIn some senses everything changes; in another, nothing changes,\u201d said Justin Wark, a professor of physics at the University of Oxford and the director of the Oxford Centre for High Energy Density Science. \u201cThis result proves what most physicists always believed \u2013 fusion in the laboratory is possible. However, the obstacles to be overcome to make anything like a commercial reactor are huge, and must not be underestimated.\u201d He said that asking how long it could take to overcome the challenges was like asking the Wright brothers how long it would take to build a plane to cross the Atlantic just after their maiden flight. \u201cI understand that everyone wants to think of this as being the great solution to the energy crisis. It is not, and whoever says it is with any certainty is misleading. \u201cIt is highly unlikely that fusion will impact on a timescale sufficiently short to impact our current climate change crisis, so there must be no let up on our efforts in that regard. \u201cThe latest results also show that the basic science works \u2013 the laws of physics do not prevent us from achieving the goal \u2013 the problems are technical and economic. As Niels Bohr, the Nobel prize-winning atomic physicist once said: \u2018Prediction is very difficult, especially when it is about the future.\u2019\u201d Dr Mark Wenman, a reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, called the achievement a \u201cfantastic scientific breakthrough \u2013 something we have not achieved in 70 years of trying\u201d. But he said: \u201cChallenges remain of how you can get the energy out of the system, how you can sustain the energy for long enough to be useful, how you scale up that energy and whether the energy can be cheap enough to compete with other sources.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-12T19:15:23Z",
            "content": "Researchers have reportedly made a breakthrough in the quest to unlock a \u201cnear-limitless, safe, clean\u201d source of energy: they have got more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than they put in. Nuclear fusion involves smashing together light elements such as hydrogen to form heavier elements, releasing a huge burst of energy in the process. The approach, which gives rise to the heat and light of the sun and other stars, has been hailed as having huge potential as a sustainable, low-carbon energy source. However, since nuclear fusion research began in the 1950s, researchers have been unable to a demonstrate a positive energy gain, a condition known as ignition. That was, it seems, until now. According to a report in the Financial Times, which has yet to be confirmed by the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that is behind the work, researchers have managed to release 2.5 MJ of energy after using just 2.1 MJ to heat the fuel with lasers. Dr Robbie Scott, of the Science and Technology Facilities Council\u2019s (STFC) Central Laser Facility (CLF) Plasma Physics Group, who contributed to this research, described the results as a \u201cmomentous achievement\u201d. \u201cFusion has the potential to provide a near-limitless, safe, clean, source of carbon-free baseload energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seminal result from the National Ignition Facility is the first laboratory demonstration of fusion \u2018energy-gain\u2019 \u2013 where more fusion energy is output than input by the laser beams. The scale of the breakthrough for laser fusion research cannot be overstated. \u201cThe experiment demonstrates unambiguously that the physics of Laser Fusion works,\u201d he added. \u201cIn order to transform NIF\u2019s result into power production a lot of work remains, but this is a key step along the path.\u201d Prof Jeremy Chittenden, professor of plasma physics at Imperial College London, agreed. \u201cIf what has been reported is true and more energy has been released than was used to produce the plasma, that is a true breakthrough moment which is tremendously exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt proves that the long sought-after goal, the \u2018holy grail\u2019 of fusion, can indeed be achieved.\u201d But experts have stressed that while the results would be an important proof of principle, the technology is a long way from being a mainstay of the energy landscape. To start with, 0.4MJ is about 0.1kWh \u2013 about enough energy to boil a kettle. \u201cTo turn fusion into a power source we\u2019ll need to boost the energy gain still further,\u201d said Chittenden. \u201cWe\u2019ll also need to find a way to reproduce the same effect much more frequently and much more cheaply before we can realistically turn this into a power plant.\u201d Prof Justin Wark, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, added that while, in principle, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory could produce such a result about once a day, a fusion power plant would need to do it 10 times a second. And there is another point: the positive energy gain reported ignores the 500MJ of energy that was put into the lasers themselves. However, Chittenden stressed the NIF was designed for a scientific demonstration, not as a power plant. \u201cThe efficiency of converting electrical energy to laser energy was not a factor in its design,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone working in fusion would be quick to point out that there is still a long way to go from demonstrating energy gain to getting to wall-plug efficiency where the energy coming from a fusion reactor exceeds its electrical energy input required to run the reactor,\u201d he added. \u201cThe experiments on NIF demonstrate the scientific process of ignition and how this leads to high fusion energy gain, but to turn this into a power station we need to develop simpler methods to reach these conditions, which will need to be more efficient and above all cheaper in order for inertial fusion to be realised as a fusion power source.\u201d The latest results, if true, top the last big breakthrough by the facility which came just last year when it was announced that the team had hit 70% of the laser energy put in to the experiment released as nuclear energy. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 December 2022 to replace a Rubicon reference, on usage grounds."

            "content": "Physicists are a-buzz over new results from nuclear fusion experiments. But what have they found, and how big a breakthrough is it? What is nuclear fusion? We experience nuclear fusion every day \u2013 it is the process that gives rise to the heat and light of the sun and other stars. In brief, it involves light atoms being smashed together to produce heavier ones, releasing vast amounts of energy in the process. To do this ourselves takes some serious engineering. At the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, a weak laser beam is split and the energy amplified to give 192 laser beams. These are used to heat the walls of a small gold can, called a hohlraum, to more than 3m degrees Celsius, resulting in the emission of X-rays. These X-rays heat a millimetre-sized capsule within the hohlraum that contains two forms of hydrogen: deuterium and tritium. The heat causes the surface of the capsule to explode outwards, forcing its contents to implode \u2013 in other words, the deuterium and tritium are forced together rapidly at very high pressure and temperature. The upshot is that, in the hottest part of the fuel, fusion occurs, resulting in the formation of helium nuclei. As one helium nucleus has slightly less mass than the combination of one deuterium and one tritium nucleus, the difference in mass is released as a burst of energy. In the right conditions the helium nuclei produced in this process can transfer their kinetic energy to the remaining fuel, heating it up and triggering yet more fusion. Should this happen, it becomes possible to release more energy than was put into the experiment by the lasers, a condition known as ignition. What just happened? Researchers at the NIF have announced that, for the first time, they have managed to do just that. The team used 2.05MJ of energy to heat the fuel with lasers, releasing 3.15MJ of energy. Is that a lot of energy? No, not really. The difference \u2013 1.1MJ \u2013 is about 0.3kWh. It takes about 0.2kWh to boil a full kettle of water. Why is everyone so excited? Nuclear fusion research has been going on for 70 years and this is the first time scientists have managed to demonstrate ignition \u2013 a positive energy gain. The results show that it is indeed possible to use laser fusion to generate energy \u2013 a crucial proof of principle that will spur on research to develop the technology. That matters because it is hoped nuclear fusion will eventually provide a near-limitless, safe and clean source of energy. How far away are we from powering our homes via nuclear fusion? Miles. And miles. Only a small amount of excess energy was generated in the latest experiments \u2013 and it took a lot of energy, around 500MJ, to power the lasers in the first place. Such reactions would also need to happen at a much greater frequency \u2013 about 10 times a second \u2013 and be far cheaper to run before nuclear fusion could actually be used to power even a kettle. Jeremy Chittenden, a professor of plasma physics at Imperial College London, told the Guardian: \u201cAnyone working in fusion would be quick to point out that there is still a long way to go from demonstrating energy gain to getting to wall-plug efficiency where the energy coming from a fusion reactor exceeds its electrical energy input required to run the reactor. \u201cThe experiments on NIF demonstrate the scientific process of ignition and how this leads to high fusion energy gain, but to turn this into a power station we need to develop simpler methods to reach these conditions, which will need to be more efficient and above all cheaper in order for inertial fusion to be realised as a fusion power source.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-12T05:00:52Z",
            "content": "The Russian shell that struck in the night had taken away the wall of a top-floor apartment, and in its place was just freezing air blowing off the Dnieper River \u2013 and a view of Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear power station on the other bank. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant\u2019s silhouette \u2013 with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks \u2013 has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war. On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time. After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant. By the next morning, the repairs had already begun. An electrician restored power to the rest of the building, and two men were in the remains of the apartment itself, sweeping up and putting chipboard in place of absent walls. There were four loud bangs as the Ukrainian army guns on the nearby riverbank opened fire on Russian positions and, a few minutes later, Nikopol\u2019s air sirens sounded in anticipation of a Russian response, though none was forthcoming that morning. The basements of the krushchevky have been turned into shelters with beds and school desks but most of the remaining population are so inured to bombardment, they just carry on with their day. The Ukrainians insist they are extremely careful about what they shoot at, even when they receive fire from the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant. On Thursday, the Ukrainian nuclear power company, Energoatom, accused Russia of bringing Grad multiple launch rocket systems near reactor number 6, which is near the area of where spent nuclear fuel is kept. The likely aim, Energoatom alleged, was to shell Nikopol and the nearby town of Marzanets, using their position as cover. The walls of the reactors are thick enough to withstand artillery fire, but a direct hit on the spent fuel containers could well lead to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Since seizing control of the power station in March, the Russians have begun building a concrete shelter over the spent fuel, but Ukrainian officials say it is being done without following the normal international safety protocols. Earlier in the week, Russia\u2019s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine of \u201cnuclear terrorism\u201d, saying its armed forces had fired 33 large calibre shells at the Zaporizhzhia plant over the previous two weeks. The most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has four inspectors at the Russian-occupied site, said last Friday there had been no shelling of the plant since 20 November, although artillery fire had landed in the vicinity. Petro Kotin, Energoatom\u2019s president, claims that the bombardments of the area around the nuclear reactors are false flag attacks carried out by Russian occupation forces. \u201cThey have two special trucks, which we know have mortars inside, which go into the forest and each time they go there, there is shelling around the plant,\u201d Kotin told the Guardian. Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, the town next to the nuclear plant that is home to its workers, claimed there was additional evidence that the shelling was coming from the Russian side. \u201cYou can hear the outgoing bang of the shooting and then the two or three seconds later the shell lands, so it is coming from very close and there aren\u2019t any Ukrainian forces that close,\u201d Orlov said in an interview on the Ukrainian side of the lines in the city of Zaporizhzhia where he continues his duties in exile. \u201cMy personal opinion is that this is to scare the local population so the Russians can tell them: \u201cYou see \u2013 we\u2019re protecting you and it\u2019s the Ukrainians who are shelling you.\u201d It was not possible to verify Kotin and Orlov\u2019s accounts of the shelling, or the counter-claims from Moscow. Satellite imagery however, has confirmed that the Russian army is storing military equipment inside the plant. The IAEA inspectors on site could theoretically determine the trajectory of incoming rockets or shells but such detective work is not within their mandate. The agency is negotiating the creation of a security no-fire zone around the reactors, but Kyiv is insisting Russia must first withdraw all its weapons and armour from the power station, something Moscow has not so far agreed to. Meanwhile there is a parallel safety threat from within the plant itself: the steady attrition of its workforce over the 10 months of the conflict. Many key workers have left because of the danger to their families or because they refused to work for the Russians. Of the 11,000-strong workforce before the full-scale invasion, just 4,000 are left. In an attempt to stop the exodus, the Russians have circulated lists of plant staff to all military checkpoints in the region with orders they are not be allowed to leave, but it has been too late to stop a major outflow. \u201cIn some cases, there\u2019s only three people to cover a seven or eight-person shift,\u201d Orlov said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have enough rest. It causes exhaustion.\u201d Operating under armed occupation adds to the stress. The workers still at the plant are under constant pressure to sign contracts with Rosatom, the Russian energy company, signifying acceptance of Moscow\u2019s control. \u201cThey take the workers aside one at a time, and the first question they ask is about the whereabouts of their families. They put pressure on through their family. One worker was questioned for eight hours,\u201d Oleksii Melynchuk, a former worker at the nuclear power plant, said. Despite that pressure, he said, only about 10% of the staff at the plant have signed Rosatom contracts. In recent days, the Russians have deactivated the electronic passes of some of the workers who have refused to sign, reducing the pool of available reactor operators even further. Melynchuk said there were just enough staff left to maintain the plant in its current state of suspended animation, with all the reactors shut down, and two of them deliberately kept hot, to provide heating for Enerhodar. But keeping reactors in this hot standby mode is a difficult and delicate process, adding to the burden on the operators. The situation could get worse still. The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, but there have been times the transmission lines have been brought down by shelling, forcing the power station to fall back on diesel generators to keep the cooling system running and prevent the reactor vessel from meltdown. If the connection to the grid was severed again, it would add to the pressure on the overstretched workforce and on the generators, which were only designed as a temporary backup. They will need maintenance and no one knows how much diesel fuel the plant has left. Once the diesel generators failed, meltdown would begin in a matter of hours. \u201cThose remaining at their posts are doing impossible things to keep the plant safe. They have proved their professionalism to the entire world,\u201d Melynchuk said. \u201cEven without the occupation, it would be very hard physically and psychologically to operate the station with the current staffing levels. But if you add the pressure from the occupiers, then it just gets harder.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-14T13:48:17Z",
            "content": "For decades, western Europe\u2019s national healthcare systems have been widely touted as among the best in the world. But an ageing population, more long-term illnesses, a continuing recruitment and retainment crisis plus post-Covid exhaustion have combined, this winter, to create a perfect healthcare storm that is likely to get worse before it gets better. \u201cAll countries of the region face severe problems related to their health and care workforce,\u201d the World Health Organization\u2019s Europe region said in a report earlier this year, warning of potentially dire consequences without urgent government action. In France, there are fewer doctors now than in 2012. More than 6 million people, including 600,000 with chronic illnesses, do not have a regular GP and 30% of the population does not have adequate access to health services. In Germany, 35,000 care sector posts were vacant last year, 40% more than a decade ago, while a report this summer said that by 2035 more than a third of all health jobs could be unfilled. Facing unprecedented hospital overcrowding due to \u201ca severe shortage of nurses\u201d, even Finland will need 200,000 new workers in the health and social care sector by 2030. In Spain, the health ministry announced in May that more than 700,000 people were waiting for surgery, and 5,000 frontline GPs and paediatricians in Madrid have been on strike for nearly a month in protest at years of underfunding and overwork. Efforts to replace retiring workers were already \u201csuboptimal\u201d, the WHO Europe report said, but had to now be urgently extended to \u201cimprove retention and tackle an expected increase in younger people leaving the workforce due to burnout, ill health and general dissatisfaction\u201d. In a third of countries in the region, at least 40% of doctors were aged 55 or over, the report said. Even when younger practitioners stayed despite stress, long hours and often low pay, their reluctance to work in remote rural areas or deprived inner cities had created \u201cmedical deserts\u201d that were proving almost impossible to fill. \u201cAll of these threats represent a ticking time bomb \u2026 likely to lead to poor health outcomes, long waiting times, many preventable deaths and potentially even health system collapse,\u201d warned Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe. In some countries the worst shortages are among GPs, with France in particular paying the price for previous planning errors. Back in 1971, it capped the number of second-year medical students through a so-called numerus clausus aimed at cutting health spending and raising earnings. The result was a collapse in annual student numbers \u2013 from 8,600 in the early 1970s, to 3,500 in 1993 \u2013 and while intakes have since climbed somewhat and the cap was lifted altogether two years ago, it will take years for the size of the workforce to recover. Even though 10% of France\u2019s GPs now work past retirement age, older doctors leaving the profession outnumbered newcomers entering it last year, when numbers were still 6% down on what they were even a decade ago. It could be 2035 before the country reaches a satisfactory ratio of doctors to inhabitants nationally. Local provision, however, is another matter: GP ratios range from 125 or more per 100,000 people in some wealthier neighbourhoods to less than half that in remote rural France or deprived suburbs such as Seine-Saint-Denis. \u201cIn fact, about 87% of France could be called a medical desert,\u201d the junior health minister Agn\u00e8s Firmin Le Bodo said last month, pledging a \u201ccomplete rebuild\u201d of GP services through more multi-function health centres and remote consultations \u2013 but no obligation, as yet, on doctors to set up in poorly provisioned areas. This winter\u2019s flu epidemic, coming on top of Covid-19, had exposed the system\u2019s failings, creating \u201ca crisis not just for France\u2019s hospital sector but for all of French healthcare\u201d, said Arnaud Robinet of the French Hospitals Federation, warning that the service was \u201cno longer capable of responding systematically\u201d to emergencies. In Germany, which spends more on healthcare than almost any other country in the world, hospitals are a greater concern, with this winter\u2019s wave of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in young children triggering alarm across the country. Amid reports of overcrowded casualty departments and parents forced to sleep in hospital corridors or travel hundreds of kilometres for a child\u2019s treatment, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung said the country was witnessing \u201cwhat it means when a system implodes \u2026 in scenes which for a long time might have seemed unimaginable\u201d. In a petition to parliament titled: \u201cAlert level red \u2013 hospitals in danger\u201d, the German Hospital Society (DKG) again highlighted a chronic lack of staff as the main problem, noting that many hospitals had had to temporarily close casualty departments due to a lack of doctors and nurses. More than 23,000 posts remain unfilled in Germany\u2019s hospitals after several years of low recruitment and recent mass resignations, particularly in intensive care and operating theatres, by staff citing a workload so extreme that some were unable to take even a short break or go to the toilet. The health minister, Karl Lauterbach, has announced a \u20ac300m (\u00a3260m) aid package for paediatric clinics and an as yet unspecified \u201crevolution in hospital care\u201d putting \u201cmedicine first rather than the economics\u201d, plus a plan to move nurses and doctors around to match demand that was dismissed as \u201cabsurd\u201d by leading medics. \u201cThe problem is we have no wards that could do without staff, because they\u2019re all already only able to offer the minimum level of care,\u201d said Christine Vogler of the German Council of Nursing (DPR). \u201cThis can only be called an act of desperation.\u201d Christoph Spinner, a consultant in infectious diseases at Munich\u2019s University Clinic, said the country\u2019s health system was \u201cwithout doubt facing enormous challenges\u201d, while a paediatrician, Nina Schoetzau, said the state of Britain\u2019s NHS was \u201ca taste of things to come\u201d for Germany. In Spain, the winter has already prompted overstretched frontline staff to take strike action. The healthcare crisis, laid bare during the Covid pandemic, follows decades of under-investment, competition between regions for medical staff, and the lure of better pay and conditions abroad. Much of the discontent has focused on the Madrid region, where in mid-November at least 200,000 people took to the streets to defend public healthcare against creeping privatisation and to express concern over the regional government\u2019s restructuring of the primary care system. \u00c1ngela Hern\u00e1ndez, a surgeon and general secretary of Madrid\u2019s AMYTS medical association, said the situation in paediatric services was \u201cpractically desperate\u201d, adding that it was also \u201cabout demand: no one is telling people that if resources are limited, services have to be used wisely\u201d. Politicians had a responsibility to \u201cexplain the situation to people\u201d, Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cBut because they do the exact opposite in Madrid and in Spain, they raise people\u2019s expectations.\u201d The Metges de Catalunya (Doctors of Catalonia) union also plans a two-day strike next month to protest against \u201coverload, disdain and precariousness\u201d. Xavier Lleonart, its general secretary, said the pandemic was \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d but the current situation was as foreseeable as it was depressing. Some Spanish doctors were so burned out they were taking early retirement, despite the hit to their pensions, he said, adding that the chief imperative was to make the profession more attractive to stop the \u201chaemorrhage\u201d of professionals. \u201cPeople say the best capital a company has is its human capital,\u201d Lleonart said. \u201cThe problem is that in health the human capital has been systematically mistreated until it has said: enough\u2019s enough.\u201d Italy\u2019s public health service, too, faces serious staff shortages, compounded by the pandemic, which triggered an exodus of staff from the profession, taking early retirement, or switching to roles in the private sector. Regional governments have signed contracts with freelance medics to cover hospital shifts where needed, highlighting the low salaries of Italy\u2019s public health sector. \u201cThere are holes that need to be filled everywhere, especially in emergency units,\u201d said Giovanni Leoni, vice-president of an Italian doctors\u2019 federation. \u201cThe issue is that freelances earn two to three times more \u2013 up to \u20ac1,200 for a 10-hour shift.\u201d Many medics had left public sector roles \u201cbefore their time\u201d, Leoni added. \u201cThey have found other types of jobs in the private sector \u2013 roles that mean they don\u2019t have to do night shifts, or weekends.\u201d Italian medics are holding a demonstration of \u201cthe invisibles\u201d later this week. \u201cWe\u2019re invisible for the government,\u201d said Leoni. \u201cSalaries for Italian doctors need to be at the same level as those in Europe. Currently, they\u2019re among the lowest.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 19 December 2022 to make it clear that the 200,000 figure needed in Finland by 2030 includes social care workers as well as health care workers."

            "date": "2022-12-01T07:00:39Z",
            "content": "Howard Brown Health, a nonprofit community health center in Chicago that is the largest provider of health and wellness care for the LGBTQ+ community and people living with HIV in the midwest, has announced it wants to lay off at least 100 employees, or about 15% of staff. The layoffs were proposed as voluntary in the first instance, but the company says \u201ca reduction in workforce is required\u201d, suggesting that if 100 volunteers are not found then layoffs will be compulsory. They come at a time of high-profile attacks on queer and trans healthcare across the country. Jobs lost would include roles in behavioral health, health education, PrEp navigation, Covid testing and other teams. Many of the roles are filled by union members, following Howard Brown employees\u2019 decision to form a union in August of this year. After hearing rumors of layoffs, the union raised its concern with management and was told in a written reply on 9 November that \u201cthere is no current plan or decision to layoff any union members\u201d. The first indication otherwise was 10 days later, on 19 November. In a letter to employees from the board of directors citing financial strain, Howard Brown outlined a goal \u201cto recover $12m in our annual operating budget\u201d and said it would \u201cconsider all available measures\u201d in order to do so. Union members said they met with management later that day, which is when the organization proposed a \u201cvoluntary separation\u201d package of one week\u2019s severance pay per year of service for employees to leave their jobs. Despite Howard Brown claiming rough financial straits, data from ProPublica shows that in 2021 the organization brought in $30m more than it spent and that the chief executive, David Munar, earned a salary of more than $300,000. Many employees argue that Howard Brown should cut funds elsewhere before considering losing employees. They point to the construction of a new $19.5m clinic in North Halsted, where Howard Brown already has a clinic. Union members said they are refusing to negotiate until management reveals the 2022 financial books. \u201cAs a union member, I would never accept that workers need to quit their jobs if it is not necessary for the organization to stay alive,\u201d said Margo Gislain, a lead organizer of the Howard Brown Union. \u201cHoward Brown refuses to show us their 2022 financial books and therefore has been unable to convince us that these layoffs are financially necessary. We want to be able to see the organization\u2019s finances so we can make suggestions of other budget cuts that don\u2019t involve losing workers.\u201d Several Howard Brown employees said they find the timing of the layoffs suspicious, coming mere months after the organization unionized. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind this is retaliatory,\u201d said Gislain, saying that many of the potential cuts would affect union members, \u201cmany of whom were highly involved as organizers\u201d. The past few years have seen widespread cuts to queer and trans healthcare across the nation as states ban or limit access to gender affirming care. As the largest public health center for queer people in the midwest, Howard Brown serves not only the LGBTQ+ population of Chicago but those in surrounding states who travel to receive care. Employees said they are already overworked and understaffed, and fear a smaller workforce would be overwhelmed and unable to provide swift patient care. Shakia Flowers, a behavioral health provider and a member of the union\u2019s bargaining committee representing Englewood\u2019s 63rd Street clinic, said that during her four years at Howard Brown there has always been a wait list for behavioral health treatment. The layoff strategy would cut the behavioral health team in half, leaving only four specialists to serve 30,000 annual patients. Erik Roldan, director of marketing and communications for Howard Brown, blamed \u201cdrastic reductions in federal dollars\u201d for what he said was a $12m revenue gap. \u201cSpecifically, the agency\u2019s revenue shortfall since the beginning of the new fiscal year July 1 comes from changes to the 340B pharmacy program,\u201d he said. \u201cSince 2020, 18 pharmaceutical manufacturers \u2013 including Eli Lilly, Merck, and Gilead \u2013 have restricted or eliminated access to 340B priced drugs through contract pharmacy partners, with 8 manufacturers specifically targeting FQHC contract pharmacies. These changes are putting a strain on the agency\u2019s finances, requiring a reduction in operating expenses.\u201d Roldan said the organization was exploring other ways of cutting spending at the same time as layoffs, that no layoffs would occur before 1 January and that they would be subject to bargaining with the union. Howard Brown employees have planned a public protest for Saturday and are accepting solidarity donations. \u201cThese layoffs would deeply impact the communities we\u2019re serving, which are already vulnerable,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about queer people, Black and brown people, the uninsured, the impoverished. It\u2019s so vitally important for these patients to come here and see providers they can relate to, who can understand their plight, and who can be their support system when they don\u2019t have one.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-06T07:00:05Z",
            "content": "The parents of a 25-year-old man left to die in a cell by a negligent prison nurse given responsibility for 800 inmates have told how the conditions in which their son died will haunt them for ever. The case \u2013 the 27th death in just five years at HMP Nottingham \u2013 was said to illustrate the desperate state of Britain\u2019s understaffed and increasingly dangerous prison system. Alex Braund, a pub chef and keen rugby player, was being held on remand awaiting trial when he fell ill in his cell with the first signs of pneumonia on 6 March 2020. Four days later, on the morning of 10 March, after a series of ill-fated attempts by Braund\u2019s cellmate to get prison staff to take the situation seriously, the young man collapsed. Prison staff responded to an emergency bell rung by Braund\u2019s cellmate at 6.55am, but they initially only looked through the cell hatch, taking five minutes to enter the cell in order to give CPR. Braund was subsequently taken to Queen\u2019s medical centre in Nottingham, where he was pronounced dead at 11.44am of cardiac arrest caused by pneumonia. The jury at an inquest at Nottinghamshire coroner\u2019s court found there had been a \u201ccontinuous failure to provide adequate healthcare\u201d, with a prison officer told by a nurse a few hours before Braund\u2019s death that there was \u201cnothing to be done at this time of night\u201d. Questioning during the hearing revealed that the nurse, who has since lost her job and been reported to the nursing and midwifery council, had amended her records on the morning of Braund\u2019s death. The assistant coroner Laurinda Bower has said she intends to refer the case to the police in relation to possible offences of falsifying medical records and perjury. Braund\u2019s mother, Deborah Grange, 57, a local government officer from Matlock in Derbyshire, said the eight days of the hearing into her son\u2019s death had been harrowing. \u201cI was expecting it to be bad but it did not prepare me for what we had to watch and listen to,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been living with Alex\u2019s most final moments, you know, he spoke to his girlfriend in the early hours. There was a feeling of abandonment, you know, sort of, you\u2019re just doomed, you know, destined to end your days in that cell. That will haunt me for ever.\u201d Braund\u2019s father, Tim Braund, 58, who also works in local government, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re interested in is trying to make sure nobody else suffers. Having heard the coroner, we have to be sceptical about the organisation\u2019s willingness to improve.\u201d HMP Nottingham was described in an inspectorate report in 2020 as having had for \u201cmany years\u201d a \u201cwell-deserved reputation for being an unsafe prison\u201d. One 80-year-old prisoner was throttled to death with a sheet in 2016 while watching snooker in his cell, and another in 2018 was stabbed to death with plastic cutlery, strangled with a ligature made from shoelaces and suffocated with a plastic bag. The latest inspectorate report from July 2022 found that levels of violence had stabilised, with some signs of progress in other areas, but warned that \u201chealth services had become stretched since our last inspection, with staff shortages affecting service delivery\u201d. Braund had been remanded into the institution on 13 February 2020 after being charged with possession of a bladed article. His parents said their son had become mixed up with people selling recreational drugs but that he had denied carrying a weapon. \u201cBut he was present when other people were involved in stuff they shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d his father said. \u201cObviously he never got around to being tried for it.\u201d Braund started to feel unwell on 6 March. The following day he reported coughing up brown phlegm. A diagnosis of a common cold was made. His chest was not examined with a stethoscope and \u201cprobing questions were not asked\u201d, the inquest heard. At 10.22pm on 9 March, the night before his death, the emergency cell bell was activated. Braund was said to have appeared scared. His request to go to hospital was denied and basic checks were not carried out. He was told that an appointment to see a doctor would be made for the following morning. Contrary to the evidence initially given to the hearing by a prison officer, the inquest found there were no further observations of Braund between 10.52pm and 5.35am the following day, when the emergency cell bell was run again by his cellmate. The nurse still did not visit Braund. At 6.55am, the cell bell was called again and Hill started shouting for help. The cell door was finally opened at 7am, and a 999 call was made a minute later. Lucy McKay, a spokesperson for the charity Inquest, said: \u201cAlex was neglected by a prison which has a long record of failing to protect the health and wellbeing of those who are owed a duty of care. He was also failed in death by staff who lied about their actions, and investigators who failed to address this.\u201d A Prison Service spokesperson said: \u201cOur thoughts remain with Mr Braund\u2019s family and friends. Since this tragic incident we have introduced extra training for staff responding to medical emergencies. We will consider the jury\u2019s findings and respond to the coroner\u2019s recommendations in due course.\u201d"

            "content": "New Zealand will launch an official inquiry into its Covid-19 response so that future governments are better prepared to deal with pandemics, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced. The government announced the royal commission of inquiry \u2013 to be chaired by Australian-based epidemiologist Prof Tony Blakely, former cabinet minister Hekia Parata and former treasury secretary John Whitehead \u2013 on Monday afternoon. It will begin in February 2023 and be completed in mid-2024, Ardern told a media briefing. \u201cA royal commission of inquiry is the highest form of public inquiry and is the right thing to do, given the Covid-19 emergency was the most significant threat to the health of New Zealanders and our economy since world war two,\u201d Ardern said, adding that while every country grappled with the virus, there was no playbook for managing it. \u201cIt had been over 100 years since we experienced a pandemic of this scale, so it\u2019s critical we compile what worked and what we can learn from it should it ever happen again.\u201d The inquiry will look at the overall response between February 2020 and October 2022, including the policy settings required to support the public health response, as well as what can be learned and how that can be applied to any future pandemics. \u201cNew Zealand experienced fewer cases, hospitalisations and deaths than nearly any other country in the first two years of the pandemic but there has undoubtedly been a huge impact on New Zealanders both here and abroad,\u201d Ardern said. New Zealand\u2019s strict Covid-19 response was broadly considered one of the most successful in the world, with a low Covid-19 mortality rate through the first 18 months of the pandemic until vaccines became widely available. Life-expectancy actually increased during this period. But the announcement comes at a time when the country is experiencing a surge of Covid-19 cases with very few restrictions still in place. On Monday, the ministry of health announced 34,528 new community cases for the week, compared to 27,076 cases in the week prior. There have been a total of 2,235 deaths attributed to the virus in New Zealand since the pandemic began. According to the terms of reference, the commission may assess whether the government\u2019s initial elimination strategy and later minimisation and protection strategy \u2013 as well as supporting economic and other measures \u2013 were effective in limiting the spread of infection. It will also consider whether the strategies were effective in limiting the impact of the virus on vulnerable groups and the health system, while taking into account the strategies adopted by comparable jurisdictions. It will not consider individual responses such as particular clinical decisions made by medical professionals, or decisions from independent entities such as the Reserve Bank. Subjects like vaccine efficacy and the epidemiology of the virus will also not be considered. The Green party, National and Act have regularly called on the government to launch an inquiry into its Covid response, as well as the economic decisions it, and the Reserve Bank made, which they believe helped lead to stubbornly high inflation and increased inequality. A key proponent of New Zealand\u2019s elimination strategy, Otago University epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker, told the NZ Herald he was \u201cdelighted\u201d at the announcement. Baker, who had also called for a royal commission, said the inquiry would be \u201ca great opportunity for all of us to be better prepared\u201d for future pandemics."

            "content": "US public health officials are bracing for a possible Covid-19 surge in the coming weeks following indoor holiday gatherings among a populace that has largely abandoned preventive measures. Concerns over this uptick come amid rising influenza and RSV cases in America. This so-called \u201ctripledemic\u201d, experts warn, could further strain the already overburdened US health system. Evidence of an increase emerged in earnest after Thanksgiving, celebrated on 24 November this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s weekly new case data reported on 30 November stood at 308,578, rising to 470,963 in the 7 December report. In the 14 December weekly report, that number dipped to 455,028 \u2013 but ballooned to 487, 367 in the 21 December analysis. Hospitalization admissions are also on the rise. The seven-day average from 15 to 21 December was 5,376, compared to 5,052 the prior week. Data shows this increase has been in motion since late October, following several months of declines, according to the CDC. This increase is being felt in different ways across the US. In Florida, Covid hospitalizations across the state remain around three-month peaks, fueled by Omicron subvariants,the Palm Beach Post reported. Across Washington, DC\u2019s metropolitan area, cases have gone up since Thanksgiving, but they have not reached levels seen during the 2021 holiday season, when Omicron started to take hold across the US, according to the Washington Post. Analysis of wastewater in Houston, Texas, suggests that there is a \u201cmini-surge\u201d that comes in conjunction with the growing prevalence of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 omicron subvariants, the Houston Chronicle reported. While these numbers pale in comparison to the winter 2022 peak in the US \u2013 with more than 5.6m new cases reported the week of 19 January \u2013 officials are working to thwart this upward trend. Joe Biden announced on 15 December that his administration was re-starting a program that sends free Covid-19 tests to US households through the mail service. The White House said that officials were poised to support healthcare staffing needs across the US, and that medical supplies from the national strategic stockpile were ready to ship if necessary. Although the US is staring down a possible seasonal increase, it appears that many are not all that worried. Just 14.6% of US residents aged five and up have received their updated booster dose, which is said to provide greater protection against Omicron variants, CDC data indicate. There have been nearly 1.1m Covid-19 deaths in the US. More than 100m cases have been reported, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

            "content": "Formula One has confirmed the cancellation of the 2023 Chinese Grand Prix because of continuing Covid restrictions. The meeting was to form part of a record 24-race season next year and F1 is in negotiations with venues interested in stepping in to replace the Shanghai race. The Chinese GP was due to take place on 16 April but that was always dependent on China\u2019s strict Covid policies, particularly in relation to teams and personnel being able to enter the country and function with sufficient ease to hold the race. F1 has not raced in China since 2019 because of the country\u2019s zero-Covid policy. On Friday F1 formally announced the conditions required to go racing could not be met. \u201cFormula 1 can confirm, following dialogue with the promoter and relevant authorities, that the 2023 Chinese Grand Prix will not take place due to the ongoing difficulties presented by the Covid-19 situation,\u201d said their statement. The cancellation leaves a significant gap of up to four weeks in the calendar. The race was due to take place between the Australian GP on 2 April and the Baku GP on 30 April. F1 is already in discussion with potential replacements to bridge what would be a major break in the calendar, potentially losing momentum after the first three rounds of the season. However, a decision is not expected until the new year. It is understood F1 had requested Baku move its race forward but the race organisers wanted to stick to their previously agreed date. A number of other tracks are believed to be interested in taking the slot, with an additional race in Europe most likely to be chosen. However, that too would create additional cost and complexity in returning freight from Australia back to Europe and then on to Azerbaijan. Portim\u00e3o in Portugal, which stood in twice during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and proved popular with teams and drivers, is believed to be the most likely candidate. Turkey\u2019s Istanbul circuit also hosted races during Covid-affected seasons and Paul Ricard in France remains a possibility having hosted a race last year but with no place on the calendar in 2023. The Portuguese F1 commentator Jo\u00e3o Carlos Costa implied on Twitter on Thursday that the negotiations with Portim\u00e3o were already at an advanced stage and expected it to be confirmed shortly. \u201cPortugal once again on the F1 route,\u201d he wrote. \u201cImminent decision - Portim\u00e3o should replace China in the 2023 calendar. Small details are missing, to be resolved before the FIA World Council, scheduled for December 9, in Bologna. Portuguese fans, what a Christmas gift!\u201d If the meeting was held there it would mark the 15th anniversary of the Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional do Algarve. F1 made no comment on the potential replacements but it is understood it will only opt to add another meeting if a suitable and logistically acceptable venue is found. \u201cFormula 1 is assessing alternative options to replace the slot on the 2023 calendar and will provide an update on this in due course,\u201d it said."

In both choirs we complied fully with the Covid regulations (albeit through gritted teeth) and operated risk-management plans, but inevitably some singers gave up and have not returned. It was galling to watch a badminton club holding indoor sessions in June 2021 while we, as an amateur choir of 150 members, were relegated to an outdoor rehearsal with limited numbers. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport did nothing to support communal choral singing despite strong representations from Making Music (the National Federation of Music Societies) while amateur sport groups were allowed to meet indoors.

            "date": "2022-12-13T14:32:03Z",
            "content": "Children\u2019s recovery from the pandemic is being held back by a workforce crisis in schools, colleges and early years, with children who have special education needs among those worst affected, according to England\u2019s schools inspectorate, Ofsted. Publishing her annual report on Tuesday, Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said the Covid pandemic continued to \u201ccast a long shadow\u201d over children\u2019s education and social care, and despite teachers\u2019 best efforts, recovery was \u201cfar from complete\u201d. Staffing problems at all levels of children\u2019s education and social care were compounding problems that stand in the way of a full recovery, Ofsted said, with schools struggling to recruit teaching assistants to help with lost learning, and nurseries losing early years workers to better paid jobs in retail and hospitality. Children are also losing out on sports, drama, music and other enrichment activities, as schools continue to experience staff absence due to Covid, and intervention for children who need additional help has been delayed due to fewer support staff. Pupils with the most complex needs were often the least well served, the report said, with support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) under even greater strain during the pandemic from which it had not recovered. Ofsted said demand for specialist services had grown significantly, with an additional 77,000 children identified as having SEND taking the overall figure up to 1.5 million pupils, meaning speech and language therapy and mental health support were not always available and there were delays in assessments for education, health and care plans. Launching her sixth annual report since taking over the role, Spielman said: \u201cThe pandemic continued to cast a shadow over education and children\u2019s social care for much of the past year. And the energy crisis and economic pressures have brought more turbulence in recent months. \u201cAcross all age groups in education, careful thought has been given to making up lost learning. However, achievement gaps are still wider than before the pandemic, meaning the recovery is far from complete. And it\u2019s clear that in education \u2013 and in children\u2019s social care \u2013 staffing issues are compounding problems standing in the way of a full recovery. \u201cWe owe the current generation of young people as much security and certainty as we can provide for what remains of their childhood. And we must offer them the education, training and opportunities they need to secure their future. To do that, it\u2019s vital that education and social care providers are able to recruit, train and retain talented and capable people.\u201d Overall, however, the report said inspections suggested an \u201cimproving picture\u201d, with 88% of all state-funded schools now judged good or outstanding \u2013 up nearly two percentage points from 2021 \u2013 and 70% of schools previously judged to require improvement now up to good or outstanding after inspection last year. In an online press conference, Spielman said workforce issues were across the board, with a third of children\u2019s home staff leaving in the year up to March and 44% of staff newly hired, while foster carers have fallen to their lowest number in years. On SEND, she said the increase in the number of pupils identified as having special needs was partly down to the pandemic, so it was often an issue of catch up more than a long-term special needs issue. Spielman also raised concerns about the government\u2019s decision to drop its schools bill which included new powers for Ofsted to tackle illegal schools and a register for children who are out of school. She said both should be prioritised by the government. The Ofsted report highlighted the growing use of part-time timetables in schools as an alternative to exclusions, which Spielman said was fine if used in the short-term to handle a crisis, but could lead to a children \u201csliding out of education altogether\u201d if used indefinitely. And while high levels of pupil absence have fallen, the chief inspector said there were still problems with persistent absenteeism. \u201cFor a minority of families, the social contract around schooling \u2013 attendance in return for education \u2013 has become fractured, perhaps tested by periods of lockdown,\u201d Ofsted said. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, described Ofsted\u2019s latest report as \u201cshocking\u201d and testimony to \u201cover a decade of neglect\u201d of education and the services needed by children with SEND, looked after children and others who need individual help. A Department for Education spokesperson said the government had invested \u00a35bn in education recovery, with over 2 m tutoring courses now started, and school budgets set to be boosted to their highest ever level in real terms by 2024/25. Councils have also been provided with \u00a34.8bn to help support children\u2019s social care and children\u2019s homes."

            "content": "If you want to get under the skin of politics, nothing beats a good diary. And what distinguishes the best \u2013 from Alan Clark and Tony Benn to Alastair Campbell and more recently Sasha Swire \u2013 is the willingness to be vulnerable. A diarist\u2019s job is to capture how it felt in the heat of the moment, however mortifying it might be to read in retrospect. Everything else is just publicity. Or in the case of Matt Hancock, who never actually kept a diary but hasn\u2019t let that stop him publishing one, a book concocted after the event (but before the public inquiry) with the help of journalist Isabel Oakeshott from a mishmash of old papers, notes and emoji-laden WhatsApps. And with the selective benefit of hindsight, what the former health secretary mainly sees is \u2013 surprise! \u2013 all the times he was brilliantly prescient, and all the times his Downing Street nemesis Dominic Cummings wasn\u2019t. If you couldn\u2019t bear watching him on I\u2019m a Celebrity, I\u2019m afraid this book may go down like a plate of sheep\u2019s unmentionables. New Year\u2019s Day 2020 finds our eagle-eyed hero in his kitchen, seizing on a tiny newspaper story about an obscure pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan and resolving to find out more. Five days later, he\u2019s quizzing chief medical officer Professor Sir Chris Whitty about \u201cthe likely need for a vaccine\u201d. (In fairness, Hancock has a tech geek\u2019s love for scientifically engineered solutions to problems, meaning that bit might actually be true.) But still he can\u2019t get his Brexit-focused colleagues to wake up, or let him call a Cobra meeting. Even when the penny finally drops, and despite what Hancock grandly calls his economist\u2019s ability to \u201csee the behaviour of individuals at the scale of whole societies\u201d, for some inexplicable reason Cummings keeps arranging big meetings behind his back. Stepping back for a moment, you don\u2019t have to pick a side in the Cummings-Hancock war to see the practical difficulties of trying to run a Covid strategy with these two, plus a prime minister who in the middle of the second deadly wave apparently inquired about testing his dog to see if it had had Covid. Hancock is bullish in dismissing what he calls \u201cincredibly hurtful\u201d allegations, mostly in the Guardian, about the handling of government Covid contracts. He still insists the biggest unwitting virus spreaders in care homes were staff moving between them, not patients being discharged from hospital untested. Perhaps we\u2019ll have to wait for the public inquiry to rule on all that, although Hancock does concede those staff movements could in hindsight have been stopped earlier. It\u2019s striking, however, how few entries care homes get in a story dominated by the more ultimately successful races to procure PPE, tests and vaccines. Towards the end things take a surprisingly Mills &amp; Boon turn, as Hancock is surprised by his \u201cfeelings\u201d for aide Gina Coladangelo, which he is shortly afterwards caught on CCTV expressing. \u201cI\u2019ve always known from the novels that people will risk everything (for love),\u201d confides Hancock, in precisely the sort of sentence that should never make it into \u201cthe novels\u201d. What\u2019s never quite explained is exactly how Coladangelo morphed from old university friend sending helpful texts about his choice of socks into a quasi-official role helping him \u201ccommunicate\u201d, and ultimately a job on the Department of Health board, some months before they got together. Personally, I\u2019d rather read more about the exact capacity in which Gina went with him to debrief the PM in the Downing Street garden one fine May evening and less about the end of his marriage. What ultimately stuck in my head however was an oddly poignant account of Hancock driving home through London in mid-February, as the government\u2019s scientific advisers began secretly preparing options for a lockdown, past pubs full of people with no idea their lives were about to turn upside down. Just for a moment, you feel the burden leaders carry of knowing the things most of us would rather not. The Downing Street whiteboard with \u201cwho do we not save?\u201d written on it; the mathematical models outlining just how many could die; the fear of running out of body bags. There are kernels of truth in here, some uncomfortable, about why politicians make the decisions they do. It\u2019s just a shame extracting them feels much like enduring one of I\u2019m a Celebrity\u2019s bush tucker trials; all that groping through muck and grubs, just for a couple of plastic stars. \u2022 Pandemic Diaries: The Inside Story of Britain\u2019s Battle Against Covid by Matt Hancock with Isabel Oakeshott is published by Biteback (\u00a325).

            "date": "2022-12-03T14:38:48Z",
            "content": "Straight from appearing on the ITV reality show I\u2019m a Celebrity, the focus on former health secretary Matt Hancock has turned to his upcoming memoir called Pandemic Diaries: The Inside Story Of Britain\u2019s Battle Against Covid. Here are five key moments from the book, which have been revealed in extracts published by the Daily Mail and Mail+. 1) Hancock claims coronavirus was brought into care homes by staff In the upcoming book, Hancock defends his handling of the care home crisis during the pandemic \u2013 the decision to discharge care home residents from hospital without testing \u2013 by claiming that the virus was introduced into the homes by care staff. In the entry dated 13 March 2020, Hancock claims that Simon Stevens, NHS England\u2019s chief executive, said that frail elderly patients who did not need urgent treatment could be discharged from hospital, either to their own homes or to care homes. In a subsequent entry dated 14 May 2020 Hancock says that people \u201cblame us for discharging elderly people from hospital into residential settings without testing them properly\u201d, but claims that this is false. Rather, Hancock claims there was \u201cscandalous behaviour\u201d by some care home operators who were using staff who had tested positive for coronavirus, saying there were at least 40 care homes where this was happening. 2) Hancock says ministers were told Covid could kill 820,000 in the UK Hancock also claims that Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, warned two months before the country was put into lockdown that the virus could kill as many as 820,000 people across the UK. According to Hancock, Conservative ministers responded with a \u201cshrug shrug\u201d. Hancock claims: \u201cThe reaction was somewhat \u2018shrug shrug\u2019 \u2013 essentially because they didn\u2019t really believe it. I am constantly feeling that others, who aren\u2019t focused on this every day, are weeks behind what\u2019s going on.\u201d 3) Boris Johnson did not initially think coronavirus would be a serious disease Hancock claims Boris Johnson was reluctant to take the issue of a pandemic seriously when he first raised the issue of the outbreak in Wuhan. The former health secretary notes that Johnson\u2019s response to him was: \u201cYou keep an eye on it. It will probably go away.\u201d One month later, Hancock says he warned Johnson that although it may be possible to contain the virus, the most likely scenario was \u201cwe\u2019re going down\u201d. He says that Johnson\u2019s response to this was \u201cBash on.\u201d 4) Dominic Cummings viewed the pandemic as a \u2018distraction\u2019 Hancock claims that Johnson\u2019s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings viewed the pandemic as a \u201cdistraction\u201d from other topics, including the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. He writes: \u201cThat\u2019s all he wants Boris talking about.\u201d 5) Hancock says he broke coronavirus rules because he \u2018fell in love\u2019 Hancock said that he fell in love with Gina Coladangelo, a friend from university, after she started working for him. \u201cWe realised we had feelings for each other which were as strong as they were. It was very sudden and took us both by surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cWe realised what was happening was of huge consequence that would last for the rest of our lives but \u2026 this was an affaire de coeur [affair of the heart] and therefore my political judgment was off.\u201d He added that he wanted forgiveness from the public for breaking the rules, rather than seeking it over his handling of the pandemic. Hancock wrote: \u201cI want forgiveness for the mistake I made, the failure of leadership at the end of the pandemic when I fell in love with Gina and I broke the guidance that I\u2019d signed off. I want forgiveness for the human error I made ... but I\u2019m not asking for forgiveness for how I handled the pandemic.\u201d"

            "title": "Matt Hancock accused of rewriting history in pandemic book",
            "date": "2022-12-05T18:33:49Z",
            "content": "Matt Hancock has been accused of rewriting history as he seeks to rescue his reputation with the launch of a book about helping to lead the UK\u2019s response to Covid. Fresh from spending three weeks in the Australian jungle on ITV\u2019s I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here!, the former health secretary has written what is billed as a tell-all account of \u201cthe successes and the failures\u201d of tackling coronavirus. Extracts of the book, The Pandemic Diaries, serialised by the Daily Mail in advance of release, have drawn criticism. A former Conservative cabinet minister questioned whether Hancock would be prepared to stand by some of the allegations in the book if he is interviewed under oath by the official Covid inquiry. Stephen Dorrell, who served as health secretary under John Major, said he did not believe some of Hancock\u2019s version of events were reliable, highlighting the issue of care homes. In an extract from the book, Hancock wrote on 2 April 2020 that \u201cwe must make sure that anyone going from a hospital into a care home is kept away from other residents\u201d. Just over a year later, on 27 May 2021, he said the vast majority of Covid infections in care homes were due to staff, and not the policy of releasing hospital patients without testing them. Asked if he found Hancock\u2019s claims credible, Dorrell said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t at the time. I can\u2019t accept him saying something was happening when it quite clearly was not, and when the evidence was clear.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is a public inquiry looking into the record of the government and way ministers discharged their responsibilities. Hancock is presumably going to be asked to give evidence to that inquiry under oath. I think he needs to be very careful. \u201cThe statements that he makes to the inquiry will be given under oath and it would be quite difficult to make statements to the inquiry that don\u2019t contradict statements attributed to him in this book.\u201d Hancock\u2019s claim that the then cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, blocked a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee, known as Cobra, in January 2020 is also understood to be disputed. Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP who chairs the parliamentary group on coronavirus, called Hancock\u2019s book a \u201cshameless attempt\u201d to profit from \u201chis incompetent handling of the pandemic\u201d. She said: \u201cNo matter how he tries to rewrite the story, the public knows the truth and the Covid inquiry must hold those responsible to account.\u201d A source who worked with Hancock at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said he wanted to get his version of events out as speedily as possible, well in advance of the official Covid inquiry gathering pace. \u201cIt\u2019s revealing Matt\u2019s side,\u201d they said. \u201cThere was a perception across government that DHSC expanded too rapidly and there was not enough attention paid to getting the right structures in place for what was essentially a super-department. The widescale view was that Matt was out of his depth.\u201d One ally of the former health secretary defended him, saying he had often been \u201cahead of the curve\u201d and was one of the earliest advocates of ensuring vaccines could be rolled out by Christmas. Another said: \u201cEverything in Matt\u2019s book is backed up by evidence \u2013 either in messages, emails or Department of Health and Social Care documents.\u201d Hancock claimed in a recent interview with the Mail he had had an \u201cabsolute bucket of shit poured over my head\u201d after being forced to quit as health secretary for breaking social distancing rules by kissing a female aide, Gina Coladangelo. \u201cThe irony is that as a consequence of our decision to live life, we have then had a shockingly awful 18 months,\u201d he said. Hancock wrote in his book that he read a short news story about \u201ca mystery pneumonia outbreak\u201d in China on 1 January 2020 and sought to raise it after the Christmas break. He said he did so directly with Boris Johnson less than a week later, but was told by the then prime minister: \u201cIt will probably go away.\u201d Hancock sought to portray himself as trying to raise the alarm about Covid while No 10 brushed his concerns off as \u201calarmist\u201d. He saved particular ire for Dominic Cummings, who published texts alleged to be from Johnson in April 2020 that described Hancock as \u201cuseless\u201d. Hancock said Cummings initially branded discussion of Covid a \u201cdistraction\u201d and turned his attention to it weeks too late. It is also claimed in Hancock\u2019s book that the Ministry of Justice repeatedly pushed during the first lockdown for thousands of non-violent prisoners to be released, to take the pressure off jails."

            "title": "London tops Rightmove searches as pandemic interest in Cornwall fades",
            "date": "2022-12-22T11:47:30Z",
            "content": "The lockdown dream of leaving the city behind and owning a spacious house in the countryside or by the sea faded in 2022 as homebuyers picked up where they left off before the pandemic: house hunting in London. Rightmove said the capital was 2022\u2019s top location by some distance with searches 9% higher than last year. Meanwhile the number of searches for homes in Cornwall and Devon fell sharply although the counties, famous for their spectacular coastlines, hung on to second and third place on the property website\u2019s annual list of most searched for locations. During the pandemic the dramatic shift to home working saw many Britons rethink where they wanted to live. For several months of 2021 Cornwall was more popular than London on the site, although the city ended the year in first place overall. However, in 2022 the mindset of buyers returned to pre-pandemic norms, Rightmove said, as while searches for London properties increased by 9%, for Cornwall and Devon they were down 18% and 17% respectively. That meant London ended the year with 36% more buyer searches than Cornwall, which is the biggest gap since 2019. In 2021 the gap between the two places was just 3%. Tim Bannister, Rightmove\u2019s property expert, said the tide started to turn towards the end of 2021 and this had continued in 2022 when a \u201clot of our trends in the market have started to head back towards where they were in 2019\u201d. But as memories of the pandemic faded, the cost of living crisis came to the fore. In the rental market searches for \u201cbills included\u201d are up 57% on this time last year as renters worry about soaring energy costs, Rightmove said. It had been the most competitive rental market on record, with quadruple the number of tenants inquiring about properties to move to, as there were properties to rent in 2022. Homes sold fastest in Scotland, where Livingston, in West Lothian, was the year\u2019s \u201cquickest market\u201d with homes finding a buyer in an average of 15 days. All of the top five areas are in Scotland, with Bo\u2019ness, West Lothian in second place and Larbert, Stirlingshire, third. Higher borrowing costs, coupled with the predicted recession, means the storm clouds are gathering over the UK housing market after several years of some of the biggest rises in property prices ever recorded. The general view among property experts is that prices will fall in 2023 but there is no agreement on by how much. Forecasters have been wrong on this before but this time there are factors, such as the recent jump in borrowing costs, that increase the likelihood of a downturn. The Bank of England has raised interest rates steadily over the past year from a record low of 0.1% to 3.5% at this month\u2019s meeting \u2013 with further rises forecast. There was some evidence of a weakening housing market as the number of home purchases had fallen to below 60,000 a month, the lowest since 2013, it said. While the Halifax thinks rising mortgage costs coupled with cost of living pressures will push house prices down by about 8% in 2023, in a report published on Tuesday Nationwide argues that a \u201csoft landing\u201d, with prices edging lower by about 5%, is possible. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said the \u201crisks are skewed to the downside, but there is still a good chance that we can achieve a relatively soft landing next year with activity stabilising modestly below pre-pandemic levels and house prices edging lower, perhaps by around 5%\u201d. \u201cThe Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates a little further, although in recent years most borrowers have opted for fixed rate mortgages which are linked to longer term interest rates that may have already peaked. If so, this will help provide some support to affordability as will solid gains in nominal earnings growth and modestly lower house prices.\u201d Rightmove is still predicting the traditional Boxing Day bounce when buyers log on to Rightmove after spending Christmas with friends and family. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from agents that they are getting properties ready for sale to go live on Boxing Day,\u201d said Bannister. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a group of people using the past few months to assess their options and consider what they can afford, and they could be spurred on next year should fixed-rate mortgages drop as anticipated.\u201d"

            "content": "Good morning. Joe Biden is to sign into law a bill to rescind the Covid-19 vaccine mandate for members of the US military and provide nearly $858bn for national defense after it passed in the Senate yesterday. The bill provides for about $45bn more for defense programs than Biden requested and roughly 10% more than last year\u2019s bill as lawmakers look to account for inflation and boost the country\u2019s military competitiveness with China and Russia. It includes a 4.6% pay raise for servicemembers and the defense department\u2019s civilian workforce. The Senate passed the defense policy bill by a vote of 83-11. The measure also received broad bipartisan support in the House last week. To win GOP support for the 4,408-page bill, Democrats agreed to Republican demands to scrap the requirement for service members to get a Covid-19 vaccination. The bill directs the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, to rescind his August 2021 memorandum imposing the mandate. What else was passed? The Senate passed legislation to fund the government for an additional week as lawmakers race to finish work on a full-year spending package before they head home for the holidays and a new Congress is sworn in. Twitter suspends accounts of several journalists who had reported on Elon Musk A number of prominent journalists who have reported on Twitter and its new chief executive, Elon Musk, appear to have been suspended or banned from the platform. In a series of evening tweets, Musk wrote that sharing his real-time location on Twitter was forbidden, and accused journalists who he alleged had been sharing information about his location of posting \u201cassassination coordinates\u201d. Accounts of tech journalists at CNN, the Washington Post, Mashable and the New York Times were suspended in quick succession on Thursday evening. All had recently published articles about Musk\u2019s suspension of a Twitter account that had shared publicly available data about the movements of his private jet. Each of these articles had highlighted the tension between Musk\u2019s stated commitment to \u201cfree speech\u201d and his choice to ban an account that he personally disliked. The Twitter account for rival social media company Mastodon \u2013 to which some Twitter users have migrated after Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter \u2013 also appeared to have been suspended. What have the news publications said? The Washington Post said in a statement that the suspension of their technology reporter, Drew Harwell, \u201cundermines Elon Musk\u2019s claim that he intends to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech\u201d. Meanwhile, CNN said: \u201cTwitter\u2019s increasing instability and volatility should be of incredible concern to everyone who uses the platform.\u201d Will they be reinstated? While the journalists had reported that the suspensions were permanent, in multiple tweets Musk said the suspensions would be for seven days. \u201cSome time away from Twitter is good for the soul \u2026\u201d Musk tweeted. Russia begins mass airstrike in apparent move to destroy Ukraine\u2019s power grid The second mass air attack in days has been launched by Russia across Ukraine, with a barrage of rockets fired at several regions across the country. The aim of the mass attack, authorities said, appeared to be to destroy the Ukrainian power grid in the hope that damaging Ukraine away from the frontline would enable Russia to make gains on the battlefield. Two people had died and a further fivewere injured, including two children, after a rocket hit a residential building in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih, the head of the Dnipro region, Valentyn Reznichenko, said on Telegram. The injured are being treated in hospital. The building\u2019s entrance was destroyed in the attack, he added. In the capital, Kyiv, explosions were heard in the south-western district of Holosiivskyi, as well as the eastern districts of Dniprovskyi and Desnyanskyi, according to the city\u2019s mayor. How has Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure been affected? The authorities have said there is damage but have not specified what has been hit or the extent of it. The Ukrainian energy company DTEK said emergency power outages would be introduced in Kyiv because of the missile attack. What else is happening? Here\u2019s what we know on day 296 of the invasion. In other news \u2026 The US National Archives on Thursday released thousands of documents related to the 1963 assassination of then president John F Kennedy shortly after Joe Biden issued an executive order authorizing the release that also kept hundreds of other sensitive records secret. A landslide killed at least 12 people while they slept at a Malaysian campsite near Kuala Lumpur early on Friday, officials said, as search teams scoured thick mud and downed trees for more than 20 people still missing. A child and a woman had been found among the dead, authorities said. Ten people, including five children, have reportedly been killed after a fire broke out this morning at a residential building in Vaulx-en-Velin, near the French city of Lyon. Another four people are in a critical condition, while 10 others, including two firefighters, have been injured. The sister of one of the children killed in the Uvalde school shooting earlier this year, as well as the city\u2019s only pediatrician, pleaded for stricter gun laws during a congressional hearing on gun violence yesterday. At the hearing, Faith Mata, whose 10-year-old sister, Tess, was killed asked: \u201cWhen is enough enough?\u201d Harvard University announced yesterday that Claudine Gay would become its 30th president, making her the first Black person and the second woman to lead the Ivy League school. Gay, who is a dean at the university and a democracy scholar, will become president on 1 July. Stat of the day: US botched 35% of execution attempts this year As 2022 draws to a close, a new grim distinction can be attached to it: in America it was the year of the botched execution. In its annual review of US capital punishment, the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) reveals the astonishing statistic that 35% of the 20 execution attempts carried out this year were visibly problematic. Several were agonisingly drawn out as officials tried to secure a vein through which to inject lethal drugs, leading lawyers to describe the process as a form of torture. Others were carried out in violation of state protocols. Some went ahead even though there were defects in those protocols themselves. Don\u2019t miss this: why are so many women living in separate homes from their partners and kids? Because it\u2019s a win-win situation The model coupling \u2013 the dream, if you will \u2013 was always Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton, or Annie Leibovitz and Susan Sontag: maintaining a marriage, de facto or real, across two separate households, so that you got all the benefits with none of the gross bits, writes Emma Brockes. You could keep the magic alive, extend the honeymoon period indefinitely and, by protecting your space and rationing your time together, create a scenario in which you were actually happy to see each other. Overlooking the small matter of money, what, exactly, is there not to like? Or rather, what is there not to like for the women in any given couple? Climate check: Lula calls on rich nations to give more to protect Earth\u2019s ecosystems Brazil\u2019s incoming president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has backed calls for rich countries to provide more money to protect Earth\u2019s ecosystems at Cop15, as talks restarted after a series of walkouts. More than 100 environment ministers have arrived at the biodiversity summit in Canada before a weekend of negotiations on this decade\u2019s UN targets to protect the natural world. Lula\u2019s incoming administration has written to the summit to underscore the need for more money for biodiversity in echoes of his speech at Cop27, where he pledged to make sure rich countries made good on their $100bn (\u00a382bn) climate commitments to the global south.

            "title": "Nasal flu vaccine may help protect children against strep A, study shows",
            "date": "2022-12-16T18:25:12Z",
            "content": "Giving children the nasal flu vaccine may help protect them against strep A, according to analysis by the UK Health Security Agency. UKHSA data shows at least 19 children have now died as a result of strep A across the UK, while there are 7,750 cases of scarlet fever so far this season. This is more than treble the 2,538 cases reported during the same period over the last comparably high season \u2013 the winter of 2017-18. Last week the UKHSA urged parents to get their children a flu vaccine after a 70% rise in hospitalisations of flu patients aged under five in a week, and an 11% fall in vaccine uptake among two- and three-year-olds compared with the past two years. Misinformation has been circulating on social media, particularly on TikTok, falsely linking the child flu vaccine to strep A. Dr Elizabeth Whittaker, from Imperial College London, said in a briefing to journalists this week that because strep A can be a complication of flu, having the flu jab protects against both flu and strep A. Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist for immunisation and countermeasures at UKHSA, said: \u201cChildren who catch influenza are at greater risk from subsequent infections, including group A strep [GAS], so these findings provide yet more reasons for parents of eligible children to bring them forward for the flu vaccine. This is particularly important at this time when we are seeing unusually high rates of group A strep infection across the population.\u201d The study found the incidence of Strep A was lower in pilot areas where the nasal flu vaccine was being offered to all primary schoolchildren, compared with areas where it was being incrementally rolled out. In two- to four-year-olds, rates of GAS were 73.5 per 100,000 children in pilot areas, compared with 93 per 100,000 in non-pilot areas. In five- to 10-year-olds, rates were 50.3 per 100,000 in pilot areas, compared with 57.8 per 100,000 in non-pilot areas. There was no difference in scarlet fever or invasive group A strep (iGAS) notifications. The spike in strep A infections has come as the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) issued serious shortage protocols (SSPs) for three penicillin medicines amid increased demand for the antibiotics. Pharmacists and GPs in the UK have faced serious difficulties in securing supplies of penicillin and amoxycillin, antibiotics used to treat infections including strep A. As a result, parents have reported having to visit several pharmacies to get medicines prescribed for their sick children, while the price of some antibiotics has risen sharply \u2013 a situation pharmacists say has left them facing losses."

            "date": "2022-12-23T07:00:02Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden was wrong to declare the coronavirus pandemic over in the US, one of the country\u2019s leading experts on the virus has told the Guardian. Dr Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children\u2019s hospital and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said that the US president\u2019s statement in September, that \u201cthe pandemic is over\u201d, was mistaken and a poor message to send to the American public. \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly not [over],\u201d Hotez said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re still in 200-300 deaths per day. [Covid-19] is still the third or fourth leading cause of death in the United States. It\u2019s definitely the wrong message to give, given the fact that we\u2019re desperately trying to persuade the American people to take this [bivalent] booster.\u201d Hotez said that getting the bivalent booster shot is the one of the most important things people can do to protect themselves against Covid. So far, only 14.1% of the total US population above age five has received the bivalent booster shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control. \u201cFor instance, here in Texas, where I\u2019m based, only 7% of Texans have gotten their bivalent [booster].\u201d Hotez \u2013 who is nominated for a Nobel peace prize along with his colleague Dr Maria Elena Bottazzi for their work developing Corbevax, a Covid-19 vaccine they refused to patent so it could be replicated by middle- and lower-income countries \u2013 also issued a chilling warning about the future of this pandemic or any others. \u201cThe next big coronavirus pandemic is coming \u2013 the fourth one. I can\u2019t tell you if it\u2019s going to be next year or five years or 10 years, but it\u2019s coming,\u201d he warned. On assessing where the US stands in comparison with other nations now, Hotez was not able to offer any good news. \u201cI think the US is not doing well. I think we failed to persuade a third of the country to get vaccines at all, maybe a quarter. And of those who\u2019ve gotten two doses, we\u2019re only persuading around a third [of them] to get their booster,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cSo the anti-vaxxers have won this victory. We\u2019re still losing too many lives.\u201d Since the pandemic began, more than 1 million people have died from Covid-19 in the US \u2013 the country with the 16th highest mortality rate per 100,000 people. The current weekly average of new cases in the US is 65,067, a slight 2.9% decrease from the previous weekly average of 67,034. \u201cI call it the greatest self-immolation in American history,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so tragic.\u201d But the US is not alone in its poor Covid response performance rating. \u201cThe US remains vulnerable. Canada, less so. Australia, less so. Maybe European countries, less so. But the US, India and China, of course, are extremely vulnerable, because China is getting vaccines that don\u2019t protect nearly as well against the variants, and the Chinese refuse to afford effective boosters against BA.5 \u2013 either our vaccine or the mRNA vaccines,\u201d Hotez said. China in particular has taken a drastic approach to its pandemic response by implementing a zero-Covid policy that saw extreme lockdowns. A surge in infections led to President Xi Jinping\u2019s strict policy. A harrowing result of that policy was the deaths of 10 people from the far western region of Xinjiang, who perished in a fire that engulfed a high-rise residential building they were unable to escape in time due to the lockdowns last month. But unprecedented mass protests across the country, especially in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, demanding the zero-Covid policy\u2019s end and Xi\u2019s resignation, resulted in a policy shift away from such restrictive measures. That relaxation was a good sign, according to Hotez, who said harsher does not necessarily mean better when it comes to dealing with the virus. \u201cChina has relied primarily on aggressive lockdowns and that is a failed strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they have tremendous vulnerability, because its population is immunologically naive and they don\u2019t have the ICU infrastructure to handle a big surge. So they have, I think, the single greatest vulnerability right now.\u201d He added: \u201c[China] kept it down to very crude and primitive means. They didn\u2019t take advantage of the technology that was available.\u201d So what lies ahead for the pandemic? In the immediate future, the winter season is a playground for illnesses like the flu, the increasingly common respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and variants of Covid-19. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in a bit of a holding pattern, wanting to know what happens with these new variants,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cIn the past, you know, we\u2019ve had these series of catastrophic waves from individual variants. We had the big, horrible Alpha wave in the winter of 2021. In the last half of 2021, we had the Delta wave, and then we had BA. 1, Omicron in early 2022, then BA.212, and then BA.5.\u201d \u201cWe have seen these bumps in Europe and my prediction is we\u2019ll see one in the US this winter. And maybe we\u2019re seeing the beginning of it right now. How bad it\u2019s going to be is hard to know. We still are seeing 200-300 deaths a day, which is a pretty serious, deadly disease. It\u2019s still something far worse than the flu. Maybe not as bad as it has been. But the key is to get Americans to take two or three appropriate protective measures.\u201d In addition to masking up and continuing to practice good hygiene, Hotez encourages another protective measure: tuning out anti-science conspiracy theories. \u201cThe globalization of anti-vaccine activists is such a deadly force. Because of the far-right members of Congress, and the CPAC [Conservative Political Action Coalition] conference, and Fox News \u2013 and now that\u2019s a globalizing force. So anti-science activism and aggression is now, as societal forces, killing more Americans than gun violence or global terrorism. The wave of Covid-19 misinformation doesn\u2019t just end on US soil. \u201cNow you\u2019re seeing all the same style anti-vaccine rhetoric in sub-Saharan African countries, south Asia \u2026 It\u2019s a deadly force that we still haven\u2019t even begun scratching the surface of combating and countering,\u201d Hotez said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I get so annoyed at all the phoney-baloney Covid origin stories, because it takes our eyes off the prize \u2013 that we\u2019re not actually doing the surveillance needed to determine when the next big one\u2019s going to erupt.\u201d According to Hotez, the key to preventing the next big pandemic can be found within one animal in particular \u2013 bats, which can host myriad viruses, from the coronavirus to Ebola. \u201cWe need to have a thorough landscaping exercise of bats across the face of Asia, especially east Asia \u2013 going from China into south-east Asia, Cambodia, Japan \u2013 where these coronaviruses are, as well as the Middle East and even parts of Latin America,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason why we\u2019re seeing more and more of this is, in part, because of climate change and urbanization \u2013 human migrations encroaching into territories where bats are. It\u2019s a combination of climate change with other social determinants.\u201d All hope is not lost \u2013 yet. In order to get ahead of the next pandemic, Hotez said it will also take a combination of the right technological and political infrastructure. \u201cWe have vaccine technologies at an unprecedented level. We have the technology to solve this. What we lack is the political will to empower low- and middle-income countries to really investigate these outbreaks. Modern technology has outpaced our social and political infrastructures. We have the technical support, but we are not willing to implement it,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-12-09T06:00:15Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s nearly three-year policy of enacting strict lockdowns to contain outbreaks of Covid-19 came with a heavy price for the world\u2019s second largest economy. The question for its president, Xi Jinping, and his inner court of advisers is whether a sudden relaxation of lockdown rules brought in this week will both prevent a recurrence of the shockwave of protests across the country and turn the economy around. In the couple of days after Beijing\u2019s announced relaxations to the rules \u2013 including allowing people with mild or no symptoms to quarantine at home \u2013 the signs are only modestly hopeful. A lack of effective vaccines and the fact much of the population has not had no jab or fewer than the three needed for full protection will mean that employers must cope with a workforce plagued by ill-health, possibly hitting production as much as any lockdown. State-run newspapers have welcomed new vaccines being validated by the government, but little is know publicly about how well they will work. Meanwhile, reports that pharmacies are already running short of basic medicines such as ibuprofen are undermining public trust in the health system and its ability to protect them without lockdowns in place. Nevertheless, Xi had little choice when he decided to ease restrictions. Not only were protesters calling for him to quit in unprecedented public outbursts, trade with the rest of the world had slumped and youth unemployment soared. As a measure of the stagnation Beijing is now wrestling with, inflation dropped to just 2.5% in October and core inflation, excluding volatile elements such as energy and food, stands at 0.6%. The almost complete lack of domestically driven inflation reveals an economy stuck in neutral. Last month\u2019s export figures showed exports had contracted 8.7% from a year earlier, a much bigger fall than the 6.7% forecast by analysts and the 0.3% dip in October. Imports also fell sharply by 10.6% from a 0.7% drop in October as the domestic demand for imported soya beans and iron ore declined. The International Monetary Fund boss, Kristalina Georgieva, said last month that it might have to trim its forecast for China\u2019s economic growth without an overhaul of Covid restrictions. Before her comments, the IMF predicted that Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) would expand 3.2% this year and 4.4% in 2023. Beijing\u2019s Covid control reforms announced on Wednesday also included adjustments to the duration and scope of lockdowns, with cities required only to close off apartments and affected floors, rather than entire city blocks. Health officials are still warning that trends in fatalities will be closely watched and they reserve the right to introduce tougher measures if needed. However, Xi has let it be known local governments should not use the previous \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and health authorities can adopt the same flexible policy. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the change of heart in Beijing was unlikely to prevent a further fall over coming quarters, limiting a recovery to the second half of next year. \u201cOutbound shipments will receive a limited boost from the easing of [China\u2019s] virus restrictions, which are no longer a major constraint on the ability of manufacturers to meet orders,\u201d he said. \u201cOf much greater consequence will be the downturn in global demand for Chinese goods due to the reversal in pandemic-era demand and the coming global recession.\u201d As an example of the hit to individual companies, Apple supplier Foxconn said revenue in November dropped 11.4% year on year, following production problems related to Covid-19 controls at the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou. The iPhone 14 is expected to be in short supply this Christmas as a result. Albert Edwards, a global Strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said China\u2019s central bank was likely to stimulate the economy with cheap money, in part to boost consumer and business spending and offset the impact of recession in most of the industrialised world. Ali Jaffari, head of North American capital markets at Validus Risk Management, said a 10% slump this year in the value of the yuan indicated the difficulties faced by the Chinese economy. \u201cChina\u2019s economic outlook remains vulnerable as the state continues to experience lacklustre growth. The property market is in a slump, manufacturing and production levels are coming in below estimates and export demand is fading,\u201d he said. Attempts by the central bank to boost borrowing, including cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves and loosening financing curbs to rescue the property sector, were unlikely to have much of an effect, Jaffari added, though financial markets were buoyed up by the easing of restrictions, sending the stock market higher. Promoting a more upbeat message on the day Covid controls were eased, Chinese state media reported that a high-level meeting of the ruling Communist party\u2019s politburo had emphasised the government\u2019s focus in 2023 would be on stabilising growth, promoting domestic demand and opening up to the outside world. It might prove to be enough to persuade the IMF to maintain its forecasts for 2023, but without more effective vaccines, lockdowns are expected to continue in China when the rest of the world has moved on, limiting growth for some time."

            "date": "2022-12-04T23:30:26Z",
            "content": "Young Australians have been left doctor-shopping for health professionals willing to flout the rules and give them a fourth Covid vaccination. As infections across the country continue to rise, health experts are now questioning if the second booster shot should be made available to people aged 16 to 29. People in that age group are now not eligible to receive the fourth dose. The rules follow the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi). But Prof Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at University of Sydney, said he supported a review of the guidelines, arguing a fourth dose should be made available to the age group, but not mandated. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Booy said people who were highly social or in close contact with someone who has an underlying health condition should have the option, particularly as it would prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the risk of more long Covid cases. Other experts disagreed the guidelines needed to be reviewed. Nicole Higgins, president of the Royal College for GPs, said she does not think the age group requires a fourth dose at this stage, adding \u201cwe need to see how Covid evolves over the next 3-6 months\u201d. Australia is experiencing a fourth Covid-19 wave, and some are choosing to seek out the extra vaccination. When the bivalent vaccine \u2013 which provides protection against the original and an Omicron Covid strain \u2013 was made available in Australia, Greta, 26, decided to find a health professional who was willing to bend the rules. The first pharmacy she approached refused, but the second pharmacy agreed to give her a fourth dose. Greta, who preferred to remain anonymous, has not contracted Covid and lives with her parents, who are both immunocompromised. She said for her the benefits of getting the fourth dose outweighed the risks, and she found a health professional willing to do it. \u201cI had my third shot in January so I felt like I was vulnerable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like the only thing I could do at the moment because there aren\u2019t many measures in place any more.\u201d Booy said he was aware of people in the 16-29 age group who have taken advantage of getting a fourth dose that would have otherwise expired. Higgins said given supply was not a problem, she understood some health professionals may opt to use the shot rather than waste them. But she urged health professionals to follow the official guidelines. Social scientist at the University of Sydney, Julia Leask, said she would not think less of a GP who made a clinical decision to administer the vaccine. \u201cI think clinical flexibility is reasonable,\u201d said Leask, despite not supporting a review of the recommendations for the age group. \u201cAs long as the risks and limited benefits against infection itself has been clearly communicated and the patient understands them.\u201d Alex Faure, 29, said she was \u201citching\u201d to get the vaccine because her partner was immunocompromised. She said she would like the opportunity for her GP to help her make the decision, based on her specific health needs. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird shift from being told the vaccine is the end of it all to now being told we can\u2019t have it \u2026 and I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand why we aren\u2019t eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cI still want it even knowing the risks.\u201d One risk for the age group is developing myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle. About one in 10,000 men and one in 30,000 women in the 16-29 age group who receive a Covid-19 dose are at risk, Booy said. \u201cIt would need to be a conscious decision,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re weighing up in a 22-year-old whether a one in 10,000 risk of myocarditis, which settles in one week, with getting Covid-19 which could lead to long Covid \u2013 that does need to be carefully thought through.\u201d A spokesperson for the federal health department, said Atagi met regularly and if new evidence became available it would consider and update the recommendations as required."

In a statement celebrating their award, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said \u201ca ripple of hope can turn into a wave of change\u201d. The couple received the award on Tuesday night in New York, two days before the release of a tell-all Netflix show expected to include damning revelations about the royal family. In a trailer for the show, Harry speaks of a \u201chierarchy in the family\u201d, a \u201cdirty game\u201d, and says: \u201cWe know the full truth\u201d. The Robert F Kennedy Human Rights organisation (RFKHR) hands out the annual accolade to leaders in government, business, activism and entertainment, this year also honouring Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Bank of America president, Brian Moynihan, among others. During the ceremony, the couple announced they would be collaborating with the RFKHR on a new award recognising gender equity in student film, which they said they hoped would \u201cinspire a new generation of leadership in the arts, where diverse up and coming talent have a platform to have their voices heard and their stories told\u201d. According to the RFKHR, honourees are those who have demonstrated \u201can unwavering commitment to social change and worked to protect and advance equity, justice, and human rights\u201d.

The charity was set up shortly after Robert Kennedy was murdered in 1968.

For Meghan to get out there on national television and normalise discussion of mental health, at this point, is incredibly important and very brave.\u201d The 2022 Ripple of Hope ceremony was hosted by the Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin. The ceremony also recognised the former NBA basketball star and civil rights campaigner Bill Russell with a posthumous award. Previous Ripple of Hope winners have included the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, the poet Amanda Gorman, the US\u2019s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, musicians Bono and Taylor Swift, the South African bishop and activist Desmond Tutu, actor George Clooney, former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and the Apple CEO Tim Cook. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 December 2022.

            "content": "Superstar US gymnast Simone Biles and tele-health provider Cerebral have ended an endorsement partnership, the company announced on Tuesday, bringing to a close a deal in which the 25-year-old Olympic champion used her own mental health experience to promote the controversial mental health startup. Biles became Cerebral\u2019s \u201cchief impact officer\u201d three months after her dramatic withdrawal from individual competition at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 saying she was \u201cnot in the right head space\u201d to compete. The athlete, who won four gold medals and a bronze at her first Olympic in 2016, was then approached by Celebral in a tie-up with Biles\u2019s own mental health advocacy platform. The terms of the deal were never disclosed. The split between Biles and Celebral comes seven months after the company received a subpoena from federal investigators over its prescribing practices of controlled substances, including the amphetamine Adderall and other stimulants used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Cerebral\u2019s nurse practitioners have said they felt pressured by the company to prescribe stimulants after a 30-minute evaluation. The major pharmacy chains CVS and Walmart later announced they would no longer fill the company\u2019s prescriptions for controlled prescription drugs. The company fired its founder and chief executive, Kyle Robertson, in a dispute with Cerebral\u2019s board. A leaked memo said Robertson\u2019s focus on growing Celebral\u2019s prescribing business had \u201ccreated the market perception of Cerebral as a \u2018pill mill\u2019\u201d.

            "date": "2022-12-14T07:00:48Z",
            "content": "Increasing numbers of emotionally troubled children have been taken into care while waiting long periods for NHS treatment because their condition deteriorated to the point where their parents could no longer cope with their behaviour, child protection bosses have revealed. Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services (ADCS) president Steve Crocker said that since the pandemic, youngsters with complex emotional needs had become a significant factor in rising child protection referrals. \u201cWe are seeing children in the social care system because they have not been supported in the [NHS] mental health system,\u201d he said. Crocker urged ministers to \u201cdo better\u201d for children facing \u201cunacceptable\u201d delays in NHS mental health treatment, adding that it was not uncommon for waiting lists to involve waits of over a year. Councils were \u201cfilling gaps\u201d in NHS provision but struggling to find placements for children with severe behavioural problems, and when they did, typically paid \u201cuntenable\u201d fees of tens of thousands of pounds a week. He accused private children\u2019s residential care providers and their \u201crapacious\u201d hedge fund backers of \u201cprofiteering\u201d from the care crisis, and urged the government to intervene to cap typical profit margins that were currently about 20%. \u201cWe do not see how this can be allowed to continue,\u201d he said. Crocker\u2019s comments came as he launched the latest ADCS Safeguarding Pressures report, which found the cost of living crisis had left children\u2019s social care resources in England at breaking point amid shortages in trained social work staff. He called for major reform, adding: \u201cWe simply can\u2019t go on as we are. Our children deserve better.\u201d The report cited an unnamed council saying it had paid \u00a330,000 a week for a \u201cbespoke package\u201d to keep safe a child who was self-harming and for whom no inpatient NHS secure services were available. Another council in the London area said it typically paid \u00a320,000 a week for private care facilities. Crocker said children\u2019s mental health had worsened during the pandemic as youngsters missed out on basic social interactions and key emotional development phases, not least when schools were closed for long periods, and normal relationships with their peers were interrupted. Although referrals to children\u2019s social care had fallen during Covid-19, they had subsequently risen sharply. Social workers were seeing higher levels of need and risk because of pandemic-related delays in families coming to them for help, by which time problems had often become more complex and severe. \u201cTypically we are seeing children with levels of distress and anxiety that manifest in self-harm or harming others. They are referred to children and adolescent mental health services [CAMHS] but it is not uncommon for waiting lists to be over a year,\u201d he told the Guardian. During the wait for treatment, the child\u2019s behaviour would often become more acute, with their family situation becoming more fraught as a result, Crocker said. \u201cParents say they can\u2019t cope any more, and we have a really traumatised child with more and more extreme behaviour.\u201d Lengthy NHS waits for CAMHS services had resulted in families reaching crisis point, with council children\u2019s services picking up responsibility for them with no additional resources, the report said. Children\u2019s social care had become \u201cthe last resort\u201d for youngsters whose mental health needs should have been met by earlier by the NHS. Crocker said this was not about \u201chaving a go\u201d at his NHS colleagues, who he said were working incredibly hard in tough circumstances. The bottom line was the health service, schools and councils did not have enough resources to cope with the demand for help. \u201cWe do not have enough support for these children,\u201d he said. It was likely the dramatic increase in the prevalence of children\u2019s mental health problems over the past two years would continue into adulthood, he said. \u201cThere is a whole generation for whom the pandemic will be a defining event. We have to understand the [emotional and developmental] impacts could be permanent.\u201d Crocker said the cost of living crisis and rising poverty would translate into increased referrals to children\u2019s social care: \u201cWe are increasingly worried about the cost of living crisis and how many more children will fall into poverty, reducing their quality of life and their life chances. The system is crying out for change.\u201d The government is preparing a response to an independent review of children\u2019s social care by Josh MacAlister which earlier this year recommended a multibillion pound investment in a system it said was spiralling out of control. Councillor Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s Children and Young People Board, said: \u201cIt is absolutely critical the government ensures that children\u2019s services are adequately funded so councils can meet this rising demand and ensure children and their families get the support they need, as soon as they need it.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe will be publishing our bold reform plans for children\u2019s social care early in the new year. In the interim we have taken total funding to \u00a3695m over three years to support 300,000 families. \u201cWe are also investing in mental health services, with at least \u00a32.3bn a year.\u201d"

            "content": "More people will be shut out from mental health services if no new cash is invested in the next two years, experts have warned. Sean Duggan, chief executive of the mental health network at the NHS Confederation, which represents the health and care system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said that a lack of long-term investment combined with a potential surge in demand due to the cost of living crisis would cause unsustainable pressure on the system. He said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t do anything beyond where we are now you will get more exclusions, more difficult access, more pressure [and] yes, waiting lists [will rise]. We have started from such a low baseline and all the pressures that we know are existing in services at the moment. \u201cThat pressure goes back into primary care, doesn\u2019t help the acute services, doesn\u2019t help the community services or urgent and emergency care.\u201d Funding for the NHS announced in the autumn statement would allow mental health services to continue with the current plan, Duggan said, but this would come to an end in 2024. He called for long-term sustainable investment. NHS figures show a 30% rise in number of under-18s in England in contact with mental health, learning disability and autism services \u2013 rising from 763,888 in the pre-pandemic year of 2019-20, to 992,647 in 2021-22. Across all ages the number of people in contact with these services rose by almost a fifth to 3.26 million over the same period. The mental health charity Mind said that with demand for support already \u201cgreatly\u201d exceeding capacity even more people would be shut out if no new investment were freed up. Mind\u2019s head of policy and campaigns, Paul Spencer, said that while the government had made welcome interventions, these represented \u201csomething of a sticking plaster\u201d rather than the needed \u201cwholesale reform\u201d. \u201cWe know that 1.8 million people are on waiting lists for mental health support, with a further 8 million unable to get any kind of help at all,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cDemand for support already greatly exceeds available capacity, so we echo Sean\u2019s warning that even more people will be shut out if no new investment is freed up.\u201d James Harris, an associate director of campaigns and communications at the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said that the current plan and funding for mental health did not meet the scale of the challenge facing the country. He added: \u201cThe nation\u2019s mental health has been hit by the double blow of a global pandemic and a cost of living crisis, meaning more people than ever are turning to a healthcare system that is struggling to meet demand.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe have committed to increasing investment into NHS mental health services by \u00a32.3bn a year by 2024, meaning 2 million additional people will be able to access NHS-funded mental health support \u2013 and we\u2019re aiming to grow the mental health workforce by 27,000 more staff by this time too. \u201cIn addition, we are investing \u00a3150m over the three years to 2024-25 to bolster NHS mental health services, better support people in crisis outside A&amp;E, and enhance patient safety in mental health units.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-22T14:00:40Z",
            "content": "A secret report has warned of morale issues and a \u201chigh\u201d demand for mental health support services amongst Australia\u2019s elite soldiers. The report warns the defence minister, Richard Marles, that some members of the Special Air Service Regiment have expressed \u201canger and grief\u201d about the situation. It urges the government to ensure health services are properly resourced. The document, obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, provides an update on the cultural reforms from the Brereton inquiry into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. Despite relaying concerns about morale, the independent oversight panel led by the former intelligence watchdog, Dr Vivienne Thom, said it believed \u201chumility\u201d was now embedded in special forces culture. The panel told Marles it believed \u201cthe level of risk of unethical behaviour amongst the SASR members and commandos is at a level where Australia should have that confidence in them\u201d. It said the focus on humility and service to others \u201cdramatically lowers the risk that the special force\u2019s unique levels of capability will drive an unhealthy exceptionalism in future\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The four-year-long inquiry by Maj Gen Paul Brereton criticised a \u201cwarrior culture\u201d within the SASR, and argued members \u201cshould pride themselves on being model professional soldiers, not on being \u2018warrior heroes\u2019\u201d. Brereton found \u201ccredible\u201d information to implicate 25 current or former special forces personnel in the alleged unlawful killing of 39 individuals and the cruel treatment of two others in Afghanistan. While the criminal allegations are still being considered by the Office of the Special Investigator, Thom\u2019s panel is required to update the defence minister on progress in implementing the broader cultural reforms four times a year. Thom and a fellow panel member, the University of Tasmania vice chancellor Prof Rufus Black, visited Campbell barracks in Western Australia in July to \u201cassess at first hand the current culture within SASR\u201d. \u201cThe panel had frank and open conversations with small groups of current SASR members at all rank levels, the SASR command team, ex-service organisations, Australian Special Air Service Association, Defence Member and Family Support and the SASR Auxiliary,\u201d said the report dated 1 August. The panellists encountered \u201ctwo quite opposing views expressed by SASR members about morale\u201d. One of these views was \u201canger and grief\u201d and the other was \u201coptimism and pride\u201d. The report provided Marles with further details about morale, but these portions were blacked out in the version released under FoI laws. \u201cThe redacted information was obtained on the basis of a mutual understanding of confidence to ensure frank and open conversations with both current and ex-service members as well as non-serving personnel,\u201d the decision-maker said in a letter explaining the edits. Despite these cuts, it is clear the panel wanted the government to maintain \u201ca strong focus on the psychological health and welfare of members and their families\u201d. \u201cThe demand on existing services is high and is likely to remain so. Resourcing welfare related support should remain a priority for Defence,\u201d the report said. The panel said the special forces were training members in \u201cmental health first aid\u201d. That was important because it would ensure addressing mental health was \u201can integral and internal part of being a good soldier in the special forces rather than an external requirement\u201d. The report also found \u201csophisticated and challenging ethical dilemmas\u201d were increasingly included in special forces\u2019 selection, training and reinforcement processes. But the panel mentioned longstanding concerns about \u201cunhealthy tension\u201d between SASR members and rival special forces commandoes. It said improved definition of the roles of the SASR and commando regiments \u201cshould assist in the development of mutual understanding and respect\u201d. The panel gave advice to Marles on whether command accountability has been properly addressed \u2013 a long-running source of tension within the special forces community. The detailed new advice about this issue was redacted, but a previous report to the then defence minister Peter Dutton before the election highlighted \u201cthe failure for any accountability to be required from senior officers\u201d. Thom\u2019s panel warned then that the failure was \u201cwidely resented\u201d and lowering morale. Marles has since given permission to the chief of the Australian defence force, Gen Angus Campbell, to resume considering administrative action against people in command roles, a process that had been suspended under Dutton. Marles said last month show-cause notices were issued to \u201ca small number of people\u201d who had held command positions \u201cat troop, squadron and task group level during particular special operation task group rotations\u201d. But the government faced criticism from the Australian special forces community and some politicians, including the Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, who argued the stripping of honours and awards would only be fair if it was also considered higher up the chain of command. The new panel report warns the government that the \u201cmerging of the Afghanistan inquiry report recommendations into the whole-of-Defence transition program means some Brereton report reforms have lost their direct connection to special forces and the urgency needed to meet their future operational requirements\u201d. Marles has declared he is personally committed to implementing the Brereton reforms because \u201chistory will judge us on the way in which we manage this\u201d."

            "date": "2022-12-23T14:00:07Z",
            "content": "Recently the government made two major policy interventions. One was a proposed attack on workers: \u201cnew tough laws\u201d against the right to strike, while refusing to negotiate with NHS workers. The other was a gift to the City: uncapping bankers\u2019 bonuses and looking to remove safeguards brought in to tame markets after the 2008 crash. This was all framed as being somehow inevitable. But it is a choice to adopt arbitrary constraints, not a law of nature. In fact, if the government\u2019s accountancy rules had not been changed 18 months ago, this particular deficit would not even exist. What the whole Truss mini-budget debacle did prove was just how much power the financial markets hold within our global system. For any who continue with a view of the world where the state alone that holds all the cards, this was a timely and undeniable riposte. The fact that globalisation and the growth of capitalism has given the City greater sway in our world doesn\u2019t mean we have no power to stand up and act. But our political class, and in particular the government, is choosing to shore up the power of markets over our economy, our public spending and our lives \u2013 rather than challenging it. It is a choice to focus economic policy on the interests of investment banks at a time of record bonuses and rocketing profits. And it is a choice to make working people pay the price for the crisis. There are alternatives, and there can be a different way \u2013 if there is the political will. A 10% increase to total spending on NHS staff would cost \u00a36.25bn. Of course, in reality the cost to the Treasury would be much less \u2013 for starters, it would get about a third of that back in tax. There are various ways a government could find that money \u2013 even within a fiscal straitjacket. One such way would be real, not artificial, windfall taxes on energy profits. Leaked Treasury estimates show energy companies may make \u201cexcess\u201d profits of \u00a3170bn in the next two years. The current energy taxes, with generous get-outs, don\u2019t even touch the sides. Why can\u2019t we demand \u00a350bn more of that windfall? We could pay off a \u00a340 bn \u201cblack hole\u201d, offer a decent pay settlement for the NHS and still have lots of cash left over. Or what about a contribution from the banks? The UK\u2019s biggest four alone are on target for profits of \u00a333bn this year. Yet the chancellor has slashed its tax surcharge on the sector from 8% to 3%. Yet another positive choice could be to address ballooning wealth inequality. As the former boss of Greggs points out, there are now 177 billionaires in the UK, up from 29 in 2010. Between them they own \u00a3653bn. The Tax Justice Network has estimated that equalising capital gains tax with income tax could raise \u00a314bn a year \u2013 that\u2019s enough to give every public sector worker an inflation-beating pay rise. And why don\u2019t we even consider going further with progressive taxation on income? Since early 2020 we have been living in crisis. At every stage, politicians have made choices. But who have those choices served? The collective interest or vested interests? At the height of pandemic, with key workers being rightly lauded as heroes, the government and Bank of England intervened to support the economy through lockdown and furlough. But it has become increasingly apparent that large sums of public money went to support corporate profits, not working people. In 2020, billions of pounds\u2019 worth of Covid contracts were handed to the private sector, which often failed to deliver. The government bypassed the usual competitive tendering process and in some cases handed contracts to its own business contacts. Then we were hit by the cost of living crisis. Inflation was triggered by a triple hit of \u201cexternal shocks\u201d: post-pandemic supply snags; the ecological crisis of global droughts; then the Ukraine war in 2022. But all these were compounded by a \u201csecond round\u201d of profit-driven inflation. As Unite research showed, FTSE 350 profit margins were 73% higher in 2021 than in 2019. Energy companies like BP, Shell or Centrica are the best known examples. But Unite research demonstrates that profiteering is rife across multiple sectors. Profiteering means taking advantage of a crisis to increase profits above previous levels. And, in many cases, this was enabled by systemic failures: a sign, if ever there was one, of a broken economy. The energy giants, for instance, argue that they didn\u2019t seek to create a grotesque cash cow \u2013 instead, huge windfalls just fell into their laps, thanks to pricing mechanisms \u201cbeyond their control\u201d. This is disingenuous, of course, because none of them will lobby to reform a market that delivers such gold-plated returns and asks for so little for them. Others made use of government-gifted monopolies \u2013 North Sea licences, electricity grids, water or train concessions \u2013 or private sector oligopolies to which failing regulators turn a blind eye. Now the banks lead the latest wave of crisis profits, benefiting from interest rate hikes. As workers go through the greatest real wage squeeze in decades, finance sector bonuses hit record highs \u2013 even before Hunt lifts the cap. The picture of our economy is one of systemic failure. While Rishi Sunak seeks to distance himself from his predecessor, the pro-elite and anti-worker policies are the constant. His government has pursued Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s \u201cbig bang 2\u201d for the City, and anti-union legislation, without a pause. The profiteering crisis, widening wealth and income gulfs: these are the defining characteristics of our broken economy. And the government isn\u2019t just choosing to ignore these issues \u2013 it\u2019s doing all it can to open the cracks even wider. Sharon Graham is the general secretary of Unite"

            "content": "The economy is going to get worse before it gets better. That\u2019s Jeremy Hunt\u2019s assessment of the current state of the UK and few would quibble with the chancellor\u2019s judgment. If ever there was a case of one swallow not making a summer, then the October growth report from the Office for National Statistics was surely it. Certainly, the economy expanded by 0.5% on the month, but that was mainly because of a bounceback in activity from September\u2019s 0.6% fall, when there was an extra bank holiday for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. While bank holidays are good for some sectors of the economy \u2013 such as hospitality \u2013 overall the closure of offices, factories and building sites leads to lower gross domestic product. Retailers had a better time of it in October, and there was a marked pickup in new car sales after a particularly weak September. Activity in the health sector also increased as the autumn vaccine booster drive continued. A better guide to the underlying state of the economy is provided by the quarterly data, which showed GDP 0.3% lower in the three months to October compared with the three months ending in July. This is hardly a surprise given the impact high inflation is having on household budgets and business costs. Weaker consumer spending and mothballed investment plans are the direct consequence of the sharpest annual price rises in four decades. There is, as Hunt admitted in his response to the official data, a tough road ahead. After October\u2019s increase in GDP, the economy is now 0.4% bigger than it was in February 2020 when the UK started to feel the effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic. Yet with real incomes being squeezed and the Bank of England certain to increase interest rates again later this week, the outlook is for the economy to contract for at least the rest of the winter, and perhaps beyond. On the upside, there is some hope that inflation is at \u2013 or close to \u2013 its peak, which may mean the Bank can limit increases in the cost of borrowing. But the question is not whether the economy is about to enter a recession but how deep and how long that recession will be. The Bank is predicting a protracted but shallow downturn, but the risks of something more painful are clearly there."

            "title": "Five charts that show the UK\u2019s economic prospects in 2023",
            "date": "2022-12-29T13:03:21Z",
            "content": "The UK is beginning 2023 on the brink of recession as households and businesses come under intense pressure from the cost of living crisis, with inflation at the highest rates since the early 1980s. The Bank of England has said the country is on track for a prolonged recession, as households struggle to keep up with the soaring costs of food, energy and other basic essentials. Here are five charts for the UK\u2019s economic prospects in 2023. Inflation Britain entered 2022 with inflation at just over 5% as the aftershock of the Covid pandemic and supply chain problems took their toll. But Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine drove up inflation even further, with energy costs for businesses and consumers rising to eye-watering levels, and inflation reaching a peak of just over 11% in October \u2013 the highest level since 1981. Most economists expect inflation to fall back gradually later this year as the initial shock from Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion works its way through the system. Inflation is measured as the annual change in price for a basket of goods and services, meaning the impact of the war in Ukraine from February 2022 will drop out of the official figures. However, falling rates of inflation don\u2019t necessarily mean prices are coming down. Living costs are expected to remain far higher than pre-Covid levels, with energy bills likely to remain more than double historical levels even after taking account of the government\u2019s energy price guarantee, keeping up the pressure on households and businesses. GDP Economic activity has slowed sharply in recent months as consumers tighten their belts in response to soaring living costs, while business investment has slumped amid concerns over the strength of the UK and global economy. Britain remains the only G7 economy with gross domestic product (GDP) below its pre-pandemic level. The Bank of England expects the recession to last for at least the whole of 2023 and the first half of 2024, before only a gradual recovery thereafter. Continuing high energy prices are expected to weigh on activity, while higher borrowing costs for businesses and households after sharp rate increases from the Bank of England will also act as a drag. Company bosses warn that business investment will remain weak, with added headwinds from Brexit red tape and additional costs for exporters. Employment The economic slump is expected to drive up unemployment, as weaker levels of consumer and business spending, alongside higher costs, lead employers to take tough decisions about appropriate staffing levels. However, the forecasts for a sharp rise in joblessness come at a time when companies are struggling to find enough workers, while the public sector is gripped by strike action as the government refuses to budge on pay. Unemployment is at the lowest level since the 1970s, largely as a result of rising economic inactivity \u2013 when working-age adults are neither in work or looking for a job \u2013 after rapid growth in early retirement and rates of long-term sickness. The decline in workforce participation means Britain is on track to be the only advanced economy with employment still lower than pre-Covid levels at the start of 2023. Employers have responded by raising wages, with annual pay growth close to 6%. However, this remains significantly below double-digit inflation, meaning real-terms pay cuts for most people. House prices Pressure on household finances from soaring living costs has been exacerbated by a steady rise in mortgage interest rates, as the Bank of England ramps up borrowing costs in response to inflation more than five times its official 2% target rate. The Bank ends the year with its base rate at 3.5%, up from just 0.25% at the start of 2022, after the most aggressive drive to raise rates for a generation. Financial markets anticipate interest rates will peak above 4%, although the central bank could halt rises at an earlier stage. These higher costs will feed through into the property market as families come to remortgage on higher rates. After a period of booming house price growth, and with weaker economic activity and rising unemployment, economists forecast a sharp decline in house prices in 2023. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects house prices to drop by 9% between the end of 2022 and third quarter of 2024, wiping out much of the increase seen since the Covid pandemic. However, prices will still remain unaffordable for many. It comes after the property market was hit by turbulence from Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini budget at the end of September, which led to a rapid increase in borrowing costs. Conditions have now settled, although mortgage rates remain significantly higher than in previous years. Public finances Jeremy Hunt pushed to win back investor confidence in the government finances after the disaster of the Truss mini budget, using the autumn statement to set out tight settlements for spending and raising more money through tax. However, public borrowing is on track for a significant increase this year as the government spends more on support for households and businesses struggling with their energy bills, while inflation pushes up debt interest costs. The budget deficit \u2013 the shortfall between spending and income \u2013 is forecast to hit \u00a3177bn in the financial year to the end of March 2023, almost \u00a340bn more than a year earlier, before then gradually falling over the next few years. With attention shifting to the next general election as the Conservatives languish behind Labour in the polls, the government will face pressure to offer more support and tax breaks to soften the economic downturn."

            "date": "2022-12-31T19:00:25Z",
            "content": "A safe prediction to make for 2023 \u2013 or any year \u2013 is that many forecasts will be wrong, not least in the world of economics and financial markets. As Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel-winning economist notes in his book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, \u201c[everything] makes sense in hindsight \u2026 The illusion that what we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future.\u201d Year ends (plus a lull in market-moving economic news in western economies, at least) present an ineluctable opportunity to highlight the ill forecasts of the 12 months previous and attempt to extract lessons for the year to come. Examples of late include a Bloomberg piece on the \u201cbrutal reckoning\u201d for Wall Street\u2019s \u201ctop stars\u201d in misreading the inflation risks. The Economist, meanwhile, dubs 2022 a \u201cbrutal year of inflation\u201d that may leave us worried about unemployment in a year\u2019s time as the impact of higher official interest rates dent demand everywhere. Here, though, are some of the safer bets to make for 2023. China\u2019s Covid contortions will be a key focus China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy behind the US, has been the main growth dynamo this century. It is easily Australia\u2019s biggest market, taking about a third of exports and accounting for as much as the next five largest combined. Even before China\u2019s \u201cscreeching U-turn\u201d to abandon its zero-Covid policy, the Reserve Bank of Australia had identified growth in the Middle Kingdom as one of its three key outlook uncertainties. (The other two were the persistence of high inflation and the fate of consumer confidence amid soaring interest rates.) One senior RBA official told Guardian Australia exiting tight pandemic controls would cause China \u201csignificant economic disruptions\u201d. One question is how China\u2019s teetering property market will fare. Another is whether newfound freedoms would prompt a spending splurge, given China\u2019s patchier income support during lockdowns. Beijing is broadly tipped to resort to its standard approach of rekindling growth by spending big on construction. That tactic has supported prices for Australia\u2019s biggest single export \u2013 iron ore \u2013 in the past and investors are betting it will do so again. Longer-term predictions are, of course, more fraught with risk. Roland Rajah and Alyssa Leng at the Lowy Institute warned in March China\u2019s future is less rosy than many predict, regardless of short-term contortions over Covid. Key drags are China\u2019s ageing and shrinking population, a gradual reduction of already poor productivity levels (compared with other east Asian economies at similar wealth levels) and diminishing returns from its pour-concrete-and-build-things economic model. \u201cThis deep slowdown in China\u2019s economy is kind of happening largely one way or another. All the risks are really to the downside,\u201d Rajah said. \u201cWe still see a highly significant slowdown in the coming years and decades.\u201d Australia\u2019s interest rates have further to rise None predicted the RBA would lift its key interest a record eight consecutive months, starting in May. That\u2019s mostly because of Russia\u2019s surprise invasion of Ukraine in February. Russia\u2019s exports of oil and gas were disrupted by the subsequent sanctions and the two warring states alone account for about 12% of calories traded worldwide. Inflation had been expected to be \u201ctransitory, short and sharp\u201d because of the supply chain dislocations and economies juiced-up to power through the pandemic, said Catherine Birch, a senior ANZ economist. The war has meant central banks extended insurance against recessions and \u201cleft it for too long\u201d to hike interest rates to blunt the price spikes. ANZ and Westpac both expect the RBA to lift its cash rate from 3.1% now to a peak of 3.85% in 2023. The CBA and NAB, the other two big banks, predict the central bank will be done at 3.35% and 3.6%, respectively. Investors were lately tipping a top rate of 4%. Each rate rise of 25 basis points adds about $75 to monthly repayments on a typical 25-year, $500,000 mortgage, according to RateCity. The 300bp increase since May has added about $834. Many of those on fixed interest rates are yet to feel the impact. But as Sally Tindall, the head of research at RateCity, noted last month that about one in three outstanding home loans are on fixed terms and about two-thirds of these are due to expire by the end of 2023. For such borrowers, higher rates are unavoidable. Economic growth will slow Higher borrowing costs aimed at sapping demand from households and businesses alike mean major economies are likely to slow if not contract in 2023. Australia\u2019s GDP expansion will halve from about 3% in 2022 to 1.5% in both 2023 and 2024, the RBA foretells. The direction of travel is widely agreed by economists if not the precise pace. Even if a rising population will mean per-capita GDP growth may end up close to zero or even feel recessionary, the abundance of jobs in Australia amid half-century lows in unemployment is one cause for optimism. \u201cThe strong labour market underpins our view of the relative resilience of the Australian economy in 2023,\u201d Birch said. The RBA tips the jobless rate to remain at about 3.5%, or close to current levels, until mid-2023. By the end of 2024, it may still be about 4.25%, a level any treasurer since the early 1970s would have happily accepted. Insolvencies will rise Rising interest rates expose companies (and households) who have borrowed too much, so an increase in insolvencies appears to be another given in 2023. In fact, the end of the Covid-imposed moratorium on such foreclosures means there\u2019s already a bit of corporate cleansing to make up, said Kristen Beadle, a manager of public practice at CPA Australia and a former registered liquidator. The collapse of the Clough Group earlier in December, with its potential knock-on effects for projects such as Snowy Hydro\u2019s giant pumped hydro project, was just the latest hit for the construction industry. Rising raw material costs and labour shortages have battered that sector particularly hard, Beadle said. \u201cPain points\u201d are also showing up in industries such as hospitality, she said. Ongoing working-from-home habits have reduced foot traffic in the heart of major cities. Melbourne, for one, is designed around people coming into the CBD, so the downturn has been \u201creally quite bad\u201d for restaurants and cafes. The interest rate \u201ccliff\u201d of expiring fixed rates will also affect business. One major bank told Beadle recently as many as 70% of its customers would go from a fixed to floating rate early next year, lifting repayment rates from 1.5%-1.9% to 5%-7%. \u201cIn times like this, the directors or the business owner will actually stop paying themselves so they no longer get a wage,\u201d Beadle said. \u201cThat really exposes them personally because they\u2019re not able to maintain their debt levels.\u201d Energy prices will rise Leaving aside petrol and diesel prices that gyrate with global fluctuations, prices of gas and electricity will rise further in 2023. That\u2019s despite the highly unusual intervention in energy markets in December by the Albanese government to put a 12-month cap on gas at $12/gigajoule and $125/tonne for black coal. The federal government will also pay consumers subsidies worth $1.5bn. Treasury estimates power prices in the 2023-24 fiscal year will still rise 23%, a steep increase but better than the 36% its modelling suggests would have been the case without the foray into markets that some derived as Soviet-lite or even Armageddon. Recent falls in wholesale power and gas prices will eventually chip away at retail prices but that\u2019s assuming they are sustained. Extreme weather, made worse by climate change, can be expected to test our energy and other key networks as it has increasingly done so in recent years. Should El Ni\u00f1o form in the Pacific after three La Ni\u00f1a years \u2013 an event models show is possible \u2013 we might face some sizeable energy and other challenges by this time in 2023."

Backed by several other Labour peers, Peter Hain, who is also a former Northern Ireland secretary, says the crises caused by climate change, the Ukraine war, the lack of economic growth and rising energy prices can only be tackled through closer cooperation with our EU neighbours than the current Brexit arrangements allow. Writing in today\u2019s Observer, Lord Hain describes Brexit as a \u201ctaboo subject\u201d because the Conservatives \u201cwon\u2019t admit\u201d the huge damage it has done to the economy, and because Labour remains \u201cunderstandably reluctant to rekindle old Brexit flames\u201d. But Hain argues that \u2013 as the governor of the Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development all now agree \u2013 quitting the EU is the main reason why the UK is the only G7 country with an economy still below its pre-pandemic size, and Labour, as the prospective party of government, has a duty to prepare a detailed plan for Brexit damage limitation. Hain says that, across a range of policies, Brexit has failed and the effects \u2013 often those that are the reverse of what was promised by lead Brexiters - will only become more evident, with potentially lethal effects on the union of England with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \u201cBrexit, supposed to control immigration, has in fact delivered both chronic labour shortages and a dramatic jump in net migration in the year to June 2022, to a record 504,000 \u2013 deeply ironic given the racist undertone to much of the Brexit campaign. \u201cAs these Brexit failings become more evident, support for Scottish independence appears to be edging up. Unless Labour does something about it, we could get independence driven at least in part by Brexit, which Nicola Sturgeon continually stresses in making her case.\u201d Among the measures Hain suggests, in addition to moves to help UK companies restore exports with the EU, is a negotiated removal of post-Brexit travel restrictions including the 90-day limit on UK citizens visiting the EU in any 180 days. He also proposes action to solve the crisis over the Northern Ireland protocol, and cooperation on energy policy and climate change. He writes: \u201cIt\u2019s high time we all confronted the Brexit fantasy of a \u2018sovereign global Britain\u2019. The writing is on the wall. Our destiny lies, if not within then certainly with Europe \u2013 and Labour needs practical policies to deliver that.\u201d Former Labour home secretary David Blunkett backed Hain\u2019s intervention and said the economic cost of Brexit to the government was one factor preventing it from offering more generous pay rises to public sector workers \u2013 the cause of current strikes. Lord Blunkett said: \u201cPeter Hain is quite right to highlight the tremendous economic hit that can be identified as a direct result of Brexit. A 15% drop in trade identified by the Office for Budget Responsibility illustrates, graphically, the loss of resource that could be available to meet the challenge of drastic falls in income and therefore the ability of public employers to offer more generous wage increases and reduce the pressure cooker of industrial action.\u201d Former TUC general secretary John Monks suggested Labour should back moves to solve labour shortages in the UK. \u201cOne problem could be tackled right away: the acute shortages of workers in some sectors, post-Brexit, especially hospitality and agriculture. This could be done by opening the visa scheme from just skilled workers to semi and unskilled key workers.\u201d Wary of alienating Brexit voters, Starmer, a prominent remainer before he became Labour leader, has been at pains to stress that he will not back any return to the EU single market or customs union, let alone contemplate a return to full EU membership, if he becomes prime minister. Recently he also ruled out bringing back the free movement of people between Britain and the EU, saying it would be a \u201cred line\u201d for Labour if it got into power \u2013 despite having backed the policy three years ago. As evidence grows of Brexit\u2019s negative effects, many Labour remainers now believe the time has come to support closer links with the EU. Starmer has also ruled out a \u201cSwiss-style\u201d deal with the EU, which would allow access to the single market but require more generous immigration rules, after reports that the government was considering such an arrangement prompted frantic denials from No 10."

            "date": "2022-12-30T16:28:47Z",
            "content": "Investors are reeling from the worst year in global financial markets since the 2008 financial crisis, as inflation forced central banks around the world to raise interest rates and put an end to the supply of cheap money that has fuelled a golden decade for investors. Global stocks have lost about a fifth of their value during the last year, as the \u201ceverything bubble\u201d that inflated during the Covid-19 pandemic burst, sending tech shares and crypto assets tumbling. Inflation surged as economies reopened from the pandemic lockdowns and Russia triggered an energy crisis in Europe by weaponising gas supplies. Inflation then hit the bond market, which fell into its first bearrun in more than 70 years \u2013 with the turmoil after the UK\u2019s mini-budget hammering UK debt and weakening the property sales. Political turmoil also sent the pound reeling to a record low against the US dollar. \u201c2022 was certainly eventful,\u201d says the Investec economist Philip Shaw. Equities The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks lost about a fifth of its value during 2022, in what Bloomberg calls an \u201c$18tn rout\u201d. That\u2019s the worst performance in 14 years, since the global financial crisis wiped 40% off stock values in 2008. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 fell by about 12% in 2022, its worst performance since 2018. But the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 posted a small gain, lifted by energy companies and defence firm BAE Systems. China\u2019s blue-chip CSI 300 index fell 22% in 2022, as Covid-19 lockdowns hit its economy through the year. The market sell-off wiped almost $1.4tn from the fortunes of the richest 500 alone in 2022, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. Shares tumbled as inflation soared, crushing hopes that price rises would be transitory. US consumer price inflation reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June, and proved stickier than hoped in the autumn too. Joe Biden dubbed inflation \u201cthe bane of our existence\u201d, as food and gasoline prices rocketed. It prompted the US Federal Reserve into its most aggressive rate hikes since the 1990s. FAANGs for nothing Tech stocks were particularly hit \u2013 the Nasdaq Composite lost a third of its value in 2022. The FAANGs \u2013 an acronym referring to the big five tech companies, Meta (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) \u2013 were far from immune. Apple fell 27%, Amazon\u2019s share price halved, while Facebook owner Meta fell 65% as investors balked at Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $100bn push into the metaverse. Tesla also lost about two-thirds of its value in 2022, hitting a two-year low. Tesla\u2019s shares had a rough end to the year, losing almost 40% in December, hit by fears of slowing demand and concerns that chief executive Elon Musk was being distracted by his purchase of Twitter. \u201cSpeculation abounds that the selloff is related to mercurial CEO Elon Musk\u2019s new acquisition of Twitter, ranging from whether Twitter is merely distracting him from his auto company to concerns about his increasingly erratic tweets to worries that Musk is being forced to sell his stake in Tesla in a margin call to support those who bankrolled the Twitter acquisition,\u201d says Matthew Weller, global head of research at City Index. Bonds 2022 was a historically bad year for European sovereign debt, which was hammered by interest rate rises by the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve. The interest rate, or yield, on German 10-year bunds suffered its biggest selloff going back to the 1950s, according to Refinitiv data. By the end of September 2022 had been the most devastating period for bonds since at least 1926, according to one estimate. Investors with classic \u201c60/40\u201d portfolios (60% in shares, and 40% in bonds) were facing the worst returns this year for a century, BofA Global Research warned in October. The most important take of the year is that \u201cthe era of easy money\u201d has ended, and ended for good, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it at that time but the 2022 bear market officially kicked off just a couple of days after the year started, when the first minutes release of the year showed that the Federal Reserve was not kidding about the rate hikes, and that the financial conditions would get real tighter over the year,\u201d Ozkardeskaya says. \u201cAnd man, they got tighter \u2026 way tighter than we expected a year ago, with the Fed raising its interest rates by 425 basis points starting from March,\u201d she adds. Energy Europe\u2019s energy system faces an unprecedented crisis, although prices have cooled from their highs. Continental gas prices broke new records in August, jumping to \u20ac321 a megawatt-hour (compared with \u20ac27 a year earlier), after Gazprom announced the closure of its Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany for maintenance. The pipeline then remained closed, before then being sabotaged in September. Despite the disruption, Europe managed to fill its gas storage facilities, helped by an influx of liquid natural gas (LNG). This week, benchmark European gas prices fell back to levels last seen before the Ukraine invasion. Oil posted its second annual gain in a row, after a turbulent year. In March, Brent crude reached its highest point since 2008, touching $139 a barrel, as traders anticipated disruption to Russian supplies. But crude prices then fell back from that March peak, ending the year about $83 a barrel, on concerns that the global economy was weakening, meaning lower demand from the world\u2019s top crude importer, China. \u201cConcerns about weaker global demand and a particular slowdown from China given its aggressive Covid lockdowns have pushed oil prices lower. This year\u2019s dollar strength has also put pressure on oil markets,\u201d says Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at Interactive Investor. Commodities Copper headed for its first yearly decline since 2018, as prices were pushed down by the stronger dollar, fears of a global recession, and the worsening Covid-19 situation in top consumer China. Other industrial metals on the London Metal Exchange were on track for yearly falls, of between 2% and 35%. But London nickel prices posted the highest gains since 2009, jumping 45% during 2022. Concerns about disruption to nickel supplies from Russia caused chaotic trading in March. Prices doubled to above $100,000 a tonne in a matter of hours, prompting the LME to suspend trading and annul trades, which then triggered a lawsuit from New York hedge fund Elliott Management. Mini-budget chaos 2022 will also be remembered as the year of the mini-budget crisis. Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s plans for unfunded tax cuts sent sterling cratering to a record low of about $1.03, and caused a dangerous selloff in government bonds. The yield, or interest rate, on 30-year UK government debt surged from 3.5% to more than 5% after the mini-budget, as investors sold these gilts, questioning whether Liz Truss\u2019s administration could run a sustainable tax and spending policy. This created a fire sale, in which some pension funds were forced to offload billions of pounds of UK government bonds, or gilts, at distressed prices. Some funds came close to collapse before the Bank of England stepped in with a pledge to buy bonds. That intervention calmed the markets, but gilt yields have been creeping higher, with 30-year bonds now yielding more than 3.9%. The mini-budget was also a disaster for sterling, and it helped drive the US dollar to its highest level for 20 years, although the pound has recovered and is now trading at about $1.20. Crypto After peaking in November 2021, the cryptocurrency market had a dire 2022 as central bankers raised interest rates and ended the flow of cheap money. Bitcoin lost two-thirds of its value, in a grinding \u201ccrypto winter\u201d in which a series of trading platforms failed, including the cryptocurrency exchange FTX."

            "date": "2022-12-12T09:22:05Z",
            "content": "Microsoft will buy 4% of the London Stock Exchange as part of a multibillion-pound deal to work together on data analytics and cloud technology. The US tech company will acquire the stake from a consortium of Blackstone and Thomson Reuters, and will take a seat on the board of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). The consortium previously sold the financial data company Refinitiv to LSEG in a \u00a322bn takeover. The latest deal will unite the exchange with one of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies. The LSEG, which runs the FTSE 100, a stock market index on which it is also listed, has tight links to the UK government and is likely to play a key part in ministers\u2019 hopes to reinvigorate the City of London. The stock purchase comes as London struggles to retain its crown as Europe\u2019s financial centre. The UK capital accounted for $1.8bn (\u00a31.46bn) of the $20.9bn raised in European listings this year, according to Bloomberg data. Representing just 9% of the total, it is the lowest share since the 2007-08 financial crisis. Last month, the combined market capitalisation of primary listings in France briefly overtook the UK for the first time. LSEG\u2019s continental rival Euronext has been on a buying spree in recent years, acquiring the Irish stock exchange in 2018 and picking up the Borsa Italiana, Italy\u2019s stock exchange, last year. Rather than the financial centre of the European Union, London had been downgraded to \u201cthe largest financial centre of the United Kingdom\u201d, Euronext\u2019s chief executive, St\u00e9phane Boujnah, said last week. Still, while London\u2019s appeal for stock listings has waned, it remains a dominant force in currency clearing. LSEG is the majority shareholder in LCH, the largest clearing house in the world for some forms of financial contracts that are meant to hedge risks for businesses and financial institutions. Microsoft\u2019s share purchases are likely to be welcomed by investors in LSEG, which is led by the chief executive, David Schwimmer. LSEG\u2019s share price rose by 4% in early trading on Monday, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. Financial data companies, including LSEG, Bloomberg and S&amp;P Global, are racing to provide new tools to investors and analysts to sort through the huge amounts of data in search of investment opportunities. Microsoft and LSEG said they had agreed a 10-year \u201cstrategic partnership for next-generation data and analytics and cloud infrastructure solutions\u201d, overseen on LSEG\u2019s board by Scott Guthrie, Microsoft\u2019s executive vice-president for cloud and artificial intelligence. LSEG will move its data handling and cloud services on to Microsoft, as well as using its office-working software and integrating the technology it offers to financial industry professionals with Microsoft. The deal will cost LSEG between \u00a3250m and \u00a3300m in new cash costs, and the company expects to spend at least $2.8bn (\u00a32.3bn) on cloud services with Microsoft over the course of the decade. That spending could rise if demand for new services increases, LSEG said. In a statement to the stock market on Monday, LSEG said the deal was \u201cexpected to increase LSEG\u2019s revenue growth meaningfully over time as new products come on-stream\u201d. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chair and chief executive, said: \u201cAdvances in the cloud and AI will fundamentally transform how financial institutions research, interact, and transact across asset classes, and adapt to changing market conditions.\u201d The companies will work together to \u201cgenerate business insights, automate complex and time-consuming processes, and ultimately, do more with less\u201d, Nadella said. Schwimmer said it was a significant milestone that would transform the experience for its customers. \u201cWe are delighted to welcome Microsoft as a shareholder. We believe our partnership with Microsoft will transform the way our customers discover, analyse and trade securities around the world, and create substantial value over time,\u201d he added. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 December 2002 to give the full name of the \u201cLondon Stock Exchange Group\u201d in the headline."

            "title": "Despite its optimism Marston\u2019s pint glass is less than half full | Nils Pratley",
            "date": "2022-12-06T18:46:25Z",
            "content": "It is less than two years since pub chain Marston\u2019s, in the depth of the first Covid winter, rejected cash offers from a US private suitor at 88p, 95p and 105p a share, saying they \u201cvery significantly\u201d undervalued the business and its prospects. Share price today: 38p. One cannot, then, yet say the board has been vindicated by events. Post-lockdown reopening ran into cold realities of a cost-of-living squeeze, soaring energy prices, higher wage bills and rising interest rates. The entire hospitality sector continues to be valued at semi-depressed prices. Hope springs eternal in the boardroom, though, and here comes Marston\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Andrea, sounding almost perky. Revenues from the 1,468 pubs were back at pre-pandemic levels in the last financial year and an underlying pre-tax profit, of \u00a327.7m, reappeared. While \u201ccognisant of the current macroeconomic environment\u201d, trading in November was \u201cpositive\u201d, Christmas bookings are \u201cencouraging\u201d and World Cup football on the telly all day is currently a bonus. And since pub companies \u2013 or, at least, those like Marston\u2019s that hitched themselves to a debt securitisation structure years ago \u2013 are quasi-property companies, the net asset value also matters. On that score, Marston\u2019s reckons its per-share value improved from 64p to 102p over the course of the year. So, at 38p, the stock market sees its pint as substantially less than half full. There is a classic post-pandemic investment debate in miniature here. Bears see debt of \u00a31.2bn as far too much financial leverage, even allowing for Marston\u2019s \u201cback to a billion\u201d target for 2026. Optimists believe the low point for trading profits probably passed with the end of lockdown and that, even in recessions, decent freehold pub estates tend to display a certain degree of resilience. Next year\u2019s outlook can always deteriorate further, of course, but there is currently a glaring disconnect. More than a few consumer-focused companies sound more positive than the stock market thinks they should be. Why is Ofgem treating energy companies like a bank? One reason why the collapse of 29 energy suppliers will cost bill-payers \u00a32.7bn (not counting Bulb, which may add \u00a36.5bn on its own) is that so many of these firms were using other people\u2019s money as working capital. There were two main pots of cash: the so-called \u201crenewables obligation\u201d (RO) payment that the firms collect and pass on to support government schemes; and customers\u2019 cash balances, which Ofgem\u2019s chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, rightly said in June had been used \u201clike an interest-free company credit card\u201d. It was therefore baffling that the regulator, in its belated attempt 10 days ago to impose order on the sector, performed a U-turn. Instead of insisting that customers\u2019 balances are fully ringfenced, which was its original thought, only the RO cash will get the full separation treatment. The new idea is that stiffer capital requirements will give suppliers more financial backbone to absorb shocks, and Ofgem officials will prowl their beat more aggressively to spot anybody treating customers like a piggy-bank. It was all about striking \u201cthe right balance between resilience and competition\u201d, argued Brearley. It\u2019s not only this column that thinks the failure to impose ringfencing on customers is bizarre. Here\u2019s Dieter Helm, the big academic brain in the energy sector, skewering Ofgem\u2019s argument that it is following a banking regulation model: \u201cSince when is the business of billing, and metering and debt collection like banking?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy do you have to lend money to suppliers to keep their businesses afloat?\u201d Absolutely right. The idea that energy companies can fund themselves from customers\u2019 deposits crept up by stealth. It is not progress. And, as Helm argues, Ofgem\u2019s unwillingness to address the issue at source may suggest the sector is \u201con very shaky ground\u201d. That is not progress either. Market still unimpressed by Vodafone If a sub-100p share price was bad enough for Vodafone to terminate its chief executive, the board cannot be pleased with what\u2019s followed. On day two after Nick Read\u2019s exit was announced, the shares closed a whisker under 90p on Tuesday. The lack of a positive reaction probably reflects worries over the dividend and the length of time it could take to hire a replacement (assuming Vodafone recruits from outside). There\u2019s also a more immediate concern about the talks to combine with Three to form the UK\u2019s largest mobile operator. In theory, Read\u2019s departure doesn\u2019t alter the negotiating script one jot. But the theory had better be correct."

            "date": "2022-12-27T23:48:52Z",
            "content": "Tesla shares fell on Tuesday to their lowest in more than two years, marking the company\u2019s worst day in eight months, as Elon Musk\u2019s electric carmaker confronts a rocky financial period. The company\u2019s stock has lost more than half its value since the start of October. Investors worry that Twitter is taking much of Musk\u2019s time, now that he is the social network\u2019s owner and CEO. His tenure as head of the platform has been marked by chaos as he implements \u2013 and often reverses \u2013 a host of new policies. Musk recently said he would find a new CEO to replace him after most polled Twitter users voted for him to step down. Experts say his erratic behavior has undermined confidence in Tesla, with shares down 73% from November 2021. Tuesday\u2019s loss, which saw Tesla shares drop 11.4%, also followed a Reuters report that the company was planning to run a reduced production schedule in January at its Shanghai plant. That news sparked worries of a drop in demand in the world\u2019s biggest car market, amid a rising number of Covid-19 infections in China. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there are demand fears,\u201d Great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes said, citing a delivery forecast cut from Chinese rival Nio in the key market. Hayes also added that Tesla\u2019s stock was facing a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of high interest rates, tax-loss selling and share sales by some funds that hold a significant amount of Tesla stock. Tax-loss selling is when an investor sells an asset at a capital loss to lower or eliminate the capital gain realized by other investments for income tax purposes. Meanwhile, a Reuters analysis showed that prices of used Tesla cars were falling faster than those of other carmakers, weighing on demand for the company\u2019s new vehicles rolling off the assembly line. Musk previously attributed Tesla\u2019s recent struggles to rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, stating \u201cpeople will increasingly move their money out of stocks into cash, thus causing stocks to drop\u201d. The billionaire himself has offloaded Tesla stock this year, selling nearly $4bn of his own shares in Tesla to finance the deal to buy Twitter, which he bought at $44bn. He said in mid-December he would not sell additional Tesla stock \u201cfor at least 18 to 24 months\u201d. However, financial filings show he sold millions after making similar promises in April 2022. Analysts have raised the possibility of Musk being asked to step down as executive at Tesla over his actions at Twitter, as he is already facing a lawsuit over his alleged failure to focus on Tesla due to outside ventures."

            "content": "Australia could soon see a \u201csizeable\u201d crash in the housing market, according to a new report from the International Monetary Fund which warns that housing affordability is declining rapidly. Rising interest rates and inflation have so far neutralised the benefit of falling property values, the IMF said in its Housing Market Stability and Affordability in Asia-Pacific report this month, and property prices are as much as 50% above what a median household can afford. The IMF noted that Australia\u2019s housing and rental markets are among the most \u201cmisaligned\u201d compared with similar economies, and its citizens among the most overburdened by housing costs. Its analysis of price misalignment \u2013 which measures property prices and rents against income levels over long-term trends \u2013 suggests a potential crash in the housing market. \u201cOur model-based analysis shows that a high magnitude of price misalignment, when combined with the impacts of high policy rates, can lead to a sizeable price correction, nearly comparable to past episodes of housing busts,\u201d the report said. \u201cAs interest rates increase, affordability is declining rapidly, despite falling housing prices. In 2022, housing prices may be as much as 70% and 50% above what a median household can afford in New Zealand and Australia, respectively, and the average household would need to spend more than 40% of its disposable income to afford housing priced at the median.\u201d The IMF found Australia has one of the most severe \u201chousing cost overburden\u201d rates, which is the share of the population spending more than 40% of its income on housing. In Australia, about 8% of the population is overburdened: above the OECD average. \u201cSpending a large share of disposable income on housing-related expenditures is often considered to be a sign of unaffordable housing,\u201d the report notes. \u201cA significant concern going forward is that higher interest rates will make home ownership unaffordable for the average household due to rising mortgage payments.\u201d Such misalignment and housing cost overburden rates, plus other factors making housing more unaffordable, are being seen across Asia. \u201cWith rising inflation and interest rates, households face a double shock to their budgets. High mortgage payments, driven by high housing purchase prices and rising interest rates, and high cost of living point to a deterioration of housing affordability, which was already stretched before the pandemic,\u201d the report said. \u201cSince housing is a key determinant for health and education, and housing inequality can lead to perpetuating socio-economic inequality, restoring housing affordability and \u2026 improving access to adequate housing, need to be priorities for policymakers in the region,\u201d the IMF said. Young people are likely to bear the brunt of the rapidly declining housing affordability, however middle-income households will also be affected. \u201cAs macroeconomic policies influence an intricate balance of demand and supply conditions in housing markets, policymakers need to pay close attention to implications of their decisions on housing affordability.\u201d The IMF urged governments to break down barriers for home ownership. \u201cPublic housing more broadly can play an important role,\u201d the report said."

It\u2019s been a difficult two years and we have been waiting for the signs of recovery as people slowly return back to pubs and restaurants.\u201d He said there were still \u201ca lot of macroeconomic headwinds\u201d the industry faced but the firm was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the future. \u201cThe two biggest challenges the industry faces is the cost of living crisis and cost inflation on utilities and food costs driven by the war in Ukraine \u2026 Those pressures won\u2019t be there forever, and when they do lessen we need to be ready as a business.\u201d Urban said the rail strikes were \u201cmassively unhelpful\u201d but M&amp;B had not seen \u201ca big exodus of Christmas bookings\u201d as feared, and still expected a strong showing at its London establishments as there is no tube strike planned. Earlier this week, the British Beer and Pub Association said pubs across the country could shut unless they received clarity soon over what will happen to energy costs after the energy price guarantee\u2019s current finish date. The hospitality industry has experienced a challenging last few years of trading because of the Covid pandemic and other issues, including problems in hiring staff, cost inflation and soaring energy bills. A recent survey conducted by the industry body UKHospitality found that more than a third of hospitality businesses are at risk of failure in early 2023."

            "content": "It is supposed to be the season for indulgence, giving and goodwill. But for many, Christmas is marked by financial stress as they strive to meet the associated costs. This year, the war in Ukraine, rising energy costs and supply chain issues have pushed prices of food, gifts and travel up sharply. Close to half (46%) of UK consumers say they plan to cut back this festive season due to rising costs, according to research released by Which? Here are some of the key areas fuelling the Christmas cost of living crisis. The cost of giving Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows how the prices of some typical gifts have increased over the last year. The stocking staple, a pair of men\u2019s socks, will have set you back 9% more this year than in November last year. The price of perfumes and fragrances was up by 7%, a men\u2019s knitted jumper cost 3% more than last year, and a women\u2019s jumper cost 9% more. It\u2019s not all bad news: some gifts have fallen in price. For the cost-cutting present buyer, books may be a good option. A nonfiction hardback cost 16% less in November 2022 than it did in November 2021, while a Top 10 paperback fiction book was 10% cheaper. Electronic goods have also fallen in price, with games consoles retailing at 11% cheaper and smartphones 1% cheaper than last year on average. Trimming back on all the trimmings The Christmas squeeze may result in fewer boxes under the Christmas tree this year. Two-fifths of consumers surveyed by Which? said they planned to buy fewer gifts this season with a third saying they would buy cheaper presents than in previous years. A third of consumers said they would buy cheaper presents while a similar figure said they would be buying less food and cheaper groceries. One in six said they would attend fewer paid festivities this year while almost one in 10 (%) said they would buy secondhand gifts. Plating up Tradition decrees that you must consume a month\u2019s calories in one sitting on Christmas Day \u2013 but this year inflation means it is going to cost you a pretty penny to do so. The increase in the cost of a Christmas dinner is dependent on what retail researchers put into their basket but one estimates the cost of traditional Christmas dinner items has risen three times faster than wages this year. A Guardian analysis of figures provided by the retail research company Assosia found that the average price of a Christmas dinner food shop \u2013 to feed about six people \u2013 across the traditional big four supermarkets (Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons) had risen by 15% on last year. Looking at own-brand prices during the week ending 24 November, a trolley with a 3.5kg turkey as well as trimmings and a bottle of wine cost nearly \u00a340 this year \u2013 up from an average \u00a334.49 during the same period last year. The cost of one portion of dinner, not including leftovers, increased by about 13%. The price per kg of frozen turkey rose from \u00a33.93 to \u00a34.79 \u2013 an increase of more than a fifth. The cost of a packet of maris piper potatoes had risen by 34% compared with November 2021, with a 2-2.5kg bag costing \u00a31.59. A 500g bag of parsnips similarly increased by 33% on average across the four supermarket chains. Own-brand Cranberry sauce rose by 37% over the year \u2013 a jar now costing on average 87p, up from 64p last year. Some elements of the festive feast have not been hit by as dramatic a price rise, as producers and retailers have managed to keep costs down, especially among more premium lines. A bottle of Campo Viejo rioja reserva cost \u00a310.13 on average \u2013 up only 13p from 2021. Meanwhile, a premium Christmas pudding (400-454g) should set a family back \u00a35.38 on average, exactly the same as last year (a standard range pudding cost 7% more). Cost of Christmas cooking With energy costs on the rise, it is not just the food itself that is pushing up bills but also the cost of preparing it. Take the traditional Christmas roast as an example: it will cost about \u00a31.18 to run an average electric oven for three hours this year, up from 73p last year, based on the energy price guarantee. Using a gas oven would cost 48p, compared with 19p last year. Driving home for Christmas With rail strikes continuing many drivers may opt to get into their cars and crank up the Chris Rea. However, the price of both petrol and diesel \u2013 which fuelled 94% of vehicles in the UK in the three months to June \u2013 have shot up in the last year. According to the RAC\u2019s Fuel Watch the cost of petrol increased from 147.24p a litre in the first week of December last year to 159.74p in the same week of 2022. Diesel drivers will have had their costs rise even more \u2013 from 150.63p to 183.74p a litre, a 22% rise. Figures for both types of vehicles are based on an average mileage of 40 miles a gallon. As a result the cost of a round trip for someone driving from London to see their family in Hull will cost \u00a36 more in petrol and \u00a316 more in diesel than it did just one year ago."

            "date": "2022-12-30T16:28:47Z",
            "content": "Investors are reeling from the worst year in global financial markets since the 2008 financial crisis, as inflation forced central banks around the world to raise interest rates and put an end to the supply of cheap money that has fuelled a golden decade for investors. Global stocks have lost about a fifth of their value during the last year, as the \u201ceverything bubble\u201d that inflated during the Covid-19 pandemic burst, sending tech shares and crypto assets tumbling. Inflation surged as economies reopened from the pandemic lockdowns and Russia triggered an energy crisis in Europe by weaponising gas supplies. Inflation then hit the bond market, which fell into its first bearrun in more than 70 years \u2013 with the turmoil after the UK\u2019s mini-budget hammering UK debt and weakening the property sales. Political turmoil also sent the pound reeling to a record low against the US dollar. \u201c2022 was certainly eventful,\u201d says the Investec economist Philip Shaw. Equities The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks lost about a fifth of its value during 2022, in what Bloomberg calls an \u201c$18tn rout\u201d. That\u2019s the worst performance in 14 years, since the global financial crisis wiped 40% off stock values in 2008. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 fell by about 12% in 2022, its worst performance since 2018. But the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 posted a small gain, lifted by energy companies and defence firm BAE Systems. China\u2019s blue-chip CSI 300 index fell 22% in 2022, as Covid-19 lockdowns hit its economy through the year. The market sell-off wiped almost $1.4tn from the fortunes of the richest 500 alone in 2022, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. Shares tumbled as inflation soared, crushing hopes that price rises would be transitory. US consumer price inflation reached a four-decade high of 9.1% in June, and proved stickier than hoped in the autumn too. Joe Biden dubbed inflation \u201cthe bane of our existence\u201d, as food and gasoline prices rocketed. It prompted the US Federal Reserve into its most aggressive rate hikes since the 1990s. FAANGs for nothing Tech stocks were particularly hit \u2013 the Nasdaq Composite lost a third of its value in 2022. The FAANGs \u2013 an acronym referring to the big five tech companies, Meta (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) \u2013 were far from immune. Apple fell 27%, Amazon\u2019s share price halved, while Facebook owner Meta fell 65% as investors balked at Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $100bn push into the metaverse. Tesla also lost about two-thirds of its value in 2022, hitting a two-year low. Tesla\u2019s shares had a rough end to the year, losing almost 40% in December, hit by fears of slowing demand and concerns that chief executive Elon Musk was being distracted by his purchase of Twitter. \u201cSpeculation abounds that the selloff is related to mercurial CEO Elon Musk\u2019s new acquisition of Twitter, ranging from whether Twitter is merely distracting him from his auto company to concerns about his increasingly erratic tweets to worries that Musk is being forced to sell his stake in Tesla in a margin call to support those who bankrolled the Twitter acquisition,\u201d says Matthew Weller, global head of research at City Index. Bonds 2022 was a historically bad year for European sovereign debt, which was hammered by interest rate rises by the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve. The interest rate, or yield, on German 10-year bunds suffered its biggest selloff going back to the 1950s, according to Refinitiv data. By the end of September 2022 had been the most devastating period for bonds since at least 1926, according to one estimate. Investors with classic \u201c60/40\u201d portfolios (60% in shares, and 40% in bonds) were facing the worst returns this year for a century, BofA Global Research warned in October. The most important take of the year is that \u201cthe era of easy money\u201d has ended, and ended for good, says Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it at that time but the 2022 bear market officially kicked off just a couple of days after the year started, when the first minutes release of the year showed that the Federal Reserve was not kidding about the rate hikes, and that the financial conditions would get real tighter over the year,\u201d Ozkardeskaya says. \u201cAnd man, they got tighter \u2026 way tighter than we expected a year ago, with the Fed raising its interest rates by 425 basis points starting from March,\u201d she adds. Energy Europe\u2019s energy system faces an unprecedented crisis, although prices have cooled from their highs. Continental gas prices broke new records in August, jumping to \u20ac321 a megawatt-hour (compared with \u20ac27 a year earlier), after Gazprom announced the closure of its Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany for maintenance. The pipeline then remained closed, before then being sabotaged in September. Despite the disruption, Europe managed to fill its gas storage facilities, helped by an influx of liquid natural gas (LNG). This week, benchmark European gas prices fell back to levels last seen before the Ukraine invasion. Oil posted its second annual gain in a row, after a turbulent year. In March, Brent crude reached its highest point since 2008, touching $139 a barrel, as traders anticipated disruption to Russian supplies. But crude prices then fell back from that March peak, ending the year about $83 a barrel, on concerns that the global economy was weakening, meaning lower demand from the world\u2019s top crude importer, China. \u201cConcerns about weaker global demand and a particular slowdown from China given its aggressive Covid lockdowns have pushed oil prices lower. This year\u2019s dollar strength has also put pressure on oil markets,\u201d says Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at Interactive Investor. Commodities Copper headed for its first yearly decline since 2018, as prices were pushed down by the stronger dollar, fears of a global recession, and the worsening Covid-19 situation in top consumer China. Other industrial metals on the London Metal Exchange were on track for yearly falls, of between 2% and 35%. But London nickel prices posted the highest gains since 2009, jumping 45% during 2022. Concerns about disruption to nickel supplies from Russia caused chaotic trading in March. Prices doubled to above $100,000 a tonne in a matter of hours, prompting the LME to suspend trading and annul trades, which then triggered a lawsuit from New York hedge fund Elliott Management. Mini-budget chaos 2022 will also be remembered as the year of the mini-budget crisis. Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s plans for unfunded tax cuts sent sterling cratering to a record low of about $1.03, and caused a dangerous selloff in government bonds. The yield, or interest rate, on 30-year UK government debt surged from 3.5% to more than 5% after the mini-budget, as investors sold these gilts, questioning whether Liz Truss\u2019s administration could run a sustainable tax and spending policy. This created a fire sale, in which some pension funds were forced to offload billions of pounds of UK government bonds, or gilts, at distressed prices. Some funds came close to collapse before the Bank of England stepped in with a pledge to buy bonds. That intervention calmed the markets, but gilt yields have been creeping higher, with 30-year bonds now yielding more than 3.9%. The mini-budget was also a disaster for sterling, and it helped drive the US dollar to its highest level for 20 years, although the pound has recovered and is now trading at about $1.20. Crypto After peaking in November 2021, the cryptocurrency market had a dire 2022 as central bankers raised interest rates and ended the flow of cheap money. Bitcoin lost two-thirds of its value, in a grinding \u201ccrypto winter\u201d in which a series of trading platforms failed, including the cryptocurrency exchange FTX."

            "date": "2022-12-30T08:00:43Z",
            "content": "In mid-November Rishi Sunak was asked in a Channel 4 interview to name one public service that \u201cwas working, adequately, working properly\u201d. The prime minister didn\u2019t give a direct answer. But the exchange feeds into an ever-more-common discourse: that the UK is facing \u201cpolycrisis\u201d in almost every facet of life in Britain. From courts to the cost of living, transport to healthcare, environment to the asylum system \u2013 everywhere appears to be affected. As the prime minister faces what he, his government and the public-at-large hopes will be a better 2023, we look at some of the many political problems that marked 2022. Inflation For most people living in the UK, 2022 has been marked by one word. Inflation has pushed up the price of almost everything with food, clothing, energy bills, rents and interest rates all affected. The data shows what the families forced to choose between heating and eating already know: rising domestic fuel and energy prices have pushed consumer inflation rates to levels last seen in the 1970s. The NHS With the turn of 2022 came the realisation that the worst of the Covid pandemic had passed and the hope that this, in turn, would allow the NHS to recover from the unprecedented pressures it faced as a result. However, there has been little letup on services all over the UK. In England the number of people on waiting lists reached a new record high for two years running in October, exceeding 7.2 million, yet another record high, with almost 2 million more across Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It is far from the only pressure being brought to bear on the health service. As many as one in three beds in some trusts are occupied by patients who are medically fit to go home but cannot be discharged because they have nowhere suitable to go. Fiscal and political chaos There has arguably never been a misnomer as expensive as Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s so-called mini-budget, which is estimated to have cost the country a staggering \u00a330bn. The resulting political fallout meant that Rishi Sunak became the third prime minister in 50 days. The prime ministerial churn has only been outdone by those of their ministers in recent years. Between 1997 and 2010, the average tenure of six key ministries \u2013 Home, Health, Treasury, Education, Foreign and Justice \u2013 stood at 1,057 days. Post-Brexit turmoil, three reshuffles under Boris Johnson, his eventual resignation and the chaotic nature of Liz Truss\u2019s tenure have all contributed to bringing the Conservative\u2019s average ministerial tenure in these positions to just 588 days, or 44% less. Asylum backlog The home secretary, Suella Braverman, would have it that the UK faces an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants, but the true scandal was revealed at Manston amid concerns that it was dangerously overcrowded. The immigration centre in Kent opened in January 2022 and was designed to hold 1,600 people for no more than 24 hours. But in November there were 4,000 people there, 2.5 times over its capacity. The British Red Cross said that problems at Manston \u201care indicative of the wider issues facing the asylum system\u201d. The asylum processing backlog rose by 71% in a year and it is now almost twice that of the last pre-Covid year (2019). Three-quarters of those waiting for an initial decision had been waiting more than six months at the end of June. Climate emergency The world is \u201cvery, very close to irreversible changes\u201d, Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, one of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, said in October after key UN reports about not enough progress to avoid a climate catastrophe. This is not a UK-only crisis, but the country has broken several climate-related records this year. 2022 is on the way to becoming, if not the warmest, one of the warmest years on record. The annual mean temperature between January and November in the UK was 10.7C, the highest so far. The UK registered a temperature more than 40C for the first time this summer, contributing to the deaths for more than 2,800 people aged 65 and over in England, the highest number since the heatwave plan was put in place in 2004. Justice delayed The backlog in the justice system is still far above pre-pandemic levels, the legacy of not just court closures during lockdown, but also an overstretched and underfunded justice system after 10 years of legal aid cuts and court closures. The crown court criminal waiting list stood at more than 62,000 at the end of September, up from just over 32,000 in March 2019, while the magistrates court backlog stood at more than 358,000 \u2013 up from 304,000. Family courts are also experiencing a large backlog of cases. The government aims to reduce the crown courts backlog to 53,000 by March 2025. A wave of strikes For the first time in 106 years, nurses from the Royal College of Nursing took the decision to strike in December. But they are not the only workers demanding a pay rise to keep up with the rapidly rising cost of living. University staff, postal workers, firefighters, security workers, bus drivers, railway workers and UK Border Force staff have also announced strikes for the end of the year, with an average of almost one strike a day in December. Rail chaos The number of rail cancellations has reached its highest level on record \u2013 with services in the north of England particularly affected. That\u2019s only counting those trains cancelled within 24 hours of departure, which appear on the official figures collated by the Office for Rail and Road (ORR). Separate figures obtained by the Guardian show some operators are vastly under-reporting their number of cancellations, by preemptively removing trains from the timetable. In the 12 weeks to 12 November, Avanti West Coast \u2013 which runs services between London, Manchester and Glasgow \u2013 timetabled just 57% of the services it did in 2019. About one in 13 of those then went on to be cancelled on the day."

            "date": "2022-12-14T21:08:30Z",
            "content": "The Bank of England is poised to increase the cost of borrowing for households and businesses when its policymakers meet today, as fears mount that the UK economy is about to enter a long recession. Financial markets expect a 0.5 percentage point increase in the central bank\u2019s base rate to 3.5% as the monetary policy committee seeks to combat inflation. The consumer prices index (CPI) fell back from 11.1% in October to 10.7% last month, according to data released Wednesday, mainly from weaker increases in petrol, clothing and food, but remains well above the BoE\u2019s 2% target. Jeremy Hunt has indicated he will welcome a tough stance on rates by officials at Threadneedle Street after he said bringing down inflation was his main mission. The chancellor said on Wednesday that inflation was \u201cthe No1 enemy that makes everyone poorer\u201d and \u201cgetting inflation down so people\u2019s wages go further is my top priority\u201d. However, anti poverty campaigners, trade unions and opposition MPs are likely to blame the Conservative administration for a triple whammy of rising interest rates, high inflation and a contracting economy that has triggered the biggest squeeze in living standards on record. In the runup to today\u2019s decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has steered financial markets away from predictions of a further sustained series of interest rate rises. Bailey and chief economist Huw Pill have stressed the peak Bank of England borrowing rate would be less than the 5% forecast by markets last month. Since they made their comments, most forecasters estimate the peak will be between 4% and 4.5%. Pill said there was a danger that a \u201cself-sustaining\u201d inflationary cycle could take hold whereby businesses continue to raise their prices to accommodate higher wage settlements for their workers long after pressure from soaring energy costs fades. But a study of inflation in the US by Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Wealth Management, has shown a large element of price inflation has come from companies seeking to maintain profit margins. Donovan has urged US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell to make clear consumers are paying a price for super-charged profits, and corporations are more to blame than workers for making the cost of living crisis worse. Danny Blanchflower, a former BoE rate setter and professor of economics at the Ivy League Dartmouth College, has called on Bailey to show restraint or risk plunging the UK into a deeper recession. Earlier this month MPC member Swati Dhingra said she was concerned the effect of eight interest rate hikes this year from a floor of 0.25% had yet to feed through to the economy. In an interview with the Observer, she said: \u201cYou do see a much deeper and a longer recession with rates being much higher. That is what I think we should all be worried about \u2026 are we going to end up lengthening and deepening the recession if the tightening continues at the pace it is?\u201d Dhingra voted for a 0.5% rate rise at the MPC\u2019s last meeting in November, when the majority of the nine-strong committee voted for a 0.75% increase. Business surveys have shown most bosses expect interest rate rises to end by the middle of next year. A third of bosses in a survey said the latest batch of rates rises by the Fed, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the BoE would be the last. The Fed raised its deposit rate on Wednesday by half a percentage point to a new target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, while the ECB is on course for a similar rise, though only from 1.5% to 2%. Investors expect both to continue increasing borrowing costs next year, though at a slower pace. Samuel Tombs, chief economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said November\u2019s month-to-month rise in the UK\u2019s core CPI, which excludes volatile elements such as fuel and food, was the smallest for 11 months. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fluke,\u201d he said. \u201cRecent falls in shipping costs and commodity prices point to a sharp fall in goods inflation.\u201d He said the cost of services, which depend more on salaries, would fall rapidly next year as wage increases fall back. Gurpreet Gill, a macro strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said the lack of momentum in the economy \u201cjustified a slower approach to tightening\u201d. However, she expected \u201cstructural supply issues\u201d stemming from an ageing population, low net migration, higher early retirement and an increase in long-term sickness after the pandemic to keep wage growth high."

            "content": "The economy is going to get worse before it gets better. That\u2019s Jeremy Hunt\u2019s assessment of the current state of the UK and few would quibble with the chancellor\u2019s judgment. If ever there was a case of one swallow not making a summer, then the October growth report from the Office for National Statistics was surely it. Certainly, the economy expanded by 0.5% on the month, but that was mainly because of a bounceback in activity from September\u2019s 0.6% fall, when there was an extra bank holiday for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. While bank holidays are good for some sectors of the economy \u2013 such as hospitality \u2013 overall the closure of offices, factories and building sites leads to lower gross domestic product. Retailers had a better time of it in October, and there was a marked pickup in new car sales after a particularly weak September. Activity in the health sector also increased as the autumn vaccine booster drive continued. A better guide to the underlying state of the economy is provided by the quarterly data, which showed GDP 0.3% lower in the three months to October compared with the three months ending in July. This is hardly a surprise given the impact high inflation is having on household budgets and business costs. Weaker consumer spending and mothballed investment plans are the direct consequence of the sharpest annual price rises in four decades. There is, as Hunt admitted in his response to the official data, a tough road ahead. After October\u2019s increase in GDP, the economy is now 0.4% bigger than it was in February 2020 when the UK started to feel the effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic. Yet with real incomes being squeezed and the Bank of England certain to increase interest rates again later this week, the outlook is for the economy to contract for at least the rest of the winter, and perhaps beyond. On the upside, there is some hope that inflation is at \u2013 or close to \u2013 its peak, which may mean the Bank can limit increases in the cost of borrowing. But the question is not whether the economy is about to enter a recession but how deep and how long that recession will be. The Bank is predicting a protracted but shallow downturn, but the risks of something more painful are clearly there."

            "content": "Britain\u2019s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic has been even weaker than originally believed and is the only member of the G7 group of leading industrial countries where output is still below its pre-crisis level. The Office for National Statistics said the UK economy contracted by 0.3% in the three months to September \u2013 compared with an original estimate of a 0.2% decline. The ONS also revised down growth in every quarter stretching back to the third quarter of 2021. As a result, the UK\u2019s gross domestic product is now estimated to be 0.8% lower in the third quarter of 2022 than in the final three months of 2019 \u2013 the period immediately before the start of the disruption caused by Covid.

Gabriella Dickens, UK analyst at Pantheon Macro, said the UK\u2019s underperformance largely reflected weakness in households\u2019 real spending, which was 3.2% lower in the third quarter of 2022 than in the final three months of 2019, compared with an average increase of 1.6% across the other G7 economies. \u201cHouseholds\u2019 spending has been relatively subdued in Britain due to the comparatively muted recovery in employment, larger price increases, and the fact that households in Britain have been less willing to reduce their saving rate than those overseas,\u201d said Dickens. A breakdown of the ONS national accounts release showed a sharp rise in the UK household savings rate in the three months to September, an indication consumers were taking precautionary measures to bolster their defences against an expected recession. The Bank of England believes the contraction of the economy in the third quarter marks the start of a prolonged recession that will last for the whole of 2023. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is planning measures in his budget to boost growth but believes the looming recession will be less severe than those in the past. Darren Morgan, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cOur revised figures show the economy performed slightly less well over the last year than we previously estimated, with manufacturing and electricity generation notably weaker. \u201cHousehold incomes continued to fall in real terms, albeit at a slower rate than in the previous two quarters, while \u2013 taking account of inflation \u2013 household spending fell for the first time since the final Covid-19 lockdown in the spring of 2021.\u201d Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cQuarter three\u2019s fall in GDP is unlikely to prove a one-off. Retail weakness, a poor set of PMIs [purchasing managers\u2019 indices] and disruption from industrial action all point to the economy likely contracting again in fourth quarter.\u201d Beck said he expected the recession to last for the first half of next year as high inflation affected household spending power and tighter monetary and fiscal policy weighed on activity. \u201cThat said, the economy is not out of supports. Households have room to save a smaller share of incomes, and on some measures, they have yet to dip into the \u00a3200bn-plus of excess savings accumulated during the Covid pandemic. Consumer spending is therefore unlikely to fall to the same extent as real incomes. And falling inflation over the course of next year offers hope of a return to growth later in 2023.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 December 2022. The Bank of England believes the contraction of the economy marks the start of a prolonged recession that will last for the whole of 2023, not 2024 as an earlier version said."

            "title": "Experts predict housing market will cool in 2023 as UK enters a recession",
            "date": "2022-12-26T06:00:24Z",
            "content": "The housing market will cool sharply next year after a bumpy 2022, industry experts are predicting, as the UK contends with recession and higher mortgage rates. As the cost of living crisis has intensified amid soaring inflation and as interest rates have increased, house prices have already started falling month-on-month. The average house price dropped 2.3% in November from October \u2013 the most since the start of the financial crash in 2008 \u2013 according to Halifax. The slowdown is expected to intensify, with all housing indicators flashing red as rates are poised to go higher and the UK enters a long recession. The Bank of England is expected to continue to raise interest rates into 2023 from 3.5% now to a peak of about 4.75%, further dampening demand from buyers. Property experts say this is likely to result in property price declines of between 5% and 12% next year, although some warn that in a worst-case scenario, they could crash by 15% to 20%. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics showed house prices were up by 12.6% in the year to October. Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s disastrous mini-budget in September sent mortgage rates rocketing to above 6%, a level last seen in 2008. Mortgage rates have since fallen back with the average five-year fix at 5.6% according to Moneyfacts, but are still much higher than a year ago. British banks and building societies expect to lend 23% less to homebuyers next year, taking mortgage volumes back to their level before the pandemic \u2013 and ending a two-year boom that lifted house prices by more than a quarter. Trade body UK Finance has forecast that gross mortgage lending for house purchases will fall to \u00a3131bn in 2023 from \u00a3171bn this year and a peak of \u00a3189bn in 2021, when the market was fuelled by a stamp duty holiday. Property sales are set to drop to 1.01m next year from 1.27m in 2022. The property firm Savills is predicting an even sharper drop in transactions, to 870,000, and a 10% drop in house prices in 2023, similar to buying agent Henry Pryor. \u201cA slide, not a crash,\u201d he said. \u201cThe housing market is like a supertanker; it takes ages to turn, change direction or change speed.\u201d The real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle is forecasting a 6% drop in house prices next year, arguing that house price crashes have been rare in the UK. Both it and Savills expect a recovery to 1% price growth in 2024, as interest rates fall back and inflation is contained. Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, expects a \u201cmodest decline\u201d in house prices next year. \u201cThere\u2019s good reason to believe that we can still achieve a soft landing.\u201d He said that while the unemployment rate is likely to rise to about 5% from 3.7% now, this would still be low by historical standards, and could be partly due to people who are currently \u201cinactive\u201d rejoining the jobs market amid the cost of living squeeze, rather than massive layoffs. Gardner noted that about 85% of mortgage balances are on fixed interest rates, and said even homeowners who have to refinance in the near term have had affordability testing at higher interest rates. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really difficult but the vast majority of people should be able to cope with it.\u201d The Bank of England has warned that 4m households face higher mortgage payments next year, with the typical payment going up by \u00a3250 to \u00a31,000 a month. This would cause severe financial difficulties for 220,000 households. Capital Economics\u2019 central forecast is for house prices to fall by 12% by the end of 2023, but Andrew Wishart, senior economist at the consultancy, said in a worst-case scenario prices could plummet by up to 20%. \u201cThe initial drop in house prices has been sharper than in the financial crisis or the early 90s. \u201cFor affordability to return to a sustainable level by the end of 2023, when we think mortgage rates will still be around 5%, the average house price would have to drop by 20%. On the other hand, were market and mortgage interest rates to drop faster than we expect, that would limit the fall in prices.\u201d The picture is different in the private rental market, where rent prices have surged to record levels amid a shortage of properties to rent and growing demand, partly because some would-be first-time buyers are continuing to rent in the hope of lower mortgage rates next year. Official figures showed UK private rents rising by 4% in November, the highest since records began in 2016. Wishart thinks rental growth will be about double the average experienced in the pre-pandemic decade over the next five years, peaking at 5.1% next year. Savills sees rental growth rising even higher, to 6.5% before slowing to 4% in 2024."

            "date": "2022-12-06T15:35:00Z",
            "content": "Time for a recap. The boss of Goldman Sachs has warned that there are \u2018bumpy times ahead\u2019, with the risk of recession next year as central bankers battle inflation. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, David Solomon said we face a \u2018very uncertain time\u2019, with monetary and economic conditions changing very quickly, which is slowing economic activity. Britain\u2019s construction sector had a tricky November, with new orders falling as rising borrowing costs spooked clients. The hospitality industry has warned that business will suffer as rail workers strike later this month. But German factories have reported a bounceback in new orders, despite the economic pressures from high energy prices. It could mean Germany\u2019s downturn will be shallower than feared. Here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s main stories: Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has put UK commercial landlord Canary Wharf\u2019s ratings under review for downgrade due to what it said was the worsening outlook for the real estate sector and the more difficult funding environment, Reuters reports. Moody\u2019s said it expects drops in office values that could be as high as 10-15% alongside materially increased funding costs and weaker demand for occupational space, and a challenging environment for asset disposal because of weak real estate markets. Trade restrictions across the world economy have increased, according to a new report from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It warns that WTO members are introducing restrictions at an increased pace, particularly on food, feed and fertilizers, in \u201ca context of economic uncertainty\u201d exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the food security crisis. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is calling on WTO members to refrain from adopting new trade-restrictive measures, particularly export restrictions. She warns that such curbs could hurt the global economic outlook. Countries should cooperate to keep markets open and predictable in order to allow goods to move around the world to where they are needed, Okonjo-Iweala argues, saying: \u201cMembers have increasingly implemented new trade restrictions, in particular on the export side, first in the context of the pandemic and more recently in the context of the war in Ukraine and the food security crisis. Although some of these export restrictions have been lifted, many others persist. Out of the 78 export restrictive measures on food, feed, and fertilizers introduced since the start of the war in late February, 57 are still in place, covering roughly USD 56.6 billion of trade. These numbers have increased since mid-October, which should be a cause for concern.\u201d India, for example, has just lifted a three-month long ban on rice exports, judging that it now has enough production to fulfill its domestic demand. The New York stock market has dipped at the start of trading, as investors worry that the US Federal Reserve may raise interest rates by another 75 basis points next week. The S&amp;P 500 shares index has dropped by 0.75%, losing 30 points to trade around 3,968 points. Tech stocks are weaker, pulling the Nasdaq Composite down by 1.25%. Traders are jittery about further interest rate rises, and not convinced the Fed will achieve that \u2018soft landing\u2019 which David Solomon mentioned. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains: \u2018\u2019Worries that the Fed could unwrap an unwelcome present of another super-sized rate hike when policymakers meet next week are sprinkling Christmas fear on indices. Wall Street registered its worst day in almost a month [on Monday] after a snapshot from the services industry showed consumer resilience was strong. This has fuelled speculation that the US central bank will have to be more Scrooge-like and make borrowing even more expensive to rein in inflation. Companies still appear to be dealing with pent-up demand with the ISM reading showing the services sector is expanding merrily. With central bank policies so far having meagre impact on the jobs market, the chances of a 0.75% rate hike being announced on the 14th are now considered to be higher. The potential effect of another rapid tightening round has led to jitters about repercussions for the global economy. The boss of Goldman Sachs has warned that there are \u2018bumpy times ahead\u2019, as central bankers try to crush inflation without crashing economies. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, David Solomon said we face a \u2018very uncertain time\u2019, with monetary and economic conditions changing very quickly, which is slowing economic activity. \u201cI think you have to assume that we have some bumpy times ahead\u201d, Solomon explained, with activity levels likely to be constrained in a \u201ctougher economic environment\u201d. Goldman\u2019s economists predict global growth will slow in 2023, to 1.9% growth, Solomon explained. The big question is whether central banks can orchestrate a soft landing, as they tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, Solomon warns: I think that\u2019s so uncertain. I think there\u2019s a possibility of that [a soft landing]. But I certainly think we could see a recession in 2023 also, so I think you\u2019ve got to be cautious and prepare. Faced with this darkening outlook, Solomon signals that Goldman staff should expect lower compensation (ie: bonuses) this year, as 2022 was not as strong as 2021 \u2013 which was a record year for Goldman. He says: 2022 is a different year, so naturally compensation will be lower. We\u2019re still early in the process of making those decisions. But just like every year, we pay for performance and we will pay people based on the overall performance of the firm. There\u2019s a clip here. Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, fears the UK\u2019s train strikes will have a devastating impact on the hospitality sector: Here\u2019s a handy thread on today\u2019s US trade report, from Chad Moutray, chief economist at The National Association of Manufacturers: A traffic jam of oil tankers has grown off Turkey after the imposition of a price cap on Russian crude by western powers attempting to hurt the Kremlin\u2019s coffers. The vessels have come to a halt after Turkish authorities in Ankara demanded that insurers prove that the ships heading through its straits are fully insured. EU sanctions on Russian oil prices came into force on Monday after tense negotiations last week. The rules state that tankers carrying Russian crude oil must not carry western maritime insurance unless it is sold under the $60 ($49) a barrel G7 price cap. The cap has been introduced in an attempt to curb Russia\u2019s fossil fuel revenues while ensuring oil continues to flow and the maritime insurance industry, which is dominated by companies in London, was not damaged. Russian oil transferred via a pipeline is not covered by the cap. About 19 crude oil tankers were waiting to cross Turkish waters on Monday, stopping near the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, which link Russia\u2019s Black Sea ports with overseas markets, the Financial Times reported. It said one tanker had been waiting for six days. Recession fears have knocked the oil price lower today. Brent crude has fallen by 1.3% to $81.57 per barrel, towards last week\u2019s 10-month low. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says this week\u2019s PMI reports have shown economic activity slowing A wider snapshot of business activity across the Eurozone showed that optimism is also low, with activity falling for a fifth month in a row in November. It is clear that surging inflation, combined with higher interest rates, is eating into budgets. The data is a fresh indication that the Eurozone is heading into a shallow recession, but a much colder winter and high demand for oil and gas could see energy prices shoot up again, piling on more pressure for companies. For now, the oil price is being pushed lower, with a barrel of Brent Crude trading below $82, as concerns about the effect of central bank tightening on demand across the global economy take precedence over supply concerns.\u2019\u2019 The US trade deficit has widened to $78.2bn in October, up around $4.0bn from the $74.1bn recorded in September. US exports dropped by $1.9bn during the month, while imports rose by $2.2bn in the month. Natural gas exports dropped by $1.4bn while the value of crude oil exports jumped by $1.6bn in the month. The Commerce Department reports that: The deficit with the European Union increased by $7.1bn to $23.1bn in October. Exports decreased $1.2bn to $28.8bn and imports increased $5.9bn to $51.9bn The surplus with Singapore decreased by $1.9bn to $0.7bn in October. Exports decreased $0.8bn to $4.0bn and imports increased $1.1bn to $3.3bn. The deficit with China decreased by $6.0bn to $26.1bn in October. Exports increased $1.4bn to $13.6bn and imports decreased $4.6bn to $39.7bn. Households will typically have to spend nearly 10% more on Christmas dinner this year, despite data showing growth in supermarket prices slowed for the first time in nearly two years. The figures from the market research firm Kantar shows the cost of a traditional Christmas dinner for four \u2013 including frozen turkey, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes and Christmas pudding \u2013 has risen to \u00a331 this year, up 9.3% from 2021. That is despite data showing that the rate of grocery price inflation dipped 0.1 percentage points to 14.6% over the past four weeks, thefirst time the annual growth in prices has slowed in 21 months. \u201cAs we move into the busiest time of the year for supermarkets, there are signs that the pace of grocery price inflation is easing off slightly,\u201d Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said. Asda is planning to open 300 small convenience stores and create 10,000 new jobs in the next four years as it tries to grab a bigger share of the grocery market and potentially overtake rival Sainsbury\u2019s to become the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket. The retailer, which is controlled by the billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital, currently has just two Asda Express stores \u2013 in Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham, and Tottenham Hale, in north London. It has already said it plans to have 30 by October next year and has now laid out a much bigger ambition. The 300 planned Asda Express sites will be in addition to the 132 convenience stores the group is acquiring from the Co-op. The UK economy could be hit by an \u2018influx of insolvencies\u2019 in early 2023, according to Owen Bassett, retail expert and underwriter at credit insurers Atradius UK. He warns that retailers will be ht by plumetting demand in the first quarter of 2023, with a \u2018bumpy road\u2019 ahead for British retailers and hospitality businesses alike. Bassett says: Black Friday and the World Cup will have tempted people to loosen their purse strings, take advantage of discounts, and encouraged them into their local pubs. Retailers will need to pull out all the stops over the next few weeks to boost sales before demand plummets in January. \u201cThe first quarter of the year is usually one to watch for retail and hospitality insolvencies following the post Christmas slump. To avoid getting swept up in what could be an influx of insolvencies in early 2023, businesses will need to make sure they\u2019re effectively managing their supply chains and doing what they can to avoid holding onto excess stock. We \u2013 at Atradius \u2013 continue to underwrite retail firms on a case-by-case basis, but it\u2019s crucial that firms have robust and updated financial insight and forecasts. To guard against the domino effect that crumbling supply chains can have on firms, a trade credit insurance policy can play a very important role in maintaining a company\u2019s confidence in its trade debtor book. In a time of high volatility this could be a determining factor as to whether a company flourishes or fails.\u201d The European commission is to propose a ban on new investments in Russia\u2019s mining sector, according to the Financial Times. The curbs would be part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow aimed at further eroding the country\u2019s economy and the Kremlin\u2019s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Here\u2019s the details via the FT: The mining investment ban, which will have exceptions for some specific products, is part of a ninth EU sanctions package that officials plan to discuss with member states in the coming days and hope to have agreed by the end of next week, three people with knowledge of the discussions told the FT. The package, which requires unanimous approval by the 27 EU states and could still be amended, also includes export controls on technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals, the people said. More strike news: Thousands of ambulance workers and other NHS staff are to strike on 21 December in a dispute over pay, the GMB, Unison and Unite unions announced. Our Politics liveblog has the latest developments: Night time industries such as nightclubs also fear losing business due to rail strikes over the festive period. Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, has warned the strike action announced by the RMT yesterday will be \u201cthe death knell\u201d for many NTE businesses. Kill says the government must provide more support for the sector: \u201cThese businesses are suffering heavily, with thousands of bookings being cancelled and some attempting to bring bookings forward to avoid strike action, creating further chaos.\u201d \u201cIn previous strike action days, we have seen in some cases up to 40% lost in trade, with billions of pounds in revenue in the balance over the holiday period, which they are relying on to survive.\u201d \u201cIt is clear public opinion is shifting, with many angry at being unable to enjoy a traditional festive period after 3 years of disruption.\u201d \u201cThe actions of the unions and rail companies in reaching a resolution at such a critical time is unacceptable.\u201d \u201cOur sector will not survive the current cost inflation crisis and further industrial action, and will require a Government intervention and further support for businesses at the sharpest end of this crisis.\u201d A Yougov poll published last Friday found that trade unions are seen more negatively following 2022\u2019s summer strikes, but Britons are now more supportive of certain profession\u2019s right to strike, including train drivers and nurses. Airline passengers face higher ticket prices as the industry moves towards its target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050, the head of a global trade association has said today. Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, which includes most of the world\u2019s big airlines, called for swifter action in Europe to drive up scarce production of greener sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Air fares have jumped this year as a result of higher prices for conventional fossil-based jet fuel. Walsh told reporters at an annual media briefing that: \u201cYou cannot expect an industry making on average $1 profit per customer to absorb the increases we\u2019ve seen.\u201d The UK housing sector has also been hit by Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to drop compulsory housebuilding targets to see off an embarrassing rebellion by his backbench MPs. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti reported last night that: The capitulation, which comes in the middle of a national housing crisis, will spark fresh concerns that the prime minister is too weak to take on unruly Conservative backbenchers. It followed up to 100 Tory MPs threatening to back an amendment that would in effect force the government to abolish the target of building 300,000 homes a year in England. Instead, the target will be \u201cadvisory\u201d and councils will be allowed to build fewer homes if they can show hitting it would significantly change the character of an area, an exemption expected to particularly apply to rural and suburban communities. The move was described as \u201cextremely worrying\u201d by housing campaigners but saves Sunak and the housing secretary, Michael Gove, a humiliating showdown in the Commons. They were forced to pull a vote on the levelling up and regeneration bill last month when the rebellion first came to light. Here\u2019s a handy guide to the Christmas dinners on offer at hospitality venues around the UK (strikes permitting), by the intrepid Rich Pelley: The drop in the UK construction PMI to a three-month low shows that the building industry is being hit by the recession, says Kelly Boorman, partner and national head of construction at RSM UK: \u2018Following a surprising uptick in September and October, the latest fall in the headline construction PMI for November paints a truer picture of the major disruption faced by the industry, as business confidence drops to the lowest level in two and a half years. There has been a significant slowdown in construction activity, with higher borrowing costs adding another layer of financial pressure for businesses as they grapple with reduced demand. In addition, as an energy-intensive industry, energy prices remain a real concern, especially with the impact of inflation on the supply chain. \u2018The government has curbed spending on large infrastructure projects, which \u2013 along with house building stalling \u2013 explains why business confidence is plummeting as the recession takes hold. Commercial activity was the only index to rise slightly, although this is likely due to renegotiation of pricing and power within the supply chain, as costs to retender would be at a significant increase. This is further reflected in input buying sitting at the highest level since July, as raw material availability also improved.\u2019 Boorman adds that the UK\u2019s troubling economic outlook is certainly dampening future activity and business confidence in the sector. With November 2022 seeing the highest number of insolvencies since February 2020, further challenges lie ahead. There\u2019s significant risk within the supply chains due to higher borrowing costs and falling cash flows, and it\u2019s likely that restructuring activity will continue to accelerate in the marketplace. Now more than ever, the industry needs government investment to help drive long-term improvement and innovation. The CBI warned yesterday that the UK has fallen into a recession that will last until the end of 2023: People struggling to pay their energy bills, or mortgages or rent, are more likely to experience depression than other UK adults, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows. The ONS reports that around 1 in 4 (or 24%) of those who reported difficulty paying their energy bills experienced moderate to severe depressive symptoms, which is nearly three times higher than those who found it easy to pay their energy bills (9%). Overall, around 1 in 6 (16%) adults experienced moderate to severe depressive symptoms in the period from 29 September to 23 October, the ONS reports. That\u2019s similar to rates found in summer 2021 (17%), but however higher than pre-pandemic levels (10%). Adults who were economically inactive because of long-term sickness were more likely to experience depression (at 59%), as were unpaid carers who performed at least 35 hours of caring responsibilities each week ( at 37%), disabled adults (35%), adults in the most deprived areas of England (25%), young adults aged 16 to 29 years (28%) and women (19%). Around 1 in 4 (27%) adults who reported difficulty in affording their rent or mortgage payments had moderate to severe depressive symptoms; this is around two times higher than those who said it was easy to meet housing costs (15%). Ally MacKenzie, Construction Disputes Partner at law firm Addleshaw Goddard, predicts there will be a lot of disputes in the construction sector next year, as the economic downturn hits builders. MacKenzie explains: Contractors tend to operate on very slim margins so any downturn risks creating a sort of domino effect of cash-flow issues and insolvencies. \u201cThe best thing companies can do right now is ensure that any contracts they have in place properly meet the demands of the current market, particularly in regard to rapid price fluctuations. Contractors should also stay as close as possible to their supply chains and immediately act on any warning signs.\u201d Britain\u2019s hospitality sector fears it will lose out on vital Christmas takings as railway workers hold strikes this month. The RMT union has announced fresh rail strikes starting in Christmas eve, which will disrupt celebrations and travel plans over the festive weekend. RMT members will walk out from 6pm on 24 December until 27 December as the dispute over pay and conditions escalates. UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says the industrial action will hurt hospitality firms, such as bars and restaurants, in the crucial festive season: \u201cThese further rail strikes will be hugely damaging for hospitality businesses, their workers and their customers as it seems almost guaranteed that we will be facing a heavily disrupted Christmas for the third year in a row. \u201cOur estimate of the cost of these strikes already stood at \u00a31.5 billion in lost sales and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating that a solution has yet to be reached to avoid this disruption during the golden month of trade for our sector. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to urge all parties involved in the negotiations to reach a solution imminently to avoid these harmful strikes.\u201d The RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Lynch, has defended rail strikes across the UK over Christmas and said unions have a \u201cduty to coordinate what they do\u201d, saying the government is sending a message that pay rises will only come with worse terms for workers. Growth at UK construction firms has hit a three-month low, as the surge in borrowing costs hit house-building. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that UK construction companies experienced a renewed slowdown in business activity growth during November, due to subdued demand and reduced risk appetite among clients. A number of survey respondents noted that higher borrowing costs and worries about the economic outlook had curtailed construction activity. This pulled the S&amp;P Global / CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index down to 50.4 in November from 53.2 in October, close to the 50-point mark which shows stagnation. That shows the weakest performance since August. Mortgage costs surged after September\u2019s mini-budget, which scuppered some people\u2019s hopes of buying a house. The Bank of England raised interest rates to 3% at the start of November, as it tried to fight inflation. Business optimism slumped to the lowest for two and-a-half years, as builders worried that the jump in borrowing costs would hurt the sector. Employment numbers continued to increase in November, but the rate of job creation fell to its slowest since February 2021. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says the jump in mortgage rates led to some house-building projects being \u2018curtailed\u2019: \u201cStalling house building activity contributed to the weakest UK construction sector performance for three months in November. Survey respondents noted that new residential building projects had been curtailed in response to rising interest rates, cancelled sales and worries about the economic outlook. \u201cConstruction growth was largely confined to the commercial segment, but even here the speed of expansion slowed considerably since October as client confidence weakened in response to heightened business uncertainty. At the same time, a lack of new work to replace completed projects resulted in another fall in civil engineering activity. SSP, which operates food outlets at UK railway stations and airport, has returned to profitability thanks to the pick-up in passengers this year. The owner of the Upper Crust chain has reported a pretax profit of \u00a325.2m in the year to 30 September, up from a loss of \u00a3411m the previous year when Covid-19 restrictions hit the travel sector. It told shareholders that: A rapid recovery in passenger demand through the year and disciplined cost management has resulted in SSP delivering a strong set of results. We remain well-positioned to benefit from the continued recovery and further growth of the global travel market over the medium-term. Revenues jumped by 162% to \u00a32.18bn, and were 78% of 2019 levels. SSP said the recovery in passenger numbers has been led by \u201cstrong leisure travel demand over the summer holiday season\u201d, which has continued well into the autumn. The group also reported a particularly strong performance in North America, where business benefited from the sharp recovery in domestic air travel this year. The UK Statistics Authority, which provides independent regulation of all official statistics produced in the UK, has said it is investigating how train cancellation statistics are reported, following a series of Guardian stories. Some train companies \u2014 with Transpennine Express (TPE) the worst offender \u2014 are taking advantage of a loophole which means that cancellations don\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d in official statistics if they are announced the night before, by 10pm. They use something called a p-code, originally designed to allow companies to cancel trains for reasons beyond the operators\u2019 control, for example after a landslide. But the p-code is open for operators to interpret, meaning some only use it for circumstances that are not their fault, while others, such as TPE, use it when they simply don\u2019t have enough staff. This results in misleading data which only includes on-the-day cancellations. TPE actually cancelled around 20% of services last month but will only have to report on-the-day cancellations of around 6%. Work is also underway with the Department for Transport and the Office for Rail and Road to \u201cbetter display\u201d pre-planned cancellation data. Over in Germany, factories have reported a larger than expected increase in orders, which may cool recession worries. German factory orders rose by 0.8% in October, driven by increased demand for heavy-duty machinery and equipment. These capital goods orders jumped 3.2% in October, despite the impact of higher energy costs hitting Europe\u2019s economy. Makers of intermediate goods saw a 1.4% drop in new orders, while demand for consumer goods was down 6.3%. Economists had forecast a smaller rise in factory orders of just 0.1%, so this indicates the downturn in Europe\u2019s largst economy could be milder than feared. Germany\u2019s economy ministry says: \u201cIn addition to the slightly improved sentiment indicators, this is a further indication that the recession could be weaker than feared, even if the outlook for the industrial economy remains subdued,\u201d The government risks \u201csleepwalking\u201d into a food supply crisis unless it provides crucial support for British farmers struggling with the soaring cost of fuel, fertiliser and feed, the National Farmers\u2019 Union has warned. Rising costs could result in supply problems for energy-intensive crops including tomatoes, cucumbers and pears \u2013 which are on track for their lowest yields since records began in 1985 \u2013 and rationing at supermarkets as recently experienced with eggs, the union said. The union said milk prices were also likely fall below the cost of production and that beef farmers were weighing whether to cut down on the number of cows being bred for slaughter in light of surging costs. Surging input costs linked to the war in Ukraine as well as the pandemic were to blame, the NFU said, having more than tripled the price of fertiliser since 2019, and pushed the cost of fuel and feed up by about 75%. That is on top of a six-fold increase in wholesale gas rices, and increased checks and red tape for importers linked to Brexit. The union is calling for state support for farmers, who it said had been forced out of business since the Covid outbreak, noting that the UK had lost about 7,000 agricultural businesses since 2019. The excitement around England\u2019s performance and Wales\u2019 first World Cup showing in 64 years hasn\u2019t translated into rapid sales rises at the supermarkets, Kantar reports. Beer sales were up in November, but that\u2019s mainly due to higher prices, but sales of snacks have jumped: Kantar says: We haven\u2019t seen a big World Cup effect \u2013 at least not yet. Take-home beer sales nudged up slightly in the last four weeks, covering the first week of the tournament, by 5% to \u00a3230 million, but mostly due to increased prices. Many people are taking the chance to enjoy a social pint while watching the games in bars and pubs, whereas last year we were in the middle of a COVID resurgence so consumers were limiting their movements and going out less. We\u2019re likely to be marking the impact of that comparison with higher at-home volumes one year ago. Crisp and snacks have fared better this winter, however, with sales up by 18%. The cost of a traditional Christmas dinner has jumped due to soaring food inflation, market research group Kantar reports. Grocery price inflation in November has dipped by 0.1 percentage points to 14.6% which is the first decline in 21 months, Kantar\u2019s latest grocery report shows. However, food inflation still remains near record highs and the cost of a traditional Christmas dinner for four has hit \u00a331 this year, with the cost of turkey and vegetables having climbed. Sales of mince pies and Christmas puddings are down year on year based on the number of people buying them and the overall number of purchases made, Kantar reports, suggesting the cost of living squeeze is hitting festive spending. The surge in food inflation means shoppers will have to spend an extra \u00a360 in December to buy the same items as last year. December is set to be a record-breaking month for supermarkets, with sales expected to exceed \u00a312bn mark for the first time. Discount supermarkets have seen another jump in sales over the last month, Kantar reports: Lidl has achieved a new record market share of 7.4% while Aldi remains the fastest growing retailer with sales up 24.4%. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, says Friday 23 December is likely to be the busiest day for pre-Christmas shopping. McKevitt adds: Sales of mince pies, Christmas puddings and Christmas confectionery are worth 2% more than last year, but this rise can largely be put down to higher prices. If we look at the amount of people buying these items and the overall number of purchases made, then sales are actually down on 2021. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The World Cup has lifted beer sales at pub chain Marston\u2019s, as England and Wales fans flocked to the bar to drink in the action from Qatar. Marston\u2019s has told shareholders that the World Cup has benefited trading, with like-for-like drink sales up around 50% for England\u2019s first two World Cup games (against Iran and the US). Marston\u2019s also reports that current trading to the end of November has been \u201cpositive with encouraging levels of Christmas bookings\u201d, in the first festive season without Covid restrictions since 2019. In its latest full-year financial results, Marston\u2019s reports that like-for-like sales were 99% of its 2019 levels despite disrupted trading last Christmas due to the Omicron variant. Revenues rose to almost \u00a3800m in the year to 1 October, up from \u00a3401.7m the previous year, towards its target of a billion pounds. Pretax profits rose to \u00a3163.4m, up from a loss of \u00a3171.1m a year earlier. Andrew Andrea, Marston\u2019s CEO says the company had a a strong performance over the last 12 months. Demand for our predominantly community-based pubs continues to be encouraging despite ongoing macro uncertainty and our estate is well-placed to benefit from changing patterns in consumer behaviour. We are managing cost inflation well and remain confident that our commitment to continue to reduce the Group\u2019s debt and return sales to back to \u00a31 billion will drive NAV [net asset value]and shareholder value. While pub chains are getting a boost from the football, UK retailers have seen a surge in sales of \u2018winter warmers\u2019, such as coats, hot water bottles, and hooded blankets to help them through the cold weather. In its latest snapshot of high street and online spending, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said sales growth picked up last month compared with October, lifted by higher prices due to inflation. Retail sales were 4.1% higher in November than a year ago, up from 1.2% in October, although that masks a much larger drop in volumes once inflation is accounted for. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, tells us: Discounts around Black Friday encouraged shoppers to do their Christmas shopping early in November to make the most of the sales. With the cost-of-living crisis and squeezed household budgets, customers are arguably hungrier than ever for a bargain while retailers have been aggressively discounting in an attempt to attract a slice of the slimmed down pot of overall consumer spending. Despite November\u2019s jump, sales are still falling short of inflation with volumes lower versus last year as the macroeconomic pressures from a looming recession and rising prices continue to weigh on demand. As we approach the most important few weeks of the calendar for retail, it looks like it could be a slimmed down festive season this year for many.\u201d The agenda 7am GMT: German factory orders for October 8am GMT: UK grocery inflation report from Kantar 8.30am GMT: Eurozone construction sector PMI report for November 9.30am GMT: UK construction sector PMI for November 1.30pm GMT: US trade report for October"

            "content": "Time to wrap up, here\u2019s today\u2019s main stories: Factory Orders across the US increased by 1% month-on-month in October, the Census Bureau reports. That\u2019s an acceleration on September\u2019s 0.3% increase, suggesting demand held up pretty well. The downturn at US companies has accelerated, with services firms reporting a sharper fall in new orders last month, due to weak demand from domestic and foreign clients. The downturn in foreign client demand was the quickest in two-and-a half years, due to challenging economic conditions in key export markets. This fall in new business knocked service sector output in November, with firms also reporting a slowdown in rising costs. That pushed the S&amp;P Global US Services PMI Business Activity Index down to 46.2 in November, from 47.8 in October, showing a sharper drop in activity. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says some companies were forced to cut prices to stimulate sales \u2013 which could help fix the US inflation squeeze: \u201cThe survey data are providing a timely signal that the health of the US economy is deteriorating at a marked rate, with malaise spreading across the economy to encompass both manufacturing and services in November. The survey data are broadly consistent with the US economy contracting in the fourth quarter at an annualized rate of approximately 1%, with the decline gathering momentum as we head towards the end of the year. There are some small pockets of resilience, notably in the tech and healthcare sectors, but other sectors are reporting falling output amid the rising cost of living, higher interest rates, weaker global demand and reduced confidence. Struggling most of all is the financial services sector, though consumer facing service providers are also seeing a steep fall in demand as households tighten their budgets. A striking development is the extent to which companies are increasingly reporting a shift towards discounting in order to help stimulate sales, which augurs well for inflation to continue to retrench in the coming months, potentially quite significantly Stocks have opened lower in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 208 points, or 0.6%, to 34,221 points, with the broader S&amp;P 500 index and the tech-focused Nasdaq both down 0.7%. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, says investors are focused whether America\u2019s central bank will slow its interest rate rises: The key focus on investors minds is what kind of a message will the Fed deliver to the market at its highly anticipated rate decision next week. The markets have concluded that the pace of tightening will slow down to 50 basis points. The Fed is then likely to continue hiking at a slower pace a few more times before pausing to give time for the higher rates to work their way through the economy to create a soft landing and in order to cool inflation. As the first big snowfall of winter threatens to drop this week, it\u2019s not just the forecasters and road gritters who will be twitchy: Britain\u2019s energy executives and policymakers are on tenterhooks, our energy correspondent Alex Lawson writes. Many Britons who have held off putting on the heating, afraid of the bulging bills that could follow, may be forced to nudge the thermostat up, putting strain on the country\u2019s power supplies. National Grid has warned that a confluence of scenarios including a cold snap and a cut off of Russian gas to Europe could lead to power cuts. Is this the first piece of that grim jigsaw? An initial assessment appears far more positive than two months ago. European countries have filled their gas storage facilities more rapidly than expected, meaning UK competition for supplies has reduced. In fact, Europe\u2019s storage is so full, some tankers carrying liquified natural gas (LNG) have even been idling in European waters, waiting for prices to bounce back. Mother Nature has also played a part: the mild start to winter reduced demand with some bosses reporting consumption has fallen more than 10% on last year. Here\u2019s Alex\u2019s full analysis: Cryptocurrency operator Circle Internet Financial has abandoned plans to go public in a $9bn deal through a blank cheque company chaired by former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond. Circle has ended its $9 billion deal with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Concord Acquisition Corp, nearly ten months after an earlier agreement was amended. Reuters has more details: \u201cWe are disappointed the proposed transaction timed out, however, becoming a public company remains part of Circle\u2019s core strategy to enhance trust and transparency, which has never been more important,\u201d said Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Circle. The company did not elaborate on its plans to go public. Circle is the principal operator of stablecoin USDC and reported a net income of $43 million and nearly $400 million in cash in the third quarter. The FT says the move \u201c\u201cshows how successive crises have sent a chill through the crypto sector\u201d. Europe will fall into a recession this winter and growth will not return before spring, European Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Monday. Gentolini told reporters before a Eurogroup meeting in Brussels that: \u201cWe will have a recession this winter.\u201d Deliveries of new UK vans fell by a fifth last month. The UK\u2019s new light commercial vehicle (LCV) market dropped by -22.2% in November, with 24,352 of vans sold during the month, according to the latest data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The SMMT says: Declines were seen across most of the sector, with deliveries of vans weighing 2.0 tonnes or under recording the largest decline of the month at -70.9%, followed by those of mid-weight vehicles weighing up to 2.5 tonnes, which fell -63.5%. Sales of battery-powered vans were up almost 15%, though, with 1,974 units registered last month \u2013taking the total EV vans delivered in 2022 to 15,039. The Chinese fashion retailer Shein has vowed to invest $15m (\u00a312.2m) in improving standards at its supplier factories as it admitted working hours at two sites breached local regulations. The online brand said an independent investigation, launched after allegations over labour abuse made in a recent UK documentary, had uncovered that employees at two of its Chinese sites were working hours that were longer than allowed. It found staff at one of the factories were working up to 13-and-a-half-hour days with two to three days off a month, while those at the second site were working up to 12-and-a-half hours a day, with no fixed structure for days off. Sales of new cars in the UK have grown for the fourth month running, with purely electric vehicles accounting for a fifth of the total. In the best November for the industry since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, almost 143,000 new vehicles were registered. Sales for the month were 23.5% higher than last year, and although the overall annual figures to date remain marginally below 2021 levels, industry leaders said it showed \u201crecovery was within their grasp\u201d. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said manufacturers were still having to battle an erratic supply of components from around the world, particularly the lack of semiconductor chips, which control vehicles\u2019 electronics. Moldova\u2019s central bank cut its main interest rate to 20% from 21.5% today, the bank\u2019s governor said via Reuters. Governor Octavian Armasu announced the rate change at a briefing, where he explained: \u201cThe (National Bank of Moldova) creates more attractive conditions for providing credit to the real economy and population.\u201d Global financial markets could suffer a widespread and destabilising collapse following a trend for businesses to reject bank borrowing in favour of loans based on multi-billion dollar foreign exchange deals. As much as $80n of global debt is hidden from regulators and $2.2tn could be at risk at any one time, \u201cpotentially undermining financial stability\u201d, according to the Bank of International Settlements, the Geneva-based organisation that acts as an adviser to the world\u2019s central bankers. In its 2022 Triennial central bank survey, the BIS said trades worth $2.2tn represents about a third of the sums traded each day, and \u201ca volume 30 times greater than daily global GDP and 14% higher than in early 2019,\u201d highlighting the potential impact of panic selling. The move to high-value loans based on the value of foreign exchange deals reveals how financial services firms have circumvented the spotlight from regulatory rules brought in since the 2008 financial crash. To keep tabs on borrowing levels, banks were forced to introduce greater transparency in their reporting of loans and to keep higher levels of capital in reserve to protect against a negative shock. The BIS said a foreign exchange deal between two parties will have a value that can be used as the basis for a loan. But if one of the parties gets into financial trouble, they could default on the loan, creating a cascading loss of confidence throughout the global financial system. Claudio Borio, head of the BIS\u2019s economic department, said: \u201cBIS analysis of the Triennial Survey continues to shed light on some corners of global financial markets that would otherwise go unnoticed. \u201cThere is a staggering volume of off-balance sheet dollar debt that is partly hidden, and foreign-exchange risk settlement risk remains stubbornly high.\u201d Regulators have recently become worried that major financial markets are at risk of panic-induced collapse as the number of traders willing to buy assets declines when prices tumble. Without willing buyers when prices begin to fall, markets become caught in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d, forcing central banks to act as the buyer of last resort. Central bankers fear that private financial markets have increasingly allowed risky trading to develop with an effective subsidy from taxpayers, who provide an unofficial financial backstop via government-supported central banks. The move to use foreign exchange deals as the basis for loans creates a more complex financial system with a higher risk of loans agreements being broken and a freeze on new loans by market participants, the BIS said. Authors Mathias Drehmann and Vladyslav Sushko, said results obtained from the triennial survey were worrying as they show an increasing amount of foreign exchange (FX) trading was hidden from view. They said: \u201cFX trading continues to shift away from multilateral platforms, where price information is available to all participants, towards \u201cless visible\u201d venues. Less visibility hinders policymakers from appropriately monitoring FX markets.\u201d The cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen below 6% for the first time in almost nine weeks, as the UK\u2019s home loans crunch eases off. Bloomberg has the details: The average two-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 5.99% Monday, according to Moneyfacts Group Plc. That\u2019s the first time it has dropped below the threshold since Oct. 4 when key home loan rates were spiraling in the aftermath of then-Prime Minister Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. The average five-year fixed-rate deal also fell to 5.78%, after dropping below 6% almost a fortnight ago. Thames Water has posted an almost \u00a3400m profit for the past six months despite a jump in leaks amid hot summer weather. The utilities giant said it showed \u201cgood progress\u201d in its recent turnaround programme following a series of operational changes, PA Media report. The firm revealed on Monday that pre-tax profits leapt to \u00a3398m for the six months to September 30, swinging from a pre-tax loss of \u00a3581m over the same period last year. It said gains on financial instruments help to boost profitability, offsetting the impact of high inflation. Thames Water said it witnessed an \u201cexceptionally high level of operational incidents resulting from drought\u201d over the period, after hot summer weather which resulted in hosepipe bans. It revealed that it saw \u201cdeterioration\u201d in water metrics, such as leakage and supply interruption, as a result of the drought conditions across parts of the UK. Nevertheless, the company reported a 43% reduction in complaints and 29% fall in backlogs for the period. The pound has risen to its highest in over three months, points out Reuters\u2019 Andy Bruce: The UK government is set to announce a package aimed at boosting growth in financial services and the City of London on Friday, Bloomberg reports, citing \u2018people familiar with the plan\u2019. They say: The Treasury is in the process of finalizing the package and has penciled in the end of the week for the announcement, pending sign-off from the Cabinet, one of the people said. City minister Andrew Griffith had been expected to unveil the reforms, which the government will pitch as securing new opportunities from Brexit by sweeping away unnecessary regulations, before Christmas. Key to that has been a plan to replicate the \u201cBig Bang\u201d, the wave of deregulation in the City in 1986. It\u2019s unclear how radical any changes to the rules might be, or how much of a difference they will make to London\u2019s competitiveness. Russia has claimed that the G7 price cap on its oil will not affect its ability to sustain its invasion of Ukraine, but will destabilise global energy markets. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was preparing its response to Friday\u2019s move by the G7 and allies, which was aimed at squeezing Moscow\u2019s energy revenues and reducing its ability to wage war. Peskov told reporters that: \u201cRussia and the Russian economy have the required capacity to fully meet the needs and requirements of the special military operation. Peskov added that it was \u201cobvious and indisputable that the adoption of these decisions is a step towards destabilising world energy markets\u201d. Supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s is pledging another \u00a350m of price cuts this winter to help customers with the cost of living crisis. Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s says: \u201cWe really understand that millions of households are having to make really tough decisions this Christmas and our job is to do everything we can to help with the rising costs of living. We are accelerating our commitment to being the best value, investing a further \u00a350 million in lowering prices and doing everything we can to fight inflation and help our customers enjoy celebrating this year. We know everyone wants to enjoy a special Christmas meal together which is why we\u2019re keeping inflation at bay and offering Christmas roast dinner for less than \u00a34 per head - cheaper than it was last year. Sainsbury\u2019s had previously committed \u00a3500m on price cuts, as it faced rising pressure from discount rivals Aldi and Lidl, who have gained market share as customers have sought out cheaper food. November\u2019s PMI surveys suggest UK companies face a gloomy outlook at home and abroad, warns economic forecasters EY ITEM Club. They say: November\u2019s UK S&amp;P Global/CIPS services Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) remained unchanged at 48.8. Activity fell, with a third successive fall in new orders reflecting weak demand at home and abroad. It appears increasingly evident that the UK economy is in recession. The weakness in demand is increasingly affecting businesses\u2019 pricing power, with output price inflation cooling despite stronger cost pressures. Overall, it would seem the survey is consistent with the EY ITEM Club prediction that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will shift down to a 50bps rate hike at its December meeting. The London stock market has gained round this morning, despite the CBI\u2019s warning that the UK faces recession and a lost decade unless the government comes up with a solid growth plan. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is up 21 points at 7577, up 0.3%, approaching last week\u2019s five-month highs. Mining companies are among the main risers, as the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions in some Chinese cities could spur demand for commodities. The domestically-focused FTSE 250 index has gained 0.5%. Garry White, chief investment commentator at wealth manager Charles Stanley, predicts we could see a Santa rally in the next couple of weeks, if America\u2019s central bank slows the pace of its interest rate increases this month. \u201cThe global economy faces a difficult 2023, but markets are still likely to rally towards the end of this year. The US has clearly passed its peak of inflation, with price rises expected to moderate worldwide during 2023. This will allow central banks to be more measured in its assessment of economic and it should be able to pause their interest-rate increases early next year, although some increases are still likely. Indeed, the US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points (bp) at its December meeting, compared with the 75bp that has been seen following the previous four meetings. \u201cThis means the Santa rally has great potential to take off after its decision is revealed on 14 December, a move that should reassure markets. The US electorate has effectively turned Joe Biden into a lame-duck president after the Republican Party took back control of the House of Representatives at the mid-term elections. This means that it will be difficult for the Government to provide any relief in the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 with markets preferring times when politicians have difficulty implementing new policy.\u201d One of the UK\u2019s largest accountancy firms will close most of its offices over Christmas and New Year for the first time to save on energy bills. The BBC reports that PwC, which employs about 24,000 people, will shut its main London office from 23 December to 3 January, as well as some smaller sites. PwC chairman Kevin Ellis said having all offices open over the festive period \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense at a time of energy scarcity\u201d. PwC has 19 offices across the UK. Most staff will be taking annual leave over Christmas, but the Covid pandemic has meant that working remotely from home is now common practice. Mr Ellis said that staff wanted the company to \u201cdo our bit to reduce energy consumption\u201d. \u201cOffice life is hugely important to our culture and business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut having all our offices open over the holiday period doesn\u2019t make sense at a time of energy scarcity.\u201d Retail sales across the eurozone fell by more than expected in October, as consumer demand weakened. Retail sales across the single currency bloc fell by 1.8% month-on-month, and were 2.7% lowe than a year ago. The largest monthly falls were recorded in Austria (-4.6%), Croatia (-4.0%) and Belgium (-3.3%). Economists polled by Reuters had expected a fall of 1.7% on the month and 2.6% on the year. Sales of non-food products fell by 2.1% month-on-month, as households cut back, while food, drinks and tobacco sales were down 1.5% compared with September. Activity at UK service sector companies continue to contract last month, as the economy fell into a likely recession. The latest survey of purchasing managers at services firms found that activity fell again in November. Levels of incoming new work continued to fall amid ongoing economic uncertainty, as cost of living challenges hit discretionary spending. This left the S&amp;P Global / CIPS UK Services PMI Business Activity Index at 48.8 in November, matching October\u2019s reading \u2013 a level that shows the sector contracted. The services PMI found: Fastest fall in new business volumes since January 2021 Discretionary spending hit by cost of living crisis Higher pay ensures that cost inflation remains elevated Last week, the UK manufacturing PMI came in at 46.5 (below the 50-point mark that shows stagnation). Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says November\u2019s PMI surveys suggest \u201ca growing recession risk for the UK\u201d. A change of government and its new economic policies may have helped arrested some of the financial market volatility after September\u2019s \u2018mini-budget\u2019 but the economic picture remains stubbornly unchanged. The overall rate of economic contraction has held steady compared to October, indicative of GDP falling at a quarterly rate of 0.4%. As such, this is the toughest spell the UK economy has faced since the global financial crisis excluding only the height of the pandemic. Inflows of new work fell at an increased rate, indicating slumping demand for goods and services, which forced companies to pare back their hiring, resulting in only very modest employment growth, Williamson explains, adding: Although business confidence in the outlook has lifted from October\u2019s recent low, largely reflecting signs of improved political stability at home, an overall gloomy mood prevails to restrain business optimism at one of the lowest levels seen over the past decade. Clearly, risks to the near-term outlook remain tilted to the downside. While an easing of price pressures brought some tentative goods news to suggest inflation has peaked, rates of increase remain historically elevated both in terms of firms\u2019 costs and their selling prices to hint at worryingly sticky price pressures.\u201d James Fairclough, CEO at AA Cars points out that car sales are still down so far this year compared with 2021: \u201cFour straight months of rising new vehicle registrations would be an achievement at any time, but with Britain sliding into recession it feels all the more impressive. \u201cAfter a painfully slow start to the year - when the sector was hamstrung by supply shortages - sales are ending the year strongly, with drivers\u2019 surging demand for Electric Vehicles leading the way. Pure EVs now account for well over one in four new cars sold in the UK. \u201cBut the progress is all relative. Total sales so far this year are still 3.4% down on the Covid-impacted numbers recorded at this point in 2021, and well adrift from their pre-pandemic levels. \u201cThe supply of new vehicles is finally improving, with the SMMT recently confirming that UK car manufacturing output jumped by 7.4% in October. But questions still remain about the durability of customer demand. Britain\u2019s new car market grew for fourth month running in November, with registrations of new vehicles rising by almost a quarter. Registrations jumped by 23.5% in November year-on-year to 142,889 units, trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. It\u2019s the highest November sales total since 2019, as manufacturers continued to churn out vehicles despite \u201cerratic\u201d supplies of global components. Plug-in electric vehicles made up more than one in four (27.7%) new registrations, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) taking their largest monthly share of the new car market in 2022. Sales of petrol-fuelled cars were up 15% year-on-year, while diesel fell over 5%. The SMMT is urging the government to do more to deliver a charging infrastructure for electric vehicles. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, says: Recovery for Britain\u2019s new car market is back within our grasp, energised by electrified vehicles and the sector\u2019s resilience in the face of supply and economic challenges. As the sector looks to ensure that growth is sustainable for the long term, urgent measures are required \u2013 not least a fair approach to driving EV adoption that recognises these vehicles remain more expensive, and measures to compel investment in a charging network that is built ahead of need. By doing so we can encourage consumer appetite across the country and accelerate the UK\u2019s journey to net zero. Economic output across the eurozone has contracted for the fifth month running, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers at European companies. The decline at eurozone\u2019s services companies accelerated last month, warns data provider S&amp;P Global. It foud that demand for eurozone goods and services fell last month, with job creation the weakest in almost two years. It\u2019s eurozone Services Business Activity Index fell to 48.5, a 21-month low, down from October\u2019s 48.6 (any reading below 50 shows a contraction). Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says the data suggests the eurozone is falling into recession. \u201cA fifth consecutive monthly falling output signalled by the PMI adds to the likelihood that the eurozone is sliding into recession. However, at present the downturn remains only modest, with an easing in the overall rate of contraction in November means so far the region looks set to see GDP contract by a mere 0.2%. Manufacturers are seeing some benefits of improved supply chains and the service sector, while still in decline amid the cost-of-living squeeze, has so far not suffered to the degree that many were expecting. With the surveys also bringing signs of inflation having peaked, the headwind on demand from rising prices should also start to ease in coming months, barring severe weather over the winter, hinting that any recession may be both brief and relatively mild. That said, energy prices could spike higher amid adverse weather in the coming months, which would not only hit spending power but could threaten production capacity at energy-intensive industries, under which scenario the risks to economic growth would shift clearly to the downside.\u201d Russia\u2019s rouble has weakened to a seven-week low against the dollar as the price cap on Russian oil comes into force today. The rouble dropped to almost 62.5 against the US dollar, the lowest exchange rate since 14 October, and also dipped againt the euro and the yuan. The price cap of $60 per barrel could eat into Russia\u2019s foreign currency export revenues. RBC Capital Markets point out that Moscow has said it won\u2019t supply countries who back the cap: Leading Russian energy officials, including Deputy PM Novak on Sunday, continue to maintain that they will withhold supply from any customer that participates in the cap plan. Biden administration officials dismiss such threats as bluster, though to date, the Kremlin has made good on many of its disruptive threats; for example, cutting off gas importers that refused to pay in RUB BCS World of Investments say: \u201cToday, the EU ban on Russian oil and the price ceiling kick in, though there is still no clarity how this is enforced.\u201d The rouble tumbled after the Ukraine invasion, hitting 120 to the dollar, but then recovered as Moscow introduced capital controls in March to support the currency. The cost of the items that make up a traditional Christmas dinner has risen three times faster than wages this year, according to research from the Trades Union Congress (TUC). Shares in Vodafone have jumped almost 2% in early trading, following news that CEO Nick Read is leaving. Marc Kimsey, equity trader at stockbrokers Frederick &amp; Oliver, comments: With shares trading at a 20-year low, news of Nick Read\u2019s impending departure is the buying signal investors have been waiting for. Many pubs and breweries across the UK will be forced to shut their doors for good as they face rocketing losses without further energy support, industry bosses have warned. Calculations in a report by the consultancy Frontier Economics, produced for the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), showed that energy bills returning to their regular rate from April would put pubs and brewers at a loss of 20% on average. Businesses have benefited from the energy bill relief scheme but face uncertainty when the scheme finishes at the end of March. The report showed that energy costs were the biggest threat to their viability and \u201cwould be even more lethal\u201d when the relief scheme ends. More than 600 workers at the housing and homelessness charity Shelter are beginning an \u201cunprecedented\u201d fortnight of strike action today in a dispute over pay \u2013 coinciding with one of its busiest times of the year. The Unite union said a 3% pay increase this year had left some of Shelter\u2019s staff unable to pay their rent and very worried about the possibility of becoming homeless themselves. Shelter said some of its services would be \u201ctemporarily impacted\u201d during the strike, but added: \u201cWe are making every effort to continue to serve those in need of our help.\u201d The two weeks of strike action will see its staff join postal and rail employees and workers across a number of other sectors who are taking part in industrial action over pay in what has been called \u201cthe December of discontent\u201d. The CBI are also forecasting a year-long fall in consumer spending, as UK household incomes are squeezed through 2023 by the inflation shock and the recession. Here are their latest forecasts: The CBI expect UK GDP growth of 4.5% this year, -0.4% in 2023 and 1.6% in 2024. Their expectation for growth over 2023 marks a significant downgrade from the last forecast in June (of +1.0%) Their forecast suggests that the economy has effectively entered a recession, which will last until Q4 2023. But they expect this recession to be a relatively mild one, with a peak-to-trough fall in output of 0.7% GDP is expected to return to its pre-COVID level (i.e., in Q4 2019) only in Q2 2024 However, both household spending and business investment do not recover this shortfall \u2013 remaining below their pre-COVID level at the end of the forecast (by 2% and 9% respectively) The copper price has touched a three-week high this morning, after some Chinese cities relaxed their tough Covid-19 restrictions. The three-month London copper price gained 0.6% to $8,504 per tonne, the highest since mid-November. Other industrial metals prices also rose, after several cities including the financial hub of Shanghai relaxed some of their pandemic restrictions. An expert on China\u2019s state media has claimed that coronavirus is weakening and management protocols could be downgraded, days after mass protests broke out in several cities against the zero-Covid policies. The CBI\u2019s economic forecasts for the UK are \u2018bleak reading\u2019, says Bill Blain, strategist at Shard Capital. Blain explains: The CBI think the next decade could be lost as the UK is swamped by stagflation, zero growth and disinvestment, and wonder what the government\u2019s plan is? There isn\u2019t one except to ignore the brutal truth of acknowledging the greatest mistake the UK ever made. He points out that the CBI expect business investment will be down 9% from 2019 pre-Covid levels, as businesses are reluctant to invest in the UK. Telecommunications company Vodafone has announced the departure of its CEO, Nick Read. Read has \u201cagreed with the Board\u201d that he will step down as CEO on 31st December, with CFO Margherita Della Valle stepping up to become interim CEO on top of her current job. Vodafone told shareholders: She will accelerate the execution of the Company\u2019s strategy to improve operational performance and deliver shareholder value. Read\u2019s departure comes three weeks after Vodafone cut its earnings guidance and announced a \u20ac1bn-plus (\u00a3879m) cost-cutting plan to cope with soaring energy bills and inflation. The company\u2019s share price has languished on Read\u2019s watch. It was around 150p when he was appointed CEO on 1 October 2018, but ended last week around 91p. Our financial editor Nils Pratley wrote about Vodafone\u2019s failure to rescue its share price last month, here\u2019s a flavour: The company seems perpetually to fail to meet its potential, while simultaneously claiming a breakthrough lies just around the next corner. Read\u2019s contribution to the overpromising agenda was a bullish presentation a year ago that declared that Vodafone was \u201cstructured for value creation\u201d and that \u201cportfolio actions\u201d \u2013 dealmaking, in other words \u2013 would \u201cimprove returns at pace\u201d. One can\u2019t quite say nothing has happened since then. The Hungarian operation has been sold, a bolt-on acquisition has been made in Portugal and last week Vodafone unveiled a sell-down of its majority stake in Vantage Towers, its German-listed mast business, that may yield the thick end of \u20ac6bn. It\u2019s just that none of those actions has been enough to shift the dial at a group carrying net debt of a remarkable \u20ac45bn. The Vantage transaction, which will create a joint venture with private equity, is immensely complicated and the glaring omissions from the deal-doing have been transactions in Spain and Italy, seen as the priorities given their sub-par competitive positions. In Spain, Vodafone was outflanked in the last round of market consolidation; in Italy, it looked at a deal and rejected it. Hopes are now pinned on the UK, where combination talks are happening with Three; UK competition regulators, though, represent a hard-to-read obstacle. Meanwhile, the one thing investors thought they knew about Vodafone was that its German operation, 30% of the group\u2019s revenues and home of an \u20ac18bn cable acquisition in 2018, could be relied upon in all weathers. The company, after all, enjoys the biggest market share in Europe\u2019s biggest telecoms market. The half-year numbers, though, showed German profits down 7% with \u201coperational challenges\u201d taking the blame\u2026. Oil prices are trading higher after OPEC+ agreed to stick to its current output targets as the cartel waits to make a judgement on the strength of Chinese oil demand before making any changes to its production strategy, says Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor: Meanwhile the G7 $60 price cap on Russian seaborne oil came into effect today as the West tries to limit Russia\u2019s ability to finance the war in Ukraine. However Ukrainian president Zelenskyy condemned the price cap as a weak half-measure that isn\u2019t low enough. There are a lot of moving parts in the oil market at the moment with uncertainty around the outlook for Chinese demand as well as global demand as the extent of the economic slowdown is yet to be seen. Meanwhile the cartel is waiting to see whether the new Russian cap goes anyway to impacting market prices. As a result, OPEC+ has made the call to hold steady for now, despite the recent downtrend. Over the last six-months brent crude has shed nearly 25%. However, given the spike in the first quarter following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is still up by nearly 14% so far this year.\u201d The upcoming recession will probably be shallow, but will still be tough for households and businesses, predicts Alpesh Paleja, CBI Lead Economist: \u201cAnother recession in the space of two years is tough going. A second year of high \u2013 albeit falling \u2013 inflation will hit households hard, especially those lower down the income distribution. With cost pressures remaining high, many businesses will also be operating in a tough trading environment.\u201d \u201cWhile it\u2019s some consolation that the upcoming recession will be shallow, it\u2019s concerning that longer-term weakness in productivity and business investment appears to be bedding in. It does not bode well for living standards and the economy\u2019s capacity to grow over the longer-term.\u201d \u201cThe time for action is now. The Government should leverage more business investment to drive growth. Our analysis shows a permanent full allowances regime would unlock an extra \u00a350bn in capital investment per year by the end of the decade\u201d Britain\u2019s economy has fallen into a recession that will last until the end of next year, the CBI business group fears. In its latest economic forecast, the CBI warns that the Prime Minister and Chancellor must do more to boost long-term growth, having stabilized financial markets by ripping up their predecessors\u2019 mini-budget. With inflation mounting, the CBI has slashed its forecast for growth in 2023, and predicts that UK GDP will shrink by 0.4% next year, down from 1% growth expected before. The economy is likely to have fallen into a recession in Q3 2022, when GDP shrank by 0.2%, the CBI points out. They expect the recession to last until the end of 2023. High inflation is at the heart of weaker economic activity \u2013 the CBI expect CPI inflation to have peaked in October (when it reached at a 40-year high of 11.1%), and to fall gradually over the coming year. But they warn that inflation will \u201cremain significantly\u201d above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target next year, likely to end 2023 at 3.9%. Tony Danker, CBI director-general, warns that the UK is suffering \u2018stagflation\u2019\u201d: \u201cBritain is in stagflation \u2013 with rocketing inflation, negative growth, falling productivity and business investment. Firms see potential growth opportunities but a lack of \u201creasons to believe\u201d in the face of headwinds are causing them to pause investing in 2023. Government can change this. Their action or inaction to support growth and investment will be a key determinant of whether recession is shallow or deep.\u201d \u201cWe will see a lost decade of growth if action isn\u2019t taken. GDP is a simple multiplier of two factors: people and their productivity. But we don\u2019t have people we need, nor the productivity\u201d \u201cThere is no time to waste. The Prime Minister and Chancellor must use levers of growth to ensure this downturn is as short and shallow as possible, but also to address the persistent weakness in investment and productivity. We cannot afford to have another decade where both are stagnant\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Oil is a big story today, as the EU sanctions on importing Russian crude come into effect hours after the Opec cartel resisted pressure to boost crude output. Opec and its allies agreed on Sunday to stick to their plan to cut output by 2 million barrels per day (bpd) from November through 2023. They also pledged to take \u201cimmediate\u201d action to stabilise global oil markets if needed. Brent crude has pushed higher this morning, up 2% at one point to $87.60 per barrel. Srijan Katyal, Global Head of Strategy &amp; Trading Services at brokerage ADSS, says Opec+ took a \u201cmeasured approach\u201d, with fears of a global recession (which would hit energy demand) rising: \u201cBy keeping production flat, OPEC+ have signalled a measured approach, not guided by speculation related to a demand slump in China, a weakened dollar, or even the relatively low prices for oil seen in recent weeks.\u201d \u201cPrices will likely remain fairly stable, though with fears of a global recession looming, and inflation rates continuing to increase, any long-term upside will be muted. A short-term dip to the lower $60\u2019s is also possible.\u201d The G7 price cap on Russian seaborne oil came into force on Monday as the West tries to restrict Moscow\u2019s ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The new $60 per barrel price cap will apply to Russian seaborne crude oil, and was agreed after Poland dropped its opposition to the deal. The price cap also aims to avert a surge in global oil prices as the EU\u2019s embargo on Russian crude begins today.

            "date": "2022-12-20T06:00:39Z",
            "content": "When Adrienne Massey heard that there was a shooting at Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York, she was hoping her aunt, Katherine Massey, knew what was going on. The store, on Jefferson Avenue, was less than five minutes from her house, in one of the Blackest areas in town. As the only major grocery store in the neighborhood, it was the place she often went to buy fresh food. What Adrian didn\u2019t realize at the time was that her aunt was already inside of the grocery store. \u201cI never thought something like this would happen so close to home,\u201d Adrienne Massey said. \u201cWhen we found out she was in Tops, you think in your mind \u2018Nah, it can\u2019t be.\u201d On 14 May, an 18-year-old white gunman radicalized by online white supremacist networks walked into the Tops Grocery store on Buffalo\u2019s East Side and shot and killed 10 Black Americans, including Katherine Massey. He has since pleaded guilty to domestic terrorism as a hate crime, murder and attempted murder, charges that come with a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. It\u2019s yet another painful chapter in American history, and has renewed calls for restricted access to guns and increased urgency around combating white supremacy. But the Tops massacre also reignited conversations about food insecurity and food access in Black communities. The closure of Tops in the immediate aftermath of the shooting left the community \u2013 already classified as a food desert \u2013 with even fewer options than before. But even as the Tops reopened in July, Buffalo residents have started to pick up the shattered pieces \u2013 and are reimagining and rebuilding their food systems with a focus on justice and community. \u201cWe decided, either we figure it out right now, or, this is never going to change,\u201d said Dakarai Singletary, founder of the local non-profit Candles in the Sun. \u201cThis is the most togetherness I\u2019ve seen. We\u2019re really trying to be a community, hold each other all accountable, and think about the wellness of our community by simply trying to make sure our community is OK.\u201d *** A Buffalo native with extensive roots in volunteerism dating back generations, Singletary founded Candles in the Sun in 2019 to serve the Buffalo\u2019s underserved youth, most of whom are Black and Latino. In the fall, just months after the shooting, Singletary stood on the front lawn of Ike and BG\u2019s, a soul food restaurant that he partners with to bring food and resources to underserved communities. As part of a monthly resources drive known as the \u201cStop and Shop\u201d, he and his team were offering bagged household resources like tissue, detergent and soap. Singletary\u2019s efforts run the gamut \u2013 mentorship, food service, local activism \u2013 food has become a centerpiece of the organization, and of Black Buffalo\u2019s recovery efforts. On any given weekend, Singletary might be handing out plums during halftime at high school football games, or stacking canned goods, or delivering meals to local senior citizens. Sometimes he works with Steven Butler, the current owner who took over Ike and BG\u2019s from his parents, to prepare deeply seasoned plates of barbecued chicken, baked macaroni and cheese, and collard greens for Black residents who appreciate a hot meal that\u2019s relevant to their culture. For years, Butler and Singletary have watched Buffalo\u2019s Black residents struggle with access to quality groceries and meals. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep just stacking poverty on top of poverty,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s jobs or retail stores, or food stores, bringing this [successful Black-owned businesses] here allows the Black community to see something other than what they\u2019ve been seeing.\u201d *** On 13 August 1843, writer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass spoke at the National Convention of Colored Citizens, a gathering of esteemed Black leaders in the US. Standing at what was then Court House Park on Washington Street, Buffalo, Douglass delivered fiery calls to actions, and advocated on behalf of freed and enslaved African Americans. Nearly 200 years later and less than three miles away from where Douglass made his speech is Tops, the site of one of more than 600 mass shootings in the US during 2022. Buffalo is one of the most racially segregated metropolitan cities in the country. Black people account for more than 35% of Buffalo\u2019s population, about 85% of whom live east of the city\u2019s Main Street. Like many cities across the US, between the 1940s and 1980s, zoning laws and intimidation kept a growing population of Black Americans away from suburban home ownership on the city\u2019s West Side, effectively creating a color line and exacerbating segregation. Buffalo natives say that, long before the shooting, the city\u2019s East Side has only become more impoverished, more neglected, and increasingly undervalued. This sort of inequality is perhaps most visible within the city\u2019s food systems. East Buffalo has long been considered a food desert, areas with less access to fresh produce, leaving many locals to rely on corner stores or having to drive to whiter parts of town to buy food. For years activists and community leaders like Massey had to nearly beg the city and retailers to put a fully operational grocery store in the community, in contrast to the city\u2019s West side, which has a range of grocers like Wegman\u2019s Price Right and Tops. On the East Side, the Jefferson Avenue Tops has been open for at least 20 years or so \u2013 where it was the sole full-service grocery store in the area \u2013 and many residents, including scholar and historian Psyche Williams-Forson, remembers the store as a centerpiece of the community. \u201cI grew up in Buffalo and Tops was our market; that was our grocery store,\u201d says Williams-Forson, professor and chair of the department of American Studies at the University of Maryland College Park. Like many Black natives and residents, Williams-Forson lived within five minutes of the grocery store. Williams-Forson has written extensively about food access in Black communities, has advocated for more affordable shopping options \u2013 such as general or dollar stores and corner markets \u2013 in Black communities. Noting the Jefferson Tops\u2019 inclusion of culturally-relevant items, such as Black hair products, Williams-Forson says the Tops \u201ccemented itself a hub,\u201d for Black residents. While there was a place where people could largely get what they needed, it being the only place \u2013 while white residents had numerous options \u2013 was still a form of inequity. (The neighborhood has several immigrant-owned shops, but longtime Black residents have said that they often don\u2019t carry the products that they need or that they\u2019re not welcoming spaces for them.) \u201cThis should have been a wake-up call for a lot of policymakers \u2013 because there\u2019s some folks, elderly and otherwise \u2013 who will never be able to go back to that space, because their loved one was violently murdered,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a perfect world, after an event like this, we will say, \u2018Oh, wait a minute, we\u2019ve been neglecting these people, and treating them not treating them as whole human beings,\u2019\u201d Wilbert Green II, a director of school and community partnerships at Canisius College and a product of Buffalo\u2019s public schools, said. \u201cThat\u2019s why this young man felt so comfortable coming into our community and killing elders.\u201d *** After a few sleepless nights following the shooting, Singletary started making plans. He knew the Massey family; he knew some of the victims\u2019 friends and family members; he knew Buffalo. And more than anything, he knew that this couldn\u2019t be the end of the city\u2019s story. Singletary tried channeling his grief and anger into action, and increased volunteerism in the nonprofit. At the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills arena, Singletary runs Heroes Kitchen, which aims to teach children how to cook. A weekly event, Singletary recalls making tacos with a group of kids, roasting the cumin seeds all the way down and adding red pepper, salt and black pepper to make their own taco seasoning. They made banana pudding and Rice Krispies for sweet treats, and have also made Alfredo pasta sauce and a baked mac and cheese finished with a custard sauce instead of a cheese sauce. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching them soft skills through the process of cooking,\u201d says Singletary. \u201cWhile learning how to make your own food, you\u2019re learning patience, you\u2019re learning timing, you\u2019re learning critical thinking. It\u2019s really expanding their entire thought process of culinary work.\u201d He connected with Ike and BG\u2019s to host Stop and Shops. The restaurant also prepares packaged hot meals, which Singletary will deliver to seniors in need. He also does grocery store runs for these same elders and adults with special needs, working to stop the cycle of food insecurity in vulnerable populations. Singletary recreated the Black fish fry \u2013 an enduring tradition in Black communities across America \u2013 a version of which the Tops location on Jefferson had recreated weekly for its largely Black customers. Just after the shooting, Candles in the Sun purchased hundreds of fish and hosted fish frys for several weeks in a row. \u201cThat was a big thing for folks, and I didn\u2019t want people to have that part of their week taken away,\u201d he said. The organization also takes children to Senek Farms, about 30 miles north of Buffalo, where they get to learn about the farming process, and plant and pick their own produce. He connected with coaches at Black high schools, many of which are understaffed and under-resourced, and began coming out with some of his team to slice fruit and hand out healthy snacks to the players, offering mentorship and encouragement alongside a few apple slices or Mount Royal plums. And Singletary isn\u2019t the only one doing this kind of work in the community. Feed Buffalo, a Black woman-owned, halal food pantry, helps vulnerable residents \u2013 particularly those who are Muslim \u2013 access quality food. And Buffalo\u2019s West Side Bazaar, serves as an incubator for the city\u2019s new, immigrant-owned food businesses. It is important to provide healthy food to Black Americans in underserved communities, says Singletary, who wants to undo the message that the community has been sent that they are undeserving of the same sort of care and value that white people in the city receive. \u201cPeople always look down on people that are less fortunate, and always try to give them less because they feel like they are less. I\u2019ve always wanted to change that narrative.\u201d For Singletary, this work is less about what happened at Tops, and more about fighting for the future. But he says that doing that work requires a deep reflection on that tragic day. Reopened in July, much to the chagrin of many residents who felt it was either too soon or should solely be a memorial, Tops now has a new coat of paint and fluorescent lighting to demonstrate an attempted new chapter. But the rapid opening, which some like Adrienne Massey saw as essential to bringing real food access back to locals, has led to a store that feels more like a site of historical, unimaginable horror, rather than a place to leisurely shop for fruits and grains. Green says it speaks to a community forced to choose between two needs: access to food and supplies, and time to grieve and heal, and redesign a grocery store on their terms. \u201cThe Tops massacre was just another punch in the darkness that Black people in Buffalo have felt,\u201d said Greene. \u201cTo me, it is the perfect descriptor of the lack of powerlessness that the Black community has.\u201d And, for Singletary, it\u2019s why the work is so important. \u201cMoving forward, people will probably become more sufficient,\u201d Singletary said. \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped relying on systems to take care of us. We can take care of ourselves and save our own neighborhoods, and not have to rely on others to come from the outside and do better for us.\u201d *** Massey hasn\u2019t returned to the store and has no plans to anytime soon. A memorial fountain indoors draws attention to the tragedy with no mention of victims. Outside of the store, to the right, a mural painted in shades of blue that remembers the 10 victims overlooks the city. Along the exterior, candles, teddy bears, and flowers encircle images of those who lost their lives. At her home, Massey has constructed her own form of healing. She talks about her Aunt Kat\u2019s life. She ate two breakfasts, and would often be up throughout the night writing letters to local newspapers about gun violence, creating plans to address food insecurity in the neighborhood, and thinking about how to support the city\u2019s Black youth. As a teenager, Massey remembers her aunt taking her to a march about civil rights, Adrian\u2019s first foray into Black activism. She played a role in redeveloping the expressway in Buffalo, and fought for women\u2019s rights. \u201cWe\u2019re losing a lot. We\u2019re losing our family, our community; we\u2019re losing our history, we\u2019re losing the wealth of a generation of people that we can learn so much from and grow from.\u201d Today, the mother of three says she is living with joy and gratitude alongside anger and fear, the sort of duality many Black people have had to experience since the founding of this country. \u201cThe healing process is that we keep going,\u201d Massey said. \u201cWe keep moving, we stick together, and we stay united, because she would\u2019ve wanted us to continue to be.\u201d For Black Buffalonians, this progress begins at the ground level. Laughing with two of his organization\u2019s young heroes and they chomped down on chicken tenders while cheering on Bills players, Singletary pointed to the experience as an opportunity for the kids to develop friendship, community, and a love for the city he and so many others continue to fight for. \u201cSeeing a smile on somebody\u2019s face means a little bit more than it used to.\u201d"

In a letter sent to all MSPs on Friday, and seen by the Guardian, the cabinet secretary for social justice, Shona Robison, insists the reforms do not \u201cin any way conflict with our work and commitment to protect women from discrimination and advance women\u2019s rights and equality\u201d. It comes as Holyrood members scramble to gather support for last ditch amendments before next Tuesday\u2019s deadline and amid warnings of significant rebellions\u201d among SNP and Scottish Labour ranks at the final-stage debate a week later. Robison says she is \u201cconscious that some of the details of the proposed reforms have become lost within the wider discussions around trans rights and the perceived conflict with the rights of women and girls\u201d. Scotland\u2019s gender recognition reform bill is intended to introduce a system of self-declaration for obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC), removing the need for a psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria, reducing the time someone must have been permanently living in their gender before they can apply from two years to three months, and dropping the age at which people can apply from 18 to 16. The letter follows correspondence leaked to the Times on Thursday from Kemi Badenoch, the UK government\u2019s equalities minister, to Robison and the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, setting out her concerns that the proposals would create a divergence in approach between England and Scotland on a \u201ccomplex and important issue\u201d, with warnings from UK government sources about \u201clegal chaos\u201d and \u201cgender tourism\u201d. All Holyrood parties except for the Scottish Conservatives are committed to some version of reform in their 2021 manifestos, but there has been growing disquiet among a number of SNP and Labour MSPs about the detail and impact of the bill. The SNP suffered its biggest ever backbench revolt at stage one of the bill but, with the Scottish Greens making gender recognition reform a key plank of its cooperation agreement with the nationalists, the balance of support remains in the bill\u2019s favour. While critics including Rachael Hamilton, the Scottish Conservative lead on gender recognition reform, have been conducting cross-party meetings, it remains unclear whether \u2013 with parliamentary arithmetic so tight - there will be sufficient agreement to carry rebel amendments. Work is continuing down to the wire on amendments to maintain the minimum application age at 18, prevent registered sex offenders from obtaining a certificate and to give public bodies more guidance on how to apply the bill. A number of Scottish Labour MSPs have expressed their own doubts about the bill, and earlier this week its former leader Johann Lamont co-signed a plea to the government to pause the legislation for further consideration. Robison also met the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem, on Thursday, after she sent a highly critical letter to the UK government in which she raised concerns that the reforms would \u201copen the door for violent males\u201d to abuse the process. Scottish government sources say the letter from Badenoch was a response to previous correspondence from Robison in which she raised cross-border issues."

            "content": "A US human rights charity has awarded Harry and Meghan its Ripple of Hope award for their activism on racial justice and mental health. In a statement celebrating their award, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said \u201ca ripple of hope can turn into a wave of change\u201d. The couple received the award on Tuesday night in New York, two days before the release of a tell-all Netflix show expected to include damning revelations about the royal family. In a trailer for the show, Harry speaks of a \u201chierarchy in the family\u201d, a \u201cdirty game\u201d, and says: \u201cWe know the full truth\u201d. The Robert F Kennedy Human Rights organisation (RFKHR) hands out the annual accolade to leaders in government, business, activism and entertainment, this year also honouring Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Bank of America president, Brian Moynihan, among others. During the ceremony, the couple announced they would be collaborating with the RFKHR on a new award recognising gender equity in student film, which they said they hoped would \u201cinspire a new generation of leadership in the arts, where diverse up and coming talent have a platform to have their voices heard and their stories told\u201d. According to the RFKHR, honourees are those who have demonstrated \u201can unwavering commitment to social change and worked to protect and advance equity, justice, and human rights\u201d. The award is named after the \u201cripple of hope\u201d speech on apartheid given in 1966 given by Robert Kennedy, the former US president John F Kennedy\u2019s brother, to students at Cape Town University in South Africa. The charity was set up shortly after Robert Kennedy was murdered in 1968. His daughter, Kerry Kennedy, a human rights lawyer and the charity\u2019s president, said the Sussexes had been \u201cincredibly brave\u201d in addressing the issues of racial justice and mental illness. \u201cThey\u2019ve stood up, they\u2019ve talked about racial justice and they\u2019ve talked about mental illness in a way that was incredibly brave,\u201d she told the US news outlet Extra. \u201cIn this world in the wake of Covid there has been a massive spike \u2026 people around the globe have said they have anxiety and massive depression. For Meghan to get out there on national television and normalise discussion of mental health, at this point, is incredibly important and very brave.\u201d The 2022 Ripple of Hope ceremony was hosted by the Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin. The ceremony also recognised the former NBA basketball star and civil rights campaigner Bill Russell with a posthumous award. Previous Ripple of Hope winners have included the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, the poet Amanda Gorman, the US\u2019s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, musicians Bono and Taylor Swift, the South African bishop and activist Desmond Tutu, actor George Clooney, former presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and the Apple CEO Tim Cook. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 December 2022.

            "date": "2022-12-17T19:00:29Z",
            "content": "Alex* loves his job. It\u2019s an interesting workplace filled with interesting people. He is so committed, he has an app on his phone with a credo outlining values the company expects its employees to uphold. The only issue is that Alex, who asked his real name not be used, feels as if he is always on-call and what he says is unpredictable rostering means he can never be sure when he is working. The problems caused by variable rosters affects hundreds of thousands of workers across Australia. From workers in the arts and aged care to casual and part-time retail and hospitality workers, many can have their work days change from week to week, month to month. Now unions and some politicians are beginning to call for \u201croster justice\u201d \u2013 for the right to predictable and stable shifts. It is an issue Alex knows intimately. The workers at the Apple store where Alex works voted in early December to strike on Christmas Eve as part of an ongoing industrial dispute which includes, among demands for better pay and conditions, a push for clear work times and guaranteed set days off. The impact on workers from unstable rosters reverberates throughout their lives, and it can be particularly difficult for workers with caring responsibilities. Alex says the lack of predictability makes it hard to schedule his time off, and even harder to achieve long-term life goals like buying a house. \u201cIt\u2019s about planning for a family, planning for friends. It\u2019s frustrating when you have no idea when you\u2019re going to work on a particular day,\u201d Alex says. \u201cPeople deserve to have certainty restored to their lives just so they can plan for life.\u201d In a statement Apple said it was \u201ccommitted to providing an excellent experience for our customers and teams, and proud to reward all of our valued team members in Australia with strong compensation and exceptional benefits\u201d. A work-time security issue Dr Gemma Beale, from Flinders University\u2019s Australian Industrial Transformation Institute, says the phrase \u201croster justice\u201d refers to what is known in academia as \u201cthe problem of work-time insecurity\u201d. \u201cWork-time security is about your access of hours of work, the control over hours worked and the predictability and consistency of working hours over time,\u201d Dr Beale says. \u201cThe greater the fluctuation in your work-time security, the more precarious your job is. It\u2019s about whether you can reasonably predict whether you will be working week to week and whether that\u2019s consistent week to week.\u201d Dr Beale says high levels of work-time insecurity can profoundly impact a person\u2019s health and wellbeing. Though it primarily interferes with basic tasks like maintaining a proper diet, regular exercise or sleep, it can also have other effects like stopping people from attending doctor\u2019s appointments, caring for family, establishing relationships, or maintaining existing ones. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Over time, the effects of these compound. \u201cThere\u2019s research that shows high rates of work-time insecurity delays buying a house, relationship formation, marriage and parenthood,\u201d Dr Beale says. Nearly one in four workers in Australia were employed on a casual basis as of August 2021, according to a 2021 review by the parliamentary library, with over two-thirds of all casual workers not guaranteed a minimum number of hours each week. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, roughly one in six Australians work on shifts and more than one in five are usually required to be on call or standby. Variable or unpredictable rosters can impact full-time and part-time workers, and while it can affect professions considered prestigious such as health and law, much of the political and union focus on predictability in rostering has focused on people working in casual employment. Josh Cullinan, the secretary for the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, claims some employers deliberately rely on high levels of insecurity as part of their business model, particularly where young people are employed. \u201cToo often we see workers, five, 10, 15 years later look back and realise they weren\u2019t able to live life to the fullest because they had to be available to their employer 24-7,\u201d Cullinan says. David Alexander, the chief of policy and advocacy at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says Australia\u2019s employment laws already provide ways for casual workers to move into more permanent positions. \u201cAustralia\u2019s workplace laws rightly provide employers and employees a choice between job types that are permanent and predictable or flexible and tailored to their own individual needs,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cCasual employment can offer significant benefits to both employers and employees through greater flexibility.\u201d Predicting apples and rosters When the employment minister, Tony Burke, was contacted for comment his office directed the Guardian to a speech at the National Press Club and the first reading speech of the government\u2019s industrial relations bill in which Burke flagged changes to make job security an objective of the act, a limit on consecutive contracts and an opportunity for \u201carbitration\u201d if a request for a roster change was rejected. In October, Labor senators joined Greens members of the Senate select committee on work and care to call for \u201croster justice\u201d to be included in an amended Fair Work Act and the government has flagged further reforms in the new year. Earlier, at the skills and jobs summit, the independent MP Zoe Daniels proposed giving casual and part-time workers at least four weeks\u2019 notice of work schedules, as part of a series of recommendations for reform. Barbara Pocock, a Greens senator, says change is well overdue. \u201cMany business can predict exactly how many granny smith apples they will need next week, they can predict their ongoing workforce needs, but they aren\u2019t taking steps to look after their workforce to make sure they have predictability,\u201d she says. \u201cThat really needs to change.\u201d A bookshop and a roster Carolina Cooksey says change is possible. The 19-year-old has done most of her growing up at the bookshop. She started at Better Read Than Dead in Sydney\u2019s inner west as a Christmas casual in 2019 while she was still in high school. At the time she figured it was better work than hospitality. A job at the bookstore offered social cache and meant she was effectively being paid to read. Soon, however, she was among workers drawn into a protracted labour dispute that received considerable media attention. There were many issues at play, but among them was a realisation by staff they had become trapped in casual employment, subject to an unpredictable rostering system that meant they were always on call. Cooksey\u2019s fight ended when an agreement was struck that gave bookstore staff a path to part-time employment and certainty around rostering \u2013 a big win for a small workplace. \u201cFor me, personally, that was really significant,\u201d says Cooksey, who is now part-time. \u201cJust having that predictability takes away a layer of stress.\u201d"

            "content": "Let there be no confusion: this is an unarguably bad film. But it\u2019s on the edge of being bad in a sort of delicious campy way, calling back to the kind of subpar, money laundering financed pulp one used to find for sale as dusty DVDs or videos in corner shops. Like all great bad films, it features once A-list actors slumming it to pay off whatever debts they must have accrued in happier times when they were able to be fussier about what their agents fished out of the slush pile. In the case of Savage Justice (also known as Savage Salvation in markets less leery of Biblical language), the cast includes none other than formerly rising, now holding steady star Jack Huston (probably best known for TV\u2019s Boardwalk Empire), and thesping legends Robert De Niro and John Malkovich. All three of them break out their best effort at southern-fried accents, and it\u2019s not a pretty sound. Huston does the heavy lifting playing a working-class good ol\u2019 boy named Shelby who has got himself addicted to heroin, as has his girlfriend Ruby Red (Willa Fitzgerald). In the world of this film, drug misuse has little deleterious effects on men, but it does cause female users such as Ruby to only ever wear bikini pants and skimpy vests, especially while lolling around when high. When the shooting up stops being fun, Shelby starts shooting down all the people involved in the trade he can access, seeking revenge. De Niro plays a sheriff tracking him down, haunted by his own demons and all that jazz. Malkovich shows up briefly at the beginning, smiling his sinister crocodile smile while shilling for cryptocurrency \u2013 appearing just long enough to lead genre-savvy viewers to expect he\u2019ll have a crucial role in the denouement. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. \u2022 Savage Justice is released on 12 December on digital platforms."

            "title": "Biden promised to reform the police. Why has so little progress been made?",
            "date": "2022-12-26T11:00:28Z",
            "content": "Two years to the day since George Floyd was murdered by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Joe Biden stood in the White House and signed an executive order he argued should instill optimism and hope among reform advocates across the country. It was late afternoon in the spring of this year, and among the attendees were members of Floyd\u2019s family and the family of Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old Black woman killed by police in Louisville, Kentucky, shortly before Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cThis executive order is going to deliver the most significant police reform in decades,\u201d the president said. Biden had placed broad police reform as a central campaign issue in a bold criminal justice platform, but two years on, and despite the rhetorical optimism on that signing day, the issue remains as intractable as it is complex. The executive order was signed after the administration abandoned its pledge to create a national police oversight commission, instead focusing efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act through Congress. But the sweeping legislation, which included meaningful efforts to end the use of police chokeholds, mandate the collection of data related to fatal use of force and amend criminal statutes allowing for broader federal prosecution of police officers, has sunk amid partisan point-scoring and the slimmest of Democratic majorities in the US Senate. Biden has actively criticized the polarizing notion of \u201cdefunding the police\u201d, but nonetheless, some of the ambitious promises of his campaign have still collided with the reality of Washington. For the most part, the administration\u2019s order is a symbolic statement of intent or a reinforcement of already existing policy, without the bite to meaningfully affect the majority of America\u2019s 18,000 local police forces over which the federal government has extremely limited oversight. It includes a new national database of police misconduct, mandatory for federal law enforcement but entirely voluntary for local, and a ban on chokeholds for federal law enforcement but little provision to encourage local police to follow suit. The total number of people killed by American police, about 1,110 a year, has remained near constant since media efforts to document them began in 2015. Meanwhile, the window for broader bipartisan criminal justice reform appears to have shrunk even further, as many Republicans distance themselves from the tentative gains made in the First Step Act, signed into law by Donald Trump. Instead, throughout the midterm election season, Republicans fell back on the \u201ctough on crime\u201d rhetoric that has supported America\u2019s mass incarceration crisis for decades. Progressive officials at the local level, including reformist district attorneys such as Larry Krasner in Philadelphia and Andrew Warren in Tampa, Florida, have seen themselves directly targeted as a result of this regression to the hard right. In Florida, the far-right governor, Ron DeSantis, suspended Warren for his refusal to enforce the state\u2019s hardline anti-abortion laws. In Philadelphia, Krasner faces a Republican-led impeachment process in the state legislature, accused of contributing to the city\u2019s increasing gun violence because of progressive reforms. (Krasner has labeled the process unconstitutional, and academic research has concluded there is no evidence to link reformist prosecutors with rising violent crime.) But it is also in these localities where some of the most significant victories for progressives have quietly occurred. In New Orleans, historically a center of mass incarceration, a newly formed civil rights division in the reformist DA\u2019s office has become among the most active in the country, intervening in over 240 individual cases in less than two years to address past harms in the local criminal legal system. Most of these, including 17 instances where convictions have been entirely vacated without re-prosecution, have led to immediate release from prison. Another landmark moment occurred this October, when Biden issued thousands of pardons to people convicted under federal law for simple marijuana possession, under pressure from progressives in Congress. For many, the narrow pardons did not go far enough, and applied to only a slim portion of the population convicted for low-level marijuana related offenses. But for those on the right, the move was lambasted as another \u201csoft on crime\u201d decision and, despite the president\u2019s urge for state governors to follow suit, in the states where possession remains fully or mostly illegal, there is little to suggest this will occur. Following four years under Donald Trump when the justice department refrained from intervening in problematic local policing practices, the Biden administration has continued to reverse this trend. Most notably this year in Louisiana, where the justice department commenced a civil rights investigation into the state police force, accused of routine rights violations against Black citizens in the wake of the brutal death of motorist Ronald Greene. Earlier this month, five officers involved in the killing were charged with offenses including homicide. The charges came over three and a half years after the incident took place, with authorities accused of a cover-up following the eventual publication of video depicting the beating, published by the Associated Press. The fatal encounter bears some similarity to the death of Kevin Desir, a Black man who died after being forcibly restrained by sheriff\u2019s deputies in a notorious jail in Florida, which occurred almost two years ago. The fatality, which had received scant national coverage, was re-examined in a Guardian investigation last month. While all officers involved in the violent restraint were cleared of criminal wrongdoing, a new private autopsy concluded the father of two had died due to manual strangulation and found the death was a homicide. Authorities still refuse to release the CCTV footage of the incident, leaving many open questions, as Desir\u2019s family continue to allege a cover-up. Answers often remain elusive. And for so many, justice is still distant."

            "date": "2022-12-16T14:22:00Z",
            "content": "The police had been waiting since dawn. Officers from the special unit of Belgium\u2019s federal police gathered on Rue Wiertz, close to the European parliament in Brussels. The parliament, which likes to style itself the house of European democracy, had been at the centre of a months-long, top-secret investigation. Investigators believed a Gulf country \u2013 unofficially confirmed as Qatar \u2013 was trying to sway decisions at the assembly, using vast sums of cash and lavish gifts. Now they were about to arrest the man they thought was at the centre of the criminal conspiracy. He was Francesco Giorgi, an assistant at the parliament. Charismatic and well-connected, the young Italian lived with his partner, Eva Kaili, a Greek MEP, who had enjoyed a meteoric rise to become one of the parliament\u2019s 14 vice-presidents since her election in 2014. As soon as Giorgi left the building, police surrounded him. His interrogation \u2013 and seizure of his phone \u2013 was deemed crucial to the investigation, according to Le Soir, which recounted the details of his morning arrest. By lunchtime last Friday, police had searched 16 properties in Brussels, arrested five others including Kaili, seized laptops, phones and hundreds of thousands of euros in cash. Two people were later released without charge. The revelations, broken first by Belgian media, followed by a terse official statement, exploded like a thunderclap over the European parliament, which likes to boast of its role as the EU\u2019s only directly-elected institution. It was like a crime novel, or a bad Netflix series, insiders said. MEPs and staff were stunned, angry, incredulous. As the police raids were unfolding, the parliament\u2019s president, Roberta Metsola, was informed. She was in her home country, Malta, preparing to give a speech to a school, when she was asked to waive the inviolability of European parliament premises \u2013 a step that would allow police to seal offices belonging to Kaili and other suspects. Within 36 hours Metsola was back in Brussels and announced she was stripping Kaili of her responsibilities. The following day, Sunday, police charged Kaili, Giorgi and two others with money laundering, corruption and participation in a criminal organisation. The suspects appeared before the investigative judge Michel Claise, renowned for cracking complex fraud cases and writing detective novels, such as Crime d\u2019initi\u00e9s (Crime of the Insiders). The European parliament \u201cis under attack\u201d, Metsola said. Transparency activists countered that the institution had weakened its defences with lax internal rules, such as allowing MEPs to have second jobs, secret expense accounts and permitting foreign governments to sponsor so-called \u201cfriendship groups\u201d and fund all-expenses-paid trips. Shockwaves continued to reverberate as police released images of neatly stacked wads of 20, 50 and 100 euro notes found stashed in luxury travel bags and backpacks across several locations, including \u20ac150,000 in Kaili\u2019s flat, \u20ac600,000 in the home of a former Italian MEP and \u20ac750,000 at her father\u2019s Brussels hotel room. A former TV news anchor from Greece\u2019s second city, Thessaloniki, Kaili was a glamorous figure inside the European parliament, who drew attention for her elegant dresses and smart handbags, as well as interest in tech regulation and cryptocurrencies. She and Giorgi were a golden couple. He was an amateur sailor, who filled his Instagram feed with images of him cruising through crystalline waters, beach sunsets and selfies on the ski slopes. Kaili\u2019s feed showed her speaking at a blockchain conference in the parliament, or looking soulful on a recent official visit to Oman, where she posed by a patterned wall wearing a headscarf loosely covering her long blonde hair. \u201cBuilding bridges with our most friendly neighbours,\u201d the caption read. Kaili was Metsola\u2019s representative to the Middle East. She was very interested in Qatar. Some colleagues nicknamed her the Qatar lobby spokesperson. One MEP recalls having coffee with Kaili, when she asked for their help to \u201cimprove the language\u201d on a resolution on Qatar and the World Cup. MEPs would later vote to condemn the deaths of thousands of migrant workers during World Cup preparations and urge Qatar to conduct investigations. Kaili was unhappy with the text. \u201cI just thought, OK, I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s interested in supporting Qatar,\u201d said the MEP. In the debate on the resolution, she stunned colleagues when she declared Qatar \u201ca frontrunner in labour rights\u201d, ignoring countless reports about the deaths of migrant workers. Hannah Neumann, a German Green MEP, who chairs the parliament\u2019s delegation for relations with the Arabian peninsula, recalls Kaili had \u201ca strong position that was often the same one that the ambassador of Qatar would have\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian, Neumann recalled a visit to Saudi Arabia in 2020 when Kaili raised an issue concerning a Qatari princess at every single meeting \u2013 including when MEPs talked to an organisation delivering humanitarian aid to hungry people in Yemen. \u201cWhen given the floor, [she would] not ask questions about Yemen, but again raise the issue of the Qatari princess. And I just thought she was a bit naive, or just didn\u2019t get the context of the meeting,\u201d Neumann said. Another MEP, Erik Marquardt, who was in charge of the parliament\u2019s position on a visa deal for Qatar (and three other states), told NPR that \u201cit was very obvious that [Kaili] was very much in favour of giving a visa waiver to Qatar very fast with not so many conditions\u201d but was \u201cnot so interested in the other countries\u201d. Kaili, who is in a Brussels jail waiting to see if she can be released on bail before a trial, has proclaimed her innocence through her lawyer. Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, a regular face on Greek morning TV this week, said his client will not be the scandal\u2019s Iphigenia, or sacrificial lamb. Giorgi has made no comment to the media. Nearly 2,000 miles away in Athens the cash-for-influence scandal has not only stunned Greeks but electrified a political scene already primed for general elections next year. Kaili\u2019s meteoric ascent had been the source of pride in a nation still recovering from prolonged economic crisis. \u201cIt is a tragic affair,\u201d said the former deputy prime minister Evangelos Venizelos, who as Pasok leader played no small role in the erstwhile news presenter\u2019s rise through the centre-left party. \u201cInconceivable politically, institutionally and morally.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-23T21:10:02Z",
            "content": "Adnan Syed, who spent 23 years in prison before he was freed from his conviction for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, has gotten a job advocating for prison reform at Georgetown University, according to the prestigious US school. Syed, whose case was the subject of the hit podcast Serial, began his role as a program associate with Georgetown\u2019s Prisons and Justice Initiative on 12 December, school officials announced in a news release Friday. The gig is Syed\u2019s first nine-to-five office job after the 41-year-old has spent more than half his life behind bars for a conviction by which authorities no longer stand. \u201cIt\u2019s a really normal and \u2026 amazing feeling,\u201d Syed said in a prepared statement attributed to him. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for it.\u201d The Prisons and Justice Initiative at Georgetown educates people who are incarcerated, gives job training to those who have been released and aims to address \u201croot causes and consequences of mass incarceration,\u201d university officials added in their news release. At his new job, Syed is working with a class titled \u201cMaking an Exoneree\u201d, which involves students re-investigating wrongful convictions, producing documentaries about their cases and ultimately striving to free innocent people. Lee was 18 when she was strangled to death and her body was found buried in Baltimore\u2019s Leakin Park in February 1999. Syed was later charged with her murder, and his first trial in December 1999 ended in a mistrial. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison at his second trial in February 2000. In September, Maryland state prosecutors filed a motion saying a lengthy investigation conducted alongside Syed\u2019s defense had unearthed new evidence undermining his conviction. That evidence, which officials had intentionally hidden from Syed\u2019s defense, mainly supported theories that someone else had killed Lee. A judge ordered that Syed be released from prison and that his conviction be overturned. Prosecutors later opted against recharging him with Lee\u2019s murder, meaning that he was free to move on with his life. Lee\u2019s family has since appealed to keep the conviction in place, arguing that they were deprived of a meaningful chance to participate in the hearing that set the stage for Syed\u2019s release. That appellate process was unresolved as of Friday. Before the fall\u2019s dramatic turn of events, the names of Syed and Lee became known across the US as well as worldwide with the release of Serial in 2014. Yet a lawyer and activist who worked to overturn Syed\u2019s conviction, Rabia Chaudry, critcized Serial for omitting information that questioned the thoroughness of the investigation into Lee\u2019s death. Chaudry produced a follow-up podcast, Undisclosed, and the book Adnan\u2019s Story: The Search for Truth and Justice After Serial, which also kept Syed\u2019s case on the international conscience, along with the 2019 HBO documentary series The Case Against Adnan Syed. The director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative, Marc Howard, hailed Syed\u2019s hiring Friday, saying it stemmed from his strong commitment to his education despite the shady circumstances that for so long landed him behind bars. Syed had been enrolled in Georgetown\u2019s liberal arts program from prison before his release from custody. \u201cHe is one of the most resilient and inspiring people I\u2019ve ever met, and he has so much to offer our team and \u2026 students,\u201d Howard said. In Friday\u2019s statement from Georgetown, Syed said getting a job at the university that gave him an education \u2013 and through that, hope \u2013 while he was imprisoned was \u201ca full circle moment\u201d. \u201cHopefully, I can have the same kind of impact on others,\u201d Syed said about his new employment opportunity."

            "date": "2022-12-09T16:22:39Z",
            "content": "The Scottish government has sought to reassure MSPs that plans to streamline how transgender people change the sex on their birth certificate will not compromise its work to advance women\u2019s rights. In a letter sent to all MSPs on Friday, and seen by the Guardian, the cabinet secretary for social justice, Shona Robison, insists the reforms do not \u201cin any way conflict with our work and commitment to protect women from discrimination and advance women\u2019s rights and equality\u201d. It comes as Holyrood members scramble to gather support for last ditch amendments before next Tuesday\u2019s deadline and amid warnings of significant rebellions\u201d among SNP and Scottish Labour ranks at the final-stage debate a week later. Robison says she is \u201cconscious that some of the details of the proposed reforms have become lost within the wider discussions around trans rights and the perceived conflict with the rights of women and girls\u201d. Scotland\u2019s gender recognition reform bill is intended to introduce a system of self-declaration for obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC), removing the need for a psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria, reducing the time someone must have been permanently living in their gender before they can apply from two years to three months, and dropping the age at which people can apply from 18 to 16. The letter follows correspondence leaked to the Times on Thursday from Kemi Badenoch, the UK government\u2019s equalities minister, to Robison and the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, setting out her concerns that the proposals would create a divergence in approach between England and Scotland on a \u201ccomplex and important issue\u201d, with warnings from UK government sources about \u201clegal chaos\u201d and \u201cgender tourism\u201d. All Holyrood parties except for the Scottish Conservatives are committed to some version of reform in their 2021 manifestos, but there has been growing disquiet among a number of SNP and Labour MSPs about the detail and impact of the bill. The SNP suffered its biggest ever backbench revolt at stage one of the bill but, with the Scottish Greens making gender recognition reform a key plank of its cooperation agreement with the nationalists, the balance of support remains in the bill\u2019s favour. While critics including Rachael Hamilton, the Scottish Conservative lead on gender recognition reform, have been conducting cross-party meetings, it remains unclear whether \u2013 with parliamentary arithmetic so tight - there will be sufficient agreement to carry rebel amendments. Work is continuing down to the wire on amendments to maintain the minimum application age at 18, prevent registered sex offenders from obtaining a certificate and to give public bodies more guidance on how to apply the bill. A number of Scottish Labour MSPs have expressed their own doubts about the bill, and earlier this week its former leader Johann Lamont co-signed a plea to the government to pause the legislation for further consideration. Robison also met the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem, on Thursday, after she sent a highly critical letter to the UK government in which she raised concerns that the reforms would \u201copen the door for violent males\u201d to abuse the process. Scottish government sources say the letter from Badenoch was a response to previous correspondence from Robison in which she raised cross-border issues."

            "content": "Nicola Sturgeon has described the concerns of a UN special rapporteur about plans to reform how people change their legal sex in Scotland as \u201cnot well founded\u201d. During a robust session of first minister\u2019s questions, Sturgeon also said Shona Robison, the minister in charge of the controversial gender recognition reform bill, would meet the special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem, next week. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, repeatedly challenged Sturgeon to delay the bill \u2013 which was the subject of the Scottish National party\u2019s biggest ever backbench revolt last month \u2013 after a highly critical letter from Alsalem to the UK government. In it she raised concerns that the reforms \u201cwould potentially open the door for violent males who identify as men to abuse the process of acquiring a gender certificate and the rights that are associated with it\u201d. \u201cThis presents potential risks to the safety of women in all their diversity,\u201d she wrote. Scotland\u2019s gender recognition reform bill is intended to introduce a system of self-declaration for obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC), removing the need for a psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria, reducing the time someone must have been permanently living in their gender before they can apply from two years to three months, and dropping the age at which people can apply from 18 to 16. Sturgeon said the bill had gone through lengthy public consultation and was undergoing intense parliamentary scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we remember all of us see protecting women and girls as a priority, but I hope all of us also see protecting the rights of trans people as important too,\u201d she said. Sturgeon also pointed to a letter in response signed by Amnesty International Scotland and Scottish women\u2019s groups including Scottish Women\u2019s Aid, Rape Crisis Scotland and Engender which argues that \u201cthere is a solid basis in international human rights standards to support the aims and principles of the bill\u201d. In her own written response to Alsalem, Robison addressed the point about single sex spaces, noting the Equality Act - which allows for their provision and certain exclusions \u2013 is reserved to Westminster. \u201cThe gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill cannot, in consequence, have the effect of changing the existing provision made by the Equality Act in relation to single-sex services,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAn amendment made to the bill at stage 2 has added further clarification on this point, for the avoidance of any doubt.\u201d As a mark of an increase in tensions over the bill before its next parliamentary debate later this month, Sturgeon was heckled earlier this week as she gave a speech at an event to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Zero Tolerance, an Edinburgh-based charity that campaigns to end violence against women. The audience member accused Sturgeon of \u201callowing paedophiles, sex offenders and rapists to self-ID in Scotland and put women at risk\u201d. \u201cWomen campaigning for women\u2019s rights are not against trans people. Shame on you for letting down vulnerable women in Scotland, not allowed to have their own spaces away from any male,\u201d she said. Zero Tolerance attracted heavy criticism after it asked those attending the event to \u201crefrain from discussions of the definition of a woman and single sex spaces in relation to the gender recognition act\u201d. The group had issued a statement on its website that stated: \u201cWe understand that as feminists we have strong opinions on these subjects. But this is not what this event is about\u201d. Following the intervention, Sturgeon insisted: \u201cI do not seek to close down anybody\u2019s freedom of speech. It is important that voices are heard.\u201d"

Archaeologists have always been able to tell us something about this when digging up Roman or bronze age settlements by using animal bones and burnt seeds as clues. It shows what farmers grew or hunters could catch. But further back in time this becomes more difficult. Teams working in the vicinity of Stonehenge, in Wiltshire, on a landscape with the marks of human occupation going back almost 10,000 years, have improved on this. Using DNA from undisturbed layers of sediment, they have been able to find out what plants and trees grew nearby. Animal bones and other evidence added to the picture of landscape, climate and vegetation along the ancient River Avon. Among the finds were the hoof prints of aurochsen, the giant prehistoric cattle, one of which could feed 200 people at a feast. The presence of willow at the earliest dates, which was followed thousands of years later by apple, rose, dogwood and ivy, suggests light woodland. Later plants, including thistles, bindweeds and nettles, provided evidence the area was gradually drying out, giving way to the current grassland. Compared with the sudden climate changes our children can expect, our ancestors had ample time to adapt."

            "date": "2022-12-17T08:00:14Z",
            "content": "Starting next July, Connecticut will become one of the first states in America to mandate climate change studies across its public schools as part of its science curriculum. The new law passed earlier this year comes as part of the state\u2019s attempts to address concerns over the short duration \u2013 and in some cases, absence \u2013 of climate change studies in classrooms. The requirement follows in the footsteps of New Jersey, which in 2020 became the first state to mandate climate change education across its K-12 learning standards. Currently, nearly 90% of public schools across Connecticut include climate change studies in their curriculums. However, by mandating it as part of state law from grades five to 12, climate education will effectively become protected from budget cuts and climate-denying political views at a time when education in the US has become a serious culture war battleground. \u201cThe conservative turn in our country \u2026 often starts at a very hyper-local level of local town boards of education. There is this push towards anti-intellectualism, anti-science \u2026 anti-reason, and I didn\u2019t want local boards of education to have the power to overturn the curriculum and say, \u2018climate change is too political,\u2019\u201d Connecticut state representative Christine Palm told the Guardian. Palm, who is vice chair of the Connecticut general assembly\u2019s environment committee, first launched her legislative efforts to pass a climate education mandate in 2018. Through various surveys and petitions, Palm found that to many students and educators, climate change education is either not being taught at all in schools or not being taught enough. \u201cAnecdotally, I knew that there was no uniform approach and that I felt there should be,\u201d Palm explained. She went on to introduce her climate education bill annually over the last four years until it was finally included in the state budget implementer bill earlier this year. \u201cIn the public schools, the program of instruction offered shall include at least the following subject matter, as taught by legally qualified teachers \u2026 science, which shall include the climate change curriculum,\u201d the current requirement reads, marking a change in language from \u201cwhich may\u201d to \u201cwhich shall\u201d. \u201cIt sounds like a simple change, but legislatively makes all the difference between a law and an option,\u201d said Palm. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), a set of K-12 science content standards, are currently adopted by Connecticut and include standards pertaining to climate change studies which more educators will rely on as the requirement kicks in next year. So far, only 20 states and DC have adopted the NGSS. \u201cThey are based on a framework for K-12 science education and the National Academies\u2019 reports, which are developed by scientists and educators defining \u2026 not just what is important to know, but what is the best way for kids to learn science,\u201d said Vanessa Wolbrink, an associate director at NextGenScience. \u201cI think a lot of the time, those who might oppose the teaching of climate science might believe that the standards are kind of subjective or would prevent true objective instruction but it\u2019s really the other way around,\u201d said Wolbrink. \u201cThese standards \u2026 really emphasize student data analysis and evidence-based argumentation. This emphasis means in order to meet the standards, students are demonstrating critical thinking skills, they\u2019re making these objective arguments with data and evidence,\u201d she explained. Depending on the grade levels, the standards vary. According to the NGSS website, middle school students who demonstrate understanding of the human impact on the environment can \u201capply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment\u201d, among other abilities. Meanwhile, one of the learning goals high school students are expected to meet in regards to climate studies includes the ability to \u201cuse a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those relationships are being modified due to human activity\u201d. To help educators update their curriculums, Connecticut\u2019s department of environmental protection (DEEP) is providing the state\u2019s department of education with various resources, including those that will complement NGSS. \u201cA primary focus for DEEP is to provide hands-on investigations and data connections that reflect local needs and action. This makes things much more tangible and useful for teachers, as they apply Next Generation Science Standards and common core,\u201d DEEP environmental educator Susan Quincy said, citing another set of academic standards focusing on math and English language arts. As the state prepares for next year\u2019s curriculum changes, experts remain cautious about the ways to relay information on the human-caused climate crisis to young students. A global survey conducted last year amongst 10,000 children and young people across ten countries, including the US, found that 59% of respondents were very or extremely worried about the climate crisis. Over 50% reported feeling emotions including sadness, anxiousness, anger, powerlessness and guilt. Seventy-five percent of respondents said that they think the future is frightening. With climate-related anxiety increasingly spreading among young people, many educators are adamant about not only teaching issues but also solutions. \u201cWorking with these young kids, some of the things I think are most important is making sure children get not only accurate information but also hopeful information. We need to make sure that kids learn about solutions and creativity and resilience as much as they learn about causes and effects,\u201d said Lauren Madden, a science educator and professor at the College of New Jersey. Madden also stresses the importance of equity-focused conversations when discussing the climate crisis in classrooms. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that climate change does not affect all people equally \u2026 There are kids in lower-income communities, communities of color and immigrant communities that experience flooding and power outages and things like that \u2026 in a much more magnified way than others,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that when we\u2019re talking to kids at that upper elementary, middle school, high school level, we\u2019re ensuring that we are coming from an equity-based perspective.\u201d With curriculums getting updated, educators such as Margaret Wang are also emphasizing contextual and interdisciplinary learning. As the chief operating officer of SubjectToClimate, an online platform that offers teachers various materials on the climate crisis, Wang helps other educators integrate climate change into their existing teaching materials. \u201cClimate change is a highly interdisciplinary subject of sciences, but there are also \u2026 elements of writing [such as] being able to analyze media literacy. There are elements of math [such as] being able to calculate and grasp its effects over time using statistics and science. And there\u2019s art as a way to mobilize collective action towards,\u201d she said. With less than a year left until climate change education is integrated across all of Connecticut\u2019s public schools, lawmakers such as Palm are well-aware of the pushback that such a mandate will receive. Palm said she tends to not get involved in matters involving local boards of education. However, she has in recent years noticed the impact of parents pushing back against educators over certain subjects such as LGBTQ+ rights, slavery and the climate crisis. \u201cIn my experience, at least traditionally, [local boards of education] have been extremely bipartisan, hardworking and thoughtful administrators \u2026 [but] increasingly, that\u2019s being affected by these vigilante groups of parents coming in and saying \u2026 they don\u2019t want kids learning about [these subjects] because it\u2019s too threatening to their delusional way of life,\u201d said Palm. \u201cWe absolutely have got to face it head on, and it starts when children are very young. We need to arm them with the tools to be part of a solution to a problem they had no hand in creating.\u201d"

            "title": "Australians are feeling the heat of climate change. For the fossil fuel industry it\u2019s still business as usual | Bill Hare",
            "date": "2022-12-28T01:05:56Z",
            "content": "It has been a tumultuous year for the climate in Australia: from record-breaking weather events to a climate surprise in the election, a new target and a global energy crisis, this year has seen its fair share of change. In February, the east-coast town of Lismore and the northern rivers region in New South Wales were hit by the worst flooding in Australia\u2019s modern history \u2013 the first of what would be a year of terrible floods, against the backdrop of a record third La Ni\u00f1a. Australia\u2019s climate impacts are worsening, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO. Many of those being hit by floods now were three years ago battling raging bushfires and drought. The Morrison government\u2019s response was weak, with its March budget delivering little in terms of action. The beginning of the year also saw the Great Barrier Reef suffer its sixth major bleaching event, and our coral reef scientists have recently flagged the prospects of a seventh. Australians are feeling the heat of climate change, and in May they voted accordingly, delivering a win to Anthony Albanese\u2019s Labor party, which saw voters switching away from the Coalition, but to the independents and the Greens, rather than Labor. The ABC\u2019s Vote Compass showed the biggest issue for voters, more than the economy or the pandemic, was climate change, surprising many. This has since been confirmed by other research. Before the election, the Coalition government had refused to increase its 2030 target, and had promised a \u201cnet zero\u201d target by 2050, but our analysis showed it didn\u2019t have a plan to get us there. It was also backing a raft of new fossil fuel projects, many of them gas. The veracity of our offsets system was being called out by the person who helped designed the system, labelling some elements a \u201cfraud\u201d. So how much has changed since May? In June the new government submitted a more ambitious 43% reduction by 2030 climate target to the UN, but it\u2019s still not 1.5C compatible. While the new target is a significant improvement, it\u2019s still more consistent with at least 2C of warming. Yet the environment minister, Chris Bowen, made a plea at COP27: \u201cIf we\u2019re not trying to keep to 1.5C then what are we here for?\u201d A great question, and one the government must ponder deeply. Because he can\u2019t very well argue for others to commit to 1.5C if we\u2019re not doing it ourselves. Australia needs to be ready to step up at the UN secretary general\u2019s climate ambition summit next September, with a 1.5C-aligned 2030 target, which should be well north of a 60% reduction below 2005 levels. The net zero promise remains, but there are still few new plans to get there. For the fossil fuel industry, it\u2019s still business as usual under the new government, which in August opened up 46,000 sq km to new oil and gas exploration. Approval after approval is going through for a maze of new gas projects, from the Scarborough and Browse projects off Western Australia to proposals to subsidise the Beetaloo basin in the Northern Territory. In 2022 the world experienced a global energy crisis caused by Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of Ukraine, and the gas industry has seen this as a massive opportunity for expansion. Governments scrambling to replace Russian gas have overreached. Within Australia, the gas industry has run rampant with excessive windfall profits while calling for massive expansion development and increased LNG exports. The government has tried to contain the damage being caused by increased eastern Australian electricity costs linked to insufficient availability of gas, leaving the domestic gas market exposed to the highly elevated prices of the international market. The latter half of this year has seen states starting to get out of coal power, setting phase-out goals around 2035-2037. While this is an advance, it\u2019s still relatively far from the power sector coal exit needed by 2030 across the OECD to be aligned with the Paris Agreement\u2019s 1.5C limit. The IEA\u2019s net zero coal report carried a similar and more stark message. There have been some other glimmers of hope in terms of stopping coal mining, with the recent court win against Clive Palmer\u2019s Waratah coalmine, part of the Galilee basin. The court found that the 1.58 gigatonnes of carbon emissions that will come from its development globally pose unacceptable risks. The federal government is starting to move on reforming the primary tool it wants to use to curb industry emissions (including oil, coal and gas), the so-called safeguard mechanism, but it seems poised to continue allowing companies to offset their emissions at scale. If this happens, there\u2019s a serious risk the whole scheme will be viewed simply as a licensing system for increased fossil fuel production rather than one that actually results in real emission reductions. Some have labelled this as \u201cstate-sanctioned greenwashing.\u201d Australia has a terrible, 30-year history of claiming to meet its targets through dodgy accounting and, more recently, through offsets, but this cannot continue. The risk now is that if the government sticks to its apparent commitment to continue to use offsets, the country will find itself at the next federal election with industry sector emissions barely reduced at all, or worse, facing increased emissions from new fossil fuel projects. In late November Unesco\u2019s world heritage committee published the results of its mission to the Great Barrier Reef, recommending, yet again, that the reef be listed as endangered due to climate change. It received a surprisingly defensive reaction from the Albanese government, arguing against such a listing, rather than using this warning to double down on the need to actually reduce emissions fast enough to get on to a 1.5C pathway. Perhaps the last big climate moment this year was the government\u2019s first annual climate statement, but as many pointed out, fossil fuels didn\u2019t rate a single mention. The government also released its greenhouse gas projections, showing most of the effort will come from the rollout of renewables in the power sector and very little else, and it signed an agreement with states on fast-tracking storage for renewables. This is a positive development and absolutely critical to decarbonising Australia and is backed by serious resources. However it is not enough. Right in the last week before the Australian silly season fully kicked off the Albanese government took legislative action to curtail the power of the gas and coal industry putting in place price caps and a reasonable price test, which led to outcries of \u201cArmageddon\u201d and Soviet-style command and control from the gas industry, and declarations of the \u201cend of gas\u201d from the Greens in the federal parliament. The outcry from the gas industry and its analysts and regular press stenographic services was hyperbolic in the extreme \u2013 and seen as such by most. As for the end of gas, there is some way to go but several things done by the government support this. The move not to allow gas into the capacity market system and instead focus on batteries and other storage, the announcement of massive battery plans, and the Greens\u2019 mediated deal to support households to get out of gas all support a faster exit from the power sector and domestic use. Looking ahead to 2023, if Australia is going to be successful in getting its economy established on a 1.5C aligned pathway, it will need to focus on policy that ensures real emission reduction. And that means really taking its foot off the gas. Reductions in the industry, mining and mineral process are urgently needed, together with a national plan to replace fossil gas in these sectors with electrification, efficiency and green hydrogen. And we will also need to reduce emissions from the LNG industry and coal which are set to grow significantly by 2030, and if not curtailed could swamp gains made elsewhere. \u2022 Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the chief executive of Climate Analytics"

            "date": "2022-12-25T16:00:05Z",
            "content": "As the Arctic warms, concern for the plight of Santa\u2019s favourite sleigh pullers is mounting. But in one small corner of the far flung north \u2013 Svalbard \u2013 Rudolph and his friends are thriving. Warmer temperatures are boosting plant growth and giving Svalbard reindeer more time to build up fat reserves; they also appear to be shifting their diets towards \u201cpopsicle-like\u201d grasses that poke up through the ice and snow, data suggests. Smaller and plumper than their Lapplandish cousins, yet boasting impressive antlers nonetheless, Svalbard reindeer inhabit almost all non-glaciated areas of the Svalbard archipelago, which sits just 500 miles (800km) from the North Pole. Like other Arctic regions, Svalbard has experienced thicker snowfall, and more frequent rain-on-snow events \u2013 where rain falls on an existing snowpack and freezes \u2013 in recent years, making it harder for reindeer to dig for food. Reports of mass reindeer starvations in Russia, and declining caribou populations in Canada and Alaska, have also prompted concern for Svalbard\u2019s reindeer. Yet, in the most productive parts of the archipelago, reindeer populations have flourished in recent decades. To investigate what might be driving the population increase, Tamara Hiltunen, a doctoral student at the University of Oulu in Finland, and her colleagues turned to annual blood samples collected in late winter as part of a long-term monitoring study. By comparing the proportion of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in these samples, they could infer what kinds of plants the reindeer had been eating in preceding weeks. The research, published in Global Change Biology, suggested that between 1995 and 2012 \u2013 a period marked by the normalisation of rain-on-snow events, increased summer temperatures and a growing reindeer population \u2013 there was a dietary shift away from low-growing mosses and towards grass-like \u201cgraminoid\u201d plants. \u201cThe erect nature of the graminoid stems allows that forage to be available to the animals, even though you might have a centimetre or so of ice,\u201d said Prof Jeffrey Welker at the University of Oulu, who supervised the research. \u201cYou have the equivalent of popsicle sticks, which are nutritious enough that those animals can sustain themselves, even during these stressful periods of winter.\u201d Higher soil temperatures and greater amounts of reindeer droppings and urine falling on the ground are also boosting the growth of graminoids, which may further benefit the Svalbard reindeer. \u201cThis is definitely encouraging news,\u201d said Prof Jaakko Putkonen at the University of North Dakota, whose research previously predicted an increase in Arctic regions affected by rain as the century wears on. \u201cHowever, nature is an endless web of interdependent variables. Some of the upcoming changes may be good to the reindeer and some may be detrimental. \u201cFor example, from Scandinavia there are reports of rain on snow promoting the growth of fungi (eg toxic moulds) under the snowpack due to warmer conditions which has led the reindeer to avoid those areas. They may be trading one challenge for another one.\u201d Welker also cautioned that events in Svalbard may not apply to other regions of the Arctic. \u201cJust as we see signs that a reindeer population on Svalbard might have some ways of adapting and adjusting to these changes, that could allow them to sustain themselves, we\u2019ve got other groups in Alaska, for instance, that are declining. \u201cIt really speaks to the complexity of the Arctic. Events that are happening in one place are not identical to those that are happening in others.\u201d However, for Svalbard\u2019s reindeer, the future looks bright \u2013 and the archipelago a promising recruitment ground should Santa need further helpers. Given their diminutive size, though, he may need to invest in a smaller sleigh. \u201cI\u2019m sure they could do it, they just might be a little bit obese,\u201d said Hiltunen. \u201cBut maybe if they lived with Santa, they wouldn\u2019t need so much fat to keep themselves alive.\u201d"

Despite the US and Australia vowing on Wednesday to \u201cdrive stronger global action to address the climate crisis\u201d, the security leaders insist the issue is still being treated as an afterthought rather than a top-order threat. The ADF faces ever-growing demands to respond to disasters at home and in the region, the group warns in a submission to the defence strategic review being conducted by former ADF chief Angus Houston and former defence minister Stephen Smith. \u201cGlobal inaction has resulted in climate change becoming an immediate existential threat to humanity and, together with nuclear war, is the greatest threat to the security of Australia and its people,\u201d the submission says. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cAddressing that threat requires an emergency response, akin to wartime mobilisation.\u201d The submission says the crisis \u201ccould only be resolved by a collective determination to step up climate action to an emergency level \u2026 in which climate mitigation becomes the first priority of climate and politics in Australia and around the world\u201d. \u201cSuch a mobilisation will mean economic disruption and large-scale social and political change, but this can no longer be avoided; the alternative, of escalating climate impacts and self-sustaining warming, will be far worse,\u201d it says. \u201cIn these circumstances, the defence sector has the experience and capacity to be a significant contributor to enacting such a mobilisation. Defence should ensure it is well prepared for such a task.\u201d Ian Dunlop, an executive member of the group and former chair of the Australian Coal Association, said the mobilisation would start with being \u201ccrystal clear\u201d on the risks. \u201cYou would then have to say: look, we are now faced with something we\u2019ve never been faced with before; we are going to have to pull together a comprehensive national approach to this with the best possible expertise we can find,\u201d Dunlop said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to recognise there is one thing that matters and that is getting emissions down quickly here and globally.\u201d Dunlop said responding to natural disasters was addressing the symptoms, not the cause, and much faster emissions cuts were needed. The group\u2019s submission takes aim at the \u201ccontinued political willingness to expand Australia\u2019s fossil fuel industry despite the fact that this will make similar future events even worse\u201d. \u201cAustralia needs an effective defence capacity to protect its own territory and to respond to regional disruption, but hard choices will have to be made in order to shape the economic environment to prioritise effective climate mitigation and resilience.\u201d Australia should press for cooperation on the climate crisis with \u201cthe other G20 nations who are responsible for 80% of global emissions, and particularly leading powers such as China and the USA\u201d, the group says. The Albanese government has ordered the Office of National Intelligence to complete a climate threat assessment \u2013 but the group is concerned this is limited to global risks, not domestic ones. Australia and the US agreed at the Ausmin meeting on Wednesday to \u201cstrengthen efforts throughout this critical decade to keep a limit of 1.5 degrees temperature rise within reach\u201d. The allies plan to share assessments and advice on the national and regional security risks posed by climate change. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said the change of government in Australia had resulted in \u201can enhanced emphasis\u201d on climate within the alliance."

            "content": "The New South Wales government has moved to head off the looming threat of teal candidates running in the Liberal party heartland at the next state election by committing to an ambitious new emissions reduction target of 70% by 2035. But the government won\u2019t move to legislate the cap, with the state\u2019s treasurer, Matt Kean, saying NSW would beat its current target of halving emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 through its existing policies. The Liberals have managed to win support for the target from its Coalition partner, the National party, largely through the promise that much-touted renewable energy zones will provide a significant investment in rural parts of the state. On Friday Kean said the new target would attract more than $39bn in private investment and support 13,000 new jobs. Earlier this year Origin Energy announced it would close the Eraring coal-fired power station seven years early, while AGL\u2019s plant in the state\u2019s upper Hunter, Bayswater, is due to close in 2033. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Kean insisted the increased target was not a result of these closures. Instead, he pointed to the establishment of renewable energy zones across the state, as well as investments in hydro energy and electric vehicles. The new target comes just days after the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the commonwealth would spend $5bn connecting NSW renewable energy zones to the country\u2019s energy grid. The first of these zones is due to be established in the central-west by 2030, with three others to follow. \u201cThis is the NSW government\u2019s plan to do our bit to safeguard our planet. But importantly, it\u2019s also our plan to safeguard our economy and ensure we create more wealth for the people of this state for generations,\u201d Kean said on Friday. The treasurer announced the updated target in Manly alongside the environment minister and local MP, James Griffin \u2013 who is facing a challenge from a teal candidate, Joeline Hackman \u2013 as well as the North Shore MP, Felicity Wilson, and other moderate Liberal party candidates running in Ryde, Coogee and Vaucluse. The announcement came on the back of a preselection deal \u2013 which Kean helped orchestrate \u2013 that will see three sitting male upper house MPs ditched in favour of female candidates. Matthew Mason-Cox, Shayne Mallard and Lou Amato will be dumped in favour of state executive member Susan Carter and former school teacher Jean Hayes. Despite not being up for reelection, the families minister, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, will be installed at the top of the ticket. The cross-factional deal is designed to head off questions about the party\u2019s commitment to increase female representation, with a string of preselections going to male candidates despite public calls from Kean and others for the party faithful to install women. But Kean denied the moves were about heading off the teal threat. \u201cThis is not about teals,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about anyone other than the NSW government showing that we have a clear plan to build a stronger, more prosperous economy and ensure that we hand our planet to our kids better than we found it. \u201cWe\u2019ll put our plan up against any other party, any other candidates, any day of the week.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-22T18:25:05Z",
            "content": "The UK government was slower than several of its European counterparts to realise it. But making public transport cheaper is a good policy that can be expected to deliver multiple benefits. The announcement earlier this week that bus companies in England will be subsidised to cap local fares at \u00a32 for three months, from January to March, is very welcome. It should make life a bit easier for the millions of people who rely on buses to travel to work and for other journeys. Many of them are facing a painful squeeze on their finances due to rising fuel and food prices. If the subsidy persuades people to travel by bus instead of by car, as ministers hope and expect, it will also have a beneficial effect on the environment. Car journeys are a hugely significant source of carbon emissions and localised air pollution, with 91% of the UK\u2019s total transport emissions coming from roads. When more people use buses and bicycles, rather than cars, congestion and journey times are reduced. With single bus fares as high as \u00a35 in some rural areas, people have been strongly incentivised to use cars, particularly when travelling in groups. Change in this destructive state of affairs is long overdue. If energy costs have forced ministers to act, it is better late than never. Reduced demand for petrol could also contribute to lowering inflation. For more than 30 years, since the bus service was privatised, London was the only place in England with regulated fares \u2013 a grossly unfair situation since people living elsewhere have the same need to move around at an affordable price. Imposing similar arrangements elsewhere should have been a no-brainer for a government committed to levelling up. But it was the Labour mayors of Greater Manchester, Liverpool and West Yorkshire who acted first. All three areas already have the \u00a32 cap now being introduced nationally. In July, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, won a judicial review, meaning that his plan for an integrated local transport system similar to that run by Transport for London is expected to go ahead. In Europe, discounted travel schemes were available this year on state-owned rail as well as bus services. Unfortunately, in Britain rail fares went up for inadequate services. Germany\u2019s three-month experiment with \u20ac9 tickets was credited with saving about 1.8m tonnes of CO2 emissions. Tallinn, the Estonian capital, has the most radical scheme of all. There, all public transport has been free to residents since 2013. Past policy failures have left Britons more exposed than they needed to be to the current energy crisis. Had ministers more actively promoted a shift away from fossil-fuel-intensive transport and heating towards more sustainable energy sources and insulation, households would now be less vulnerable and more secure. But the \u00a360m being spent on making buses cheaper will be money well spent."

            "date": "2022-12-07T11:00:22Z",
            "content": "In some ways, this year\u2019s UN climate summit held in Egypt was all about food. In the context of crop failures and food insecurity, due to extreme weather and dwindling diversity, as well as rising food prices exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the tight grip of corporate monopolies \u2013 Cop27 included the first ever day dedicated to food and climate. Scientists are clear that the interconnected climate, environmental and food crises require bold transformative action to drastically reduce greenhouse gases and improve resilience. Food systems produce a third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Cattle ranching is the main driver of Amazon rainforest loss, while industrialized food production is the biggest threat to 86% of the world\u2019s species at risk of extinction. But at Cop27, as in the debate more broadly, corporate interests dominated. Campaigners and NGOs say the food industry\u2019s fingerprints were all over the solutions being touted, including an array of technologies and incentives that they say will do little to cut big food\u2019s huge climate footprint, reduce diet-related diseases or increase food security and climate resilience in the long term. \u201cFrom treating cow burps to robotic weeders, none of the false solutions on offer at Cop27 come close to stopping the industrial food production from being an engine of planetary destruction,\u201d said Raj Patel, food justice scholar and author of Stuffed and Starved. \u201cAgribusiness and governments offered a series of patented patches designed not to transform the food system, but to keep it the same.\u201d There\u2019s a lot still to unpick from Cop27, but here are some of the food \u201csolutions\u201d that experts told the Guardian they are most alarmed about: 1 The rise of \u2018climate-smart agriculture\u2019 The phrase \u201cclimate smart\u201d \u2013 the mother of all buzzwords \u2013 has made its way into climate plans and policymaking, adopted by corporations, governments and multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank and FAO. Billions of dollars are going into research on so-called climate-smart tech solutions such as robotics, AI, net zero dairy, cultivated meat and precision farming, including drones, GPS and drip-irrigation technologies. While proponents say these will increase productivity, help farmers adapt to the climate crisis, and cut emissions, critics say that the phrase \u201cclimate smart\u201d has become an all-encompassing cover for rebranding harmful farm practices. A key proponent of climate-smart agriculture is the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate initiative (Aim4C), a joint initiative spearheaded by the US and the UAE, which has promised $4bn in agricultural innovation to reduce emissions. It is supported by 40 countries and some of the world\u2019s largest food companies including PepsiCo, the meat giant JBS and CropLife, an association of agrochemical companies. More than two-thirds of its partners are in the US or Europe, according to a DeSmog analysis, with not a single group representing Indigenous communities listed among its knowledge partners. Aim4C has no clear plans to significantly slow or reduce activities such as industrial meat production and fertilizer use, which climate scientists say are fundamental to curbing global heating. \u201cAIM\u2019s agritech solutions are not a strategy for 21st-century ecological change that benefits all of humanity and the web of life. Rather, this is more business as usual\u201d said a spokesperson for the International Coalition on Climate and Agriculture, an alliance of activists and civil leaders. 2 Tech fixes for food\u2019s giant methane problem Methane is a short-lived but powerful heat-trapping gas that accounts for about a third of the rise in global temperature since the pre-industrial era. Livestock \u2013 through cattle burps, manure and the cultivation of feed crops \u2013 is responsible for nearly a third of global anthropogenic methane emissions, which is why scientists are clear that reducing meat and dairy consumption in the global north is essential to curbing global heating to 1.5C. But the focus at Cop27 was not on changing human diets but rather cows\u2019 diets \u2013 to make their burps less gassy. There was much excitement from JBS, Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s largest food and drinks company, and the meat and dairy trade groups about the boom in methane-reducing feed additives made from ingredients such as seaweed, ozone, enzyme inhibitors, green tea and garlic. But the long-term risks and benefits of these emerging products remain unclear, and those currently on the market are only affordable to industrial cattle farmers and food companies that are invested in growing meat and dairy consumption, not reducing it. \u201cAt best, these technologies provide a cover for the large meat and dairy corporations to continue overproducing on polluting factory farms,\u201d said Amanda Starbuck, research director at Food and Water Watch. 3 Increasing access to fossil fuel-based fertilizers as the answer to food insecurity The global food system is a heavy user of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, produced in an energy-intensive process reliant on fossil fuels. They are credited with helping to increase yields and reduce hunger, but their expansion has come at a huge cost to the environment, climate and human and animal health. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers are responsible for 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2022 study, which found that reducing their use \u201coffers large mitigation potential\u201d in addition to other health, environmental and economic benefits. Yet curtailing synthetic fertilizers was not on the agenda at Cop27, rather the focus of industry reps and European and US officials was on fertilizer access and \u201cefficiency\u201d \u2013 helping farmers use increasingly costly nitrogen inputs in smarter ways. The US, EU, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands announced $109m of public funds (plus $26m in private investment) to expand fertilizer access and efficiency to combat food insecurity. But according to the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri: \u201cChemical fertilizers do not ensure food security. Their pervasive use sometimes increases crop production in the short term, but it creates a longer-term dependency on corporations and trade \u2026 the ultimate goal must be to wean them off this dependency as soon as possible.\u201d Branding fertilizer efficiency as climate action is further evidence of the industry controlling the narrative, said Lili Fuhr, deputy director for climate and energy at the Centre for Environmental Integrity. \u201cSynthetic fertilizers are just fossil fuels in another form. Fertilizer companies know they will soon be under scrutiny and are trying to divert attention from production to more efficient use by the farmers.\u201d The fertilizer industry, which will benefit directly from the new taxpayer funded subsidies, is already booming: nine of the largest companies are expected to make $57bn profits in 2022 \u2013 up more than fourfold from 2020. 4 Industrial agriculture as the only way to feed a growing population The industrial food sector pitches itself as the only way to feed a growing population. Yet small farmers (with less than two hectares) produce over a third of the world\u2019s food \u2013 despite having access to only 12% of agricultural land. Much of the world\u2019s population is either undernourished or overweight, suggesting that we are not producing or eating well. Still, the momentum and the money seem to be skewed in favor of industrial agriculture, allowing it to continue to grow and emit. Almost 90% of the $540bn in global food subsidies, which play a big role in deciding what food is produced and what we eat, have been deemed \u201charmful\u201d to the planet \u2013 by damaging health, the climate and nature as well as excluding smallholder farmers. \u201cSubsidies are a major change agent. They make it hard for farmers to make changes, and stop consumer-driven market changes from naturally taking place. This is not a level playing field,\u201d said Stephanie Haszczyn from the Farm Animal Investment Risk &amp; Return (Fairr) initiative. Lower-impact forms of farming often receive little to no subsidy assistance. Proponents like La Via Campesina argue that agroecology \u2013 a form of farming steeped in Indigenous and ancestral knowledge that works with nature and local conditions to produce food sustainably, protecting biodiversity and soil quality \u2013 offers a viable greener, healthier and fairer alternative to big ag. But neither subsidies nor agroecology were on the agenda at Cop27. \u201cIt was very disturbing to see a large contingent of corporate lobbyists influencing the process while small-scale farmers have been shut out and drowned out,\u201d said Million Belay, an Ipes-Food expert and general coordinator of the Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa, a large grassroots movement. \u201cFarmers demanded recognition for diverse, resilient farming, agroecology and climate finance, but they left with very little.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-22T11:03:15Z",
            "content": "Returning to coal-fired power generation in some parts of Europe has not prevented strong progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, data shows. Emissions for November for the EU were at their lowest in at least 30 years, as were gas consumption, carbon from the power sector, and power generation from fossil fuels, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. This month\u2019s freeze may result in more coal and gas being burned in December, after an unusually mild November. Germany missed its targets on cutting consumption of gas under the cold conditions, the German grid agency said. But only a small proportion of last month\u2019s drop in fossil fuel use should be attributed to the weather, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analysis. The mild temperatures contributed a 6% reduction in gas demand outside the power sector \u2013 mostly for heating \u2013 while actual demand fell 26%. Within the power sector, milder temperatures can account for two percentage points of the 12% drop in demand, the analysts found. Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst and author of the report, said the data showed that accusations against the EU of falling back on climate commitments were wrong. \u201cThere has been a very widespread perception that Europe is going backwards on climate change, because of the Ukraine war,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were frequent remarks to that effect at Cop27, saying Europe was going back to coal. We are showing that has not been the case \u2013 there was a misreading of coal consumption.\u201d Some member states, including Germany and Poland, have sought a limited return to burning coal for power generation in the face of soaring gas prices and supply constraints in after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The UK has also put coal-fired power plants on standby. In November, the EU as a whole used less coal than in the same month last year, and than in the same month for the past three decades. Germany and Poland both used less coal than a year ago, though Finland slightly increased its coal use. There were dramatic reductions in output from nuclear reactors in Germany and France. In Germany that was made up for by an increase in wind and solar generation, while France reduced its power demand substantially. However, this month\u2019s cold spell, with temperatures about 5C lower than usual for the time of year, and snow and icy conditions across much of northern Europe, could stall progress on cutting fossil fuel use this winter. Myllyvirta said: \u201cEverything is conditional on the weather. If we have a big cold spell, we will see more gas burning.\u201d He said early signs for December were that the trend for lower emissions was holding up. The first half of December had colder weather than the year before, he added, but total emissions remained well below 2021 levels, showing that the reduction in gas and electricity use was not mainly because of the weather. However, power sector emissions started increasing again in December. Myllyvirta said the sector continued to be plagued by the poor performance of nuclear, and wind conditions were also poor, but reduced gas use outside the power sector kept emissions falling overall. He added that the transformation of Europe\u2019s energy this year showed that the underlying trend was strongly away from fossil fuels. \u201cIf anyone had said a year ago that Europe could nearly eliminate reliance on Russian fossil fuels in 10 months, they would have been taken for a complete lunatic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have come quite close to doing so, and that is quite remarkable.\u201d He added that governments should seek to protect their most vulnerable citizens from the dangerous effects of the energy price rises that have forced such a sudden change. Europe could go further in weaning itself off Russian energy, and fossil fuels in general, but that should be managed equitably, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that so much of this reduction [in fossil fuel use] has happened through high prices, which is having major social and economic impacts,\u201d Myllyvirta said."

The sector had a goal to reduce emissions directly controlled by institutions by 43% between 2005-06 and 2020-21. However, 59% did not meet this target, according to the estates management record at the Higher Education Statistics Agency. This data has been used by the People and Planet University League to rank universities\u2019 efforts to reduce carbon. This year, Cardiff Metropolitan University topped the league table for the first time with a 65% decrease in emissions over the 15-year timeframe. Oxbridge may top other league tables but it is slipping down the carbon rankings. The University of Oxford has fallen 16 places to 40th, while Cambridge fell two places to 86th. Russell Group universities have shown improvement with two \u2013 the University of Exeter and University College London \u2013 in the top 10 and, in general, the group has scored higher than last year. Jack Ruane, the university league manager at People and Planet, said: \u201cIt is disappointing to see that 59% of UK universities have failed to achieve the carbon reduction target. This highlights the importance of holding the sector accountable via short-term assessments of actual reductions in carbon emissions, rather than celebrating net zero target-setting, which are often vague on how offsetting will be achieved.\u201d Divestment from fossil fuels remains a tricky proposition for higher education institutions and only 33% of universities (50 of 153) have a commitment to fully screen out all fossil fuel investments written into a valid policy. A further 10 universities have partial commitments. Only 7% (11) have made a commitment in policy to directly reinvest in community renewable energy and/or renewable energy projects on campus. Only 3% of the sector (four) have committed to cutting recruitment ties to the fossil fuel and mining industries. Laura Clayson, the climate justice campaigns manager at People and Planet, said: \u201cDespite 100 UK universities having now publicly announced the exclusion of fossil fuel companies from their investment portfolios, just 60 have enshrined this commitment in a valid policy document. Concerningly, this is a significant drop from 76 last year. \u201cSevering investment ties with the fossil fuel industry is an important first step for universities to act upon their responsibility to communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis and fossil fuel extraction impacts. We hope to see a sharp increase in policy exclusions in next year\u2019s league in line with this.\u201d"

            "title": "Russian Medibank hackers could be first targets of Australian sanctions against cyber-attackers",
            "date": "2022-12-14T14:00:57Z",
            "content": "The Australian government has revealed it is considering using new sanctions powers against cyber-attackers for the first time, sparking calls for the Medibank hackers to be the initial targets. The Magnitsky-style sanctions laws that were introduced in Australia a year ago include a world-leading measure to allow travel bans and asset freezes on those deemed responsible for \u201csignificant\u201d cyber-attacks. In an unusually frank disclosure, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed it had now provided advice to the minister, Penny Wong, about using these cyber-related powers. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cYes,\u201d it said in a newly tabled response to a Senate question on notice. \u201cThe department routinely provides advice to ministers on possible sanctions measures, including cyber sanctions.\u201d A Dfat spokesperson told Guardian Australia the legislation allowed for sanctions to be imposed in relation to significant cyber incidents, and the government \u201ckeeps its sanctions settings under consideration\u201d. But the government would not speculate about specific listings in advance, the spokesperson added. The shadow minister for cybersecurity, James Paterson, said he was \u201cencouraged and hopeful that the government will go down this path\u201d. \u201cOf course, the opposition would provide very strong bipartisan support for any cyber sanctions they want to announce,\u201d said Paterson, who extracted the confirmation through the Senate estimates process. Paterson said the most likely starting point for such sanctions would be cyber incidents that have already been publicly attributed by the Australian government, including the Russian criminals responsible for the Medibank hack. \u201cIn the words of the government, these criminals have done things that other cybercriminals are unwilling to do, which is target people\u2019s personal health information and release it on the dark web to punish people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat crosses a number of lines. This is not run of the mill \u2013 this is especially egregious \u2013 and it has to be backed up with action against them.\u201d To date, the government has not named the individuals it believes responsible for the \u201ctotally reprehensible\u201d publication of sensitive health information taken from Medibank, understood to include procedures claimed by policyholders related to the termination of pregnancy and miscarriages. But the Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, has said he is in possession of intelligence that hackers in Russia were responsible for the Medibank data breach. \u201cTo the criminals \u2013 we know who you are,\u201d he said in November. Paterson conceded the hackers were unlikely to come to Australia on holiday so would not be directly affected by travel bans, but this should not stop the Australian government from \u201cusing every tool we have available\u201d to deter malicious cyber activity. \u201cWe should be making the world a smaller and less welcoming place for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t put a price on it we\u2019re going to have more of this behaviour.\u201d Other cyber incidents to have been attributed by the Australian government include the targeting of Queensland government-owned electricity generator CS Energy by the Russian-aligned Conti ransomware group in November 2021. Last year the Morrison government joined with allies to accuse China\u2019s ministry of state security of malicious cyber activity by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Exchange software. Since the Albanese government came to office, its Australian Cyber Security Centre has linked the Iranian government\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to the \u201cactive\u201d targeting of Australia, UK, US and Canadian organisations. Last weekend Wong announced she was using another part of the Magnitsky sanctions laws to target Iran\u2019s morality police and Iranian and Russian individuals linked to human rights abuses. On Monday Dfat summoned Iran\u2019s top diplomat in Canberra to register deep concern over the execution of an anti-government protester. It is the sixth time Dfat has taken this step since the crackdown on protests began in September. A spokesperson said the Australian government would \u201ccontinue to make representations to Iran over its egregious human rights abuses and use of the death penalty\u201d."

            "date": "2022-12-14T03:05:11Z",
            "content": "Telecommunications giant TPG has revealed an email-hosting service used by up to 15,000 iiNet and Westnet business customers has been breached, with the hacker looking for cryptocurrency and other financial information. TPG said in a release to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on Wednesday that cybersecurity firm Mandiant had found evidence of unauthorised access to a Hosted Exchange service used by iiNet and Westnet business customers. A Hosted Exchange service is a Microsoft product that is operated by iiNet and Westnet to provide email services to customers \u2013 typically as part of a bundle of business or home broadband services. TPG said initial analysis of the activity on the service showed the aim of the threat actor was to search for customers\u2019 cryptocurrency and financial information. The company has not said what might have been obtained in the attack, but an investigation is under way and affected customers will be advised. TPG told the ASX the breach did not affect mobile or broadband services, and access has been cut off for the attacker. \u201cWe have implemented measures to stop the unauthorised access, further security measures have been put in place, and we are in the process of contacting all affected customers on the Hosted Exchange service,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have notified the relevant government authorities.\u201d On Monday, TPG\u2019s biggest rival Telstra reported that a \u201cmisalignment of databases\u201d had resulted in the details of up to 130,000 unlisted customers being made available via directory assistance or the White Pages. Health insurer Medibank also revealed on Wednesday that law firm Maurice Blackburn had lodged a complaint with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) in relation to its cyber-attack that resulted in the personal information of 10m current and former customers being published on the dark web. It is separate to the investigation launched by the OAIC at the start of December. Medibank said it had not been contacted about the complaint by the OAIC, but the complaint alleges Medibank has breached the Australian Privacy Principles and seeks compensation for individuals whose personal information was exposed as a consequence of the cybercrime. \u201cMedibank continues to support its customers from the impact of this crime through our previously announced Cyber Response Support Program which includes mental health and wellbeing support, identity protection and financial hardship measures,\u201d a Medibank spokesperson said."

            "date": "2022-12-28T14:41:49Z",
            "content": "TikTok has been banned from any devices issued by the US House of Representatives, as political pressure continues to build on the Chinese-owned social video app. The order to delete the app was issued by Catherine Szpindor, the chief administrative officer (CAO) of the House, whose office had warned in August that the app represented a \u201chigh risk to users\u201d. According to a memo obtained by NBC News, all lawmakers and staffers with House-issued mobile phones have been ordered to remove TikTok by Szpindor. \u201cHouse staff are NOT allowed to download the TikTok app on any House mobile devices,\u201d NBC quoted the memo as saying. \u201cIf you have the TikTok app on your House mobile device, you will be contacted to remove it.\u201d The move was also reported by Reuters. In a statement the US house of representatives confirmed the ban, saying \u201cwe can confirm that the Committee on House Administration has authorized the CAO Office of Cybersecurity to initiate the removal of TikTok Social Media Service from all House-managed devices.\u201d In August the CAO issued a \u201ccyber advisory\u201d labelling TikTok a high-risk app due to its \u201clack of transparency in how it protects customer data\u201d. It said TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, \u201cactively harvests content for identifiable data\u201d and stores some user data in China. TikTok says its data is not held in China, but in the US and Singapore. The CAO move comes amid multiple attempts to restrict the use of TikTok by government and state employees. Last week Congress passed a $1.7tn spending bill, which includes a provision banning TikTok from government devices. The ban will take effect once President Joe Biden signs the legislation into law. According to Reuters, at least 19 US states have partially blocked the app from state-managed devices over security concerns. In a statement released after the Congress ban, TikTok said the move was a \u201cpolitical gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests\u201d. This month the US senator Marco Rubio, a former Republican presidential contender, unveiled a legislative proposal to ban TikTok from the US entirely. Rubio said it was time to \u201cban Beijing-controlled TikTok for good\u201d. Biden has revoked presidential orders targeting TikTok issued by his predecessor, Donald Trump, which included requiring TikTok to sell its US business. However, the US Committee on Foreign Investment, which scrutinises business deals with non-US companies, is also conducting a security review of TikTok. According to a recent Reuters report, TikTok is offering to operate more of its US business at arm\u2019s length and subject it to outside scrutiny. The office of the House\u2019s chief administrative officer and TikTok have been approached for comment."

            "date": "2022-12-26T10:00:29Z",
            "content": "The future direction of UK plc now looks more likely to come from the Starmer and Reeves emporium than the woeful management of the present Are You Being (Under) Served? government. In the mayhem of 2022, the Tories forfeited their claim to be the natural managers of the UK economy. Opportunity knocks for the opposition to fill that gap. Attacking the government\u2019s record here is straightforward: the economy has had skimpy growth for most of its 12 years in power (on a per-person basis, the economy has grown just 7% in real terms since the financial crash of 2007-08). Perhaps more concerning for any potential replacement, productivity has lagged behind competitors. Voters feel the result in their real-terms household incomes, and lower earners now find basics, let alone treats, less affordable. So \u201cthe Tories tanked the economy\u201d is a line with a lot of truth to it. Planning to get the economy upright again is a more daunting task. That will need to change in 2023 as voters will want to know more about Labour\u2019s intended direction of travel. The big reality check is that the political economy no longer has \u201cnatural elasticity\u201d, which prompts things to return to a benign status quo. The Conservatives have discovered this the hard way, after opting for austerity in the hope of rapid stabilisation afterwards. This never really paid off, and something similar seems to be happening in the wake of the pandemic, where bouts of apparent recovery are followed by sluggishness. Systemic tweaks may help to some extent. As a former Bank of England economist, it must have struck Rachel Reeves that her old employer\u2019s inflation-targeting remit is too restrictive. These days, more flexible central banks have a wider brief to consider inflation and employment, which connects them more closely to the big picture. The 1997 Gordon Brown version of the central bank\u2019s autonomy doesn\u2019t have to be the final word on the bank\u2019s role, so this discussion should not be cut off by the shadow chancellor before it gets going. Reconnecting Labour more forcefully to business is the most significant overall priority, alongside a clearer understanding of what it takes to help medium-size companies to scale and become export champions. This will mean a delicate corporate tax calculation for Labour. \u201cSharing the pain\u201d is a decent message in times like these. But ensuring there are incentives for companies to grow needs to be firmly in the mix, along with commitments to offsets for research and development, and promoting better quality machinery and digital capacity. These are not \u201csexy\u201d topics, in the way that tax and borrowing motivate MPs and voters. But tax incentives that favour the behemoths with offshore accounting facilities over new entrants is one reason for productivity woes. Keir Starmer, I gather, is quietly spending a lot of time speaking to industry giants such as JCB (despite the diehard support for Boris Johnson from its chairman, Lord Bamford). Understanding where and how the commitment to \u201cgreen jobs\u201d plugs into broader economic thinking will be crucial. Certainly there will be tension between commitment to \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen generated from methane, and \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen made with renewable energy, which is more environmentally solid but harder to secure at scale. That poses tricky questions about what is meant by a green job. Much else, in terms of energy supply, cost and the impact on the economy, will depend on how Labour navigates this choice \u2013 and those who advocate for one or the other will be disappointed. There will also be calls to \u201crebalance\u201d the economy to the north, where investment has been shockingly poor. It should not, however, come across as a zero-sum game in which the party turns its back on the powerhouse of established tech and new industry clusters in the south. Labour needs to embrace a better and more innovative future for the economy, not simply shuffle around resources. Remaking relations with major economic powers in Europe needs to be a higher priority. Starmerism has shied away from this, partly in order to avoid rows about whether he wants to rejoin the single market, and partly because, to put it bluntly, the upper echelons of today\u2019s Labour party are not well connected in Berlin, Paris or Brussels. But when it comes to resolving trade tensions and healing post-Brexit damage, a Labour government will be seen as a new start, and has commonalities with the SPD-led coalition in Berlin and the socialism-lite French government. It can start to show more dedication to the task of talking to Europe for mutual trade and benefit. Oppositions need plans, projects and passions, but they also need to look at why some apparently good ideas have not worked \u2013 and the answer is not always that Conservatives are fools or greedy cynics. A Labour pledge to \u201cgive small enterprises a level playing field for winning contracts, cutting red tape, streamlining the bidding process\u201d is one I read with some nostalgia, having written about the attempt to make this happen in 2011 under David Cameron. It did not work because the legal and efficiency complexity proved too great, and procurement challenges often favour big players. It is a dead certainty Labour will also struggle with this; it must be open to learning from the best-intentioned failures, even Tory ones. A Labour economy needs to support the interests of those who have fallen behind in the national prosperity story. But the party also needs to think beyond simply redistributive ideas, to those that move the needle on growth. The present focus around on-shoring and re-shoring jobs, without a plan to boost immigration for skilled workers or a better sense of connection to the outside world, risks parochialism. Tempting as it is to bring out the Blair-Brown greatest hits album, Starmer cannot rely on returning to the defaults of the 2000s, or the assumption that ousting an unpopular government will be a remedy. Next year, many voters who opted for the Conservatives in 2019 will survey the damage and ask what may await them if they shift their vote leftwards. We have the beginning of an answer \u2013 2023 should give us a greater sense of where the Labour compass will point. Anne McElvoy is senior editor at the Economist"

            "date": "2022-12-09T06:00:15Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s nearly three-year policy of enacting strict lockdowns to contain outbreaks of Covid-19 came with a heavy price for the world\u2019s second largest economy. The question for its president, Xi Jinping, and his inner court of advisers is whether a sudden relaxation of lockdown rules brought in this week will both prevent a recurrence of the shockwave of protests across the country and turn the economy around. In the couple of days after Beijing\u2019s announced relaxations to the rules \u2013 including allowing people with mild or no symptoms to quarantine at home \u2013 the signs are only modestly hopeful. A lack of effective vaccines and the fact much of the population has not had no jab or fewer than the three needed for full protection will mean that employers must cope with a workforce plagued by ill-health, possibly hitting production as much as any lockdown. State-run newspapers have welcomed new vaccines being validated by the government, but little is know publicly about how well they will work. Meanwhile, reports that pharmacies are already running short of basic medicines such as ibuprofen are undermining public trust in the health system and its ability to protect them without lockdowns in place. Nevertheless, Xi had little choice when he decided to ease restrictions. Not only were protesters calling for him to quit in unprecedented public outbursts, trade with the rest of the world had slumped and youth unemployment soared. As a measure of the stagnation Beijing is now wrestling with, inflation dropped to just 2.5% in October and core inflation, excluding volatile elements such as energy and food, stands at 0.6%. The almost complete lack of domestically driven inflation reveals an economy stuck in neutral. Last month\u2019s export figures showed exports had contracted 8.7% from a year earlier, a much bigger fall than the 6.7% forecast by analysts and the 0.3% dip in October. Imports also fell sharply by 10.6% from a 0.7% drop in October as the domestic demand for imported soya beans and iron ore declined. The International Monetary Fund boss, Kristalina Georgieva, said last month that it might have to trim its forecast for China\u2019s economic growth without an overhaul of Covid restrictions. Before her comments, the IMF predicted that Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) would expand 3.2% this year and 4.4% in 2023. Beijing\u2019s Covid control reforms announced on Wednesday also included adjustments to the duration and scope of lockdowns, with cities required only to close off apartments and affected floors, rather than entire city blocks. Health officials are still warning that trends in fatalities will be closely watched and they reserve the right to introduce tougher measures if needed. However, Xi has let it be known local governments should not use the previous \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and health authorities can adopt the same flexible policy. Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the change of heart in Beijing was unlikely to prevent a further fall over coming quarters, limiting a recovery to the second half of next year. \u201cOutbound shipments will receive a limited boost from the easing of [China\u2019s] virus restrictions, which are no longer a major constraint on the ability of manufacturers to meet orders,\u201d he said. \u201cOf much greater consequence will be the downturn in global demand for Chinese goods due to the reversal in pandemic-era demand and the coming global recession.\u201d As an example of the hit to individual companies, Apple supplier Foxconn said revenue in November dropped 11.4% year on year, following production problems related to Covid-19 controls at the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou. The iPhone 14 is expected to be in short supply this Christmas as a result. Albert Edwards, a global Strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said China\u2019s central bank was likely to stimulate the economy with cheap money, in part to boost consumer and business spending and offset the impact of recession in most of the industrialised world. Ali Jaffari, head of North American capital markets at Validus Risk Management, said a 10% slump this year in the value of the yuan indicated the difficulties faced by the Chinese economy. \u201cChina\u2019s economic outlook remains vulnerable as the state continues to experience lacklustre growth. The property market is in a slump, manufacturing and production levels are coming in below estimates and export demand is fading,\u201d he said. Attempts by the central bank to boost borrowing, including cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves and loosening financing curbs to rescue the property sector, were unlikely to have much of an effect, Jaffari added, though financial markets were buoyed up by the easing of restrictions, sending the stock market higher. Promoting a more upbeat message on the day Covid controls were eased, Chinese state media reported that a high-level meeting of the ruling Communist party\u2019s politburo had emphasised the government\u2019s focus in 2023 would be on stabilising growth, promoting domestic demand and opening up to the outside world. It might prove to be enough to persuade the IMF to maintain its forecasts for 2023, but without more effective vaccines, lockdowns are expected to continue in China when the rest of the world has moved on, limiting growth for some time."

            "content": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s government is \u201cgoing backwards\u201d on building a greener economy and lacks a growth plan to soften the blow from recession, the head of the UK\u2019s leading business lobby group has said. Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said the prime minister\u2019s lack of ambition for the low-carbon economy was leaving business bosses \u201cconfused and disappointed\u201d after the progress made under Boris Johnson. Arguing that the government lost its \u201cbiggest champion\u201d in cabinet for green economic growth when Johnson left No 10, Danker said: \u201cIn crude terms, most of business thinks the government is going backwards on green, having gone forwards over the past five years.\u201d He said this was leading to \u201cgenuine and widespread concern\u201d in company boardrooms across the country, because bosses believe the low-carbon economy of the future is one area wherer Britain could become a world leader. Warning that a \u201ccompetitive prize\u201d was being put at risk, Danker said firms wanted more action from the government on carbon capture, sustainable finance in the City of London, onshore wind and investment in renewables. \u201cThe government is strangely silent and reticent for all the levers for green growth.\u201d Danker said failure to encourage business to invest in green projects and other productivity-enhancing schemes was weighing on the prospects for the British economy. Publishing a downbeat assessment in its latest economic forecasts, the CBI said Britain in 2023 would remain beset by high inflation, weak economic growth, low business investment and chronic worker shortages. Reflecting higher taxes, a squeeze on household incomes and a weaker growth outlook, it said business investment at the end of 2024 was on track to remain 9% below the level in December 2019, before the Covid pandemic struck. Danker said: \u201cThe country does not have a plan for growth. There are lots of ominous signs about recession and headwinds. What we\u2019re lacking is any sense of reason to believe in investment confidence, or a market framework for growth, coming from government.\u201d Jeremy Hunt used his autumn statement speech last month to argue that Britain could take advantage of \u201cBrexit freedoms\u201d to cut regulations in five key growth industries: digital technology, life sciences, green industries, financial services and advanced manufacturing. However, the chancellor also confirmed that the headline rate of corporation tax would rise by six percentage points, from 19% to 25% from April, and that the government\u2019s \u201csuper deduction\u201d investment relief programme would end. Aiming to restore investor confidence in the government after Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget, Hunt suggested that higher taxes should form part of the plan to show Britain can pay its way, while prioritising financial stability and bringing down inflation as preconditions for economic growth. The head of the CBI said company bosses understood the government\u2019s aims but he warned there was a danger that firms would pull back from investing in Britain without a more robust plan for growth from the government. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be trying the Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng formula for growth, ie let\u2019s cut everyone\u2019s taxes and boost consumption. But we should be trying to boost business investment.\u201d The CBI said chronic shortages of workers required a more flexible immigration system, as well as more investment in education and training. It called for the de facto ban on onshore wind to be scrapped, and for the government to offer companies tax relief on productivity-boosting investments. It comes with the economy expected to have already fallen into a recession in the third quarter of this year, when GDP shrank by 0.2%. The business group said it expected the recession to last until the end of 2023, with high levels of inflation, alongside falling business investment from the middle of the year and a year-long decline in consumer spending. Danker said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that Britain finally grapples with business investment. I think Rishi Sunak gets that. Business recognise that. And yet we don\u2019t have a strategy for it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-12T00:01:46Z",
            "content": "Fears are growing over the state of the UK economy as it emerged that the manufacturing sector shrank by about 4% this year and is forecast to decline by a further 3.2% in 2023. Increasing raw material costs, sagging consumer demand, staff shortages and higher borrowing costs have collectively formed the perfect storm for the UK manufacturing sector, according to the latest Make UK/BDO outlook report. The study showed that investment in the sector has gone \u201cnegative\u201d for the first time in nearly two years. The report suggests that the manufacturing sector is likely to be 7% smaller by the end of next year, although the report\u2019s authors stressed that the 4% fall for this year is relative to a strong 2021, which experienced a pandemic bounceback. The dire figures came as policymakers at the Bank of England weigh up whether to raise interest rates again on Thursday. Make UK said it has been consistently revising down its forecasts for manufacturing growth in 2022 from 3% in March to 1.7% in July, then 0.6% in September and now, a contraction of -4.4%, highlighting the extent to which conditions have weakened. As well as downgrading its forecasts for manufacturing, Make UK is forecasting GDP growth of 4.4% this year but a 0.9% contraction next year. More than 330 companies were surveyed as part of the report. In November, the British Chamber of Commerce said manufacturing fell by 2.3% to record the worst performance over three months since the 1980s. Stephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK, said: \u201cThere is simply no sugar-coating the outlook for next year and possibly beyond \u2026 the UK risks sleepwalking into an acceptance that little or no growth is the norm. Government needs to work with industry as a matter of urgency to deliver a long-term industrial strategy that has growth at national and regional levels at its heart.\u201d Phipson called on ministers to help alleviate labour shortages with a temporary easing of the migration system, and for an expansion of the tax exemption for work-related training. He also wants a rethink of recent decisions on the research and development tax relief for small businesses \u201cto ensure manufacturers are not deterred from investing in critical innovations\u201d. Richard Austin, BDO\u2019s national head of manufacturing, warned there is little clarity on how the new government plans to build the right longer-term environment in which the sector can effectively plan. News that the manufacturing sector is struggling will be noted at the Bank of England. On Thursday, the nine members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) will make an interest rate decision that could not only push up the cost of borrowing for businesses, but also the amount that millions of mortgage holders have to pay their banks every month. Most analysts are expecting the base rate to rise from 3% to 3.5%, its highest rate for 14 years. The expected 0.5% rise will represent a slight cooling in rate increases, after the Bank\u2019s MPC opted for a 0.75% rise last month \u2013 the highest single increase since 1989. Deutsche Bank has suggested that interest rates could push as high as 4.5% next year, drifting from the Bank\u2019s own previous prediction of 5.25% last month. The rate rise threatens to pile further pressure on households already struggling with higher energy bills. Later on Monday, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will publish its gross domestic product (GDP) figure for October. GDP fell by 0.2% in the third quarter of the year as households and businesses struggled with soaring inflation."

            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy returned to growth in October as activity bounced back from the impact of the additional bank holiday for the Queen\u2019s funeral, however a long recession is still expected. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.5% on the month, after a decline of 0.6% in September when many businesses closed their doors during the national mourning period. Car sales rebounded after a poor month amid a wider recovery in the country\u2019s dominant service sector, while there was strong growth in activity in the health sector amid a rise in GP appointments, A&amp;E attendance and the Covid-19 autumn booster campaign. Construction continued a strong run, driven up by housebuilding, while manufacturing output grew. However, GDP shrank by 0.3% in the three months to October, reflecting concerns over the strength of the economy as consumers and businesses tightened their belts amid the highest rates of inflation for 41 years. The Bank of England said last month the economy was probably already in a recession that could last until the end of 2023, after GDP fell by 0.2% in the three months to September. Despite a recovery in October, a return to contraction in November and December could spell a second consecutive quarter of decline \u2013 the technical definition of a recession. Economists said the October figures did not alter the overall picture of a slowing economy. David Bharier, the head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBusiness confidence has been falling dramatically as firms face into a wall of higher prices and energy bills, increased taxation, and rising borrowing costs. \u201cUnless the government helps create a stable environment to allow businesses to invest, the UK faces a long-term loss of competitiveness.\u201d With inflation above 11% during Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine driving up energy costs, the Bank of England is widely expected to further raise interest rates on Thursday for the ninth time in a row. However, the rate-setting monetary policy committee is expected to be split, with a minority of its nine members likely to push for a slower pace of rate increases amid the risk of a lengthy recession. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expected the economy to shrink by up to 2% in total over the course of the recession. \u201cThe government looks set to pull back energy price support substantially next year, while higher interest rates will squeeze disposable incomes and spur households and businesses to pay off debt. \u201c[I] doubt that the economy will grow again until early 2024, resulting in a deeper and longer recession than we envisage for all other G7 economies.\u201d Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the figures showed Britain was lagging behind on the global stage. \u201cThese are challenging economic times but there is a choice. We can continue down the road of managed decline, falling behind our competitors, or we can draw on bold thinking to propel us forward,\u201d she said. Analysts said October\u2019s recovery in consumer spending was likely to be short lived, despite hopes among retailers and hospitality firms that the World Cup in Qatar could help drive up sales during the festive season. The latest snapshot showed output in consumer-facing services grew by 1.2% on the month, after a fall of 1.7% in September when many retailers temporarily closed for the Queen\u2019s funeral. Alongside a rise in car sales, the ONS said travel agencies and tour operators benefited from a stronger month, while output also grew for sports activities and amusements. Yael Selfin, the chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \u201cStretched household incomes could see sustained falls in consumer spending over the coming year, despite households tapping into their savings and increasing borrowing to help maintain their spending during the downturn.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said high inflation was slowing economic growth across the world, and the International Monetary Fund had forecast a third of the world economy will be in recession this year or next. \u201cWhile today\u2019s figures show some growth, I want to be honest that there is a tough road ahead. Like the rest of Europe, we are not immune from the aftershocks of Covid-19, Putin\u2019s war and high global gas prices,\u201d he said."

            "title": "\u2018That\u2019s Hitler, Bannon thought\u2019: 2022 in books about Trump and US politics",
            "date": "2022-12-11T07:00:26Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has been out of office almost two years, but he is still lodged in America\u2019s consciousness. In mid-November, he declared his 2024 re-election bid. Days later, Merrick Garland, the attorney general, appointed Jack Smith as special counsel. Trump has since demanded that the US constitution be terminated, and dined with Ye, the recording artist and antisemite formerly known as Kanye West, and Nick Fuentes, the white supremacist. This week, on a bleak Tuesday afternoon in New York, a jury found the Trump Organization guilty on all counts in a tax fraud trial. The Trump show is never dull. As expected, in 2022 the 45th president left his mark on what Americans read about politics. In February, Jeremy Peters of the New York Times delivered Insurgency, capturing how the party of Lincoln and Reagan morphed into the fiefdom of Trump. Peters caught Steve Bannon rating his former boss among the worst presidents, and likening Trump\u2019s history-making 2015 escalator ride to a scene from Triumph of the Will, Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s Nazi propaganda film. \u201cThat\u2019s Hitler, Bannon thought.\u201d By extension, that makes Mar-a-Lago Trump\u2019s Eagle\u2019s Nest. As for Bannon, having burned through a Trump pardon, he awaits sentencing for contempt of Congress and will stand trial next year in Manhattan for conspiracy and fraud. In March came One Damn Thing After Another, another installment of Trump alumni performance art, this time by Bill Barr, the ex-attorney general. Barr took aim at Joe Biden for his stance on Russia, saying \u201cdemonizing [Vladimir] Putin is not a foreign policy\u201d, nor \u201cthe way grown-ups should think\u201d. Looks like the author didn\u2019t have an invasion of Ukraine on his bingo card. In case anyone cares, Barr still loathes progressives, as his book makes abundantly clear. But he did spill his guts to the January 6 committee. May brought the first political blockbuster of the year, This Will Not Pass, in which Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns delivered 473 pages of essential reading. Kevin McCarthy denied having talked smack about Trump and the January 6 insurrection, so Martin appeared on MSNBC with tapes. The House Republican leader lied. Burns and Martin\u2019s subtitle was \u201cTrump, Biden, and the Battle for America\u2019s Future\u201d. They closed with an anxious meditation on the state of US democracy, quoting Malcolm Turnbull, a former prime minister of Australia: \u201cYou know that great line that you hear all the time, \u2018This is not us. This is not America.\u2019 You know what? It is, actually.\u201d Later in May came A Sacred Oath by Mark Esper, Trump\u2019s last defense secretary, and Here\u2019s the Deal by the former White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway, Trump administration memoirs \u2013 and personas \u2013 as different as day and night. Esper pulled no punches, depicting Trump as unfit for office and a threat to democracy, a prisoner of wrath, impulse and appetite. His memoir was surgically precise in its score-settling, not just fuel for the pyre of Trump alumni revenge porn. Here\u2019s the Deal was just that. Disdain unvarnished, Conway strafed Bannon, Jared Kushner and Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s last chief of staff. Unsurprisingly, she had few kind words for Biden, blaming him for the Ukraine invasion and for Iran threatening nuclear breakout. Trump junked the Iran deal and was Putin\u2019s toady. Then again, Conway is the queen of \u201calternative facts\u201d. In August came Breaking History, Kushner\u2019s own attempt to spin his triumphs while playing the victim. His book was predictably self-serving and selective, even trying to spin as something understandable his ex-con dad luring his own brother-in-law into a filmed liaison with a prostitute. The Kushners and the Trumps are not your typical families. Breaking History also came with conflicting creation stories. The New York Times reported that Kushner took an online MasterClass from the thriller writer James Patterson, then \u201cbatted out\u201d 40,000 words of his own. By contrast, the Guardian learned that Kushner received assistance from Ken Kurson, a former editor of the New York Observer, and two other Trump White House alumni. As luck had it, Trump granted Kurson a pardon for cyberstalking, though Kurson later pleaded guilty after being charged with spying on his wife. \u2018The first thing he told us was a lie\u2019 Labor Day signaled a pre-midterm publication rush. With The Divider, Peter Baker and Susan Glasser offered a beautifully written, utterly dispiriting history of the man who attacked democracy. In electing Trump, the New York Times and New Yorker, husband-and-wife pair wrote, the US empowered a leader who \u201cattacked basic principles of constitutional democracy at home\u201d and \u201cvenerated\u201d strongmen abroad. Whether the system winds up in the \u201cmorgue\u201d and how much time remains to make sure it doesn\u2019t were the authors\u2019 open questions. The results of the midterms \u2013 Republicans squeaking the House, Democrats holding the Senate, election deniers defeated in key states \u2013 offered a glimmer of hope. Truth, however, remains a scarce commodity for Trump. \u201cWhen we sat down with [him] a year after his defeat,\u201d Baker and Glasser wrote, \u201cthe first thing he told us was a lie.\u201d Specifically, Trump claimed the Biden administration had asked him to record a public service announcement promoting Covid vaccinations. Baker and Glasser also depicted Hitler as a Trump role model. To John Kelly, his second chief of staff, a retired Marine Corps general and a father bereaved in the 9/11 wars, Trump complained: \u201cYou fucking generals, why can\u2019t you be like the German generals?\u201d \u201cWhich generals?\u201d \u201cThe German generals in World War II.\u201d \u201cYou do know that they tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off?\u201d According to Baker and Glasser, Kelly used The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, a study by 27 mental health professionals, as an owner\u2019s manual. Next, a month before the midterms, Maggie Haberman\u2019s Confidence Man made its debut. A political epic, the book traced Trump\u2019s journey from the streets of Queens to the Upper East Side, from the White House to Mar-a-Lago. Haberman gave Trump and those close to him plenty of voice \u2013 and rope. She caught Kushner gleefully asking a White House visitor: \u201cDid you see I cut Bannon\u2019s balls off?\u201d To quote Peter Navarro, another Trump tell-all author, like Bannon now under indictment: \u201cNepotism and excrement roll downhill.\u201d Haberman interviewed Trump three times. He confessed that he is drawn to her like a moth to a flame. \u201cI love being with her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s like my psychiatrist.\u201d But she saw through him, writing: \u201cThe reality is that he treats everyone like they are his psychiatrists.\u201d Trump\u2019s vice-president, Mike Pence, tried his hand with So Help Me God, a well-written and well-paced memoir that will, however, do little to shake the impression that he is the Rodney Dangerfield of vice-presidents: he gets no respect. Pence delivered a surprising indictment, cataloging Trump\u2019s faults, errors and sins from Charlottesville to Russia and Ukraine. But Pence\u2019s is a precarious balancing act. He upbraided Trump for his failure to condemn \u201cthe racists and antisemites in Charlottesville by name\u201d, but also rejected the contention Trump was a bigot. As for Putin, \u201cthere was no reason for Trump not to call out Russia\u2019s bad behaviour\u201d, Pence wrote, while calling Trump\u2019s infamous, impeachment-triggering phone call to Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u201cless than perfect\u201d. In the end, So Help Me God was a strained attempt to retain political viability. \u2018As long as you make the right friends\u2019 Not all the notable books of 2022 were about Trump himself. Some examined the people and movements that lie adjacent. We Are Proud Boys by Andy Campbell looked at the violence-addicted street fighters who have become best friends with many of Trump\u2019s past and present supporters, from Ann Coulter to Roger Stone. As Campbell put it, the Proud Boys have \u201cproven that you can make it as a fascist gang of hooligans in this country, as long as you make the right friends\u201d. Andrew Kirtzman\u2019s Giuliani provided a vivid reminder that Trump\u2019s gravitational pull induces destruction. The author covered Rudy Giuliani when he was New York mayor. Rudy wasn\u2019t always a buffoon. The book is masterly and engrossing. Broken News, by Chris Stirewalt, doubled as a critique of the media and a rebuke of Fox News, his former employer, and Trump. The Washington Post, the New York Times, MSNBC and Joe Scarborough fared poorly too. Substantively, Stirewalt contended that much of the news business is about the pursuit of ratings. These days, Fox is battling defamation lawsuits arising from repeatedly airing Trump\u2019s \u201cbig lie\u201d. Robert Draper\u2019s Weapons of Mass Delusion dissected the Trumpian nightmare, focusing on the consequences of the world the internet created. Republicans like the far-right Arizona congressman Paul Gosar and his mentee, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, are much more likely to be rewarded than penalized for \u201coutrageous, fact-free behavior\u201d. Gabriel Debenedetti is the national correspondent for New York magazine. His first book, The Long Alliance, brought depth and context to the near-two-decade relationship between the 44th and 46th presidents, emphasizing that the pair\u2019s time in power together was no buddy movie. Barack Obama was the star. Joe Biden played a supporting role \u2013 until he too seized the brass ring. The most memorable contribution to this year\u2019s American political literature, however, was not a printed book. The Trump Tapes, subtitled \u201cBob Woodward\u2019s Twenty Interviews with President Donald Trump\u201d is an audio collection that offers a passport to the heart of darkness. In June 2020, Trump confided: \u201cI get people, they come up with ideas. But the ideas are mine, Bob. Want to know something? Everything is mine.\u201d Wow. Woodward\u2019s tapes convincingly demonstrated that Trump knew in early 2020 that Covid posed a mortal danger to the US, but balked at telling the whole truth. Trump holds the press in contempt but yearns for its approval. He flattered Woodward as \u201ca great historian\u201d. Maggie Haberman knows the feeling."

            "date": "2022-12-10T07:00:58Z",
            "content": "The civil war divided America\u2019s Christians along axes of geography and theology. These days, Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, soon to be prime minister again, have wrought a similar sorting. In the words of Eric Alterman, \u201cIsrael is a red state. US Jewry is blue.\u201d Alterman is a distinguished professor of English and journalism at the City University of New York. We Are Not One represents four decades of effort, patience and research. Sixty pages of endnotes undergird his arguments, some dating to his student days. Alterman posits that closeness between the US and Israel has oscillated over time and that younger American Jews, particularly those outside Orthodox Judaism, are now distancing themselves from the Zionist experiment. He relies, in part, on polling by Pew Research. Practically speaking, the divide may be more nuanced, with the latest shifts also reflecting a response to a rise in crime \u2013 and messaging about it. In the midterms, the Republican Lee Zeldin won 46% of Jewish voters in New York as he came close to beating the governor, Kathy Hochul. Donald Trump never surpassed 30% nationally. In 2020, he took 37% of New York\u2019s Jewish vote. In We Are Not One, Alterman observes how unsafe streets and racial tensions helped spawn neoconservatism. It is \u201cimpossible\u201d to separate the movement\u2019s \u201corigins from the revulsions caused by constant news reports of inner-city riots \u2026 and broader societal dislocations\u201d. Between 1968 and 1972, Richard Nixon\u2019s share of the Jewish vote doubled from 17% to 35%. One Saturday night in 1968, a crowd thronged the streets of Borough Park in Brooklyn, a predominately Jewish enclave, to cheer the vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic presidential nominee. Over the next four years, \u201claw and order\u201d found purchase. To top it off, George McGovern, the Democratic nominee, made Israel supporters nervous. The South Dakota senator\u2019s message, \u201cCome home America\u201d, left them wondering if the US would be in Israel\u2019s corner if war came again. Vietnam was a proxy for foreign policy anxieties. As a coda, Alterman recollects how Nixon nonetheless yearned to turn Jews into political foils and whipping boys. That 2016 Trump ad with a six-pointed star over a field of dollar bills? It had deep roots. Alterman also recounts how Daniel Moynihan, a Democrat, used his position as Gerald Ford\u2019s UN ambassador to reach the Senate in 1976. With support from neoconservatives, hawkish Jews and the New York Times, he beat Bella Abzug, a leftwing lion, in the primary. Then he beat James Buckley, the Republican incumbent. Moynihan lauded Israel\u2019s raid at Entebbe. In Alterman\u2019s description, he appealed to \u201cAmerican Jews\u2019 feelings of vulnerability and their pride and relief at Israel\u2019s military prowess in kicking the asses\u201d of Palestinian and German terrorists and \u201chumiliating\u201d Idi Amin, Uganda\u2019s \u201cevil dictator\u201d. Time passes. Things remain the same. In New York, transit crime is up more than 30%. Violence against Jews is a staple, according to the NYPD. Meanwhile, on college campuses, in Alterman\u2019s words, Israel is a \u201cmini-America\u201d, a useful target for faculty and students to vent against \u201crapaciousness on the part of the US and other western nations vis-a-vis the downtrodden of the world\u201d. The author quotes Benzion Netanyahu, the Israeli leader\u2019s late father: \u201cJewish history is in large measure a history of holocausts.\u201d Modern insecurities spring from ancient calamities. Kanye West spews bile. Trump entertains him with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist and Holocaust denier. Republicans quietly squirm. Trump\u2019s Jewish supporters grapple with cognitive dissonance and emotional vertigo. Take Mort Klein, of the hard-right Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), who makes several appearances in We Are Not One. Testifying before Congress, Klein accused the press of taking Trump\u2019s comments on Charlottesville, where neo-Nazis marched in 2017, \u201ccompletely out of context\u201d. In 2018, after 11 worshippers were murdered at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Klein rode to the rescue again. At the ZOA dinner, he said it was \u201cpolitical blasphemy\u201d to blame Trump. Last month, ZOA gave Trump its highest honor. According to Klein, the ex-president was the \u201cbest friend Israel ever had in the White House\u201d. Then Trump met West, now known as Ye, and Fuentes, twisting Klein into a human pretzel. \u201cTrump is not an antisemite,\u201d he announced. \u201cHe loves Israel. He loves Jews. But he mainstreams, he legitimizes Jew hatred and Jew haters. And this scares me.\u201d Trump reportedly kept Hitler\u2019s speeches by his bed. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it\u2019s a duck. At a recent confab of Agudath Israel of America, an ultra-Orthodox group, Rabbi Dovid Zwiebel, its executive vice-president, condemned Trump: \u201cYesterday\u2019s friend can be tomorrow\u2019s greatest enemy.\u201d Two years earlier, though, its members clearly backed Trump over Joe Biden. Borough Park was as deep red as Lafayette, Louisiana. It all carries a whiff of deja vu. Alterman recounts how neoconservatives admonished America\u2019s Jews against complaining of Israel\u2019s alliance with Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson: \u201cThe Christian Zionists\u2019 devotion to \u2018Greater Israel\u2019 earned them a pass from the neocons for their occasional outbursts of antisemitism.\u201d Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago dinner created a similar bind. David Friedman, his bankruptcy lawyer and ambassador to Israel, tweeted: \u201cTo my friend Donald Trump, you are better than this \u2026 I urge you to throw those bums out, disavow them and relegate them to the dustbin of history where they belong.\u201d Trump was not amused. On Friday, he lashed out at \u201cJewish Leaders\u201d. Friedman must learn patience. ZOA may wish to rescind its award. Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization lawyer who moved to the White House, echoed Friedman for CNN. Days later, he spoke at a synagogue in Scarsdale, north of New York City. Greenblatt repeated the need for Trump to correct the record and urged those in attendance to politely speak up. In the next breath, he lauded his one-time boss\u2019s achievements and character. It sure is tough to quit Trump. We Are Not One: A History of America\u2019s Fight Over Israel is published in the US by Hachette Book Group"

            "date": "2022-12-03T09:00:41Z",
            "content": "The past few years have left many of us reeling, with events moving so fast that historians and political writers have been scrambling to catch up. Publishing lead times are months long: at least one biography of Liz Truss was scheduled for Christmas publication and has had to be rapidly rewritten. You can probably skip that. Instead, reach for the tonic of Marina Hyde\u2019s What Just Happened?! Dispatches from Turbulent Times (Guardian Faber). Based on her cult Guardian columns, Hyde\u2019s book takes us from the Brexit referendum of 2016, through the horrors of Donald Trump and the Covid-19 pandemic, to Boris Johnson finally being prised out of 10 Downing Street in 2022 (\u201cJohnson is leaving office with the same dignity he brought to it: none. I\u2019ve seen more elegant prolapses\u201d). How did we get to this point, though? Among the books trying to make sense of that question is Hannah Rose Woods\u2019s Rule, Nostalgia: A Backwards History of Britain (WH Allen). This indispensable and fascinating cultural history begins in 2021 and works its way back to 1530, revealing that every generation creates its own fantasies harking back to an imaginary golden era. Woods notes that the centre and left are not immune \u2013 as she says of Remainers: \u201cBrexit-adjacent social media discussion drew on a seemingly bottomless enthusiasm for faux-archaic swearing: \u2018Cockwomble\u2019, \u2018Arsebadger\u2019, \u2018Wankpuffin\u2019.\u201d Nostalgia may be reassuring and unifying but it can easily become exclusionary and dangerous \u2013 for example, when historians and heritage workers who challenge such myths are attacked for telling uncomfortable truths. \u201cIt should not feel like an existential threat to explore the complexities of the past, or to find out that things were rarely as straightforward as we had first been told.\u201d Every nation builds myths and fantasies about itself. The Wrath to Come: Gone With the Wind and the Lies America Tells (Head of Zeus) by Sarah Churchwell is an urgent, searing analysis of America\u2019s psyche through the lens of Margaret Mitchell\u2019s bestselling 1936 novel, set during and after the Confederacy, and the blockbuster 1939 movie based on it. The book opens with Donald Trump\u2019s supporters storming the Capitol on 6 January 2021, waving Confederate battle flags. As Churchwell shows, the legacy of Gone With the Wind runs deep in US politics. The night before the film\u2019s Atlanta premiere there was a pageant at a plantation, during which a Black children\u2019s choir \u2013 dressed up in slave outfits \u2013 sang spirituals for an all-white audience that was evidently nostalgic for the 1860s: \u201cOne of the little Black children dressed as a slave and bringing a sentimental tear to white America\u2019s eye was a 10-year-old boy named Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d Looking at how ideas and ideologies can spread beyond borders, and the rebound, Kojo Koram\u2019s Uncommon Wealth: Britain and the Aftermath of Empire (John Murray) takes apart the assumption that former British colonies around the world fell into inequality and insecurity after the British left because of their own innate dysfunctionality. Instead, Koram looks at how British capital, debt and asset-stripping continued to shape those countries\u2019 destinies \u2013 and how, in a \u201cboomerang effect\u201d, the same destructive policies have been advanced in Britain itself. His incisive section on Britannia Unchained \u2013 the now notorious 2012 book co-authored by Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng, among others \u2013 is a striking example that has only become more relevant since this book was published at the beginning of 2022. The tumultuous relationship between the global south and the north is a central theme of Sally Hayden\u2019s My Fourth Time, We Drowned: Seeking Refuge on the World\u2019s Deadliest Migration Route (4th Estate). Hayden\u2019s extraordinary reporting from migrant routes across north Africa, focusing on individual experiences, has already been justly lauded, winning the 2022 Orwell prize for political writing. The intensely personal stories she tells are a welcome corrective to the often dehumanising discourse that surrounds migration in rich countries. This unforgettable book should be required reading for politicians on all sides. Anyone interested in the uneasy faultlines running through Europe itself should rush to pick up Timothy Phillips\u2019s The Curtain and the Wall: A Modern Journey Along Europe\u2019s Cold War Border (Granta). It traces the old iron curtain from Kirkenes in the frozen north of Norway, round the Baltic, through Germany and the Balkans, and on to Nakhchivan in Azerbaijan. The result is an enthralling travelogue with jaw-dropping historical stories in every chapter. Though the book is not about Ukraine, which was a long way behind the iron curtain, readers will come away with a deeper understanding of the background to Russia\u2019s (and the Soviet Union\u2019s) often difficult relationships with its neighbours \u2013 and enough material for a couple of dozen novels. With King Charles III now on the throne, we might look back to the days of the first King Charles. The Siege of Loyalty House: A Civil War Story (The Bodley Head) is Jessie Childs\u2019s captivating tale of one royalist house holding out against the Roundheads. Her narrative is atmospheric, unflinching and sometimes exquisitely witty, right down to the author\u2019s note explaining her spelling choices: \u201cDuring an argument at a London apothecary in 1639, Sarah Wheeler called Samson Sheffield \u2018fatt gutts\u2019 (he had called her a whore, and her husband \u2018a rogue, a rascal, base fellow, a peasant, an apothecary slave and one that lived by the turds and farts of gentlemen\u2019). It would be a shame, I think, to lose the visual thickening of those double \u2018t\u2019s.\u201d There is plenty to fear in our political future, yet there are also signs of hope. For a dose of both, try Maria Ressa\u2019s How to Stand Up to a Dictator (WH Allen). Ressa, the Filipino journalist who won the Nobel peace prize in 2021 for her reporting in the face of harassment from Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s regime, has written an energetic book that is part memoir, part modern history of the Philippines and part call to arms. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d Ressa warns; even so, her clarity of purpose and courage are profoundly inspiring. Another book that inspires hope \u2013 albeit cautiously \u2013 is Anand Giridharadas\u2019s The Persuaders: Winning Hearts and Minds in a Divided Age (Allen Lane). Giridharadas challenges the idea that there is an unbridgeable divide in the US on subjects such as race and politics. Instead, he looks at stories of how activists and politicians have tried to reach out to people who don\u2019t immediately agree with them, rather than writing them off (he avoids the contentious term \u201ccancel culture\u201d). There are no easy answers, and Giridharadas is frank about the varying degrees of success in his case studies. This is not an instruction manual but a thoughtful exploration of the possibilities and limits of communication and change. Finally, for pure enjoyment, the history book that has made me laugh most this year is Mallory O\u2019Meara\u2019s Girly Drinks: A World History of Women and Alcohol (Hurst).

            "title": "Suella Braverman feeding Farage politics, says outgoing government adviser",
            "date": "2022-12-17T21:41:16Z",
            "content": "An outgoing government adviser has criticised Suella Braverman for allegedly encouraging an increase in racism in Britain and \u201cnormalising\u201d the politics of Nigel Farage. Nimco Ali, who is stepping down from her role as the government\u2019s adviser on tackling violence against women, added that Rishi Sunak should sack Braverman, warning that keeping her on as home secretary will see him lose the next election. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Ali, who was born in Somalia before moving to Britain as a child refugee, said of Braverman: \u201cShe\u2019s basically feeding into this Nigel Farage stuff \u2026 and when you start to normalise these things it\u2019s really hard to put it back in its box. \u201cWhen you have your home secretary speaking the way she is speaking and being cheered, that is problematic, especially when you\u2019re the first man of colour to be prime minister.\u201d Ali, who is a survivor of female genital mutilation (FGM), announced she was effectively quitting her government advisory role during a live radio broadcast, saying she was on a \u201ccompletely different planet\u201d from the home secretary. She said that seeing the home secretary\u2019s eyes \u201clighting up\u201d while discussing deporting people from backgrounds not so different from her own, as well as Braverman\u2019s \u201ccrazy rhetoric\u201d during the summer, left her no choice but to quit her advisory role. Ali, who is close friends with Carrie and Boris Johnson, said she saw clear links between this type of rhetoric and the repeated racist abuse she was subjected to during the 2020 Euro football tournament. When asked if she thought Braverman\u2019s language was helping to incite such racist incidents, she said: \u201c100%. It\u2019s legitimising it. When somebody like her says it, you think, you\u2019re still talking about people of your own heritage to a certain extent but you\u2019re also normalising the Nigel Farages.\u201d She said she could not understand the home secretary\u2019s \u201cambition\u201d to \u201cput people on a flight to Rwanda and get rid of human rights\u201d, adding that it made her anxious that Braverman, \u201ca woman of colour\u201d, could be comfortable with such a stance. She also accused Braverman of \u201cvindictiveness\u201d and a \u201clack of compassion\u201d. The Home Office has been approached for comment. Ali also alleged that Dame Cressida Dick, then Metropolitan police commissioner, complained that the government\u2019s initial response to Sarah Everard\u2019s murder by the serving police officer Wayne Couzens had been \u201cover the top\u201d. Dick\u2019s first words in a high-level meeting chaired by Boris Johnson in March last year shortly after Everard\u2019s murder were \u201cthis has been blown out of proportion\u201d, Ali claimed. The former Met commissioner has denied Ali\u2019s claims. \u201cI did not make those comments and it is not language I would ever use. I entirely supported every effort the government was making at that time, giving advice and taking action in the Met. Throughout my service, I sought to reduce violence against women and girls,\u201d she told the Sunday Times."

            "title": "From US president to NFT salesman \u2013 has Trump finally hit rock bottom? | Arwa Mahdawi",
            "date": "2022-12-17T14:00:22Z",
            "content": "Trump cashes in on trading cards Oh how the mighty have fallen! Just a few years ago Donald Trump was the most powerful man in the world. He had an army of \u201cyes men\u201d, acolytes who hung on his every word. He was close to his family: his eldest daughter and his son-in-law were his special advisers. He had a Twitter account with millions of followers. He made policy and moved markets. He may have been something of a laughingstock, but he had power and influence. Now, however, Trump is just a laughingstock with a lot of legal problems. His former cheerleaders, including the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, have turned their backs on him. Even his family is keeping their distance: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner have cut all public ties with the former president. A normal person might keep a low profile in this situation. They might regroup, do some damage control and calmly figure out how to rebuild their reputation. Not Trump. Instead he decided to wrap up 2022 in the most unhinged way possible: releasing a superhero digital trading card collection. For just $99 each you can buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of Trump dressed in various guises including an astronaut, a fighter pilot and a superhero with lasers coming out of his eyes. Is anyone really stupid enough to waste their hard-earned money on a digitally generated image of Trump dressed like Superman? Apparently so. According to the site selling the NFTs, the trading cards sold out less than 24 hours after Trump announced they were available. Which isn\u2019t too shabby considering it has been reported that there were 45,000 of the cards available for sale. Still, I\u2019d take those numbers with a pinch of salt. Remember when Melania launched an NFT around this time last year? It sold for $180,000 but a blockchain expert discovered that the winning bid was either from Melania herself or whoever set up the NFT\u2019s sale. And remember when Donald Trump Jr wrote a book in 2019 imaginatively titled Triggered, which topped the New York Times bestseller list? Turns out he had a little help from his friends: the Republican National Committee spent nearly $100,000 on a bulk order of the book which helped get it to the top of the bestseller charts. It\u2019s not clear whether Trump scooped up all his own trading cards but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that was the case. If all the sales were truly organic, however, then Trump managed to earn $4,455,000 overnight: under a licensing deal proceeds reportedly all go to Trump rather than the campaign for his 2024 presidential run. You\u2019ve got to hand it to the man, he does come up with some creative ways to make money. Not everyone is impressed by his ingenuity, however. A far-right troll best known by his online persona Baked Alaska, who is facing prison time over his role in the January 6 riots, was aghast at his former hero\u2019s new venture. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to jail for an NFT salesman,\u201d he tweeted. When a guy called Baked Alaska thinks you\u2019re embarrassing, you\u2019ve officially hit rock bottom. Scientists have finally located the snake clitoris (Male snakes, on the other hand, are still trying to figure it out.) If you had no idea that snakes had clitorises until now, you\u2019re not the only one. Previous research mistook the organs \u2013 snakes have two individual clitorises \u2013 for scent glands. The lead author of the study unveiling these finding notes that \u201ca massive taboo around female genitalia\u201d probably played into why snake clitorises had gone undiscovered for so long. \u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of not knowing what to look for and not wanting to,\u201d she said. Iran expelled from UN body tasked with empowering women Turns out that violently cracking down on protests calling for gender equality is somewhat at odds with \u201cempowering women\u201d. Bad grandmas are the new pop culture icons \u201cA growing resistance to the tired grandma trope in popular culture as frail, lonely and hobbling is popping up in surprising places,\u201d writes Sally Feldman in the Guardian. Has prestige television finally conquered the penis? Yes, according to Slate. If you watched White Lotus you may have noticed some full-frontal male nudity \u2013 it was sort of hard to ignore. (Theo James described the prosthetic penis he sported as something that looked like it had been stolen \u201coff a donkey\u201d.) While this sort of thing used to be quite rare on TV, there has been a recent proliferation of penises on prime time. Whether this is a positive development or not is up for debate. Did the US women\u2019s soccer team win their \u2018equal pay\u2019 case? It\u2019s complicated Like a lot of legal battles, the only people who really came out ahead were the lawyers. Shocking testimonies of abuse from IDF veterans The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) often uses its female soldiers to sanitize its image. But feminism and militarism rarely mix. Just take a look at this shocking new video project in which IDF veterans recount the grim reality of occupation and a culture of dehumanisation and violence against Palestinians. Norway proposes 40% gender quota for large unlisted firms In 2005 Norway became the first country in the world to introduce a 40% gender quota on the boards of listed companies, forcing other countries to take note. Last month the European parliament passed a law requiring large listed companies in the EU to have a minimum 40% of non-executive board members as women from mid-2026. Now Norway is recommending that large private companies should also have a 40% gender quota. Tunisia election set to deliver male-dominated parliament and erosion of women\u2019s rights In 2014 nearly a third of MPs in Tunisia were women. However, after President Kais Saied removed a requirement for candidate lists to alternate between the sexes only 122 female candidates, compared with 936 men, were approved to run in the current election. Tunisians will vote on Saturday and activists expect the new parliament to be male-dominated. \u201cThe Tunisian parliament was once the exemplar of gender equity in the region. With these new changes to the law, that could soon be history,\u201d wrote Salsabil Chellali, Tunisia director of Human Rights Watch, on a blog. The week in plot-riarchy The New York Post may be a rightwing rag but I must concede that the greatest headline-writing minds of our generation work there. The Post dedicated its front page last Wednesday to the news of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s arrest and captioned a picture of the hirsute former billionaire with the headline \u201cHAIRY PLOTTER.\u201d Magic. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 December 2022. Donald Trump stood to make $4,455,000 from selling all of his trading cards, not $45,000 as an earlier version said."

            "content": "US vice-president Kamala Harris will swear in Karen Bass as Los Angeles mayor, marking the historic election of the first Black woman to lead the second largest city in the country. The swearing-in ceremony on Sunday will bring together two elected leaders who have repeatedly broken barriers in California politics and beyond. In 2020, Harris became the first woman, first Black person and first Asian person to be US vice- president. In 2008, as a California state assemblymember, Bass became the first Black woman to serve as the speaker of any US state legislature; she was elected to represent Los Angeles in the US congress in 2010 and later became chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. The mayor-elect asked Harris to administer the oath of office as a way to recognize their positions as two of California\u2019s most powerful Black women, the LA Times reported, citing an aide to the vice-president. Harris was honored to participate, the aide told the paper. The vice-president tweeted that it was \u201can historic moment for the people of Los Angeles\u201d. The inauguration will take place on the steps of LA\u2019s city hall and will include musical and other performances, according to a Bass spokesperson. Bass, the first woman to lead LA and second Black mayor in the city\u2019s history, defeated her opponent, billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso, in the closely watched race in November. Caruso had spent more than $100m (\u00a387m) of his own funds on his campaign, which spent roughly 10 times as much as Bass\u2019s campaign. It took a week for the race to be called, with Bass ultimately earning 55% of the vote and Caruso earning 45%. Bass is stepping up at a pivotal moment in LA politics after a leaked audio recording captured three councilmembers making racist and bigoted remarks about colleagues and marginalized communities in the region, prompting an ongoing scandal. Several progressive candidates defeated more moderate opponents in key LA races this year. The congresswoman is also taking over city hall at a time when LA county has recorded 69,000 unhoused people, including more than 48,000 living outside. On the campaign trail, Bass pledged to move 17,000 people indoors in her first year."

            "content": "Peru\u2019s President Pedro Castillo has announced the immediate dissolution of congress and the installation of a \u201cgovernment of exception\u201d to rule by decree until new legislative elections \u2013 just hours before he was due to face an impeachment vote in a dramatic escalation of his fight with the opposition-led chamber. The announcement on Wednesday was the latest dramatic twist in Castillo\u2019s tumultuous 17 months in power which has already seen five cabinets, six criminal investigations and two failed attempts to impeach him. In a televised national address, Castillo ordered a night-time curfew and the reorganisation of the judiciary and prosecutor\u2019s office, which is investigating him for alleged corruption and influence-trafficking \u2013 charges which he denies. The move immediately prompted mass resignations from the cabinet, including the foreign minister, C\u00e9sar Landa, and the economy minister, Kurt Burneo. Minutes before Castillo\u2019s address, the commander of the army, Walter C\u00f3rdova, also resigned. \u201cI strongly condemn this coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and call on the international community to assist in the democratic re-establishment of democracy in Peru,\u201d tweeted Landa. \u201cCastillo took this decision without my knowledge or support.\u201d Opposition lawmakers immediately called the move illegal and a coup, and have refused to leave the congress building. They say they will proceed with the scheduled impeachment debate and vote. Castillo\u2019s announcement prompted comparisons with the notorious \u201cautogolpe\u201d of April 1992, in which the then president, Alberto Fujimori, dissolved congress and sent soldiers and tanks on to the streets of Lima. \u201cWhat has happened in Peru is a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d said Fernando Tuesta, a political science professor at Lima\u2019s Pontifical Catholic University. \u201cNothing announced by former president Pedro Castillo is allowed by the constitution.\u201d \u201cHe is usurping power and is not to be obeyed,\u201d Tuesta said."

            "date": "2022-12-08T15:52:52Z",
            "content": "A Guatemalan court has found a former president and his vice-president guilty on two charges of corruption, in one of the most high-profile corruption cases in the Central American country. The ruling against former president Otto P\u00e9rez Molina and his vice-president, Roxana Baldetti, on charges of illicit association and customs fraud come as a relief amid what is seen as the rollback of anti-corruption efforts. But the two were absolved of charges of illicit enrichment, due to lack of evidence. The decision comes over seven years after the two were forced to resign from office, but for many analysts, the ruling does not come as a clear case of justice for their acts of corruption. \u201cIn some ways justice has been done \u2013 but not completely,\u201d said Edie Cux, a lawyer with the Guatemalan anti-corruption organization Acci\u00f3n Ciudadana. \u201cIt sends a message of institutional weakness regarding cases dealing with corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to some extent, a message of impunity for cases of illicit enrichment.\u201d P\u00e9rez Molina and Baldetti were sentenced to 16 years in prison each for their part in a tax fraud scheme and a fine of just over $1m. Guatemala\u2019s special prosecutor\u2019s office against impunity, or FECI, had requested 30 years. Both were accused of corruption after the April 2015 announcement of an investigation by the public prosecutor\u2019s office in conjunction with the UN-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, commonly known as Cicig, which uncovered extensive corruption in the country\u2019s tax system that had enabled the theft of more than $120m. The case led to massive protests that brought together diverse sectors of the country, including the middle class, small farmers and the business class, to demand the resignation of P\u00e9rez Molina and Baldetti. \u201cIt was a historic moment for Guatemala,\u201d said Ana Mar\u00eda M\u00e9ndez, Central America analyst with the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cSeeing different sectors of the population come together. This type of unity had never been seen before in the country.\u201d Baldetti and P\u00e9rez Molina resigned in 2015 after months of huge protests and after losing the support of the country\u2019s economic elite. The resignations brought hopes for change. But they occurred just ahead of the 2015 presidential election, won by the far-right candidate Jimmy Morales, a former comedian who campaigned off of the scandal promising voters he was \u201cneither corrupt nor a thief\u201d. Morales later undermined the anti-corruptions efforts, forcing Cicig to officially close after he refused to extend the body\u2019s mandate. The closure came after a coordinated campaign undermining the efforts of the anti-corruption body, which was echoed by Judge Jeannette Vald\u00e9s during Wednesday\u2019s sentencing. Anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala have faced systematic backlash in the years since the closure of Cicig, with judges, prosecutors, attorneys and others facing criminal prosecution. The backlash has led to nearly 30 anti-corruption actors being forced into exile, including Juan Francisco Sandoval, the former head of FECI \u2013 which inherited the cases investigated by Cicig \u2013 who was forced to flee in July 2021. Most recently the internationally renowned judge Miguel \u00c1ngel G\u00e1lvez, who had initially sent the case against P\u00e9rez Molina and Baldetti to trial, was forced to resign following months of attacks. As the anti-corruption judges and investigators have been forced into exile, other high-profile cases against politicians accused of corruption have been dismissed. \u201cThere is a consolidation of a system of impunity,\u201d said M\u00e9ndez. \u201cThe consolidation of an authoritarian system and the most serious and highest expression of the lack of judicial independence that occurs today in Guatemala.\u201d But Wednesday\u2019s decision was a powerful endorsement of the work done by investigators who collaborated with the Cicig at a time when there have been attempts to discredit their work. \u201cIt is a vindication of the work carried out by [those who worked with] Cicig and the public prosecutor\u2019s office,\u201d said Juan Francisco Sandoval. \u201c[It is] an emblem for the people of Guatemala.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-12-09T12:17:06Z",
            "content": "Farmers are ripping up orchards because they are unable to afford to keep them, the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) has said, in a major blow for biodiversity. The increasing cost of labour and spiralling energy costs have meant fruit growers are removing trees from their land, Minette Batters said. \u201cThis year there was a massive contraction for people not wanting to plant the orchards and ripping out old orchards because we wasted \u00a360m worth of profit last year in the first six months of this year,\u201d she said at a food security event this week. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to have a major reset if we are going to continue to grow this incredibly important sector and we\u2019re not going to have food shortages off the back of it.\u201d Orchards are now a very rare habitat in Britain, replaced by farms and urban development. England and Wales have lost 56% of their orchards since 1900. Traditional orchards have been hit particularly hard with a decline of 81%, equivalent to an area almost the size of the West Midlands. As habitats they offer huge benefits for carbon sequestration and wildlife, particularly pollinators and birds. Batters said the loss of the fruit trees was disastrous for biodiversity. \u201cWe want to see more orchards, but if you are there with an orchard that you haven\u2019t been able to harvest the apples from, what are you meant to do? \u201cWe should be really really encouraging buying British apples and pears and growing more of it here. Why would we not?\u201d Some farmers are keeping fruit trees on their land even if there is no immediate profit to be gained from them, because they improve biodiversity, carbon sequestration and soil health on their farms. Martin Lines, the chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said farmers should not be ripping out old trees if they could avoid it. \u201cIt\u2019s important for biodiversity, but also the apples and pears we could use in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe seed bank is really important, keeping older cultivars which could end up being more resilient as we face climate change, and if we rip out old orchards we risk losing that.\u201d Experts say the government should be compensating farmers for keeping their old orchards. Andrew Allen, the policy lead for land use at the Woodland Trust, said: \u201cWe need to manage land better for nature, combining it with productive farming. Traditional orchards are a particularly important example of this, offering a mosaic of trees, grasses, shrubs and wildflowers which make them ideal for wildlife. \u201cHalting the long-term decline in the number of traditional orchards is a litmus test of the government\u2019s new [environmental land management] ELM scheme. It should not only discourage farmers from ploughing up traditional orchards but actively reward them for good management that benefits nature.\u201d Lines added: \u201cFarmers need to see the economic benefit of keeping those trees. If they are facing soaring labour costs, energy costs, it is very difficult to keep them. Government needs to incentivise farmers to keep their orchards in these hard times or they will be lost. \u201cFarmers are currently making business choices. Because of the uncertainty within the marketplace and the supply chain, they are intensifying their farming system to get as much commodity out of the production. And I think that will lead into a continual decline in biodiversity.\u201d Mark Tufnell, the president of the Country Land and Business Association, said: \u201cThere ought to be continued support of orchards. Greater certainty would help enormously, the difficulty of this whole transition is that it is taking a very long time to do it. If there is an opportunity for someone to have some government support for helping the biodiversity in their traditional orchard then they should know about it sooner rather than later.\u201d Jake Fiennes, who manages the nature-friendly farming at Holkham nature reserve in Norfolk, argues that farmers who are unable to afford to pick the apples from their orchards should be paid to leave them to grow wild rather than uproot them. He said: \u201cA species of bird that has been in significant decline is the lesser spotted woodpecker. It has seen catastrophic declines over the last few decades. It is our smallest woodpecker, and it requires low intervention woodland. In abandoned orchards we are seeing increasing numbers of lesser spotted woodpeckers as there is no intervention, they have made a home there. \u201cOrchards, because they are full of flowers, they blossom, they have a range of biodiversity underneath them. When they are abandoned they become full of species. We need to figure out how land managers get value for those abandoned orchards.\u201d"
