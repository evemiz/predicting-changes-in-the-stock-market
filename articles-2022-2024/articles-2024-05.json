            "date": "2024-05-06T16:25:09Z",
            "content": "Milwaukee will replace its top election official with just under six months until the presidential election, the city\u2019s mayor announced on Monday. Mayor Cavalier Johnson appointed Paulina Guti\u00e9rrez to take over as executive director of the Milwaukee election commission, replacing Claire Woodall who had served as the director since July 2020. The change, first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, means there will be a new head of elections in one of the most critical cities in a key battleground state. Milwaukee is the most populous city in Wisconsin and one of the places Donald Trump targeted as part of his efforts to overturn the election. Woodall did not immediately return a request for comment. Guti\u00e9rrez \u201cwill lead the office at an important juncture when public scrutiny of the work of the department will be extremely high\u201d, Johnson said in a statement. \u201cI have confidence in her, and I will make certain the department has the resources it needs to fulfill its duties.\u201d It was not immediately clear why Johnson chose to replace Woodall. There were reports on Monday that it was connected to her decision to publicly criticize election employees after the office mistakenly sent the wrong ballots to voters in the spring. Ahead of the April 2 Wisconsin presidential primary, more than 200 voters in Milwaukee were mailed ballots marked for the wrong district \u2013 an error that Woodall attributed in strong terms to the staff of her office. \u201cI can\u2019t express how frustrating and infuriating it is that it just seems like there was no critical thinking involved or communication,\u201d she told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. Like many election officials, Woodall drew the intense scrutiny of election-denying activists in the wake of the 2020 presidential election and faced harassment and threats in the following months. To pre-empt doubts and conspiracy theories ahead of the 2024 election, Woodall\u2019s office developed new protocols to ensure transparency while transmitting the tally of absentee ballots. The office has also faced internal tumult since 2020. A former official in the Milwaukee election office, Kimberly Zapata, was convicted of fraud for ordering multiple fake absentee ballots in 2022 and sentenced to a $3,000 fine and a year of probation earlier this month. It is not clear if there was any connection between the scandal and Woodall\u2019s replacement. The 2020 election was Woodall\u2019s first time running a presidential election in Milwaukee, and this year\u2019s presidential election will be a first for her replacement, Guti\u00e9rrez, who was appointed deputy director in early 2023. \u201cChange, especially when it is unexpected, can often be unsettling,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez wrote in a Sunday email that was reported by the Journal-Sentinel. \u201cThe experience of changing leadership is demanding and uncertain as we navigate uncharted waters and relearn to collaborate and communicate as an organization.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-26T16:34:54Z",
            "content": "The end of official mourning for Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi has unleashed a battle for succession in which as many as 20 credible names have been proposed. All candidates have to be cleared by the 12-strong elite body known as the Guardian Council, and the regime is torn between ensuring continuity on the one hand and on the other, allowing an open competition that stimulates turnout and gives the victor legitimacy. The election on 28 June, triggered by Raisi\u2019s death in a helicopter accident last Sunday, has the potential to expose political divisions within the regime, something that the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will seek to avoid in the search for predictability and stability. Although the elections are about personalities, backroom deals and relationship to the supreme leader, ideology plays a role. Saeed Jalili, twice a candidate for the presidency although he withdrew in favour of Raisi four years ago, announced on Sunday that he would stand. A hardliner, he has spent most of his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and was Iran\u2019s main nuclear negotiator between 2007 and 2013. This weekend, former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appeared outside his house surrounded by supporters saying he was considering his options, but his populist unpredictability means he is unlikely to be cleared to stand. Alireza Zakani, the mayor of Tehran and similar in outlook to Jalili, said he has made no decision, but sources said he was preparing a campaign team. The traditional conservative candidates are seen as either Parviz Fattah, the former head of the Mostazafan Foundation, a massive business conglomerate, or Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the parliament speaker between 2020 and 2024. Since reformists are largely marginalised from parliament, the divisions are more apparent between the traditionalists and the Paydari Front, the anti-western Shia supremacists who oppose any kind of compromise \u2013 including on the nuclear deal. Registration for the presidency lasts for four days, starting this Thursday. On the basis of precedent, as many as 10 candidates can be permitted to join the first round, although only four actually stood in 2021. Doubt still persists as to whether Ali Larijani, a speaker of the parliament for 12 years and experienced centrist, will seek to stand, or be permitted to do so. He denied reports that he was entering the race, saying any decision would be conveyed through his official channels. Permission to let him run this time would be a sign that the regime recognises the need for the president to have a genuine mandate. He has the support of the previous president, Hassan Rouhani. But some Iranian media are predicting that if the race becomes unpredictable, the stolid vice-president and current interim president, Muhammad Mokhber, may be asked to stand and take the job for five years. His business dealings, including handling much of the supreme leader\u2019s own affairs, make him a trusted figure even though the shadow of corruption and his introduction of ineffective Covid vaccines will hardly endear him to the average Iranian. Parviz Fattah, the head of the Execution of Imam Khomeini\u2019s Order (EIKO), a huge economic conglomerate under Khamenei\u2019s control, is also tipped to run. In a sign of the mood inside parliament, Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, sanctioned by the EU and a strong advocate of stricter enforcement of the hijab, was elected as the interim leader of the largest faction in parliament. As head of Tehran\u2019s revolutionary court, he played a role in the jailing of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national. Three European powers are deciding whether to table a motion at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of governors, starting on 3 June, over Iran\u2019s failure to accept IAEA requests to improve access to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. The IAEA director-general, Rafael Grossi, is trying to negotiate improved access, but progress has been slowed by Raisi\u2019s death. In a sign of the importance of the issue, Ali Shamkhani, the political adviser to the supreme leader and the former secretary of the supreme national security council, has been appointed to head the nuclear negotiations. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 May 2024. The date of the presidential election is 28 June, not 21 July as stated in an earlier version."

            "date": "2024-05-13T02:36:16Z",
            "content": "Lithuania\u2019s president, Gitanas Naus\u0117da, appears on course for a second term after a first round of voting, following a campaign dominated by the war in Ukraine and fears over neighbouring Russia. Naus\u0117da won 44% of votes cast in Sunday\u2019s election, electoral commission data showed, while prime minister Ingrida \u0160imonyt\u0117 won 20%. As no candidate won more than 50% the pair will head to a run-off election on 26 May. Speaking to reporters after voting ended, Naus\u0117da pledged to keep up pressure on the country\u2019s western allies for increased military support for Ukraine. \u201cUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy already said it all. They don\u2019t need our declarations of good will, they are of no use in a fight \u2013 they need air defences \u2026 Until they have air defences, Ukraine will stay vulnerable,\u201d he said. The 59-year-old former banker said he was confident of victory in the second round and would require \u201cno strategy\u201d to campaign against \u0160imonyt\u0117. \u0160imonyt\u0117, the current prime minister and the only woman among the seven candidates who ran, is a 49-year-old fiscal conservative with liberal views on social issues. Naus\u0117da\u2019s campaign focused on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and its impact on Lithuania\u2019s national security, including the prospect of a potential act of aggression by Russia on Lithuanian territory. Just over half of Lithuanians believe a Russian attack is possible or very likely, an Elta/Baltijos Tyrimai poll has found; this is a common feeling across the Baltics. Last week the country\u2019s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, raised the prospect of an ad hoc coalition of western countries sending military training personnel into Ukraine backed by ground-based air defence, lending support to ideas mooted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Most of the candidates running in Sunday\u2019s election, including \u0160imonyt\u0117 and Naus\u0117da, told the national broadcaster they kept food stockpiles at home ready in case of a military conflict. \u201cI am doing all I can to make sure it will not be needed,\u201d Naus\u0117da said during a televised debate. Naus\u0117da and \u0160imonyt\u0117 support increasing defence spending to at least 3% of Lithuania\u2019s GDP, higher than the expected 2024 average in the EU of 2%, and a fraction of the estimated 30% of GDP the Kremlin is putting in Russia\u2019s war economy. The Baltic states feel exceptionally vulnerable to the threat from Russia, with the first of 4,800 German troops arriving last month as part of a Nato plan to strengthen security between now and 2027. European leaders believe that even if a peace deal were struck in Ukraine, Putin would regroup with the aim of launching further incursions in the next decade. The aim is to pay for the modernisation of Lithuania\u2019s army and infrastructure to support a brigade of German troops \u2013 and their families \u2013 that will be deployed in Lithuania and combat-ready from 2027. While agreeing on Russia policy, the two top candidates in the election differ on issues such as same-sex civil partnerships, which Naus\u0117da opposes, and have a history of acrimonious bickering and refusing to speak to each other. Lithuania\u2019s president has a semi-executive role, which includes heading the armed forces and chairing the supreme defence and national security policy body, and representing the country at EU and Nato summits.

            "date": "2024-05-15T17:24:45Z",
            "content": "Hello! Welcome back to our new US elections newsletter. Non-Trump supporters have been all jittery this week, after a poll appeared to show Joe Biden getting royally stuffed by Trump in the election. The poll had Trump leading Biden in six of the seven states that are key to becoming president. It might seem scary, yes, but it\u2019s too soon to be completely terrified: we\u2019ll look at why in a little bit. First, some of the happenings in US politics. Here\u2019s what you need to know \u2026 1. Trump is (still) in court Summer is almost here in New York. The bees are out, the birds are singing. And Michael Cohen is singing, too! Cohen, who spent a decade as Trump\u2019s lawyer and hatchet man, has been telling a Manhattan court how he paid Stormy Daniels, an adult film actor, to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen said he did so at the direction of Trump, to help his chances of winning the 2016 election. That\u2019s a crime, which wouldn\u2019t bode well for Trump\u2019s re-election chances. 2. Mixed primary results for Republicans Barring the unprecedented, Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be the Democratic and Republican candidates in November \u2013 but the presidential primaries are still going on, and sometimes they tell us interesting things. Like in Maryland and Nebraska, for example, where on Tuesday about 20% of Republicans voted for Nikki Haley \u2013 who dropped out of the presidential race in March \u2013 over Trump. It suggests the former-president has some wooing to do to win over Republicans. 3. Will tariffs excite voters? Tariffs are not the sexiest thing a president can announce. But Biden will be hoping they have some impact, after he increased tariffs \u2013 essentially the amount of taxes a country has to pay to sell its goods \u2013 on a number of Chinese imports. The new tariffs affect steel and aluminium, which are traditionally important products in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan. He also jacked up tariffs on electric vehicles, in a move the White House says will protect jobs. Don\u2019t panic \u2026 at least not yet Monday mornings are rarely enjoyable, but for people concerned about a second Trump term, this week\u2019s was worse than usual. \u201cTrump Leads in 5 Key States,\u201d blared a New York Times headline, \u201cAs Young and Nonwhite Voters Express Discontent With Biden.\u201d This newsletter isn\u2019t usually about polling and numbers and abacuses: it\u2019s called the Stakes, not the Odds. But bear with me, because it is worth taking a look at the New York Times/Siena College poll that prompted that headline \u2013 and hundreds of scary follow-up stories by other media outlets. The newspaper knocked up a graphic that shows Biden down in Nevada by 12 points; in Georgia by 10 points; and by seven points in both Arizona and Michigan. Biden was also behind in Pennsylvania, but had a small lead in Wisconsin. Most states vote very predictably: New York has been Democratic for ages; Alabama, Republican. But these five are swing states \u2013 ones that Biden and Trump both have a shot at winning. Each candidate would need to win some combination of swing states to take the White House. Not very good for Democrats, eh? But how much should they really be worried? Maybe not as much as you may think. For one thing, those terrifying numbers were a result of asking registered voters how they planned to vote. But not every registered voter actually votes: some aren\u2019t excited about the candidates, others just can\u2019t be bothered. In 2020, 168 million people were registered to vote. Only 158m actually did. This is important because when the New York Times questioned people who said they were likely to vote \u2013 not just registered \u2013 the results became much closer. Among these people who are planning to vote, Biden is actually slightly ahead in Michigan (as opposed to being seven points behind). He is still slightly behind in Pennsylvania, and one point behind in Wisconsin, but well within the margin of error. (That\u2019s another thing: these polls are only accurate to within plus or minus 3.5%.) So in Michigan, in Pennsylvania \u2013 where Biden grew up \u2013 and in Wisconsin, the race is essentially too close to call. And that\u2019s important, because if Biden can win these three states, that should be enough to get him re-elected. In the 2016 presidential election, a lot of journalists and news outlets convinced themselves Trump was going to lose in large part from looking at polls. Of course, everyone got it wrong. That prompted all sorts of hand-wringing among the press. In the future, there would be less focus on single polls. Everyone would report on issues instead. As is often the case with the (pretty self-serious) American media, noble think pieces were written, apologies were issued. Yet it feels like we\u2019re back at it again: one poll, being reported on, again and again, scaring the hell out of everybody. I have nothing against polls. I listen to the FiveThirtyEight podcast, which bases its political analysis almost exclusively on polling. They can also tell us useful things about how different people feel \u2013 for example, that young people are less enthusiastic about Biden than they were in 2020, while some Black voters also appear to be drifting away from the president. But as Leah Askarinam, a reporter at AP, told that podcast this week: \u201cThese are helpful numbers. [But] it is six months away from the election.\u201d Askarinam added: \u201cThese polls are not telling us who is winning and who is losing right now.\u201d So nobody should get all in a tizzy just yet. \u2018It\u2019s a stupid request\u2019 Michael Cohen is the key witness in Trump\u2019s ongoing criminal trial, but not everyone will know who he is. Well, Cohen worked for Trump from 2006 to 2018 as his personal attorney \u2013 but Cohen was really Trump\u2019s attack dog: charged with going after anyone who upset his boss. Cohen was known to a lot of reporters as a shouty, sweary menace, and I thought it was worth sharing with you my own brush with him, in 2012. Trump \u2013 at that time, just a loudmouth reality TV star \u2013 had demanded that Barack Obama publish his passport records, claiming Obama had not been born in the US. I thought it would be amusing to call Trump Tower and ask whether Trump would publish his own records. I got Cohen, who found it less amusing, and quickly became upset. He accused me of \u201ctrying to be funny\u201d (fair), called my request \u201cstupid\u201d (bit mean), said Trump would release his passport records if I sent him mine (!), asked me to donate $5m to charity (!!), then hung up on me. I never did get Trump\u2019s passport records, and I never heard from Cohen again, but happily, I recorded our conversation. Who had the worst week? Rudy Giuliani. The man who led New York through the 9/11 attacks, then went from America\u2019s mayor to America\u2019s weirdo in what felt like the blink of an eye, Giuliani lost what was left of his reputation during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 particularly through a doomed attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which reached its nadir when he hosted a press conference at a landscaping business located between a crematorium and sex shop. Things have gone from bad to worse since then. In December last year, Giuliani was ordered to pay $148.1m to two election workers after he lied about them. Then he filed for bankruptcy. This week, his radio show was canceled because he wouldn\u2019t stop lying about the 2020 election. He\u2019s also having to sell his apartment. Born to lie Donald Trump wishes he was the Boss \u2013 or at least that he drew the same crowds and loyalty in New Jersey. At a rally over the weekend, Trump claimed to have a \u201cmuch bigger crowd\u201d than Bruce Springsteen. The city of Wildwood estimated Trump\u2019s attendance at 80,000. Trump claimed 100,000. But the city previously said the event\u2019s capacity was just 20,000. Radio station New Jersey 101.5 reported that the city and Trump\u2019s claims of crowd size are \u201cwildly overestimated\u201d. Meanwhile, according to the local Asbury Park Press, Springsteen drew about 180,000 people across three shows the last time he played a stadium in his home state. Springsteen has called the former president\u2019s time in office \u201ca fucking nightmare\u201d and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016. - Rachel Leingang, misinformation reporter Elsewhere in US politics \u2022 \u201cA split has emerged in the Never Trump movement in the Republican party,\u201d says David Smith, with some of the Trump-averse Republicans no longer bold or brave enough to not vote for the former president. \u2022 Blue-collar voters have lined up increasingly behind Trump, Steven Greenhouse writes, but experts say Biden can win them back. \u2022 Republicans could flip a Senate seat in Maryland in November, which would not be good news for Democrats, explains Joan E Greve.

            "title": "What happens if a US presidential candidate dies?",
            "date": "2024-05-05T16:00:14Z",
            "content": "Americans are bracing for a rare presidential rematch between the two oldest candidates in US history: the 81-year-old president Joe Biden and the 77-year-old former president Donald Trump. Concerns about their age, mental fitness and the possibility that Trump could be convicted of a felony and sentenced to prison time before election day have raised questions about what would happen in the extraordinary event that one of them dies, becomes incapacitated or abruptly withdraws. If Biden, as the sitting president, were to die the vice-president, Kamala Harris, would assume the powers of the presidency under the 25th amendment. But replacing Biden or Trump as their party\u2019s presumptive nominees for president \u2013 a prospect that is entirely hypothetical \u2013 is more complicated. In the event of an unforeseen vacancy, party rules, state and federal election laws and the US constitution would guide what would undoubtedly be a messy process. What happens if Biden or Trump needs to be replaced? The answer, experts say, depends largely on when the vacancy arises. Is it after the party\u2019s nominating convention? Before election day? What if the winning candidate is no longer able to take the oath of office? The timing matters. If the unexpected occurs, the job of replacing the presidential candidate would fall to \u201c10,000 people who no one has ever heard of\u201d, according to Elaine Kamarck, a member of the Democratic National Committee rules committee and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Collectively they represent convention delegates, members of the parties\u2019 national committees, the 538 members of the electoral college and the 435 members of the House of Representatives. Each plays a relevant role at different stages of the election process. What if it happens before a party\u2019s convention? Biden and Trump have secured enough delegates to be their parties\u2019 nominee in mid-March, but neither will be formally selected until the conventions this summer. The Republican national convention will take place in Milwaukee in mid-July. The Democratic convention will take place a month later in Chicago. Before then, state parties will continue to hold primaries, caucuses and conventions, electing delegates to send to conventions. If Biden or Trump were to withdraw or die before being formally nominated, their delegates would arrive at the convention in Milwaukee or Chicago largely uncommitted. A replacement nominee would then probably be chosen at the convention in a messy floor fight. Imagine frantic horse-trading, back-room dealing and public speech-making. Democrats also have a system of \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2013 unpledged senior party officials and elected leaders whose support is limited on the first ballot but who could play a decisive role in subsequent rounds. Would the running mate automatically move to the top of the ticket? The short answer is no. Neither Harris, nor Trump\u2019s eventual vice-presidential pick, would automatically become the nominee, according to DNC and RNC rules. But delegates tend to be people with a degree of loyalty to the candidate or party. So in all likelihood, the running mate would emerge as a strong contender for the nomination. Presumably a Biden delegate would be open to supporting Harris, who, in the event Biden has died or fallen critically ill, would already be serving as president. Nevertheless, if a vacancy emerges, it is possible alternative candidates would step forward \u2013 imagine the California governor, Gavin Newsom, or his Michigan counterpart, Gretchen Whitmer. On the Republican side, Trump has yet to choose a running mate. The runner-up for the Republican nomination, Nikki Haley, proved deeply unpopular with the party\u2019s base and could struggle to win over Trump\u2019s delegates if he were not the nominee. Has this happened before? Many Americans will have no memory of the 1968 Democratic primary, when President Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek re-election after only narrowly winning the party\u2019s New Hampshire primary contest in March. Weeks prior, Senator Robert F Kennedy had launched his campaign for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. He was assassinated in June, after winning the California primary. Johnson\u2019s vice-president, Hubert Humphrey, eventually accumulated enough delegates through the support of party insiders to win the Democratic nomination. But the convention that year was so disastrous for the party, which went on to lose the presidential election, it prompted an overhaul of the entire primary system, resulting in the contest-driven nominating process in place today. What if a vacancy arises after the convention but before election day? Here again the political parties would play a central role. The Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee have slightly different rules guiding how they would replace the deceased presidential nominee by majority vote. According to party rules, the DNC has the power to fill the vacancy on their party ticket after the chair consults Democratic governors and congressional leaders. The RNC, according to its rules, could reconvene a national convention or select the alternative candidate itself. For simplicity, the parties would probably consider the running mate, but there is no guarantee. If there were enough time, the replacement candidate might appear on the ballot. But states have different ballot filing deadlines and several states begin mailing their ballots as early as September. In states where ballots have already been printed or mailed, the party could instruct voters \u2013 and electors \u2013 to treat the names at the top of the ticket \u201cas hieroglyphics\u201d, said Derek Muller, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cIf it says Biden-Harris, you should interpret that as Harris-Booker,\u201d he said, offering the hypothetical example of an alternative Democratic ticket with the New Jersey senator Cory Booker as Harris\u2019s running mate. Has this ever happened before? No. But there are some examples of how this might play out. In 1972, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Senator Thomas Eagleton, was forced to withdraw from the ticket after the convention following reports that had been treated for mental illness. The Democratic National Committee convened a meeting in Washington to select Eagleton\u2019s replacement, Sargent Shriver. Experts also point to 2000, when the Democratic candidate for a Senate seat in Missouri, the state\u2019s governor, Mel Carnahan, died weeks before the election. The state\u2019s lieutenant governor, a Democrat who ascended to the governorship, committed to appointing Carnahan\u2019s wife, Jean, to the seat if he won posthumously, which he did. She was then appointed to fill her late husband\u2019s seat. \u201cThe electorate can learn about these things if given the cues to do so,\u201d Muller said. Could Congress delay the election? It is possible but improbable. The date of the election is set by federal law, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, which is 5 November. Both chambers of Congress would have to approve a measure delaying the election, and the president would have to sign it, unlikely in a divided government. Even if it were to happen, Congress could only push the election by a matter of weeks because the constitution states that a president\u2019s term \u201cshall end at noon on the 20th day of January\u201d. What happens if the candidate is incapacitated, not dead? Timing would still matter. The rules and laws would still apply. But the scenario takes on a new degree of complexity. \u201cAll of these questions become much more complicated in situations where you have a disability or you\u2019re physically unable to take the oath,\u201d Muller said. \u201cThere are just more contingencies in place that you don\u2019t have when it comes to death.\u201d What if the winning candidate dies after election day? It is important to remember how the presidential election process works. To win the White House, a candidate must accumulate a majority of electors \u2013 270 \u2013 in the electoral college. In each state, political parties choose slates of electors and voters cast their ballot for a party\u2019s electors. \u201cWhen you vote for president, you\u2019re actually not voting for Joe Biden or Donald Trump,\u201d Kamarck said. \u201cYou are voting for a slate of electors who have been chosen in that state as part of the electoral college.\u201d After the election, the winning presidential candidate\u2019s slate of electors, generally party loyalists vetted by local party leaders for the role, meet in their states to cast their votes for president and vice-president. This year, that occurs on 17 December. Some states \u201cbind\u201d electors to vote for the winner of the election in their state, laws that were upheld by the supreme court in a 2020 ruling, but other states allow electors more independence to cast \u201cfaithless votes\u201d. The supreme court justice Elena Kagan added in a footnote that \u201cnothing in this opinion should be taken to permit the states to bind electors to a deceased candidate\u201d. If the electors haven\u2019t met when the vacancy occurs, they would be strongly incentivized to coalesce around a replacement candidate designated by the party. The running mate would be an obvious choice, but, again, not the required one. The electors could also decide to back the deceased candidate and under the 20th amendment the vice-president-elect would become the president-elect. More on this later. What happens if the winning candidate dies before Congress declares a winner? A newly elected Congress will meet on 6 January to certify the results of the presidential election by counting the electoral votes. Traditionally this has been a ceremonial affair. But in 2020, a violent mob of Trump supporters overran the US Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s victory. In this polarized and charged environment, there are concerns about how elected officials in Congress would handle a situation in which the winner of the electoral college vote cannot assume the presidency. Reforms made after the 6 January insurrection on the Capitol made it harder for members of Congress to object to the counting of certain electoral votes, a partisan practice. But Congress would be operating in uncharted territory. Is there a precedent? No. No winning presidential candidate has died in the period between election day at the start of November and the inauguration on 20 January. But there is one example of a losing presidential candidate dying after election day. In 1872, the Democratic presidential candidate Horace Greeley died after losing the election to Ulysses S Grant but before the casting of the electoral college votes. Although his death did not affect the outcome, there was a debate over what to do with the 66 electoral college votes he had won. Most electors chose to cast their votes for another candidate and Congress chose not to count the three votes cast for the deceased Greeley. Some experts say Congress\u2019s decision not to count the votes should not necessarily be taken as precedent, especially because it occurred before the 20th amendment was ratified. Others argue that members of Congress might have decided the matter differently if the votes would have affected the outcome. So what does the 20th amendment say? Section 3 of the 20th amendment states: \u201cIf, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President elect shall have died, the Vice-President elect shall become President.\u201d But there is some debate over when a winning candidate becomes president-elect. Is it after the electors vote on 17 December or not until a joint session of Congress counts the electoral votes on 6 January? \u201cThe balance of scholarly opinion holds that the president- and vice-president-elect are chosen once the electoral votes are cast,\u201d according to a 2020 Congressional Research Service memo. But the law itself leaves some ambiguity. How will it look to voters? Amazingly, these are only some of the hypothetical scenarios that could unfold. If the unexpected occurs, parties will jockey for political advantage and bad actors would probably try to seize on the chaos. This will be especially true in the event the election results are contested, as Trump is laying the groundwork to do, or in the \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d neither candidate earns 270 electoral votes. With the election expected to be narrowly decided, there is no doubt an unexpected vacancy would jolt a system already rattled by an onslaught of spurious claims and political misinformation. Holly Idelson, a policy advocate with the non-partisan group Protect Democracy, said education and public awareness will be critical to defuse the potential for a \u201ccrisis atmosphere\u201d in the circumstance of a presidential candidate\u2019s death or withdrawal. \u201cYes, there are unprecedented scenarios that could arise, and yes, there may be genuine questions about how to apply the law, but in many cases there is law to apply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should focus our efforts on promoting regular order rather than undue alarm.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 May 2024 to correct the number of electoral college members to 538; a previous version incorrectly said there were only 535 members. Also, text was revised to clarify the provisions of the 25th amendment."

            "content": "At the start of a long weekend of election results, the first outcomes have been every bit as dire for the Conservatives and Rishi Sunak as analysts had predicted. Here is the state of play. Labour wins mayoralty covering PM\u2019s constituency Labour\u2019s David Skaith has won the first York and North Yorkshire mayoral race, an area that includes Rishi Sunak\u2019s constituency of Richmond. Skaith won with 35.1% of the vote \u2013 beating the Tory candidate, Keane Duncan, by almost 15,000 votes. Duncan came second with 27.3% of the vote. Reform UK did not put up a candidate. Keir Starmer said the result was a \u201chistoric victory\u201d for Labour in \u201cthe heart of Tory territory\u201d. Tory Ben Houchen re-elected as Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen has won the Tees Valley mayoral election, offering the Conservatives a rare bright spot in an otherwise gloomy election. Houchen, the incumbent, won 81,930 votes (53.6%) against 63,141 (41.3%) for Labour\u2019s Chris McEwan and 7,679 (5%) for the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Simon Thorley. The turnout was 30%. Labour secured a swing of 16.5 percentage points from the 2021 vote, and the party pointed out this was greater than the 12-point switch it would need to sweep the Tees Valley constituencies in a general election. Labour\u2019s Claire Ward becomes first East Midlands mayor Claire Ward has been elected the first mayor of the East Midlands, beating the Conservative Ben Bradley by more than 50,000 votes. The former Watford MP had 181,040 votes (40.27%), with Bradley, who is MP for Mansfield and leader of Nottinghamshire county council, on 129,332. A Labour source described the region as \u201cthe beating heart of the general election battleground\u201d, suggesting the party\u2019s win there is one of the biggest signs yet it could be on track for national victory. Labour\u2019s McGuinness beats Driscoll for North East mayoralty Labour\u2019s Kim McGuinness has won the NorthEast mayoralty, defeating the formerly of Labour-turned-independent Jamie Driscoll. McGuinness won 185,051 votes (41.3%) to Driscoll\u2019s 126,652 (28.2%). Driscoll resigned from Labour after being blocked from standing for the post after he appeared on stage with the veteran leftwing film-maker Ken Loach. Labour has won the Blackpool South byelection with a 26-point swing The \u201cred wall\u201d seat was retaken by Labour after the third largest ever Tory-to-Labour swing. Almost as ominously for the Conservatives, they managed to beat Reform UK by only 117 votes. Keir Starmer described this as a \u201cseismic win\u201d and a \u201ctruly historic result\u201d. The byelection was triggered after Scott Benton stood down in March over a lobbying scandal. The Conservative party is on course to lose up to 500 council seats The Conservatives have already shed more than 450 council seats on a night of heavy losses for the party. The political scientist Prof Sir John Curtice said the party was \u201cbasically losing half the seats they\u2019re trying to defend\u201d. If that continued, he added, they could end up losing about 500 seats. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said the party seemed to be on course for \u201cone of the worst, if not the worst, Conservative performance in local government elections for the last 40 years\u201d. Sunak \u2018completely focused on the job\u2019 In his first comment on the results, Sunak said: \u201cIt is disappointing to lose good hardworking Conservative councillors,\u201d adding: \u201cI\u2019m focused completely on the job at hand. That\u2019s delivering for people across the country.\u201d Richard Holden, the Conservative party chair, said that although the results had not been great for the Tories, there was no chance of Sunak being replaced. Speaking to Times Radio, he said: \u201cThe prime minister is going to go on and lead the Conservative party into the general election, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d Asked for his response to the results so far, Holden said: \u201cNot a great set of results but coming off, I think it would be fair to say, a very high watermark in 2021.\u201d Andrea Jenkyns, one of two Tory MPs who have publicly said Sunak should be replaced, has accepted that a confidence vote in him is now unlikely. A ConservativeHome poll found that 63% of Tory members did not think Sunak should resign. Greens dominate Bristol The Green party fell narrowly short of an overall majority in Bristol, but the party is celebrating a thumping victory over Labour, taking 34 of the 70 seats and leaving Starmer\u2019s party trailing a distant second with 21, after losing two. Party officials said they believed they were on track to finish with more than 800 members on more than 170 councils, and they have councillors for the first time in Newcastle, Sefton, Redditch and Bolton. The Lib Dems won eight seats in Bristol after gaining three and the Conservatives won seven after losing seven. Labour has gained control of eight councils The Labour party has gained more than 160 councillors, and taken Rushmoor and Redditch from the Conservatives. It has also taken Norwich, Hartlepool and Thurrock, all from no overall control. The Conservatives have lost control of 10 councils. The full results are available here. Labour has lost control of Oldham council Gains by independents meant Labour lost its small majority on Oldham council, in an area with a large Muslim population. Arooj Shah, the Labour leader of Oldham council, rejected suggestions that Starmer\u2019s response to the Israel-Gaza war was to blame. Shah said there had been \u201cdivisive, toxic politics\u201d in Oldham for the last five years and problems in the town were ultimately linked to Tory austerity. The Liberal Democrats have gained seats and two councils The Lib Dems have reached 500 seats, ahead of the Tories who have at least 460. The party retained control of Winchester after winning eight of the first 10 seats to declare. Daisy Cooper, the party\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats are on the up with gaining councillors across the country, from Hampshire to Stockport. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 winning streak continues and we are ready to beat Conservative MPs and finally get this chaotic government out of office.\u201d Liberal Democrats gained overall control of Tunbridge Wells as the Conservatives lost four seats in their former stronghold. Sir Ed Davey campaigned in the area and his party now has 22 of the 39 seats, with Conservatives on seven, and Labour and independents five each. The Liberal Democrats took Dorset from the Conservatives after gaining 15 seats. The party now has 42 of the 82 seats on the council, with Conservatives on 30 after losing 13. There are four independents, four Greens and two Labour councillors. Dorset is the first Lib Dem council gain from the Conservatives in this election. Labour has failed to take control of Harlow Harlow, a bellwether seat in the general election, had been targeted by the party in the local election with visits by Starmer and Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, on Wednesday. Starmer said Labour needed to win \u201cin places like Harlow\u201d. The Tories went into the local elections with 21 of the seats on the council, and Labour holding the other 12. The Tories now have 17 seats and Labour 16. Electoral Commission says \u2018no major problems\u2019 with voter ID Unlike Boris Johnson, the vast majority of voters turned up to vote with the required photo ID. Vijay Rangarajan, the chief executive of the Electoral Commission, claimed the new requirement did not create \u201cany major problems\u201d. He said: \u201cA few people turned up without it. They went home and got it, much like Mr Johnson did. An awful lot of people had brought it. We think the campaigns that we and many others have done to raise awareness had worked.\u201d"

            "content": "With just two days to go before a knife-edge election in Rishi Sunak\u2019s own back yard, it was the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, campaigning in North Yorkshire, where Labour is expected to win the mayoralty. The prime minister wasn\u2019t even elsewhere on the campaign trail, but in London, speaking to editors at a media freedom event. It is a stark contrast to the last time these seats in the local elections were in the spotlight. Boris Johnson named the day \u201cSuper Thursday\u201d and was a looming presence on the campaign at the height of the Conservatives\u2019 vaccine bounce, especially at the Hartlepool byelection, which the Tories won from Labour. This time there is a likely to be catastrophic defeat to Labour in Blackpool South, where Reform UK is hoping to beat the Tories into third place. It hardly matters because the presence of Sunak or otherwise is not the deciding factor in any of these local election races \u2013 although the Tories\u2019 best hopes, Andy Street and Ben Houchen, have been keeping any mention of Westminster politics well away from their election leaflets. But it is this lack of campaigning nous \u2013 a toe-curling ability to say the wrong thing, the nervous laugh when confronted \u2013 that is being talked about by Conservative MPs as a key argument for changing leader if the results over the weekend are even more disastrous than anticipated. Sunak\u2019s personal ratings are low but several Tory MPs who have been campaigning in recent weeks have said they did not detect a visceral dislike of the prime minister personally. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of dismissiveness, out-of-touch stuff,\u201d one MP campaigning in the West Midlands said. \u201cIt\u2019s the perception he gets a helicopter everywhere.\u201d The argument for making a change to a leader such as Penny Mordaunt would be that she at least may be able to campaign better during the general election. Sunak\u2019s most recent outing at his PM Connect event was not even broadcast live. He has been confronted by a voter on her local hospital, nervously laughing at her complaints and appearing to walk off. He once asked a homeless man: \u201cDo you work in business?\u201d The PM has also been widely mocked for appearing to be unable to use a debit card and for refuelling a borrowed car. Many times No 10 has said the exchanges were taken out of context, but they have defended how often Sunak seems to use a helicopter to travel to events, including to commute to his own constituency. \u201cI just think, we\u2019re going to get something like this every single day of the election campaign unfortunately,\u201d one Tory MP complained. \u201cHe can\u2019t do human, he looks rattled.\u201d Sunak seems to be the only person in Westminster prepared to believe the polls can be wrong, when even the most senior Tory strategists have privately concluded the campaign will be about damage control. The PM told activists in CCHQ this week they would be part of the \u201cgreatest comeback in political history\u201d. But if the aim of the next Tory election campaign will be to save as many seats as possible, then very little else works as an argument to change leader other than Sunak\u2019s cringeworthiness. There are few reasons on policy alone to make the change. Plans by Tory agitators for a 100-day policy blitz reveal just how difficult it is to draw significant differences. The proposals include an increase in defence spending and cutting the benefits bill to reduce payments for anxiety, both of which Sunak has already announced, or vague uncosted pledges to increase prison capacity or to stop his proposed smoking ban. Those who hold the key to Sunak\u2019s future are the Tory MPs with chunky majorities \u2013 perhaps 10,000 or more \u2013 who could win on a good day or lose on a bad one. The issue is that no one really knows what will contribute to a good or bad day for those MPs. Is it a harder line on immigration or culture wars? A more one-nation approach? An early election? A January election? A new leader \u2013 Mordaunt or Robert Jenrick? Those theories have been gamed in every direction \u2013 with no clear answer forthcoming."

            "content": "Rafael Behr: The Tories haven\u2019t yet plummeted to inconceivable depths \u2013 but they\u2019re not far off Looking for a national picture in local council and byelection results always calls to mind the old joke about two drunkards scouring the pavement under a streetlamp. \u201cAre you sure this is where you dropped your keys?\u201d says one. \u201cNo,\u201d says the other, \u201cbut this is where the light is.\u201d In the zone of partial illumination things look bad for the Tories. They have already shed scores of council seats. The loss of Blackpool South, with a 26-point swing to Labour (the third biggest ever), is consistent with a pattern of byelection batterings that has put Keir Starmer on a safe trajectory towards Downing Street. Since there was speculation that the Reform party could come second in Blackpool, the Tories might eke dismal consolation in having avoided third place, but only just \u2013 by 117 votes. Reform\u2019s 17% vote share is its best byelection performance to date but not the upset it was hoping for in a seat that looked hospitable to a hard-right challenger. If Reform doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure to mobilise its potential support on the ground, it will be less of a force in a general election than its media boosters imagine. Perversely, the impact may be felt more in the flight of moderate Tories who tire of Rishi Sunak\u2019s Reform-oriented populist postures. That might be a factor in some remarkable swings away from the Conservatives in places such as Rushmoor in Hampshire, and in the police and crime commissioner ballots in Cumbria and Somerset. There is no method for disentangling motives in an aggregate shift in voting behaviour, although that never stops people trying. Ideologues and partisans will always project their prior beliefs on to any result and see vindication of whatever it was they were calling for before the votes were counted. That is true for Labour\u2019s performance, too. Defenders of Starmer\u2019s strategy will say the results prove his method is working. Critics, especially those who are unhappy with the opposition leader\u2019s stance on the war in Gaza, will point to a few Green gains in Tyneside and Labour underperformance in areas with high Muslim populations (Oldham, for example) as evidence that the party\u2019s left flank has been neglected. Even Sunak loyalists will find wispy straws to clutch at. Ben Houchen holding Tees Valley mayoralty (with much reduced majority), and just about clinging on to Harlow in Essex \u2013 a Labour target. The big metro mayoralties are yet to declare, so there is time for the spotlight to fall on some other part of the electoral terrain. Then some different, similarly incomplete narrative might emerge. To the extent that Conservative HQ can muster hopeful spin, it relies on baked-in assumptions that the party is on course for defeat and that things can only get worse. In that context, the steady continuation of things being very bad indeed, while not plummeting abruptly to inconceivable depths, is tenuously presented as a kind of achievement. But continuity down the road to disaster is not recovery, no matter which way you hold it up to the light. Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist Katy Balls: Sunak may have just enough of a story to hang on to his post There will be relief in Conservative campaign headquarters this lunchtime following the news that Ben Houchen has secured a third term as Tees Valley mayor. This was the contest that even Rishi Sunak\u2019s inner circle believed could spell curtains for the prime minister if Houchen lost. \u201cIt was the nuclear option,\u201d explains a senior Tory. Instead, Houchen \u2013 who has the nickname \u201cpatron saint of the red wall\u201d \u2013 won fairly comfortably, albeit with a reduced vote share. However, he did fire a warning shot, with the metro mayor using his victory interview to suggest the central Tory government needs to give the public a reason to vote for them. That aside, this victory \u2013 along with briefings from Labour sources that they believe the West Midlands Tory mayor, Andy Street, could also hold on (that count is due on Sunday) \u2013 should give Sunak a reasonable defence in the face of disappointing council losses. No 10 believes it ought to be enough to dissuade the Tory party from another bout of regicide. However, this is not to say that Sunak is out of the woods entirely. The silence from many backbenchers since the results started to roll in is telling. Many are keeping their powder dry and want to take the full bank holiday weekend to assess what the results mean. \u201cIt\u2019s the vote swing that will be the problem,\u201d says a Tory MP. \u201cThat\u2019s what tells us if we are going to keep our seats \u2013 and for a lot of us the answer is no.\u201d While any Tory mayoral victory gives Sunak a story to tell, it provides little comfort when it comes to a likely general election result. Both Houchen and Street have run on their personal brands and at times distanced themselves from the Tories in Westminster. While Houchen did have Sunak campaign with him, he is also willing to criticise the Tories when needed. That level of independence is much harder for a Tory MP to replicate in a general election. Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s political editor Nadeine Asbali: Labour\u2019s stance on Gaza cost the party Muslim votes \u2013 and will do so in the future All the Muslims I know have either become apathetic about voting altogether owing to the presumption that all parties are offering the same thing, or they have backed the Green party or independent candidates for the first time \u2013 in some cases because their position on Gaza was stronger, and in others simply to punish Labour for its own stance. It\u2019s difficult to grapple with the idea that withdrawing my vote from Labour could bolster the Tories. But ultimately, for many, the \u201clesser of two evils argument\u201d no longer stands, and it has become entirely unthinkable to lend a vote to Labour. Despite the fact that Labour may be on course for a landslide general election victory, it needs to face accountability over Gaza, and seeing its Muslim vote drop will force it to consider that. These local losses in Oldham and the West Midlands should act as a warning. On a personal \u2013 even moral \u2013 level, I simply couldn\u2019t put an X next to the name of any candidate who remains part of a party whose leaders condoned Israel cutting off food and water to Gaza. While they claimed they were misinterpreted, they did so too late. There is also their behaviour around the SNP ceasefire vote and the wave of Islamophobia unleashed as a result. We are already seeing Muslims who are voting with Gaza at the forefront of their minds dismissed as Hamas supporters or as being more loyal to their faith than to Britain. A Labour source even told the BBC that Hamas was the real villain (though the party officially condemned that remark as racist). Domestically, Labour offers little difference to the Tories \u2013 think of its backing of the two-child benefit cap, which plunges millions of children into poverty (and Muslims are one of the most highly represented groups when looking at social deprivation). Besides, Gaza isn\u2019t just a niche Middle Eastern politics issue: it has become a human question, and many Muslims like myself simply cannot look past Labour\u2019s support of what appear to be war crimes committed against people who could be us. Nadeine Asbali is a secondary schoolteacher in London Dal Babu: These elections highlight the politicised nature of policing. That needs to change One set of results today that won\u2019t get as much attention as the metro mayors and local councillors are the police and crime commissioners (PCCs). But at a time when only 40% of people in England say they trust their police force, we should be paying attention. The PCCs were first elected in 2012, with a pitiful turnout of just 15%. Turnout has risen somewhat since then, but the results so far today suggest a turnout of around 20%. Over the past 10 years the whole process has become more explicitly politicised, with fewer independents being returned. In 2024, we look to the results essentially as bellwethers of wider political fortunes. This is not the right way to approach policing. I recall, in 2010, sitting at a dinner at Bramshill police college with a number of chief constables and the then justice minister, Nick Herbert MP, who was explaining the proposed introduction of PCCs to cynical police leaders. They suspected that politicians would interfere with policing. Sadly these concerns were well founded; today we tend to see support for, or opposition to, government policing policy from PCCs predicted entirely by political allegiance. It is time for a rethink. Louise Casey\u2019s report into the Metropolitan police (London does not have a PCC, because it has the mayor) recommended creating a policing board, chaired by the mayor, to help with oversight and accountability. The old system \u2013 police authorities \u2013 included local people who understood local communities. Perhaps it is time to go back to the drawing board. Dal Babu is a former chief superintendent in the Metropolitan police Sarah Longlands: Dissatisfied local communities turned to Labour. Does it have a plan to keep those people onside? Local elections are about everything that matters to us. They\u2019re not just a judgment on the quality of the services councils provide, but also a reflection of how people feel about the state of their communities. These results show growing support for Labour, but more fundamentally they highlight just how dissatisfied people are that the last 14 years of austerity have seen local services driven into the ground and local governments driven to the brink of bankruptcy. This poses a significant challenge for any future Labour government, with (self-imposed) fiscal constraints that will prevent them from being able to offer a much-needed immediate and substantive funding boast to local public services. For while Labour has committed to providing a longer-term funding settlement for local government, there is as yet no promise of any extra money. Any substantive increase in funding would be contingent on growth in the economy that would boost tax revenues. Labour has a plan for growth, but again there are challenges here. Growing the economy in a way that is fair, equal and sustainable will require strong intervention and the help of local leaders. This can\u2019t be done on a shoestring \u2013 and our councils in particular will need time and resources to rebuild the capacity that has been significantly eroded over the course of the current government\u2019s tenure. The mayoral results won\u2019t be fully known until Saturday, but these too will pose a challenge for Labour in government. They need to look closely at devolution arrangements. The narrow framing of the current deals severely limits the way in which combined authorities can use their resources to forge economic futures that recognise the individual strengths and aspirations of their regions. We can read plenty into these results about what Labour will need to tackle should Keir Starmer make his way to number 10. Sarah Longlands is the chief executive of the Centre for Local Economic Strategies Peter Kellner: It\u2019s not quite \u201997, but Tory voters are staying home in all the right contests for Labour Is Labour doing as well as it did in the run-up to Tony Blair\u2019s landslide in 1997? The question is being asked with increasing frequency. The answer is no; but it doesn\u2019t need to do so in order to win a comfortable victory. The BBC estimates that Labour\u2019s support in this week\u2019s local elections was equivalent to 34% across Britain. In 1996, the last local elections before Labour returned to government, the party won 43%. Six months before the 1997 election, Labour\u2019s average poll rating was 51%. It is now 44%. Against that, Labour has been doing even better in recent byelections than it did in 1994-97. But that is largely because many more Conservatives have been staying at home this time. In the last eight seats the Tories have been defending, the turnout has averaged 40%. In Blackpool South yesterday it was just 32.5%. In the four equivalent contests in 1995-97, the average was 65%. The scale of Labour\u2019s recent stunning gains is flattered by Tory abstentions. However, below the surface of the overall numbers, almost everything is going Labour\u2019s way. It has made big advances in Scotland. Polls and byelections confirm that anti-Tory tactical voting is back with a vengeance. And last night, Labour was achieving some of its biggest swings where it will need them most in the general election: in areas that voted leave in the Brexit referendum eight years ago, and which went on to back Boris Johnson at the last general election. Ben Houchen\u2019s victory in Tees Valley offers some relief to the Conservatives. But Rishi Sunak should take care. Houchen\u2019s victory is more for the person than the party. Labour is well ahead when people are asked how they would vote in a general election. Recent polls suggest a similar pattern in London and the West Midlands tomorrow: a significant number of voters simultaneously wanting a Labour prime minister and a Conservative mayor. Peter Kellner is a former president of YouGov Archie MacKay: Labour\u2019s Kim McGuinness bested Jamie Driscoll in the north-east mayoralty, but voters want her to be more than a party politician It was a more comfortable Labour win in the end than the Jamie Driscoll campaign expected. The incumbent North of Tyne mayor, who ran as an independent after being frozen out by Labour, stood for head of the new north-east mayoral combined authority on his record in office \u2013 and the promise of additional investment for the newly added regions of the combined seven counties. But it appears the looming general election played a more significant part in voters\u2019 minds. Whether that\u2019s what a \u201cdevolved\u201d authority needs remains to be seen. The question now will be, will Labour\u2019s London-based HQ allow its north-east mayor autonomy, or will it claim the greater say in the running of the devolved regions? And if the latter, how will the new mayor \u2013 considered a safe Starmerist choice \u2013 respond? County Durham initially rejected membership of the combined authority before reluctantly coming on board at the 11th hour. For residents here, jaded by a generations-long abandonment since Thatcher won her war against the coalminers, platitudes from the incoming mayor about being here before and knowing the solutions won\u2019t really cut it. There\u2019s a reason the \u201cred wall\u201d collapsed \u2013 and it\u2019s not because Labour previously had the answers. With a general election coming, McGuinness will need to demonstrate that Labour is willing to invest in the former Durham coalfield\u2019s immediate and long-term recovery. Reopening the disused Leamside rail line is seen by many community leaders as a catalyst for economic revival in the county, reconnecting the area with the great cities on the Tees, Wear and Tyne. It\u2019s a project McGuinness had championed. Yet in the week leading up to this election, Labour was already managing expectations of that investment, casting a shadow over the core manifesto promise of a \u201cfully integrated public transport system\u201d. So, is it McGuinness\u2019s decision to make or London\u2019s? The answer may go some way to determining how much red is repainted on the north-east wall. Archie MacKay is managing editor of South West Durham News John McDonnell: Labour won big \u2013 but Gaza is an issue it must address before the general election First, the scale of Labour\u2019s victory in Blackpool South demonstrates overwhelmingly that people want the Conservatives out. Keir Starmer is right to call a 26% swing \u201cseismic\u201d. Neither retail offers of tax cuts or other pre-election sweeteners, nor claims that the Rwanda policy is stopping the boats are doing anything to turn things around for Rishi Sunak. Second, beware: although the Tories changing leader yet again will appear ludicrous, the fast installation of a middle-of-the-road, media-friendly face such as Penny Mordaunt could limit the damage and reduce Labour\u2019s majority at the general election. Although the view on most doorsteps \u2013 even among many Conservative voters \u2013 was that it is time for a change, there is still a loyal Conservative base that will want to come out to buttress the party. Labour needs to be fully prepared for this possible scenario now. Third, the hurt and anger felt by many in the Muslim community about Starmer\u2019s response to Gaza is real and deeply felt. Time and time again, Keir\u2019s LBC interview defending the Israeli use of siege tactics is raised on the doorstep. Even though this was corrected a week later, the correction was late coming \u2013 and the failure to back a ceasefire in the first parliamentary vote is also brought up. Labour must not run away from the fact that unless significant action is taken by Keir, Gaza will have an impact on the general election results in those constituencies where there is a sizeable Muslim community. With humility, Labour\u2019s decision-makers need to accept that they got it wrong. A symbolic act of a public apology by Labour, expressed by Keir, to the Muslim community is needed to start the process of reconciliation.

            "date": "2024-05-05T16:34:13Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak will face pressure to adopt hard rightwing policies such as an immigration cap and scrapping European human rights law this week, with Suella Braverman saying he needs to \u201cown and fix\u201d a disastrous set of local election results. Sunak\u2019s allies were on Sunday insisting he wanted to stick to his current plan and that it was working, as plotters against his leadership accepted they did not have the support to challenge him. But Braverman issued an extraordinary broadside against Sunak on a BBC news programme, saying she regretted voting for him to be leader but it was too late to get rid of him. She also said the party would be \u201clucky to have any MPs\u201d if it continued on the same path. Urging him to change course, she called for more conservative policies such as withdrawing from the European convention on human rights \u2013 a move that would be hugely unpopular with moderate Conservatives. Braverman told the BBC\u2019s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \u201cI love my country, I care about my party and I want us to win, and I am urging the prime minister to change course, to \u2013 with humility \u2013 reflect on what voters are telling us, and change the plan and the way that he is communicating and leading us.\u201d Asked about whether she wanted to see a change in leader, Braverman said: \u201cI just don\u2019t think that is a feasible prospect right now, we don\u2019t have enough time and it is impossible for anyone new to come and change our fortunes to be honest. There is no superman or superwoman out there who can do it.\u201d Instead she called on Rishi Sunak to \u201cown\u201d the result, adding: \u201cTherefore he needs to fix it.\u201d One of her allies, John Hayes, called for a reshuffle to bring her back into the cabinet. Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister and communities secretary, along with ex-minister Neil O\u2019Brien are to publish a pamphlet this week urging more action to bring down migration before the election. However, Sunak is looking at a schism in the party, as other senior Conservatives dismissed Braverman\u2019s diagnosis that a swing further to the right was needed. Some Tories believe the prime minister needs to tack to the centre to take votes from Labour and the Lib Dems in marginal seats, while others believe the best strategy is squeezing the Reform UK vote on the right. Andy Street, the former West Midlands mayor who narrowly lost to Labour on Saturday, said: \u201cThe thing everyone should take from Birmingham and the West Midlands is this brand of moderative, inclusive, tolerant conservatism, that gets on and delivered, has come within an ace of beating the Labour party in what they considered to be their back yard \u2013 that\u2019s the message from here tonight.\u201d Robert Buckland, a Tory MP and former justice secretary from the One Nation wing of the party, told GB News that the British public are \u201cputting their fingers in their ears\u201d about the Conservatives because they are engaged in too much infighting. \u201cThe more that we talk about factions and ideology and the less we focus on business, on growth, on jobs, on housing, all those issues that actually people are talking about \u2026 then I think we\u2019ve become an irrelevant rump,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Conservative party wins elections, not by being soft and mushy but by reflecting the views of the British public, by being in alliance with them. The coalition that we need is with the British people. We\u2019ve been the party of the nation for generations. I believe we can get back to that, but we need to focus on what people are talking about.\u201d Sunak has been largely absent from the airwaves over the weekend, apart from appearing at Ben Houchen\u2019s Tees Valley victory on Friday \u2013 a sole pocket of good news for the Conservatives. However, Mark Harper, the transport secretary and a longtime supporter of Sunak, gave a round of broadcast interviews insisting the prime minister\u2019s plan is working. He said the party still had \u201ceverything to fight for\u201d and pointed to there being only nine points between the Tories and Labour in the vote share in England. Another option being floated by some Conservative MPs is whether to give Boris Johnson a role in the election campaign, despite his difficult relationship with Sunak, his successor as prime minister after Liz Truss. Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative on the right of the party and a supporter of Johnson, told Sky News\u2019s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips: \u201cI would like to see real commonsense conservatism, honouring our manifesto commitments. I would like to see the return of Boris on the frontline of politics, whether that\u2019s going for a seat in the next election and being front and centre of our election campaign.\u201d A report in the Sunday Times suggested this weekend that there had been contact between Johnson\u2019s team and Nigel Farage\u2019s camp about the possibility of reuniting the right of politics after the election although the two men are not understood to have spoken directly."

            "date": "2024-05-15T17:24:45Z",
            "content": "Hello! Welcome back to our new US elections newsletter. Non-Trump supporters have been all jittery this week, after a poll appeared to show Joe Biden getting royally stuffed by Trump in the election. The poll had Trump leading Biden in six of the seven states that are key to becoming president. It might seem scary, yes, but it\u2019s too soon to be completely terrified: we\u2019ll look at why in a little bit. First, some of the happenings in US politics. Here\u2019s what you need to know \u2026 1. Trump is (still) in court Summer is almost here in New York. The bees are out, the birds are singing. And Michael Cohen is singing, too! Cohen, who spent a decade as Trump\u2019s lawyer and hatchet man, has been telling a Manhattan court how he paid Stormy Daniels, an adult film actor, to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen said he did so at the direction of Trump, to help his chances of winning the 2016 election. That\u2019s a crime, which wouldn\u2019t bode well for Trump\u2019s re-election chances. 2. Mixed primary results for Republicans Barring the unprecedented, Joe Biden and Donald Trump will be the Democratic and Republican candidates in November \u2013 but the presidential primaries are still going on, and sometimes they tell us interesting things. Like in Maryland and Nebraska, for example, where on Tuesday about 20% of Republicans voted for Nikki Haley \u2013 who dropped out of the presidential race in March \u2013 over Trump. It suggests the former-president has some wooing to do to win over Republicans. 3. Will tariffs excite voters? Tariffs are not the sexiest thing a president can announce. But Biden will be hoping they have some impact, after he increased tariffs \u2013 essentially the amount of taxes a country has to pay to sell its goods \u2013 on a number of Chinese imports. The new tariffs affect steel and aluminium, which are traditionally important products in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan. He also jacked up tariffs on electric vehicles, in a move the White House says will protect jobs. Don\u2019t panic \u2026 at least not yet Monday mornings are rarely enjoyable, but for people concerned about a second Trump term, this week\u2019s was worse than usual. \u201cTrump Leads in 5 Key States,\u201d blared a New York Times headline, \u201cAs Young and Nonwhite Voters Express Discontent With Biden.\u201d This newsletter isn\u2019t usually about polling and numbers and abacuses: it\u2019s called the Stakes, not the Odds. But bear with me, because it is worth taking a look at the New York Times/Siena College poll that prompted that headline \u2013 and hundreds of scary follow-up stories by other media outlets. The newspaper knocked up a graphic that shows Biden down in Nevada by 12 points; in Georgia by 10 points; and by seven points in both Arizona and Michigan. Biden was also behind in Pennsylvania, but had a small lead in Wisconsin. Most states vote very predictably: New York has been Democratic for ages; Alabama, Republican. But these five are swing states \u2013 ones that Biden and Trump both have a shot at winning. Each candidate would need to win some combination of swing states to take the White House. Not very good for Democrats, eh? But how much should they really be worried? Maybe not as much as you may think. For one thing, those terrifying numbers were a result of asking registered voters how they planned to vote. But not every registered voter actually votes: some aren\u2019t excited about the candidates, others just can\u2019t be bothered. In 2020, 168 million people were registered to vote. Only 158m actually did. This is important because when the New York Times questioned people who said they were likely to vote \u2013 not just registered \u2013 the results became much closer. Among these people who are planning to vote, Biden is actually slightly ahead in Michigan (as opposed to being seven points behind). He is still slightly behind in Pennsylvania, and one point behind in Wisconsin, but well within the margin of error. (That\u2019s another thing: these polls are only accurate to within plus or minus 3.5%.) So in Michigan, in Pennsylvania \u2013 where Biden grew up \u2013 and in Wisconsin, the race is essentially too close to call. And that\u2019s important, because if Biden can win these three states, that should be enough to get him re-elected. In the 2016 presidential election, a lot of journalists and news outlets convinced themselves Trump was going to lose in large part from looking at polls. Of course, everyone got it wrong. That prompted all sorts of hand-wringing among the press. In the future, there would be less focus on single polls. Everyone would report on issues instead. As is often the case with the (pretty self-serious) American media, noble think pieces were written, apologies were issued. Yet it feels like we\u2019re back at it again: one poll, being reported on, again and again, scaring the hell out of everybody. I have nothing against polls. I listen to the FiveThirtyEight podcast, which bases its political analysis almost exclusively on polling. They can also tell us useful things about how different people feel \u2013 for example, that young people are less enthusiastic about Biden than they were in 2020, while some Black voters also appear to be drifting away from the president. But as Leah Askarinam, a reporter at AP, told that podcast this week: \u201cThese are helpful numbers. [But] it is six months away from the election.\u201d Askarinam added: \u201cThese polls are not telling us who is winning and who is losing right now.\u201d So nobody should get all in a tizzy just yet. \u2018It\u2019s a stupid request\u2019 Michael Cohen is the key witness in Trump\u2019s ongoing criminal trial, but not everyone will know who he is. Well, Cohen worked for Trump from 2006 to 2018 as his personal attorney \u2013 but Cohen was really Trump\u2019s attack dog: charged with going after anyone who upset his boss. Cohen was known to a lot of reporters as a shouty, sweary menace, and I thought it was worth sharing with you my own brush with him, in 2012. Trump \u2013 at that time, just a loudmouth reality TV star \u2013 had demanded that Barack Obama publish his passport records, claiming Obama had not been born in the US. I thought it would be amusing to call Trump Tower and ask whether Trump would publish his own records. I got Cohen, who found it less amusing, and quickly became upset. He accused me of \u201ctrying to be funny\u201d (fair), called my request \u201cstupid\u201d (bit mean), said Trump would release his passport records if I sent him mine (!), asked me to donate $5m to charity (!!), then hung up on me. I never did get Trump\u2019s passport records, and I never heard from Cohen again, but happily, I recorded our conversation. Who had the worst week? Rudy Giuliani. The man who led New York through the 9/11 attacks, then went from America\u2019s mayor to America\u2019s weirdo in what felt like the blink of an eye, Giuliani lost what was left of his reputation during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 particularly through a doomed attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which reached its nadir when he hosted a press conference at a landscaping business located between a crematorium and sex shop. Things have gone from bad to worse since then. In December last year, Giuliani was ordered to pay $148.1m to two election workers after he lied about them. Then he filed for bankruptcy. This week, his radio show was canceled because he wouldn\u2019t stop lying about the 2020 election. He\u2019s also having to sell his apartment. Born to lie Donald Trump wishes he was the Boss \u2013 or at least that he drew the same crowds and loyalty in New Jersey. At a rally over the weekend, Trump claimed to have a \u201cmuch bigger crowd\u201d than Bruce Springsteen. The city of Wildwood estimated Trump\u2019s attendance at 80,000. Trump claimed 100,000. But the city previously said the event\u2019s capacity was just 20,000. Radio station New Jersey 101.5 reported that the city and Trump\u2019s claims of crowd size are \u201cwildly overestimated\u201d. Meanwhile, according to the local Asbury Park Press, Springsteen drew about 180,000 people across three shows the last time he played a stadium in his home state. Springsteen has called the former president\u2019s time in office \u201ca fucking nightmare\u201d and campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016. - Rachel Leingang, misinformation reporter Elsewhere in US politics \u2022 \u201cA split has emerged in the Never Trump movement in the Republican party,\u201d says David Smith, with some of the Trump-averse Republicans no longer bold or brave enough to not vote for the former president. \u2022 Blue-collar voters have lined up increasingly behind Trump, Steven Greenhouse writes, but experts say Biden can win them back. \u2022 Republicans could flip a Senate seat in Maryland in November, which would not be good news for Democrats, explains Joan E Greve.

            "content": "The election may not yet be in the bag for Labour, but research suggests it is in the shopping basket. The party\u2019s voters now make up the majority of customers at all leading supermarkets apart from Waitrose, according to the latest polling from retail research firm GlobalData. Shoppers at Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi have all swung to Labour from Conservative since 2019, the research found, with the upmarket online grocer Ocado narrowly taking the lead with the biggest proportion of Labour supporters, followed by the discounters Lidl and Iceland. Five years ago, Labour held a majority only in the aisles of Asda, Co-op and Iceland. Even at Conservative holdout Waitrose, the Tory lead has been heavily discounted to just 1.2 percentage points, down from 36.4 in 2019. That\u2019s bad news for Rishi Sunak given that \u201cWaitrose woman\u201d \u2013 middle class, southern and not a fan of Brexit or culture wars \u2013 was one of the voter demographics identified by the Conservatives in 2022 as one they needed to win over to stay in No 10. Shoppers at Iceland, which has the biggest proportion of customers on the lowest income, have swung further to the left. Even the supermarket\u2019s boss, Richard Walker, has switched allegiance to Keir Starmer\u2019s party after ditching plans to become a Conservative MP. Zo\u00eb Mills, lead retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cIf supermarkets were seats, Labour would be on course for a landslide victory, according to our supermarket election poll. \u201cWhen we asked the same questions during the 2019 general election campaign, the Conservatives held sway in all supermarkets except Asda, Iceland and the Co-op, having enticed Morrisons\u2019 shoppers to vote blue and holding on to both Aldi and Lidl, which had previously been Labour in our pre-2017 election polls.\u201d Mills said that, aside from their lead at Waitrose, the only chains where the Conservatives were not trailing Labour by double-digit percentage points were Marks &amp; Spencer and the Co-op. Perhaps surprisingly, the supermarket with the highest proportion of Reform UK voters is the Co-op, despite its long socialist heritage and funding of the Co-operative party, which backs 26 Labour MPs. Mills suggested the Co-op\u2019s large number of stores in south and south-east England, where Reform supporters tend to live, could explain why so many of its shoppers favour the party backed by Nigel Farage and led by Richard Tice, who is understood to be a Tesco shopper. Aldi was found to have the biggest share of Green party supporters, followed by M&amp;S. Mills said: \u201cReform, formerly known as the Brexit party, has overtaken the Liberal Democrats and is third favourite in all supermarkets except Sainsbury\u2019s. The Green party is still in fifth place across most locations, but has made some progress, especially in the larger supermarkets.\u201d GlobalData compiled the research by asking a group of 3,177 nationally representative consumers between 1 April and 12 May how they intended to vote in the next general election and which retailer they mainly used for food and groceries."

            "title": "Polls close in local elections with Tories expecting heavy losses",
            "date": "2024-05-02T21:00:18Z",
            "content": "Voting has closed in local elections, a moment of potential peril for Rishi Sunak, with the Conservatives braced for heavy losses that could destabilise his premiership. The elections, in more than 2,600 seats across 107 English councils, are seen as a key test of whether the Conservative party is as unpopular with voters as the polls suggest. They are also the prime minister\u2019s final chance to stem speculation of a Labour landslide at the general election \u2013 and to quash any potential rebellion from Tory plotters keen to oust him before it. His first big test will be the parliamentary byelection in Blackpool South, where the former Tory MP Scott Benton resigned after being found guilty of breaching standards rules in a lobbying scandal. Labour said it was hopeful of taking back the seat, which Benton won with a majority of 3,690 in 2019, but the race for second place could be problematic for Sunak if the Tories are outflanked on the right by the Reform party. There are also concerns in No 10 that Sunak may face a leadership challenge if the Tories lose the West Midlands and Tees Valley mayoralties. Their candidates seeking re-election \u2013 Andy Street and Ben Houchen, respectively \u2013 have distanced themselves from the party. Polling before voting opened suggested the West Midlands contest was on a knife edge, with YouGov putting the Labour candidate, Richard Parker, two points behind Street. Houchen was seven points ahead of his Labour rival, Chris McEwan, in Tees Valley, but was expected to win as he started from a high bar, taking 73% of the vote last time. If either of them lose, some Tory insiders fear Sunak could face a confidence vote \u2013 just 52 Tory MPs need to feel despondent enough about the state of their party to trigger one. The experiences of Theresa May and Boris Johnson with such votes suggests that even prime ministers who win them can see their authority drain away. Ten metro mayoralties in England including London are being contested, as are 37 police and crime commissioner roles in England and Wales. There were no elections in Scotland or Northern Ireland, and no local council elections in Wales. Labour will be keeping a close eye on the contest for the north-east mayor, where the polls suggest that the incumbent, Jamie Driscoll \u2013 who was barred from running as the party\u2019s candidate amid accusations of factionalism \u2013 could run the Labour candidate Kim McGuinness close. The Tories could face an upset in a newly created mayoralty, York and North Yorkshire, which had been assumed to be a safe Tory seat but now looks in play for Labour. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is expected to win a record third term in the capital after a bitterly fought contest with his Tory rival, Susan Hall, who has faced criticism for pushing the party to the right. Some psephologists have predicted the Conservatives could lose 500 council seats \u2013 about half of those the party is defending this time around \u2013 but Labour sources have said the figure is too ambitious. This set of local council seats was last contested in May 2021, when the Conservatives under Johnson were at a high point after the UK\u2019s Covid vaccine rollout, and the party enjoyed its strongest performance since 2008. Sunak has faced months of often frenzied conjecture over his leadership but before polling day his aides said he was feeling more secure. During the past two weeks he has made a series of policy announcements aimed at securing his base \u2013 welfare reform, the Rwanda deportation plan and defence spending increases \u2013 with more expected in the days ahead. The Commons leader, Penny Mordaunt, who is seen as a future leadership contender, responded to speculation about her ambitions on Thursday by saying: \u201cI too have read that I\u2019m to be installed rather like a new boiler into No 10 next week \u2026 But let me say again, I support our prime minister and I will continue to support him after this weekend and beyond.\u201d The results for all the contests will be declared from the early hours of Friday through to Saturday afternoon, when the West Midlands result is declared."

            "date": "2024-05-26T10:46:20Z",
            "content": "It was supposed to be a show of strength, a packed crowd of 83,000 ANC supporters showing South Africa that despite the country\u2019s myriad problems, the ruling party was still confident of victory in Wednesday\u2019s pivotal elections. Instead, as people streamed out of the three-quarters-full venue before President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s speech had even begun, the Siyanqoba (\u201cTo conquer\u201d) rally will have left ANC leaders more nervous than ever that the party that liberated South Africa will lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to victory in 1994. If the ANC\u2019s vote falls below 50% and it is forced into a coalition, it will only have itself to blame. Rampant corruption under Ramaphosa\u2019s predecessor, Jacob Zuma, has hollowed out the state. About four in 10 South Africans are unemployed, while basic public services are either poor or non-existent. Power and wealth still resides in a tiny minority, while poverty is extreme, making South Africa the most unequal society in the world. It\u2019s also one of the most dangerous. \u201cEverywhere in the country, crime is the thing that people talk about, whether you\u2019re black or white,\u201d said William Gumede, a political analyst who also helped some of the opposition parties form a pre-election coalition pact. \u201cIt deprives South Africans from living a full life. It has sucked the soul out of the country.\u201d The progress made under the leadership of Mandela and his successor, Thabo Mbeki, stalled when Zuma took power. Billions was looted from the state, leaving almost every part of it bankrupt, from the national airline to the agency that ran the railways. An official inquiry concluded that \u201cthe ANC under Zuma permitted, supported and enabled corruption\u201d. A generational divide is opening up. At Soweto\u2019s FNB stadium \u2013 the venue, then known as Soccer City, that hosted the opening game of the 2010 football World Cup \u2013 several older rally attendees spoke of their frustration that their children, born into freedom, were not backing the ANC. On the day of South Africa\u2019s first free election in 1994, Girlfaith Dlamini was nine months pregnant. While her fellow South Africans queued for hours to cast their votes, Dlamini was taken to the front. \u201cI was treated like a president,\u201d she said. Her daughter was born two weeks later, the day after Mandela was sworn in \u2013 now she\u2019s studying chartered accounting at Wits University. \u201cMy kid is in university because of the ANC. I\u2019m a domestic worker, I couldn\u2019t afford fees.\u201d But her daughter, like many of those \u201cborn free\u201d, has less loyalty towards the party that has ruled South Africa her entire life. On Wednesday, she will vote for the EFF, a leftwing populist party led by Julius Malema. \u201cI was very angry with her,\u201d Dlamini said. \u201cI told her \u2018the ANC is the one taking you to school!\u2019\u201d Hers is not the only family falling out over politics. Mary Monyweka, a 58-year-old ANC official in Tshwane, has had similar rows with her daughter. \u201cIt feels so painful,\u201d she said. Monyweka pulled up her trousers to show a bullet wound she received in the Soweto uprising in the summer of 1976. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand what is going on, she doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. Monyweka doesn\u2019t know who her daughter will vote for. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d she laughs. Aside from the EFF, the party of Mandela is also likely to lose votes to a new party formed by Zuma, uMkhonto we Sizwe, which takes its name and logo from the ANC\u2019s former paramilitary wing. There is no shortage of other options, with 52 parties on the ballot, the most popular of which aside from the ANC is the Democratic Alliance (DA), which has gained a reputation for its relatively impressive management of Cape Town and Western Cape province. At a DA rally at a much smaller venue in Soweto last Wednesday, a far younger crowd had gathered. There was anger at the ANC and none of the residual loyalty felt by older black South Africans. \u201cOur children drink dirty water and go to sleep hungry,\u201d said 36-year-old April Molobi who had come along with his twin sister, Paulina, and nephew Thalepo. \u201cI just want the government to give us jobs so we can work. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d Paulina described waking up at 3am to unsuccessfully queue for jobs. Thalepo recounted the various qualifications he\u2019d received at school. \u201cI have plenty of certificates but they are not working for me,\u201d the 28-year-old said. He left school eight years ago and has been unemployed since. If he had his choice of job he would be a private investigator, he said, as he told tales of corrupt officials and dodgy politicians. But the DA is still hamstrung by the sense that it is a party dominated by white people. The crowd at last week\u2019s rally was almost entirely black, but backstage where the party\u2019s staff and politicians mingled, the proportion of white people was far higher. Back at the ANC rally, past the stalls selling hats, shirts and T-shirts in the party\u2019s yellow, green and black, many of them emblazoned with the faces of long-dead liberation heroes, stood Stephen Serapezo, a 62-year-old housing official in Johannesburg who was waiting for friends to arrive. He accepted that the ANC \u201cwronged the people\u201d when Zuma was in charge. But the ANC is renewing itself, he insisted: \u201cAll the rotten apples have left the movement.\u201d And he cited the government\u2019s stance on Gaza, particularly its decision to take Israel to the international court of justice. \u201cWe are leading the world in making sure that Palestinians have a voice internationally.\u201d If the ANC needs to go into coalition, Serapezo would favour a deal with the DA, which he believes has similar economic policies. But he accepts that is a minority view at this rally. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t accept it,\u201d he says, waving his hands at the crowd. \u201cThey see it as a white party, full stop, not \u2018do we have anything in common?\u2019\u201d Regardless of the thinning crowd, Serapeza believed his party and country had a brighter future. \u201cWe\u2019re getting somewhere and there\u2019s hope. There is no reason to be despondent.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-14T02:00:22Z",
            "content": "When the people of Gujarat cast their votes last week in India\u2019s six-week-long election, there was one constituency in the state that stood silent. There were no polling stations or impatient queues of people, and no one with the tell-tale inky finger. In Surat, no voting was necessary \u2013 the outcome was already decided. Mukesh Dalal, from the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), won the seat by default after every other candidate was either disqualified or dropped out of the race. It was the first time in 73 years that Surat\u2019s candidate was appointed, not elected. Surat is not the only constituency in Gujarat to witness swathes of candidates going up against the BJP suddenly withdrawing from the race. In Gandhinagar, where Amit Shah, the home minister and prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s right-hand man, is running, 16 opposition candidates dropped out before last Tuesday\u2019s voting. Gujarat is likely to be an easy win for the BJP in the election, which is also expected to return Modi to power for a third term. It is Modi\u2019s home state and the stronghold of his party, which has won every state election here since 1995, and in the last general election in 2019 won all 26 seats. Yet some have alleged that there have been concerted efforts to cement BJP hegemony in the state and declare wins by huge margins by eliminating the opposition altogether. In Gandhinagar, the BJP is publicly aiming for Shah to win the seat by an unprecedented 1 million votes. In Surat and Gandhinagar, opposition parties and activists have accused the BJP of undermining democratic processes by using party workers and police to intimidate and put pressure on opposing candidates to withdraw, sometimes with explicit threats of violence or direct harassment of their families. The BJP district and state spokespeople refused to comment. Gujarat\u2019s director general of police, Vikas Sahay, and the home minister, Shah, also did not respond. Among those who withdrew in Surat was Baraiya Ramesh, 58, who has his own textile business and was running as an independent candidate. He alleged that after submitting his nomination, he began to face a campaign of intimidation. \u201cI was threatened by the police and pressured to withdraw,\u201d said Ramesh. \u201cEveryone in Surat knows how every candidate was harassed and pressure was put on them to not fight the elections.\u201d Fearing the threats, he turned his phone off, but as soon as he turned it back on, he claims he was traced by police and picked up. \u201cThey clearly told me to withdraw the nomination, so I did,\u201d he said, adding that he feared for his safety but said it was important that he spoke out publicly. \u201cMost of the candidates were threatened by the police.\u201d In Gandhinagar, five opposition candidates alleged threats in the buildup to campaigning, and 16 ultimately withdrew. Hours before voting began in Gandhinagar, Jitendra Chauhan, 39, who was running as a candidate for the Akhil Bhartiya Parivar party, posted a video on social media. Through sobs, he alleged he was forced to withdraw. Chauhan previously worked for the BJP between 2012 and 2019, but told the Guardian he had become disillusioned with the party and had decided to run against Shah to fight for local issues. It was a decision he said that had \u201cmade my life hell\u201d. \u201cAs soon as I decided to submit my nomination, the police started following me everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, on 16 April, when I submitted my nomination papers, I started receiving threats from BJP workers. A BJP legislator threatened to jail me in some fake case.\u201d With every passing day, Chauhan said the threats got worse. \u201cPeople would call me, come to my house, and give me an ultimatum to withdraw. Then the police started harassing my friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt so threatened that I had to withdraw my nomination.\u201d One candidate, Sumitra Maurya, 43, a schoolteacher, who contested elections for the first time with the Prajatantra Aadhar party, said she had refused to be cowed by the campaign of \u201cunpleasant and frightening\u201d intimidation that began from the moment she submitted her nomination for Gandhinagar in April. \u201cI was well aware of who I was fighting against \u2013 the man who is India\u2019s home minister, a political heavyweight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am a firm believer in the power of democracy.\u201d Initially, it started with a visit to Maurya\u2019s home from unknown men, then constant calls to her and her husband, questioning why she was running. WhatsApp messages saying \u201coffer\u201d, \u201ccall me,\u201d and \u201cit is urgent\u201d began to flood in, and then relatives began to call, asking her to withdraw. Fearing the threats, she travelled with her family about 200 miles out of the city. But after they checked into their hotel, there was a knock on the door, and several men in plain clothes stood outside, asking to speak to her husband. As Maurya confronted the men, they eventually revealed they were from the crime branch of police who said they were under a lot of pressure from their seniors. Through the hotel window, Maurya could see the men roaming around the property throughout the night and she claims two cars followed them when they drove back the next morning. She still refused to remove her name from the ballot. \u201cThey want to create an example so that people like me think a hundred times before even thinking about contesting.\u201d Voting in Gandhinagar was also mired in allegations of widespread irregularities. In one video that emerged, Muslims \u2013 who are unlikely to support the BJP \u2013 appear to be being passed cash to pretend they had cast their votes. Multiple polling agents told the Guardian they had witnessed Muslim voters being coerced or threatened into not voting and there are several videos that appear to show outsiders being brought in to illegally cast votes in the place of absentees. At least one booth in the constituency has been ordered to redo the polling. \u201cThroughout the campaigning and on the polling day, the police and local administration worked together with BJP workers to scare our workers and people who they thought would vote against the BJP,\u201d said Sonal Patel, 64, the candidate for the opposition Congress party in Gandhinagar, who remained in the race. Patel also accused BJP workers of trying to pay off and blackmail Congress candidates and workers into switching sides and said she was repeatedly prevented from campaigning. \u201cThis has all been done because they want to win by the highest margin,\u201d she said. Several candidates and human rights activists submitted complaints to the election commission \u2013 the body overseeing the polls which stands accused of being co-opted by the BJP government \u2013 and also requested extra police presence on polling day, but got no formal response. The local election commission did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. Shabnam Hashmi, an activist who was on the ground, also submitted complaints to the election commission. \u201cI have seen harassment and intimidation and manipulation in elections before, but never on this scale and never with the full state machinery behind it,\u201d said Hashmi. \u201cIt was unprecedented and very unfortunate for our democracy.\u201d"

            "content": "Half a dozen members of the European parliament earn more from second jobs than as EU lawmakers, according to analysis that raises questions about potential conflicts of interest. The campaign group Transparency International EU found that 70% of the European parliament\u2019s 705 members have side jobs. Just over a quarter (26%) of side jobs were paid, with six lawmakers earning more than their \u20ac120,900 (\u00a3103,000) annual gross MEP salary. The highest-earning MEP declared \u20ac3m a year from a real estate business; another politician had a salary from his corporate law job that was almost as high as his MEP pay, while numerous parliamentarians benefited from company board memberships and the lecture circuit. Of the top 20 MEP earners, nine were members of the mainstream centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP); a further six belonged to nationalist or far-right parties, or had been members of such groups in the recent past. The top 20 also covered two socialists; two liberals, including the former Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt; and one independent, who was expelled from the liberal group. That was Lithuanian MEP Viktor Uspaskich, whose \u20ac3m in earnings topped the list. He was removed from the liberal Renew group in 2021 over homophobic comments and now sits as an independent. A low-profile MEP, Uspaskich was reported by Lithuania\u2019s public broadcaster last year to have given money to a website promoting conspiracy theories about the war in Ukraine and Covid vaccines. In second place was French MEP J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rivi\u00e8re, who earned \u20ac220,248 on top of his MEP salary, mostly through his involvement in a financial services company. Rivi\u00e8re was elected to the European parliament as a member of Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally, but later joined \u00c9ric Zemmour\u2019s Reconqu\u00eate party, before re-registering as an independent in 2023. At no3 was L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, a former Hungarian justice minister and member of the hard-right governing Fidesz party: he was estimated to earn \u20ac171,638 from a university rectorship and academic work. Other MEPs who had high earnings \u2013 although the sums were less than their salaries as legislators \u2013 included Guy Verhofstadt, a former leader of the liberal group. He earned \u20ac131,988, mostly from company boards and appearances on the speaking circuit. The French centre-right MEP Geoffrey Didier earned \u20ac115,200 a year working as a corporate lawyer at a firm where he is said to \u201cadvise and assist business leaders or financial organisations\u201d in litigation, as well as other outside earnings. He said his work as a lawyer was \u201ctotally legally compatible\u201d with his MEP mandate. \u201cRegarding the potential lack of time, I have been unanimously recognised as an MEP very committed in my work,\u201d he added, referring to leading roles legislating the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act and Media Freedom Act. \u201cI know many MEPs who do not have any legal or any other activity and who, however, do not work as much as I did.\u201d Monika Hohlmeier, a German centre-right MEP, declared \u20ac75,000 a year for sitting on the board of Munich-based BayWa group, an agriculture-construction-energy conglomerate that is on the EU lobbyist\u2019s register. She said: \u201cI believe that politicians should not only be active in the political ivory tower, but also have to engage outside parliament. It is important that they publish their activities and that is exactly what I have been doing for years.\u201d She stressed the independence of her decisions, adding: \u201cThe experiences that I have in the various organisations or at BayWa and the knowledge that I generate there enrich me in order to analyse different issues from different perspectives and make a carefully considered assessment of facts.\u201d The Flemish nationalist MEP Johan Van Overtveldt earned \u20ac30,000 a year sitting on the board of an Antwerp-based company Nbx BV which specialises in technology and payment systems. Van Overtveldt\u2019s office said the MEP was a member of that company\u2019s international board and \u201cfocuses on international expansion plans, outside the EU. Hence, no conflict of interests\u201d. The Guardian has contacted all named MEPs for comment. None of the MEPs have broken any rules, but Transparency International EU said the range of second jobs, paid and unpaid, raised concerns about conflicts of interest and potential foreign interference, 18 months after the European parliament was rocked by the \u201cQatargate\u201d cash for influence scandal. \u201cWhen we look at the contents of the declarations, we see that there are mistakes, we see that there are activities that could be conducive, potentially to a conflict of interest,\u201d said Rapha\u00ebl Kergueno, the lead author of the Transparency International EU study, which is based on MEPs\u2019 public declarations of outside interests up to 24 April 2024. He contrasted what he saw as parliament\u2019s limited checks on MEPs\u2019 declarations with more \u201cproactive\u201d checks in some EU member states, such as France. \u201cThat opens up the door to a whole host of problems: either conflicts of interest \u2026 [and] potentially an open door for entities that might try to funnel money from third country governments into the European parliament.\u201d After the Qatargate scandal, MEPs voted to tighten ethics and transparency standards. More than half of the top 20 biggest earners (13 MEPs) voted against an amendment that would have banned side jobs with organisations on the EU lobbyists\u2019 register. The proposal ultimately failed after it was rejected by more than 90% of the centre-right EPP and Eurosceptic European Conservative and Reformists (ECR) group. Transparency International is also asking whether MEPs busy with second jobs have time to focus on their parliamentary duties. The report shows that the average MEP with side interests has four activities, paid and unpaid, while 23 MEPs declared more than 10 side jobs. \u201cSome MPs have so many side activities which really raises the question of how they allocate their time,\u201d Kergueno said. \u201cWe want to make sure [not only] that there are no conflict of interest, but we also want to make sure that elected representatives are working full time for the citizens and not necessarily for their private interest.\u201d Transparency International is calling on the next European parliament, which begins its term in July after European elections, to ban all side jobs, paid and unpaid. In the absence of such a ban \u2013 which would have to be voted on by MEPs themselves \u2013 the campaign group would like to see more robust checks from the parliament on second jobs, that \u201cputs in place the resources to also ensure that MEPs will not have a situation of conflict of interest\u201d, Kergueno said."

            "date": "2024-05-20T15:48:13Z",
            "content": "Eagles that have migratory routes through Ukraine have shifted their flight paths to avoid areas affected by the conflict, researchers have found. GPS data has revealed that greater spotted eagles not only made large detours after the invasion began, but also curtailed pitstops to rest and refuel, or avoided making them altogether. The upshot, the team say, is that the vulnerable raptors took longer to reach their breeding grounds, and probably expended more energy to get there. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like if you were to run a marathon but you had no water breaks. And at the end, someone asks you to run an extra seven or eight miles,\u201d said Charlie Russell of the University of East Anglia, a co-author of the study. The researchers warned the situation could delay breeding, as the eagles could need longer to recuperate, and affect the survival chances of any young, as prey may be less available when the eggs hatch. Writing in the journal Current Biology, Russell and colleagues reported how they analysed migration routes taken by 19 greater spotted eagles as they flew through Ukraine to breeding grounds in southern Belarus in March and April 2022 \u2013 just weeks after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. While females travel from overwintering grounds in Greece, males travel from sites in east Africa. The researchers compared these paths with 65 migrations recorded from 20 birds in 2018-21. The findings suggest the eagles travelled an extra 53 miles (85km) on average after the invasion. Russell said one eagle added an extra 155 miles to its route. The journey took, on average, 55 hours longer after the conflict started, with males found to have a lower flight speed than before the conflict began. And while 90% of eagles made stopovers in Ukraine before the conflict, only 32% did so after the invasion, with some sites avoided altogether. The team said the greatest deviations from a direct path occurred where military activity was higher. However, Russell said, the degree to which the eagles appeared to have been affected varied. Indeed while one eagle, nicknamed Borovets, continued to fly via Kyiv despite intense fighting, another \u2013 known as Denisa \u2013 shifted its path after flying within a kilometre of explosions and battles around the outskirts of the city. Russell said the detours appeared to have been made on the fly in response to sporadic events. \u201cIt is not like the birds are checking the news every morning to figure out where they should or shouldn\u2019t fly on their migrations,\u201d he said. Russell said the results may underestimate the impact of the conflict, given some eagles could also be exposed to such stresses during the breeding period itself. \u201cRight now, there is not much that we can do, but it\u2019s important that we are understanding the stresses on these populations, so that in a post-conflict scenario we can help to not just support greater spotted eagle populations and help them recover, but ecosystems as a whole,\u201d he added. Dr Josh Milburn, a philosopher at Loughborough University whose research explores ethical questions about animals and warfare, said the study expanded on what is already known about the negative effects of the conflict on Ukraine\u2019s domesticated and captive wild animals. \u201cOn rare occasions, wild animals can benefit from human conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the findings of this study echo what we know from previous research, focused on other war zones: war has an overwhelmingly negative impact on wild animals \u2013 both in terms of conservation goals and in terms of the suffering of individual animals.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-23T13:46:34Z",
            "content": "China has launched two days of military drills around Taiwan after the island swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te. Lai takes over from Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan\u2019s president since 2016. Both are from the Democratic Progressive party (DPP), a pro-sovereignty political party detested by the Chinese government, which views the group as separatists. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to take control of it, with force if necessary. The naming of this Joint Sword drill, suffixed with -2024A, has fostered expectations there are more drills to come this year. How significant are the drills? The drills are the most significant since similar exercises were launched against Taiwan in August 2022 and April 2023. However they appeared smaller in scope, and did not involve live fire near Taiwan on the first day. Military drills around Taiwan were widely expected this week. After a relatively muted reaction to Lai\u2019s victory in January, analysts were on the lookout for a Chinese show of force in response to the inauguration on 20 May. The deputy commander of the US Indo-Pacific command, Lt Gen Stephen Sklenka, said the drills were \u201cconcerning\u201d but expected. \u201cThe normalisation of abnormal actions, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening,\u201d Sklenka said. Thursday\u2019s exercises included coastguard vessels, which have been used increasingly for enforcement and military-adjacent purposes in recent years. After a fatal collision between an illegal Chinese fishing boat and a Taiwanese coastguard vessel near Kinmen in February, China responded with increased patrols and an explicit rejection of maritime borders which it had until then tacitly respected. How big are they compared to previous military exercises? Like the previous war games, Thursday\u2019s also appeared to be practising blockade techniques. Maps of the exercise locations showed Chinese forces targeting five large areas of sea surrounding Taiwan, and several smaller ones around the Taiwanese islands which sit next to the Chinese mainland. The August 2022 drills did not include the small Taiwanese islands as targets. So far, the drills appear to be smaller and of a lower intensity compared with 2022 and 2023 in terms of level of activity. Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry said China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) stayed outside the 24 nautical mile limit of Taiwan\u2019s waters, and only carried out live fire exercises inland, not in the strait or at sea. It did not declare any no-fly zones. The 2022 drills included the firing of ballistic missiles over Taiwan\u2019s main island into the sea, and analysts believed the 2023 drills showed an increased \u201cwar-like\u201d capability, with marked improvement in the launching of fighter jets from aircraft carriers. This year the PLA navy has begun test sailing its third aircraft carrier, an addition to its fleet which analysts say will greatly increase China\u2019s ability to maintain a strong presence across the Taiwan strait, South China Sea and East China Sea. Why does Beijing dislike Taiwan\u2019s new president? Beijing said this week\u2019s drills were a \u201cpunishment\u201d for \u201cseparatist acts\u201d \u2013 that is to say, Taiwan voting in Lai as president. Beijing views the DPP as separatists. It cut off communication with the Taiwanese government in 2016 shortly after Tsai took office. The Chinese government is particularly concerned about Lai, who in the past has advocated more strongly for Taiwanese independence. In recent years, and in his presidential campaign, he softened this stance, and now hews more closely to the path carved out by Tsai of not formally declaring Taiwan\u2019s independence because it already enjoys autonomy in practice. Nevertheless, Beijing detests Lai and took particular exception to parts of his inauguration speech which appeared to more strongly affirm Taiwan\u2019s separateness from China than Tsai usually did. In a report on Thursday, the Chinese state media broadcaster CCTV said that Lai \u201cwill be nailed to the pillar of history\u201d. Is Beijing planning a war? China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, has made it clear that he sees resolving the \u201cTaiwan question\u201d as part of his legacy. Analysts and western intelligence mention dates as soon as 2027 as a deadline by which the PLA has been instructed to be ready for a conflict. A PLA Defence University lecturer, Zhang Chi, told state media the northern sites of this week\u2019s drills \u201csent a warning\u201d to the ruling DPP. Zhang, who was not speaking on behalf of the PLA, said the eastern areas cut off Taiwan\u2019s energy imports, support lines from the US and other allies, and \u201cthe escape route for Taiwan independence forces\u201d. Zhang\u2019s comments were likely aimed at sending a message to international parties that the PLA took these drills very seriously, and to reassure domestic audiences of China\u2019s strength and control. There is increasing concern that rather than an all-out assault, Beijing will increase its less militaristic \u201cgreyzone\u201d activities, which are harder for Taiwan and other interested parties to calculate a response to. These already include increased coastguard patrols around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, the shifting of flight paths to Taiwan\u2019s side of the median line, and the frequent deployment of weather balloons \u2013 which are civilian but can also gather granular microclimate data which can assist in bombardment attacks \u2013 into Taiwan\u2019s airspace. All activities that are arguably civilian, legal and difficult to respond to, but which still put pressure on Taiwan."

            "date": "2024-05-27T04:00:13Z",
            "content": "In the weeks since Vladimir Putin sacked his longtime defence minister Sergei Shoigu, Russia\u2019s FSB security service has pursued a series of high-level corruption cases against a deputy minister and department heads in what many insiders are now calling a purge in the defence ministry. Andrei Belousov, the technocrat economist appointed to replace Shoigu, has a mandate to reduce corruption in the defence ministry and streamline military production for a long war against Ukraine that could largely be decided by industrial output. But former defence and Kremlin officials, ex-officers and foreign observers have said it was likely the exit of Shoigu and loss of his protection that has allowed the FSB, the Russian security department responsible for internal investigations, to take down powerful officials in a power struggle that could have knock-on effects for how Russia fights the war in Ukraine. \u201cThe FSB finally got their teeth in the defence ministry and general staff,\u201d said Capt John Foreman, the UK\u2019s former defence attache to Moscow, who said he believed the arrests could continue after \u201cPutin\u2019s patience had finally snapped\u201d. \u201cShoigu and Gerasimov provided a buffer, but now Putin decided he had to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cShoigu kept the FSB largely away from the ministry throughout his tenure, there were very few arrests. Once the FSB has their teeth in you, who knows how far they will go.\u201d Throughout the war in Ukraine, Shoigu and Gerasimov have come under fire from pro-war advocates for the military\u2019s setbacks and their failure to eradicate pervasive corruption within the armed forces. Last summer, this dissatisfaction reached its peak when Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner paramilitary group, initiated an unsuccessful rebellion against the military\u2019s leaders. Interagency rivalries run deep in Russia, and Shoigu\u2019s ouster may have given investigators in the FSB and investigative committee an opportunity to dust off criminal cases against the top brass in an effort to seek promotions and praise. \u201cIt\u2019s the dream of any investigator to put a real live deputy minister of defence in prison, it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s the dream of a lifetime,\u201d said one former Kremlin official. \u201cYou get new epaulettes for that, a promotion, some kind of award. You can earn a reputation for that.\u201d In the case of high-level prosecutions, the official said, Putin would probably be informed before an arrest was sought. But, the official added, he said it was unlikely the corruption cases were being initiated by the Kremlin itself. In the span of a month, four top defence officials were arrested on corruption charges, marking the most significant crackdown in the defence ministry in years. The purge began on 23 April with the shock arrest of the veteran deputy defence minister Timur Ivanov for suspected bribe-taking. Addressing the recent series of arrests, the Kremlin on Thursday denied any suggestion of a crackdown within the defence ministry. \u201cThe fight against corruption is consistent work,\u201d the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. \u201cIt is not a campaign, it is constantly ongoing work.\u201d Ivanov was a long-term confidant and protege of Sergei Shoigu. His detention is believed to have laid the groundwork for Shoigu\u2019s dismissal, who was subsequently replaced as defence minister by Belousov. In the weeks that followed, additional high-ranking officials were detained. These included Yuri Kuznetsov, the head of the ministry\u2019s personnel department, and Vadim Shamarin, the head of the communications department of the Russian general staff. Hours after Shamarin\u2019s arrest on Thursday, Russia\u2019s investigative committee also reported detaining another defence ministry official \u2013 Vladimir Verteletsky, who headed a division in the state defence procurement department of the ministry. While the Kremlin announced earlier this month that Russia\u2019s top general, Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, would retain his position, the arrest of Shamarin, a direct deputy of Gerasimov, could weaken the general\u2019s standing within the military hierarchy. \u201cThe probability of Gerasimov\u2019s dismissal has gone up. I would sell my shares in him right now,\u201d said Foreman. A former defence official said the arrests showed that the balance of power had swung in favour of Russia\u2019s security services, while its military appears in disarray. \u201cThe FSB\u2019s department of counterintelligence operations (1st division) is becoming increasingly powerful. They currently hold all the cards and are tightening the screws,\u201d said the official, who worked closely with Ivanov and Shoigu. \u201cIt is not that Belousov\u2019s arrival led to the purges, but the departure of Shoigu and his strongmen resource that enabled the arrest,\u201d the official continued. \u201cShoigu in the end was a silovik [member of the security elite] and had their backing.\u201d Russian prosecutors have also gone after a senior general best known for his criticism of Shoigu and Gerasimov. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms force, said last summer that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield, including the lack of counter-battery fire, and deaths and injuries the army was suffering from Ukrainian attacks. Popov, who Russian media said stood accused of stealing 100m roubles (\u00a3868,569) of metal, was arrested on Tuesday and placed in a pre-detention facility. Gleb Irisov, a former Russian air force lieutenant who left the military in 2020, said he had spoken with an FSB source before the arrests who told him that the purge in the defence ministry would be prompted mainly by its failures in Ukraine. \u201cUnder Sergei Shoigu, the defence ministry became heavily influenced by his personal network,\u201d said Irisov. \u201cFrom senior commanders to lower staff, key positions were filled with Shoigu\u2019s picks \u2013 friends or friends of friends. He even created numerous deputy positions specifically for his allies.\u201d Those have included a reported mistress of Sergei Shoigu\u2019s who headed companies that earned millions of pounds from contracts with the defence ministry. Irisov said he regularly discovered substandard equipment in the military, including lightbulbs that melted at supersonic speeds while flying Russia\u2019s modern Su-35 air-defence fighter, as well as shoddy trucks and air defence systems unable to shoot down modern drones. He said in part their deficiencies were the result of corruption under Shoigu. \u201cThe overall quality of the military suffered because funds were routinely embezzled,\u201d he said. \u201cMilitary exercises often existed only on paper, as the allocated money was siphoned off.\u201d"

            "content": "A Green party councillor at the centre of an antisemitism row has apologised \u201cfor the upset caused\u201d by his remarks but hit back at \u201cIslamophobic\u201d attacks against him. The Green party has launched an investigation into Mothin Ali, who was elected to Leeds city council last week, but has declined to suspend him. Ali, who is a prominent YouTube and TikTok personality, has come under fire for remarks he has made in social media videos in recent months and during his acceptance speech last week. In his speech on being elected, recorded on his TikTok channel, Ali stood in front of a Palestinian flag and said \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and \u201cthis is a win for the people of Gaza\u201d. On the day of Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on Israel, Ali said in remarks on social media that Palestinians had the right to \u201cfight back\u201d. In a separate video published on social media, he criticised a rabbi who went into hiding after receiving online threats because he had served with the Israel Defence Forces. Ali called Rabbi Zecharia Deutsch a \u201ccreep\u201d. In a statement published by the Green party branch in Leeds after the remarks sparked backlash, Ali said he was \u201csorry for any upset my comments caused about the Gaza conflict. That was not my intention\u201d. \u201cLike many across the world I have been deeply impacted by the dreadful conflict currently underway in Gaza. The international court of justice said this conflict meets the case for plausible genocide,\u201d he added. \u201cI do not support violence on either side: violence leads to more violence and this is what I have tried to convey,\u201d he added. \u201cI have consistently called for an immediate ceasefire and a release of all hostages. I hope to be working with a broad coalition including both the Jewish and Muslim Greens soon to discuss sensible ways for us to work on communicating our shared passion of bringing the conflict to an end.\u201d Ali hit back at criticism of his use of the words \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d in his acceptance speech in the Leeds city council elections last week, suggesting the attacks were Islamophobic. \u201cIt is not unusual for somebody of my faith to use the words \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 as an expression of gratitude and celebration. Some have sought to misrepresent this and it suggests Islamophobia to me,\u201d Ali said. The Jewish Labour Movement (JLM), an affiliate of the Labour party, wrote to the Greens on Tuesday warning that they were allowing \u201cthose with a history of spreading antisemitic views and positions to join and represent your party\u201d. JLM questioned why Ali was allowed to stand after his remarks about Rabbi Zecharia Deutsch. Simon Myerson KC, the chair of the Leeds Jewish Representative Council, has published a letter he has written to Green party co-leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, calling for Ali to be suspended. The Green party said it was investigating the context of Ali\u2019s remarks and declined to comment. It came as S\u00eean Berry, a former co-leader of the Green party, announced she was standing down from the London assembly just three days after she was elected. Berry\u2019s decision to exit the assembly makes way for Zo\u00eb Garbett, who was the Green party\u2019s unsuccessful candidate in the London mayoral contest, to take her place. The move sparked criticism from Labour figures who said Berry should not have stood for the London assembly if she was going to immediately relinquish the seat. Berry is the Greens\u2019 parliamentary candidate in Brighton Pavilion, the seat currently held by the party\u2019s only MP, Caroline Lucas, who is standing down at the next election. She has come under fire from Labour for standing in London and Brighton simultaneously. Berry said: \u201cZo\u00eb has shown how much of a difference she will make in city hall, listening to Londoners and bringing their voices into the political debate. That\u2019s why she needs to be in this job as soon as possible.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-21T15:37:52Z",
            "content": "The defense rested in Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial on Tuesday, without the former president himself testifying. Trump had previously railed about being silenced and falsely claimed he was not allowed to testify, but ultimately elected of his own volition not to take the stand in his own defense. Trump\u2019s decision came without fanfare. The move was not surprising \u2013 defendants in criminal cases rarely testify, because they would be subject to cross-examination, during which they could easily say something that harms their defense \u2013 but followed several instances of Trump claiming he was not allowed to do so. The judge, Juan Merchan, had gone so far as to address Trump\u2019s claims, saying: \u201cI want to stress, Mr Trump, that you have an absolute right to testify at trial,\u201d and adding that the gag order preventing Trump from verbally attacking witnesses did not affect his right to take the stand. After the defense rested Merchan, told jurors to return on Tuesday 28 May for closing arguments. Merchan said he would also announce his instructions to jurors the next day and expected that they would then start deliberating. The trial had resumed earlier Monday with continued cross-examination of Robert Costello, whom the defense has used to try to discredit the former president\u2019s one-time fixer, Michael Cohen. Trump entered the courtroom just before 9.30am. The former president, who is all but guaranteed to be the Republican presidential nominee, is charged with falsifying business records related to paying the adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence about an alleged sexual liaison. Manhattan prosecutors allege that Trump plotted in summer 2015 with Cohen, then Trump\u2019s consigliere, and the former tabloid head David Pecker to keep any damaging information under wraps in an effort to protect his candidacy in the 2016 election. Cohen told jurors he coordinated the payment to Daniels weeks before election day, and footed the bill himself. The campaign was gravely concerned that Daniels\u2019s account could deal a deadly blow to Trump\u2019s presidential run, he said, as an embarrassing hot mic recording \u2013 in which he bragged about grabbing women \u201cby the pussy\u201d without their consent \u2013 had emerged weeks prior. Cohen, who testified for four days, claimed at one point that an angry Trump instructed him to bury Daniels\u2019s account, telling him to \u201cjust take care of it\u201d. \u201cThis was a disaster, a fucking disaster,\u201d Cohen said he remembered Trump saying. \u201cWomen will hate me.\u201d Cohen told the jury he had kept Daniels\u2019s account off the radar in 2011, coordinating with her then lawyer to remove a story about their alleged encounter from a gossip website. \u201cHe was really angry with me,\u201d Cohen said of Trump\u2019s reaction after he informed him about Daniels\u2019s potentially coming forward before election day. Trump allegedly said: \u201cI thought you had this under control? I thought you took care of this.\u201d The prosecution maintains Trump\u2019s repayment of Cohen in 2017 constituted illegal behavior because he described disbursements as legal expenses in financial documents. Cohen\u2019s testimony is integral to prosecutors\u2019 argument that Trump was well aware that these repayments would be described in an illicit way. On cross-examination, Trump\u2019s legal team failed to land hard blows. The closest Blanche got was getting Cohen to in effect admit over-billing the Trump Organization for reimbursement for a payment to a tech company called Red Finch to help make a poll about famous business figures more favorable to Donald Trump. Cohen said he had paid the tech company $50,000, but in reality he had paid $20,000. Blanche asked Cohen whether he pocketed the $30,000. \u201cSo you stole from the Trump Organization?\u201d Blanche said. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Cohen replied. On Monday, the prosecution rested its case and Trump\u2019s defense started theirs, with the day ending on Costello, a lawyer Cohen had discussed during his four days on the stand. Cohen said he met with Costello after officers raided his hotel room and home in April 2018, but was wary of having him as legal representation, given his relationship with Rudy Giuliani. Cohen said he worried that Costello would tell Giuliani about their conversations, and that the former New York City mayor would then disclose this information to Trump. Costello claimed that during their first meeting, Cohen said he did not know about Trump doing anything illegal; the raid came in the wake of Cohen admitting that he had paid Daniels. \u201cI explained to Michael Cohen that this entire legal problem he was facing would be resolved by the end of the week if he had truthful information about Donald Trump and cooperated with the southern district of New York,\u201d Costello testified. Costello claimed that Cohen allegedly said: \u201cI swear to God, Bob, I don\u2019t have anything on Donald Trump.\u201d Costello\u2019s behavior on the stand, including commentary, almost spun the courtroom into chaos, and prompted a rebuke from the judge. Costello blurted out \u201cjeez\u201d at one point during his testimony, and instructed someone to strike a question, which is something only judges \u2013 not witnesses \u2013 have the power to do. Following this episode, Merchan told the jurors that there would be a brief break and after they were gone, warned Costello against acting in such a way. Merchan then asked: \u201cAre you staring me down right now?\u201d and ordered court officers to \u201cclear the courtroom\u201d. Members of the press were asked to leave for several minutes. Under the US constitution, New York state, and common law, there is a presumption of access, meaning court proceedings are supposed to be open to the press and public except in extremely rare circumstances. Merchan did not permit a media attorney to address the court about the access issue."

            "date": "2024-05-05T19:59:22Z",
            "content": "Some Democrats rallied to the defense of Joe Biden on Sunday as the president came under increased criticism over his response to pro-Palestinian student protests and his handling of Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. Republicans have seized on Biden\u2019s response to the protests, which have seen more than2,000 people arrested around the country, accusing him of a weak response. But prominent Democrats, including Biden re-election campaign co-chairperson Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans, claimed the president \u201chas been very strong about this from the beginning\u201d. Their support came as campus protests have seen an increasingly aggressive police response. An encampment at the University of Southern California was cleared by police in riot gear on Sunday morning, and a similar effort at the University of California, Los Angeles was shut down by police who reportedly used rubber bullets on Thursday. Scores of protesters were arrested at Columbia University on Tuesday night \u2013 a move which New York City\u2019s mayor defended in an interview on Sunday. Asked on CNN\u2019s State of the Union if Biden could have reacted differently to the protests, which have seen clashes between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel protesters as well as dueling accusations of antisemitism and Islamophobia, Landrieu said: \u201cThe president\u2019s been very clear about this. He\u2019s also been very strong about the need to stamp out antisemitism and Islamophobia. It\u2019s a very difficult time, [there are] very passionate opinions on both sides of this issue. \u201cThe president has been handling it I think very, very well and I think he will continue to do so.\u201d Thousands of young people have protested at university campuses across the country in recent weeks, criticizing the Biden administration\u2019s continued support of Israel. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and 2 million displaced, since Israel attacked the enclosed strip in response to Hamas terrorist attacks which killed more than 1,100 Israelis. Speaking on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Mark Kelly, the Arizona senator, added his voice to Democrats who have voiced approval for police crackdowns on campus sit-ins, saying it is \u201cappropriate for police to step in\u201d when protests turn into \u201cunlawful acts\u201d. \u201cWhen they cross a line and when they commit crimes, they should be arrested,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThat\u2019s the appropriate thing to do.\u201d Kelly said some of the university protests had \u201cbecome very violent, and students \u2013 especially Jewish students \u2013 have the right to feel safe on a campus, and they\u2019ve gotten out of control\u201d. \u201cEverybody has the right to protest peacefully. But when it turns into unlawful acts \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen this in a number of colleges and universities including here in Arizona \u2013 it\u2019s appropriate for the police to step in,\u201d he said. Biden had mostly stayed silent on the unrest at university campuses until he addressed the issue on Thursday. \u201cDissent is essential for democracy,\u201d Biden said in an address at the White House. \u201cBut dissent must never lead to disorder.\u201d Biden said some protesters had used \u201cviolent\u201d methods. \u201cViolent protests are not protected. Peaceful protest is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos.\u201d The president added: \u201cVandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campus, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation \u2026 none of this is a peaceful protest.\u201d On Sunday, Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, defended how the police have handled protests in the city. About 280 people were arrested at Columbia University and the City University of New York last week. \u201cWhen those protests reach the point of violence, we have to ensure that we use a minimum amount of force to terminate what is perceived to be a threat,\u201d Adams told ABC News This Week. John Fetterman, the Democratic Pennsylvania US senator who is a vocal supporter of Israel, said the protests were \u201cworking against peace in the Middle East\u201d and reiterated his backing for the US sending aid to the country. \u201cI will never support any kind of conditions on Israel during this. And again, I would, I am going to continue to center \u2013 Hamas is responsible for all of that again, then,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cAnd now if you\u2019re going to protest on these campuses, or now what, they\u2019re going all across America as well, too. I really want to, can\u2019t forget, that the situation right now could end right now, if Hamas just surrendered.\u201d Hours after calling in state troopers to break up a quiet, rain-soaked encampment of anti-war protesters, the University of Virginia president, Jim Ryan, issued a public statement calling the episode \u201cupsetting, frightening and sad\u201d. Ryan had been noticeably absent from the episode itself. His public statement Saturday evening, his first on the matter, came well after the encampment had been raided and the 25 demonstrators who had pitched tents on the patch of grass by the university\u2019s chapel were arrested. Ryan called it unfortunate that a small group had chosen to break university rules after receiving repeated warnings. \u201cI sincerely wish it were otherwise, but this repeated and intentional refusal to comply with reasonable rules intended to secure the safety, operations, and rights of the entire university community left us with no other choice than to uphold the neutral application and enforcement of those rules,\u201d he wrote. Nonetheless, the arrests were criticized by Jamaal Bowman, the New York progressive Democratic congressman who has been critical of Israel. \u201cI am outraged by the level of police presence called upon nonviolent student protestors on Columbia and CCNY\u2019s campuses. As an educator who has first hand experience with the over-policing of our schools, this is personal to me,\u201d Bowman wrote on X. \u201cThe militarization of college campuses, extensive police presence, and arrest of hundreds of students are in direct opposition to the role of education as a cornerstone of our democracy.\u201d"

            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s former communications director Hope Hicks provided testimony on Friday that could be helpful both to prosecutors and the former president\u2019s defense, revealing the fallout inside the Trump campaign in the wake of the damaging Access Hollywood tape on which Trump bragged about sexual assault. Here are the key takeaways from day 11 of People of New York v Donald J Trump: Hicks suggests Trump was behind money to Daniels Hicks bolstered a key part of the prosecutors\u2019 case that Trump was the source of the $130,000 paid to Stormy Daniels, when she cast doubt on the description relayed to her by Trump himself, that his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen had simply paid Daniels out of selflessness. Prosecutors asked on direct examination what Hicks thought of that account. \u201cThat would be out of character for Michael,\u201d Hicks acknowledged. \u201cI didn\u2019t know him to be an especially selfless person. He was the kind of person to seek credit.\u201d Hicks casting serious doubt on Trump\u2019s suggestion that Cohen paid the money was an important moment: she essentially discredited the Trump team\u2019s contention that the entire hush-money scheme was orchestrated by Cohen and Trump was removed from the operation. In doing so, Hicks also provided a second win for prosecutors, as she revealed that Trump had some direct knowledge about the hush-money scheme. Trump\u2019s lawyer Emil Bove twice objected when the Manhattan district attorney prosecutor Matthew Colangelo pried into whether it would have been out of character for Cohen to have paid the hush money without telling Trump, but the judge overruled both objections. Hicks helps Trump\u2019s \u2018Melania\u2019 defense Hicks handed a gift to Trump when she testified on direct examination that the reaction of his wife Melania was his biggest concern on the morning that the Wall Street Journal article detailing the hush-money payments came out three days before the 2016 election. \u201cHe was concerned about how it would be viewed by his wife,\u201d Hicks said. The Trump team suggested in opening statements that the main reason why the catch-and-kill scheme to buy Daniels\u2019 story happened was because Trump found it embarrassing for him and for Melania \u2013 an alternative explanation to prosecutors\u2019 case that it was to influence the election. Prosecutors subsequently tried to have Hicks add that Trump was also concerned about those stories derailing his 2016 campaign, but Hicks only offered that Trump was always asking how certain news would \u201cplay\u201d with voters. Hicks helps Trump distance Cohen Under cross-examination by the Trump lawyer Bove, Hicks also affirmed that Cohen had juvenile tendencies and that he often inserted himself into the Trump 2016 campaign unsolicited even though he had no formal role with the campaign, which had its own lawyers. Bove asked Hicks in a series of quickfire questions: If Cohen took \u201cunauthorized\u201d actions? If Cohen \u201cwent rogue\u201d? Or if Cohen sometimes did things that were unhelpful? \u201cHe liked to call himself \u2018fixer\u2019, or \u2018Mr Fix-It\u2019. And it was only because he first broke it.\u201d In granting that Cohen sometimes acted unilaterally, Hicks opened the door for Trump\u2019s team to lean into their contention that Trump was removed from the catch-and-kill schemes and it was Cohen freelancing his way through the operation."

The jury has been sent home and instructed to return next Tuesday. Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: Trump declined to testify at his own criminal trial after the defense rested its case after calling just two witnesses. Trump had previously railed about being silenced and falsely claimed he was not allowed to testify, but ultimately elected of his own volition not to take the stand in his own defense. Trump was joined by a huge entourage of supporters, including his sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, actor Joe Piscopo and Republican members of Congress. The trial resumed earlier this morning with continued cross-examination of Robert Costello, whom the defense has used to try to discredit the former president\u2019s one-time fixer, Michael Cohen. Costello was a defense lawyer with whom Cohen met after federal authorities raided his hotel room and apartment. Cohen told jurors that he was leery of Costello, who had described a close relationship with Trump ally Rudy Giuliani. Cohen said he didn\u2019t trust Costello, concerned that anything he said would get to Giuliani and thus, Trump. Here are the key takeaways from the trial on Monday. Cohen, the prosecution\u2019s most important witness, saw his testimony end on Monday and Costello\u2019s behavior on the stand almost spun the courtroom into chaos, and prompted a rebuke from the judge. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger showed emails Costello sent to Cohen in which he repeatedly dangled his close ties to Giuliani in the aftermath of the FBI raid. In one email, Costello told Cohen: \u201cSleep well tonight, you have friends in high places,\u201d and relayed that there were \u201csome very positive comments about you from the White House\u201d. Judge Merchan told jurors to return on Tuesday 28 May for closing arguments. Merchan said he would also announce his instructions to jurors the next day and expected that they would then start deliberating. Donald Trump Jr defended his father\u2019s decision not to testify. \u201cThere\u2019d be absolutely no reason, no justification to do that whatsoever. Everyone sees it for the sham that it is,\u201d he said at a news conference alongside other Trump allies near the courthouse. While Donald Trump floated the possibility of legal drama earlier in the hall \u2013 suggesting he might break the gag order \u2013 the likelihood of any eyebrow-raising courtroom antics remains practically nil this afternoon. Trump and his team, and prosecutors, returned to court this afternoon for a conference where they and the judge, Juan Merchan, discussed proposed instructions to the jury. This conference is ongoing. Judge Juan Merchan has denied the defense\u2019s request that he tell the jury that there was no limit on federal candidates\u2019 contributions to their own 2016 campaigns, AP reported. Per AP, Trump attorney Emil Bove suggested the language would help the jury \u201chave a full picture of what constitutes contributions and expenditures\u201d and understand that Donald Trump could have paid such sums as the Stormy Daniels payout \u2013 if it were deemed a campaign contribution \u2013 from his own funds. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo countered that campaign self-funding rules were \u201cextraneous and totally irrelevant\u201d to the case, according to AP. The judge concluded it was unnecessary but told defense lawyers they could argue in their summation that Trump could have paid Daniels himself, instead of Michael Cohen doing so. Donald Trump spoke to reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom before heading back inside after a long break. The former president said: I feel very good. I think we\u2019ve had a great case we\u2019ve put on. Per pool, Trump also spoke about the gag order, hinting that he may break it to to \u201cdefend our constitution\u201d so he will \u201ctake a chance\u201d. Trump is accompanied in court this afternoon by members of his entourage including his son, Donald Trump Jr, the former Hells Angel leader and actor Chuck Zito, and the actor Joe Piscopo, per the Times. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are talking about how both sides want to handle the Federal Election Campaign Act (Feca) in the jury instructions. The defense wants the word \u201cwillfully\u201d to be used when the judge, Juan Merchan, tells jurors about the election law violation. Trump attorney Emil Bove says: It\u2019s only a crime if it has a criminal object, if it\u2019s a non-criminal violation, we\u2019re talking, I submit, we\u2019re talking about a civil conspiracy, at most. Judge Juan Merchan is back on the bench and prosecutors and the defense are meeting now to work on jury instructions. Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers rested their defense on Tuesday morning, without the former president himself testifying. The jury has been sent home and instructed to return next Tuesday, in the meantime court will resume at 2.15pm ET today when prosecutors and the defense will discuss the instructions that will be given to jurors before they start deliberating. Here\u2019s a recap of the latest developments: Trump declined to testify at his own criminal trial. Trump had previously railed about being silenced and falsely claimed he was not allowed to testify, but ultimately elected of his own volition not to take the stand in his own defense. Trump was joined by a huge entourage of supporters, including his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, actor Joe Piscopo and Republican members of congress. The trial resumed earlier Monday with continued cross-examination of Robert Costello, whom the defense has used to try to discredit the former president\u2019s one-time fixer, Michael Cohen. Costello was a defense lawyer with whom Cohen met after federal authorities raided his hotel room and apartment. Cohen told jurors that he was leery of Costello, who had described a close relationship with Trump ally Rudy Giuliani. Cohen said he didn\u2019t trust Costello, concerned that anything he said would get to Giuliani and thus, Trump. Here are the key takeaways from the trial on Monday. Cohen, the prosecution\u2019s most important witness, saw his testimony end on Monday and Costello\u2019s behavior on the stand almost spun the courtroom into chaos, and prompted a rebuke from the judge. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger showed emails Costello sent to Cohen in which he repeatedly dangled his close ties to Giuliani in the aftermath of the FBI raid. In one email, Costello told Cohen: \u201cSleep well tonight, you have friends in high places,\u201d and relayed that there were \u201csome very positive comments about you from the White House\u201d. Judge Merchan told jurors to return on Tuesday 28 May for closing arguments. Merchan said he would also announce his instructions to jurors the next day and expected that they would then start deliberating. Donald Trump Jr defended his father\u2019s decision not to testify. \u201cThere\u2019d be absolutely no reason, no justification to do that whatsoever. Everyone sees it for the sham that it is,\u201d he said at a news conference alongside other Trump allies near the courthouse. No cameras are allowed inside the courtroom while proceedings are under way, but a courtroom sketch artist has captured this morning\u2019s scenes. Donald Trump Jr was joined by a group of Trump allies that included Republican state leaders, lawmakers, state attorneys general at a news conference near the courthouse. \u201cWe are here because we are friends of Donald Trump, the president of the United States, and when a friend has trouble, friends have his back,\u201d said Dan Patrick, the Texas lieutenant governor, AP reported. If they can go after the former president of the United States of America, who has the ability and the financial resources to fight back, what happens to the average American. Per AP, Texas congressman Troy Nehls, wearing a tie with a pattern of photographs of Trump holding the American flag, said: They don\u2019t want him on the ballot \u2026 This is five weeks in a courtroom when he should be out reaching the American people and telling the American people what he would like to do for this country. Outside the courthouse, Donald Trump Jr attacked a question about why his father didn\u2019t testify in his own defense: Why would you justify this insanity? You don\u2019t subject yourself to that. You\u2019re going in a kangaroo court, nothing more nothing less. There\u2019s absolutely no reason or justification to do that whatsoever. Everyone sees it for the sham that it is. Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers on Monday moved to have the judge, Juan Merchan, dismiss the case before jury deliberations, arguing that there was no evidence that Trump had committed the crimes. The defense argued that the case rests on the testimony of a witness, the estranged former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, who has a well-documented history of lying. \u201cThere is no way that the court should let this case go to the jury relying on Cohen\u2019s testimony,\u201d Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said outside the presence of the jury, adding that without Cohen\u2019s testimony \u201cthere is no case\u201d. Merchan reserved judgment on deciding on their request, but the possibility that he grants it is very remote. Merchan, addressing Blanche, said: You said that his lies are irrefutable, but do you think he\u2019s going to fool 12 New Yorkers? Donald Trump earlier refused to answer a reporter\u2019s question about whether he wanted to create a unified reich. The question referred to a video that appeared on Trump\u2019s Truth Social account that included the words \u201cunified reich\u201d among hypothetical news headlines if he wins the November election. The text appears in the background of a 30-second clip that makes staple Trump campaign promises, such as closing the border and mass deportations, and it may have been lifted from Wikipedia, AP reports. Joe Biden\u2019s re-election operation said the video is further proof of the ex-president\u2019s dictatorial intent if he is returned to the White House. Biden-Harris campaign spokesperson James Singer said in a statement last night: America, stop scrolling and pay attention. Donald Trump is not playing games; he is telling America exactly what he intends to do if he regains power: rule as a dictator over a \u2018unified reich\u2019. In a statement, Trump\u2019s campaign press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, blamed the posting of a video that included the word \u201cunified reich\u201d on a third party, and a mix-up by a staffer: This was not a campaign video, it was created by a random account online and reposted by a staffer who clearly did not see the word, while the President was in court. Donald Trump will not take the stand in his own criminal trial, after his defense lawyers rested their case on Tuesday morning after calling just two witnesses. The former president previously said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d testify in his hush money trial, telling reporters last month: I\u2019m testifying. I tell the truth, I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there is no case. Trump became more noncommittal in a later interview with Newsmax, where he said only that he would testify \u201cif it\u2019s necessary\u201d. Trump\u2019s legal spokesperson, Alina Habba, said yesterday: We know he wants to testify. He is willing, he is able, he is nothing to hide at all. He\u2019s absolutely ready to tell the truth. Trump has repeatedly falsely claimed that he is not allowed to testify because of a court-imposed gag order. In fact, Juan Merchan\u2019s order does not in any way stop Trump from testifying. Legal experts have widely suggested Trump testifying would almost certainly be a mistake, given his track record of making self-incriminating comments. Judge Juan Merchan tells the jury he intends to adjourn Donald Trump\u2019s criminal trial now, resuming next Tuesday. At that time, you will hear summations of the attorneys. And the next day, you will hear my jury charge and then I expect you will begin your deliberations at some point on Wednesday. Merchan instructs both sides to return at 2:15pm ET, where they will address jury instructions. This part is key \u2013 it will likely to get to how the jury needs to interpret Donald Trump\u2019s alleged intent to commit a second crime by falsifying business records. The jury has left the courtroom, and Merchan is off the bench. Robert Costello is off the stand. The defense rests. Trump attorney Emil Bove asked about the email in which Robert Costello told Michael Cohen to let his concerns be known. \u201cWas that you pressuring Michael Cohen to do anything?\u201d \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Costello said. Was Costello just giving him options, Bove pressed? \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cDid you ever pressure Michael Cohen to do anything?\u201d \u201cI did not,\u201d Costello replied. \u201cDid you ever have control over Michael Cohen?\u201d Costello smiled and said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Trump attorney Emil Bove is asking Robert Costello about whether Michael Cohen agreed for him to be his attorney. Every time Costello\u2019s colleague asked Cohen about the retainer, \u201c\u2018Michael, have you signed the retainer yet?\u2019, he had an excuse,\u201d he said. \u201cWere you concerned that you were representing Michael Cohen but he hadn\u2019t signed a retainer agreement?\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Costello replied. It seems that Bove is trying to suggest that Cohen\u2019s wariness toward Costello indicates flakiness and thus, unreliability. Hence the question about whether Cohen had ever signed a retainer; Bove was trying to imply that Cohen was stringing Costello along, as a way of undermining his character. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger has wrapped up her cross-examination of Robert Costello and Trump attorney Emil Bove is back up at the podium again. Bove is pointing to an email from 20 April 2018 that said \u201cI will be on the team\u201d and featured a quote from Michael Cohen expressing how excited he was to have Costello on board; this appears to be a draft announcement or press release. Costello had sent this email to his son, apparently out of excitement over representing Cohen. (Context: Cohen has said that he never agreed for Costello to represent him, nor did he. This is early on, around when Costello met with Cohen; the former Trump fixer described being leery of Costello because of his tight relationship with Rudy Giuliani.) In a 22 June email, Robert Costello wrote to a colleague: [Michael] Cohen has to know this yet he continues to slow play us and the president \u2013 is he totally nuts??? I am in a golf tournament tomorrow early and again on Sunday. What should I say to this asshole? He is playing with the most powerful man on the planet. \u201cThis note speaks for itself, doesn\u2019t it Mr Costello?\u201d prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked. \u201cYes, it does,\u201d Costello said. Hoffinger asked Costello: did he lose control of Cohen? When he pleaded guilty in 2018? He replied: I certainly didn\u2019t have any control when he pled guilty. Did he have animosity toward Cohen? Costello said: I don\u2019t have animosity \u2013 \u201cDo you have animosity against Michael Cohen?\u201d Hoffinger pressed. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cLast week, on May 15, didn\u2019t you go to Congress to testify about the case, about Michael Cohen?\u201d she asked. Donald Trump, speaking before court, said the defense will be \u201cresting\u201d soon, but he won\u2019t be \u201cresting\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll be doing something in the morning and then probably coming back in the afternoon. And we\u2019ll be resting pretty quickly,\u201d he told the media. He added, however: I won\u2019t be resting. I don\u2019t rest. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger pointed to a message where Robert Costello wrote to Michael Cohen which read: If you really believe you are not being supported by your former boss, then you should make your position known. \u201cYou wrote that to him, right.,\u201d Hoffinger asked. Costello answered in the affirmative. Was he angry? No. Was he upset? No. \u201cDid you believe that he was also playing President Trump, correct?\u201d Hoffinger asked. Costello replied: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct. In another missive to Michael Cohen, Robert Costello said: I spoke with Rudy [Giuliani]. Very, very positive. You are \u2018loved. If you want to\u2019 call me I will give you the details \u2026 Rudy said this communication channel must be maintained. He called it crucial... Costello\u2019s email continued: Our issue is to get Cohen on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president. In my opinion this is the clear correct strategy. We must reverse the [Michael] Avenatti effect and restore this to a far more simple investigation of things that while they might not look good politically and nevertheless legal. Asked about this email, Costello told the jury: Michael Costello had been complaining incessantly, frankly, that Rudy Giuliani was making statements in the press that Michael Cohen didn\u2019t approve of, that\u2019s why I said to him if you really feel that way make it known... Susan Hoffinger, in resuming he cross-examination of Robert Costello, is grilling him on his relationship with Rudy Giuliani. (Recall: Michael Cohen had chatted with Costello after the feds raided his home and hotel room in April 2018. Cohen said that Costello gave him pause, due to the attorney\u2019s relationship with Giuliani. Cohen testified that he feared that anything he said to Costello would get to Giuliani and thus, in turn, trickle to his ex-boss, Donald Trump.) It appears that prosecutors had elicited this testimony from Cohen as a way of explaining why he wasn\u2019t immediately forthcoming about Trump\u2019s alleged wrongdoing. The defense called Costello on Monday, as its second witness. They tried to use Costello to discredit Cohen, as he testified that Trump\u2019s former consigliere said he didn\u2019t have anything on Trump. But on cross today, Hoffinger presented emails that showed Costello was close to Giuliani. In an email to a colleague, Costello wrote: All the more reason for Cohen to hire me because of my connection to Giuliani, which I mentioned to him in our meeting In an 21 April 2015 email to Cohen, Costello wrote: I just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on your team. Rudy was thrilled... Donald Trump addressed the media before heading inside the Manhattan courthouse, where he claimed that \u201cevery single scholar says there\u2019s been no crime\u201d in his hush-money trial, per pool report. The former president repeated the talking points he usually sticks to, per the pooler, railing that the judge, Juan Merchan, was conflicted and slamming the case. According to the pool, he did not answer a question about whether he wanted to create a unified reich. Trump, the pooler noted, could be heard saying to his group, \u201canother day in paradise\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s entourage today includes Donald Trump Jr, Boris Epshteyn, Pam Bondi and Matt Whitaker \u2013 and Seb Gorka, who carried in a silver metal briefcase with a large presidential seal on its side. Gorka often walks around with White House memorabilia. When he attended Trump\u2019s campaign launch in 2022 at Mar-a-Lago, he arrived in Palm Beach with a binder with the presidential seal on the front. Court is now in session. Judge Juan Merchan has taken the bench. Robert Costello has returned to the witness stand and the jury is entering momentarily. Among those joining Donald Trump today in court to support the former president in his criminal trial is a former leader of a New York Hells Angels chapter who spent years in prison on drug charges. Chuck Zito \u201chelped found in the early 1980s the New York Nomads chapter of the Hells Angels, the infamous club that started in California. The justice department described the organization as a criminal enterprise and linked the New York chapter to the Gambino crime family. Mr Zito later left the biker group to try to become a movie star in Hollywood,\u201d per the Times. Zito now sells T-shirts on his website, Chuck Zito\u2019s Italian Bay Boy Apparel. In addition to shirts with this slogan, his tees have voiced support for the ex-president, such as \u201cTrump\u2019s the best, fuck the rest\u201d and, \u201cimpeach my balls.\u201d Donald Trump has entered the courtroom and made a gesture to someone. Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush-money trial entered its 19th day on Monday in Manhattan with what has become a routine procession, with a phalanx of supporters that included his son, Eric, Kash Patel and the law professor Alan Dershowitz, a former leader of the New York Hells Angels chapter, and a disgraced former NYPD commissioner. Here are some key takeaways from the day\u2019s proceedings: 1. Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony concluded: Cohen, who took the stand on Monday, 13 May and was the prosecution\u2019s most important witness, saw his cross-examination, and re-direct, end this afternoon. Indeed, prosecutors said that Trump, Cohen and tabloid honcho David Pecker plotted in summer 2015 to keep negative press about the then-candidate under wraps \u2013 so as not to derail his presidential campaign. During his direct testimony, Cohen told jurors that Trump instructed him to fix Stormy Daniels\u2019 account of an extramarital liaison in 2006 and personally signed checks that reimbursed him for the $130,000 hush-money payment. Trump\u2019s lead attorney, Todd Blanche, struggled to hit Cohen with \u201cgotcha\u201d moments, and the closest he arguably came was in offering an alternative explanation about why the ex-president\u2019s longtime confidant would receive $420,000 in payments for a $130,000 cost. 2. Cohen regained his footing on re-direct: After cross wrapped, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger had an opportunity to question Cohen again. She tried to undermine Blanche\u2019s suggestion that Cohen\u2019s cooperation against Trump was out of self-interest. She asked what had happened to him since he started speaking out and, ultimately, cooperating with law enforcement. \u201cMy entire life has been turned upside down as a direct result, I lost my law license, my businesses, my financial security,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWould you have paid Stormy Daniels if Mr Trump had not signed off?\u201d Hoffinger pressed. He said: \u201cNo ma\u2019am\u201d, and, when asked why not, he explained: \u201cBecause, I wanted to ensure that I\u2019d get my funds back.\u201d 3. Robert Costello claimed Cohen cleared Trump in conversations: Costello was a defense lawyer with whom Cohen met after federal authorities raided his hotel room and apartment. Cohen told jurors that he was leery of Costello, who had described a close relationship with Trump ally Rudy Giuliani. Cohen said he didn\u2019t trust Costello, concerned that anything he said would get to Giuliani and thus, Trump. Costello said he met Cohen on 17 April 2018, at the hotel where he was staying. \u201cI explained to Michael Cohen that this entire legal problem he was facing would be resolved by the end of the week if he had truthful information about Donald Trump and cooperated with the southern district of New York,\u201d Costello told jurors. Cohen allegedly claimed: \u201cI swear to god, Bob, I don\u2019t have anything on Donald Trump. 4. Costello prompted near-chaos in court: Despite Costello\u2019s comments on Cohen, he wasn\u2019t exactly a great witness for the defense because of his courtroom composure. He said \u201cjeez\u201d at one point and instructed that something be stricken \u2013 which is something only a judge can do. Judge Juan Merchan directed the jury to leave at one point during his testimony and then told Costello: \u201cSo when there\u2019s a witness on the stand and you don\u2019t like my ruling, you don\u2019t say \u2018jeez,\u2019 and you don\u2019t say \u2018strike it\u2019. Because I\u2019m the only one who can strike ... \u201d Merchan said. It devolved further. \u201cYou don\u2019t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?\u201d Merchan said. Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade has arrived at the Manhattan courthouse. Donald Trump has left Trump Tower to attend the latest day in court. Proceedings are due to start at 9.30am ET, with prosecutor Susan Hoffinger continuing to question Robert Costello. Both the prosecution and the defense have signaled they do not expect to need much longer before wrapping up their cases. Earlier on Monday, the prosecution attempted to undercut the Trump team\u2019s contention that Michael Cohen lied whenever it suited his needs, such as when he lied to a federal judge in 2018 that he was not pressured into pleading guilty to tax evasion \u2013 which he later disavowed. The prosecution suggested that lying to the judge in 2018 was not comparable to lying on the stand in Trump\u2019s trial, as Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued, because unlike in 2018 the current case does not involve Cohen or his wife facing potential jail time. \u201cIs this different?\u201d prosecutor Susan Hoffinger asked Cohen, referencing the 2018 incident. \u201cThe other one, it was, my life was on the line \u2026 my liberty,\u201d Cohen said. I was the defendant in that case, and here I\u2019m just a non-party subpoenaed witness. Trump will once again be joined in the courtroom by political allies, according to CNN. Among those expected at the Manhattan criminal court today are Trump\u2019s son Don Jr; Sebastian Gorka, a former aide to Trump and an ex-editor at the rightwing website Breitbart; and Trump\u2019s former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, who was a prominent critic of the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference in 2016. CNN has a list of all the people expected to join Trump in court today: Donald Trump Jr Former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker Former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi Republican senator Eric Schmitt Republican representative Daniel Webster Republican representative Dan Meuser Republican representative Ronny Jackson Republican representative Troy Nehls Republican representative Dale Strong Republican representative Maria Salazar Former leader of a New York Hells Angels Chapter Chuck Zito Sebastian Gorka Joe Piscopo Bill White The Washington Post has more details on the courtroom chaos caused by Costello on Monday. After the judge, Juan Merchan, removed the media from the courtroom, he told Costello his \u201cconduct is contemptuous\u201d, court transcripts show. He also told Costello he would remove him as a witness if he did not change his behavior. \u201cIf you try to stare me down one more time, I will remove you from the stand. I will strike this entire testimony; do you understand me?\u201d Trump\u2019s attorney Emil Bove answered for Costello, saying: \u201cYes Judge. I understand.\u201d Costello then tried to make a comment, to which Merchan replied: \u201cNo. No. This is not a conversation.\u201d Donald Trump is almost certain not to testify in his own defense, based on his lawyers\u2019 comments in court. Legal experts have widely suggested Trump testifying would almost certainly be a mistake, given his track record of making self-incriminating comments. After Robert Costello is finished, the defense is likely to rest their case, although calendar issues may mean the judge adjourns trial until 28 May, when the jury could start deliberations. Yesterday\u2019s testimony from Robert Costello was in direct conflict with Michael Cohen\u2019s recollection of the extent of Donald Trump\u2019s involvement and knowledge in the hush-money scheme, including that he had told Trump he was going ahead with paying hush money to Stormy Daniels on a call in October 2016. Costello, who almost came to represent Cohen after Cohen was charged by federal prosecutors with tax evasion in 2018, testified that he advised Cohen to cooperate with federal prosecutors in that case and offer any information he had on Trump. Cohen lamented: \u201cI swear to God, Bob, I don\u2019t have anything on Donald Trump,\u201d and that Trump \u201cknew nothing\u201d about the hush-money payments, Costello recalled. He said: Michael Cohen said numerous times that President Trump knew nothing about those payments, that he did this on his own, and he repeated that numerous times. Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s former fixer, testified on Monday that he knew the hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels violated federal election law \u2013 even though he claimed otherwise in 2018. The implication of Cohen\u2019s testimony was that Trump, by extension, must also have believed to some extent that the hush-money payment violated the Federal Election Campaign Act. Cohen\u2019s evidence marked an important moment as Trump\u2019s criminal trial hurtles to a conclusion, since it was the closest the prosecution has come to tie Trump to the alleged falsification of business records with an intent to commit a second crime, including the federal campaign contributions law. \u201cIs that a truthful sentence,\u201d asked the prosecutor Susan Hoffinger, referring to a letter Cohen had sent to the Federal Elections Commission stating that the $130,000 payment was done in his personal capacity and therefore not a campaign contribution or expenditure. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d Cohen replied. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of felony falsification of business records. Prosecutors must prove Trump authorized what he knew to be hush-money repayments to be falsely labeled as \u201clegal expenses\u201d in the Trump Organization\u2019s records, with an intent to commit a second, election crime. Good morning. A defense witness called by Donald Trump\u2019s legal team will return to the stand this morning a day after he was reprimanded by the presiding judge, Juan Merchan, for his behavior. Merchan briefly closed the courtroom on Monday afternoon and forced reporters out after he admonished Robert Costello, a lawyer close to Trump\u2019s associates who almost came to represent Michael Cohen after he was charged by federal prosecutors with tax evasion in 2018. Costello muttered under his breath \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cjeez\u201d and sighed loudly when the judge sustained the prosecution\u2019s objections. Addressing Costello, Merchan said: If you don\u2019t like my ruling, you don\u2019t say \u2018jeez\u2019 \u2026 You don\u2019t give me side eye, and you don\u2019t roll your eyes \u2026 Are you staring me down right now? Costello took the stand on Monday afternoon after prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office rested their case following Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony. Cohen, whose $130,000 hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels is at the heart of the criminal case against Trump, testified that he knew the payment violated federal election law.

The government\u2019s projected $9.3bn surplus will be funded by slugging the NDIS with $14.4bn in savings measures and crucially, decisions not to increase spending or any immediate solutions to address the housing crisis will see many renters and aspiring homeowners continue to suffer. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 2024 federal budget winners and losers. WINNERS Low-income renters Australians who are on lower incomes and receive certain welfare payments are set for a boost in the amount of government rental support they\u2019re eligible for. To help Australians on the lowest incomes, the government will bolster its Commonwealth Rent Assistance program, available for those on the disability support pension, carer payment, age pension, jobseeker, youth allowance, Austudy, parenting payments, or family tax benefit (part B) paying above a certain amount on rent. Just under one million Australian households renting in the private market or from a community provider will enjoy a 10% increase on the maximum rate of rent assistance available to them under the scheme, as part of the changes that will take effect from September. This follows a 15% increase in last year\u2019s budget. To give you an idea of what a Commonwealth Rent Assistance payment typically looks like, as of December, the average recipient was paying about $590 in rent each fortnight, and receiving about $158 in rent assistance. But the amount each recipient is eligible for depends on their household type and how high their rent is. The government will spend $1.9bn increasing the maximum rent assistance rates over the next five years. However, as treasurer Jim Chalmers said in his budget speech, this measure brings \u201cmuch-needed help\u201d only to those \u201cdoing it tough\u201d. Renters who don\u2019t receive welfare support payments or the means tested family tax benefit don\u2019t get any rent assistance as part of this announcement, and amid a national crisis in which rents increased by more than 10% in 2023, this increase does not go very far at all. Renewable energy manufacturing businesses The government wants to boost local manufacturing of solar panels and bolster the green hydrogen industry. Local solar panel manufacturers will have access to subsidies, grants and other supports, as will local battery manufacturing operations, as the government spends $1.5bn on boosting the country\u2019s capability and resilience against supply chain disruptions from countries such as China, which controls about four-fifths of the global solar panel market. The government has also allocated $6.7bn over the next 10 years on a Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive, which will pay $2 a kilogram of locally produced renewable hydrogen from 2027-28. This of course all comes alongside the government\u2019s flagship Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, so it\u2019s broadly a good budget for local manufacturing. Women The government will spend $1.1bn over four years to pay superannuation on government-funded paid parental leave from July 2025, to address the disparity in retirement incomes between men and women which is now at 25%. There\u2019s $56m for a raft of women\u2019s health initiatives, including $12.5m over four years for the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health organisation to provide free period products, $7m over four years to support women and families who have suffered miscarriage, and $5.2m over three years to train health workers to insert and remove long-acting reversible contraceptives, as well as training for GPs to better treat menopause. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Women will also benefit from higher rebates for longer consultations for patients with complex gynaecological conditions such as endometriosis, which the government will spend $49.1m subsidising. There will also be a gender audit of Medicare-funded service \u2013 for example, the current rebate on ultrasounds of the scrotum is significantly higher than for a female pelvic ultrasound \u2013 and measures to improve access to affordable abortion services by easing rules around ultrasounds. Prior to Tuesday\u2019s budget, the government also announced a program to help women leaving domestic violence situations, with payments of up to $5,000 and access to other support services at a cost of $756.4m over five years. A significant portion of existing social housing spending has also been redirected to crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children fleeing domestic violence. Small businesses In addition to the household energy bill relief, around one million small businesses will be eligible to receive a $325 rebate on electricity costs. The instant asset write-off scheme has also been extended again. Businesses with an aggregated annual turnover of less than $10m will continue to be able to immediately deduct the full cost of eligible assets under $20,000, provided they\u2019re first used or installed and ready by the end of June 2025. The scheme can be taken advantage of on multiple assets. Pensioners, cancer patients and Australians requiring PBS medicines The cost of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) will be frozen for a year, for Medicare cardholders with a prescription. For pensioners and concession cardholders, the co-payment cost of PBS medicines will be frozen for five years. The government will spend $469.1m on these subsidies. Additionally, it will spend $3.4bn listing new medicines on the PBS, including medications for cardiac disease, and a breast cancer medication that will see per treatment cost cut from about $100,000 to $31.60. The government will also spend $1.4bn over the next 13 years on the Medical Research Future Fund, including more than $400m for low survival cancers and addressing health inequities. Motorists The government is spending big on road safety and upgrades. Several measures in this budget aim to tackle the nation\u2019s worsening road death toll, with spending on the Roads to Recovery and Black Spot programs to progressively increase to $1bn and $150m respectively by 2033-34. The safer local roads and infrastructure program, to address heavy vehicle road safety and bridge renewal, will also receive $200m in funding each year until 2033-34. The government has also announced it will spend $21.2m over six years to improve data collation of road safety incidents across states to form a National Roads Safety data hub. A one-year national road safety education and awareness campaign will also be funded to the tune of $10.8m. Meanwhile, the government will spend billions on new roads in western Sydney, as well as on existing key road projects across the country, including Melbourne\u2019s North East Link. It will also spend hundreds of millions upgrading roads in the Northern Territory, as well as key highways in all states and territories. Disorganised travellers The frantic rush to the post office to renew a passport in the lead up to an overseas holiday appears to be on the rise, and the government has figured out a new way to help this disorganised type of traveller while boosting its budget. Fast track processing of passports will become an option from July. For an additional fee of $100, you can have your passport processed in just five business days. The government expects to make $27.4m from this express passport option over five years, with the money to be directed to support the work of the department of foreign affairs and trade, so if the tourist who didn\u2019t check their passport expiry date also didn\u2019t check visa rules in a foreign country and finds themselves detained, they\u2019ll likely benefit from the consular services their speedy passport fees have funded. It\u2019s important to note, the government already offers a \u201cpriority processing\u201d option which costs $252 for a two-day turnaround, but only certain people can pay for this option. Anyone who has lost their passport twice in the past five years is ineligible. So this new \u201cfast track\u201d option to pay $100 extra for a five-day turnaround serves as a middle ground for those who may be ineligible for the faster option or don\u2019t want to pay more than $250, but who cannot risk waiting weeks in the standard passport application process. Those with student debt Gaining significant attention when announced in the lead up to the budget, the government is capping indexation of student loans to either the consumer price index or the wage price index, whichever is lower. Cutting around $3bn in student debts through the changes to the Hecs and Help loan programs, the initiative will be backdated to mid-2023, reversing last year\u2019s horror 7.1% indexation hike and providing a $1,200 saving for the average person with student debt. Freight rail operators After years of wild weather including floods destroying sections of regional train tracks and ballooning freight rail delivery times by forcing roundabout diversions, the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC), which manages large chunks of the tracks relied on by the nation\u2019s freight rail operators, is set for reliability improvements. In an effort to remove trucks from roads and push freight on to rail, the ARTC will receive $540m to upgrade key sections of track to make sending freight by rail more reliable, including in regional Victoria and Western Australia. LOSERS Renters on average incomes and aspiring homeowners The government has acknowledged the country is in the grips of a housing crisis, with average rents consistently rising, property ownership increasingly out of reach for workers and housing construction falling well short of national and state targets. However there is little in this budget that will bring immediate relief, or even cause for short to medium term optimism, for middle and high income renters. For those renters eager to escape the constant fear of rent rises and buy their first home, there are no structural changes such as to negative gearing rules that would shake up the ownership dynamic of the housing market. And while the government is continuing billions in investments in home construction initiatives with the states, these are only expected to begin to significantly boost housing stock towards the end of the decade. The lack of any significant near future solutions in this budget means most renters and aspiring homeowners will continue bearing the brunt of the housing crisis. Tax dodgers Cracking down on multinationals, large public and private companies and high-wealth individuals will be the focus of the tax office\u2019s Tax Avoidance taskforce, which is being extended by a further two years, until July 2028. Extending the taskforce will cost the government $1.2bn over the next five years, but will raise tax revenue by $2.4bn. And while they haven\u2019t exactly been cheating the system, foreign residents in Australia will be subject to a stronger capital gains tax regime more in line with what Australian residents pay, affecting the tax they pay when selling properties and shares. The government expects to raise $600m in tax from these changes over the next five years, and will spend $8m on the changes. Fraudsters The government will spend $67.5m over the next four years to combat scams and online fraud, with the government to legislate a Scams Code Framework which will include mandatory codes for different industries. Telecommunications, banks and digital platforms such as social media and search engines will be targeted initially, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to receive $37.3m over the four years to administer and enforce the codes so that businesses in various industries address scams on their platforms and services. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will also receive $23.3m over four years to operate a secure eInvoicing network, while the ACCC will receive $6.3m this coming financial year to improve public awareness of scams and help the public avoid and report them. NDIS recipients and providers The government\u2019s headline surplus has been achieved in part through a significant saving on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, with spending on the program predicted to be $14bn less over four years than projected in the mid year economic and fiscal outlook. The government will also spend about $84m over two years to boost fraud detection capability at the National Disability Insurance Agency, as it looks to strengthen the integrity of the NDIS and weed out what has been a growing trend of providers gaming the scheme. International students A cap on the number of international students at Australian universities was announced in the lead up to the budget, with the sector voicing its concern at lower revenues from the high-fee paying cohort traditionally seen as a cash cow to subsidise the cost for local students. In the budget, the government has revealed its plan to regulate the caps based on how much student accommodation a university builds. In an acknowledgment of the added burden international students place on the already strained supply of housing for young Australians, the government will require any increase in international student enrolments to be tied to the amount of new housing a university builds. \u201cIf universities want to take more international students, they must build more student accommodation,\u201d Chalmers said in his speech on Tuesday night."

            "date": "2024-05-14T14:08:04Z",
            "content": "Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine, Niger\u2019s prime minister, has blamed the US for a rupture in an important military pact between the two countries that allows US forces to station in the west African nation. In an interview with the Washington Post, Zeine said US officials had attempted to dictate which countries Niger could align with, had failed to justify the presence of US troops in the country while \u201cdoing nothing\u201d to counter an Islamist insurgency in the region. \u201cThe Americans stayed on our soil, doing nothing while the terrorists killed people and burned towns,\u201d Zeine told the Post. \u201cIt is not a sign of friendship to come on our soil but let the terrorists attack us. We have seen what the United States will do to defend its allies, because we have seen Ukraine and Israel.\u201d Last year, a military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat ousted Niger\u2019s democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum. Washington then froze security support and paused counter-terrorism activities run out of Air Base 201, where the US conducts drone surveillance of the Islamic State and al-Qaida-affiliated groups in the Sahel and stationed more than 1,000 military personnel. Last month, the US acted on Niger\u2019s demands that US troops leave and agreed to withdraw its forces. The cancellation of the US-Niger security pact has stirred fears of a loss of US influence and a replacement by Russian power in west Africa. Neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali, where Russia\u2019s Wagner mercenary group has established a presence, are already considered to be close to Moscow. After last July\u2019s coup in Niger and before his assassination in August, the Wagner group leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, issued a statement welcoming the new military government and offering it Wagner\u2019s services. US diplomats and military officials made a counter-offer designed to keep cooperation in place, but Russia has dispatched troops to the capital, Niamey. Russian and US troops now occupy opposite ends of an airbase. In his interview with the Post, Zeine revealed the extent of the breakdown in US-Niger relations. Zeine said leaders of Niger\u2019s new government, known as the National Council for Safeguarding the Homeland, or CNSP, were unhappy that the US had frozen military support but kept US troops in the country. Gen Michael Langley, head of the US Africa Command, told a Senate armed services committee meeting in March that while the US was no longer conducting counter-terrorism operations from Niger, a US military presence in the region was necessary to counter Russian encroachment. \u201cI\u2019d say that a number of countries are at the tipping point of actually being captured by the Russian Federation as they are spreading some of their false narratives across Libya,\u201d he said. \u201cAt [an] accelerated pace, [the] Russian Federation is really trying to take over central Africa, as well as the Sahel.\u201d Zeine said that the US response to Niger\u2019s coup contrasted with responses from Russia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates that had welcomed the new leadership in Niamey with \u201copen arms\u201d. \u201cNigeriens were saying, \u2018Americans are our friends, they will help us this time to annihilate the terrorists.\u2019 But there was radio silence,\u201d Zeine told the newspaper, adding that Niger would have not looked to Russia for help if the US had responded to requests for more support, including for planes, drones and air defense systems. But he also said he had told the US delegation that Niger still desired economic and diplomatic relations with the US. \u201cIf American investors arrived, we would give them what they wanted. We have uranium. We have oil. We have lithium. Come, invest. It is all we want.\u201d Zeine told the Post he took offense at remarks by Molly Phee, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, who he said had directed Niger to resist engaging with Russia and Iran if it wanted to continue its security relationship with the US and threatened sanctions if Niger pursued a deal to sell uranium to Iran. Zeine said that \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d has been signed with Iran. The Niger leader said he had told Phee that she had \u201ccome here to threaten us in our country. That is unacceptable. And you have come here to tell us with whom we can have relationships, which is also unacceptable. And you have done it all with a condescending tone and a lack of respect.\u201d In a response, a US official told the Washington Post that the message relayed to Niamey was \u201cdelivered in a professional manner, in response to valid concerns about developments\u201d."

            "date": "2024-05-02T21:31:46Z",
            "content": "The trial of a US military contractor accused of contributing to the abuse of detainees in Iraq two decades ago, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, collapsed on Thursday when an eight-person civil jury in Virginia failed to return a verdict. Caci Premier Technology, a private company contracted by the US government to provide civilian interrogators at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 and 2004, had been accused of conspiring with US soldiers to physically and mentally assault those held with the intention of \u201csoftening them up\u201d for questioning. Horrific leaked images from Abu Ghraib of a hooded detainee standing on a box attached to electrical wiring, and others piled naked while smiling army soldiers gave thumbs-up signs, became synonymous with widespread abuses committed by American troops, and sparked global outrage. A federal judge in Alexandria declared a mistrial on Thursday after the jury said it was deadlocked and could not reach a verdict following the six-day trial and almost eight days of deliberations. Caci, based in Reston, Virginia, had argued it was not complicit in the abuse because its employees had little to no interaction with the three plaintiffs,and that any liability for their mistreatment belonged to the US government. They jury sent out a note saying it was deadlocked, and indicating in particular that it was hung up on a legal principle known as the \u201cborrowed servants\u201d doctrine. The plaintiffs, Suhail Najim Abdullah Al Shimari, Salah Al-Ejaili and As\u2019ad Al-Zuba\u2019e, Iraqi civilians who were detained at Abu Ghraib before being released in 2004, will seek a retrial, their lawyers said. Baher Azmy, legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) that represented them, told the Guardian in a statement: \u201cWe are, of course, disappointed by the jury\u2019s failure to reach a unanimous verdict in favor of our plaintiffs despite the wealth of evidence. \u201cBut we remain awed by the courage of our clients, who have fought for justice for their torment for 16 years. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case again.\u201d Al-Ejaili, meanwhile, said he was grateful the plaintiffs\u2019 voices were heard. \u201cIt is enough that we tried and didn\u2019t remain silent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might not have received justice yet in our just case today, but what is more important is that we made it to trial and spoke up so the world could hear from us directly. This will not be the final word; what happened in Abu Ghraib is engraved into our memories and will never be forgotten in history.\u201d Prosecutors in the trial, which began on 15 April, detailed \u201csadistic, blatant and wanton abuses\u201d of those rounded up by US forces. The lawsuit said Al-Ejaili, who was working as journalist for Al Jazeera when he was detained, was left naked for hours with his hands tied, repeatedly beaten, and threatened with dogs. Zuba\u2019e said his captors tortured him with extremely hot and cold water, beat his genitals with a stick, and kept him in a solitary cell for nearly a year; while Al Shimari, who was detained for for two months at Abu Ghraib, was subjected to electric shocks, food deprivation and forced physical activity to the point of exhaustion. None of the three were ever charged or provided with a reason for their arrest. CCR lawyers argued that Caci was liable for their mistreatment even if they could not prove their interrogators were the ones who directly inflicted the abuse. Other evidence included reports from two retired army generals, who documented the abuse and concluded that multiple Caci interrogators were complicit. The reports concluded that one of the interrogators, Steven Stefanowicz, lied to investigators about his conduct, and that he probably instructed soldiers to mistreat detainees and used dogs to intimidate detainees during interrogations. Stefanowicz testified for Caci at trial through a recorded video deposition and denied mistreating detainees. Caci officials initially had serious doubts about his ability to work as an interrogator, according to evidence introduced at trial. An email sent by the Caci official Tom Howard before the company sent interrogators to Iraq described Stefanowicz as a \u201cno-go for filling an interrogator position\u201d. Caci initially sent Stefanowicz over to Iraq not as an interrogator but as a screener, but he testified that the army \u2013 desperately short of interrogators at a prison with a rapidly expanding population \u2013 promoted him to interrogator within a day of his arrival. Trial evidence showed that Caci defended the work of another of its interrogators, Dan Johnson, even after the army sought his dismissal when photos of the Abu Ghraib abuse became public, and one of the photos showed Johnson questioning a detainee in a crouched position that army investigators determined to be an unauthorized stress position.

            "date": "2024-05-25T10:00:22Z",
            "content": "Dave Yeager didn\u2019t join the US army to become a pathological gambler. But after re-enlisting as a food inspection specialist in the wake of 9/11, Yeager arrived at his base hotel in Seoul, Korea, feeling overwhelmed and restless. \u201cI\u2019m walking around and find a casino-style slot machine room,\u201d says the 57-year-old former sergeant. \u201cAs soon as I sat down, the first thing I noticed was that my shoulders started to relax. Then I won, and it was like a dopamine hit. In that moment, all of the fear and anger and stress that I was feeling just went away.\u201d Suddenly and without warning, a night of gambling here and there became a seven-day-a-week addiction \u2013 one that had him phoning home for more money, pawning personal effects and stealing from his unit. When a demotion in rank failed to curb Yeager\u2019s reckless behavior, his bosses threw up their hands. \u201cMy commander, a colonel I really respect, basically said in few words, \u2018We have no idea what to do with you because you\u2019re such a stellar performer,\u201d he recalls of the come-to-Jesus meeting that preceded his transfer to a US duty station. \u201cNobody ever used the word gambling. It was \u2018this problem you have\u2019.\u201d While the boom unleashed by the 2018 legalization of sports betting raised fears of an emerging addiction crisis, this institutional problem \u2013 at the heart of the US military \u2013 can be traced back decades, to the rooms like the one Yeager ventured into in Korea. In 1951, Congress banned slot machines from military bases in the US. In the 70s, the army and air force pulled them from foreign bases only to slowly bring them back in the 80s \u2013 with the idea that it would keep the troops from running into off-base trouble. Currently, the US military operates more than 3,000 slot machines on bases in 12 countries \u2013 down from 8,000 slots in 94 countries in 1999, according to the Pentagon. That\u2019s besides the other chance games the military sponsors on bases, with service members as young as 18 able to participate. The remaining slot machines alone rake in more than $100m annually, money that each branch steers into groups supporting \u201cmorale, welfare and recreation\u201d initiatives on all bases such as movie theaters and golf courses. None of that money, Yeager notes, goes toward education, screening or prevention. \u201cWhen you fall into a gambling problem,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s not treated as a mental health issue and an addiction. It\u2019s treated as a money problem and a disciplinary issue.\u201d All the while, service members spiral deeper down the hole. A 2003 patient chart analysis at one Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center found that, of the patient population that had attempted suicide, 64% blamed gambling-related harms for pushing them to the brink. Three years later, the suicide death of a decorated army helicopter pilot forced the general public to somewhat reckon with the military\u2019s gambling problem. A 2016 survey of Iraq war veterans concluded that 4.2% had become at-risk gamblers subsequent to being deployed. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, an estimated 56,000 active duty service members may meet the criteria for gambling disorder \u2013 which more generally affects an estimated 1% of Americans \u2013 roughly the same percentage of the adult population currently in active duty service. Both demographics skew heavily male. In a 2021 Rutgers University study of gambling in the military, the researcher Mark van der Maas deduced that active and retired military service members were more than twice as likely to become problem gamblers than the general population \u2013 and even that may be underestimating the actual figures by quite a margin. \u201cPeople tend not to think of the different things they\u2019re doing as capital-G gambling because that\u2019s such a morally loaded term,\u201d van der Maas says. \u201cA sports bettor, for example, might not think they\u2019re gambling because they put so much time and research into it.\u201d Van der Maas\u2019s research suggests a connection between military service and poor mental outcomes for women, a less-studied gambling cohort relative to men. \u201cGenerally speaking, there are fewer women with gambling disorder compared with men,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when we talk about the reasons why people gamble, women are more likely to say that they gamble to help deal with negative emotional state. \u201cIn both the US and Canada, women in military service or on police forces are exposed to sexual harassment and assault on the job. Understanding how being in that emotionally stressful environment potentially leads to gambling disorder for women is an area we need to pay more attention to.\u201d Even though gambling has been recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Medical Disorders since 1980, the military is no better at confronting the problem than other American institutions that don\u2019t see gambling on a par with drugs or alcohol addiction. (Some insurance carriers have only just begun covering problem gambling treatments.) It\u2019s only since 2019 that the Department of Defense has mandated annual screenings for gambling disorder as part of service members\u2019 general health assessment in addition to conducting random spot surveys of active duty soldiers. \u201cEarly detection and treatment of gambling disorder and other health-related behavioral issues is critical to maintaining the overall wellbeing and operational effectiveness of our forces,\u201d a defense department spokesperson said. Before this statement, neither the defense department nor the VA had publicly commented on efforts to curb problem gambling within their ranks. Still, the military\u2019s periodic checkups for gambling aren\u2019t as rigorous as the ones used for substance abuse, or physical fitness. \u201cIt really would just take three quick questions to at least flag if someone needed more follow-up,\u201d van der Maas says. This relaxed attitude makes military members especially vulnerable to gambling addiction. \u201cWhen you think about military people, they\u2019re very bonded,\u201d says Heather Chapman, a psychologist who directs the gambling program at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA, one of the few residential facilities in the country that focuses on the disorder. \u201cIt almost becomes like a family, and what you see is that behavior becomes integrated within the family structure, something to do when they have downtime \u2013 whether it\u2019s slots or a Texas hold \u2019em tournament. It doesn\u2019t have the immediate problematic issues that drugs and alcohol can have. There\u2019s no obvious screen for gambling other than financial issues, which can affect a person\u2019s clearance if they have considerable debt or declare bankruptcy.\u201d Gambling can seem like an especially attractive escape in a high-stress environment that conditions workers to accept risk, bottle individual issues and finish the jobs they start. \u201cYou\u2019re taught from day one, leave your problems at the door; you have a mission to do,\u201d Yeager says. \u201cThe problem is that, even when they fall into addiction, the mentality is \u2018I have to fix this on my own. I have to keep this to myself. I can\u2019t leave until I win.\u2019 \u201cOne of the tenets of gambling addiction is chasing losses. You add the warrior mentality to that, and you\u2019ve basically got gambling addiction on steroids.\u201d Yeager\u2019s addiction resulted in the breakup of his young family, the end of his military career and a debt in the high five figures. (He\u2019s further ashamed to say that he borrowed from subordinates.) After a decade-long nosedive that included a two-week stay at a civilian psychiatric hospital, Yeager remembers the stumped counselor at his local VA handing him a packet for the VA gambling program in Cleveland. It was only after making that pilgrimage and communing with veterans in his same foxhole that Yeager turned his life around. Now remarried, reconciled with his family and out of debt, he raises awareness about problem gambling in the military, touring the country and promoting a book about his recovery all the while. He hopes to be a light to service members. In some ways, as gambling becomes more ubiquitous and accessible, they are even more vulnerable to addiction. \u201cJust having gambling in your pocket now changes everything,\u201d Chapman says. \u201cWe won\u2019t really know what the true impact will be for another five or six years down the road when things really start to boil over.\u201d Some federal lawmakers have shown a willingness to cooperate in the interest of heading off disaster. In 2017, the senators Elizabeth Warren and Steve Daines introduced a bipartisan bill that would force the Department of Defense to track gambling disorders in its health assessments and develop policies and programs around treatment and prevention. Earlier this year the congresswoman Andrea Salinas teamed up with the senator Richard Blumenthal on a bill that, among other things, would funnel half of the federal taxes on gambling operators into national treatment and research programs. But both measures have struggled for traction within a divided Congress. The inaction just deepens the sense of dread within the precincts of the military on the frontlines of the gambling addiction problem \u2013 not least Yeager, who shudders to think of the potential risks to national security if the military\u2019s gambling problem continues unchecked. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now: it\u2019s only a matter of time before you start seeing stories come out about the major who lost their commission, or the sergeant who committed treason because of their gambling addiction,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more we need to do. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t shut up.\u201d In the US, call the National Council on Problem Gambling at 800-GAMBLER or text 800GAM. In the UK, support for problem gambling can be found via the NHS National Problem Gambling Clinic on 020 7381 7722, or GamCare on 0808 8020 133. In Australia, Gambling Help Online is available on 1800 858 858 and the National Debt Helpline is at 1800 007 007. This article was amended on 25 May 2024 because an earlier version misquoted Yeager saying that he didn\u2019t borrow from from subordinates."

            "date": "2024-05-23T06:45:13Z",
            "content": "A US military commander says he has \u201cno idea\u201d how Australia\u2019s nuclear-powered submarines will be used in the Taiwan Strait, despite a top state department official predicting \u201cenormous implications\u201d for \u201ccross-Strait circumstances\u201d. Lt Gen Stephen Sklenka, the deputy commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, played down the potential for Australia to be drawn into a devastating war in the region against the Australian government\u2019s wishes. \u201cAt least from the military perspective, there is no expectation of anybody participating in any conflict with us, because those decisions are national sovereign decisions,\u201d Sklenka said during a visit to Australia. \u201cWe don\u2019t dictate that to other countries.\u201d The deputy US secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, one of the architects of Aukus, said last month the security partnership between Australia, the UK and the US could \u201cchange the nature of the way each of our three countries operate together\u201d. Campbell said Aukus had \u201cthe potential to have submarines from a number of countries operating in close coordination that could deliver conventional ordnance from long distances\u201d, adding: \u201cThose have enormous implications in a variety of scenarios, including in cross-Strait circumstances.\u201d Sklenka, who works with Australia and other allies in the region as a leader of the US Indo-Pacific Command, was asked on Thursday what role he envisaged for Aukus submarines in the Taiwan Strait. \u201cLook, Secretary Campbell is a policy guy and I\u2019m not,\u201d Sklenka told the National Press Club in Canberra. \u201cI have no idea. I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Pressed on whether the Indo-Pacific Command had factored the submarines into its long-term planning, Sklenka said it was \u201ctoo far down the path\u201d but Australia and the US \u201cdo share planning actions\u201d. \u201cRecently, we have done a lot more with Australia,\u201d he said. Australia plans to buy at least three Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines from the US in the 2030s, before a new class of Australian-built submarine \u2013 SSN-Aukus \u2013 enters into service from the 2040s. Sklenka said the US and its allies must \u201ctake seriously Chairman Xi Jinping\u2019s directive to his own forces to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027\u201d. But Sklenka denied the Aukus submarines would therefore be too late. \u201cNot if he doesn\u2019t fight in 2027,\u201d Sklenka said of the Chinese president. \u201cI don\u2019t think conflict is inevitable \u2013 I really don\u2019t \u2013 but I\u2019m a military guy and if you\u2019re an American you\u2019re paying me not to live on hope. You\u2019re paying me to be ready.\u201d The Australian government has repeatedly said it has made no pre-commitment to the US to join a conflict over the status of Taiwan, a self-governed democracy of 24 million people that Beijing regards as an inherent part of Chinese territory and has not ruled out taking by force. As part of the staged Aukus plan, the US and the UK will increase rotational visits of their own nuclear-powered submarines to the HMAS Stirling base in Western Australia from 2027. Sklenka said a second element of the plan \u2013 collaboration on advanced defence technologies \u2013 had \u201cthe potential to expand to include new partners\u201d. That meant that \u201cthe beneficiaries of Aukus will extend far beyond the three formal members\u201d. Japan is seen as the first potential Aukus pillar 2 partner, but South Korea, New Zealand and Canada have also expressed interest. The Chinese government has argued Aukus would only add to regional tensions."

            "title": "Hamas \u2018rejects\u2019 any military presence in Gaza as aid begins to arrive along US-made pier \u2013  as it happened",
            "date": "2024-05-18T15:03:27Z",
            "content": "It is 6pm in Gaza and in Tel Aviv. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian\u2019s Middle East coverage here. Here is a recap of the latest developments: Hamas issued a statement on Friday saying the US-built pier off the Gaza Strip is no alternative to opening all land crossings under Palestinian supervision, adding that they reject any military presence on Palestinian land. Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip started rolling across a newly built US pier and into Gaza for the first time. The bodies of three hostages kidnapped by Hamas, including the German-Israeli Shani Louk, have been retrieved from Gaza by the Israeli military, it announced. The other two hostages were identified as Amit Buskila, 28, and Itzhak Gelerenter, 56, according to the military spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, who said the three victims were taken to Gaza after being killed by Hamas at the Nova music festival. With key land crossings closed or operating at limited capacity due to fighting, some relief supplies have begun to flow into Gaza via a temporary, floating pier constructed by the US. The Israeli army said 310 pallets began moving ashore in \u201cthe first entry of humanitarian aid through the floating pier\u201d. In the coming days, about 500 tonnes of aid are expected to be delivered to Gaza through the pier, according to US Central Command (Centcom). US military officials anticipate the aid shipment operation could scale up to 150 truckloads a day. The EU welcomed the first shipment from Cyprus to the Gaza pier, but called on Israel to \u201cexpand deliveries by land and to immediately open additional crossings\u201d. The US aid chief said the new sea corridor could not be a substitute for land crossings, and warned that deliveries of food and fuel entering Gaza had slowed to \u201cdangerously low levels\u201d. The head of the US Agency for International Development (USAid), Samantha Power said: \u201cEvery moment that a crossing is not open, that trucks are not moving, or where aid cannot safely be distributed, increases the terrible human costs of this conflict.\u201d Israel said it killed two senior Islamic Jihad militants in separate airstrikes in the northern West Bank and in Rafah. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad confirmed that a local commander was killed in an overnight strike on the occupied West Bank\u2019s Jenin refugee camp. However there was no immediate comment from the group on the army\u2019s announcement that a \u201csignificant\u201d operative was killed in Rafah. Austria said on Saturday it will restore its funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) after suspending it over allegations that staff were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks. A total of \u20ac3.4m ($3.7m) in funds have been budgeted for 2024, and the first payment is expected to be made in the summer, Austria\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. New divisions have emerged among Israel\u2019s leaders over postwar Gaza\u2019s governance, with an unexpected Hamas fightback in parts of the Palestinian territory piling pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu came under personal attack from Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant for failing to rule out an Israeli government in Gaza after the war. Netanyahu\u2019s war planning also came under recent attack by army chief Herzi Halevi as well as top Shin Bet security agency officials, according to Israeli media reports. Israeli military said its air forces \u201cstruck over 70 targets\u201d across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours while ground troops \u201ccontinue precise operations\u201d in eastern Rafah. The Kuwaiti hospital said an overnight Israeli strike killed two people in a displacement camp in Rafah, with witnesses reporting heavy gunfire and shelling in the city\u2019s south-east and jets bombarding its eastern areas. The army said its forces \u201cconducted targeted raids\u201d in Rafah and found weapons and explosives. The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they fired anti-tank missiles and mortars at Israeli forces massing to the east, south-east and inside the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said there were intense battles overnight in the northern Jabalia refugee camp, after the Israeli army reported on Friday \u201cperhaps the fiercest\u201d violence in the town in more than seven months of war. Israeli forces \u201celiminated terrorists in a number of battles\u201d in the Jabalia area and parts of central Gaza, the army said. Palestinian sources in Rafah told AFP that Israeli forces were operating in the city\u2019s al-Salam and Jenina neighbourhood as well as on the Philadelphi route along the Egyptian border.\u201cTroops are advancing and retreating around these areas,\u201d a security source said. Cairo, which has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, says a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi could violate its landmark 1979 peace deal with Egypt. In northern Gaza\u2019s Beit Lahia, witnesses reported airstrikes near Kamal Adwan hospital on Saturday. The hospital\u2019s director Hussam Abu Safiya told AFP on Friday that the facility, which has received \u201clarge numbers of injured and killed\u201d from fighting in nearby Jabalia, was running low on medical supplies and fuel to power generators. At least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed and 79,366 have been wounded in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The Hamas-run health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. German-Israeli Shani Louk\u2019s father says that finally laying his daughter to rest will be a gift after her body was recovered from Gaza, months after she was killed in Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on southern Israel. Nissim Louk said the funeral will be held on Sunday. One person was reportedly killed and other passengers were severely injured after a car was struck by a drone in the western part of Rafah, said Al Jazeera correspondent Hani Mahmoud on Saturday. Mahmoud, who is reporting from Deir el-Balah, said the car was on the way to central Gaza on the coastal road. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the report. British security firm Ambrey said on Saturday it had received information that a Panama-flagged crude oil tanker had been attacked approximately 10 nautical miles southwest of Yemen\u2019s Mokha. Ambrey later added that the tanker had received assistance and one of its steering units was reportedly functional. It did not indicate who provided the assistance. Earlier on Saturday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said a vessel in the Red Sea was struck by an unknown object and sustained slight damage. \u201cThe vessel and crew are safe and continuing to its next port of call,\u201d UKMTO said in an advisory note, adding the incident occurred 76 nautical miles northwest of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah. Palestinian sources in Rafah told AFP that Israeli forces were operating in the city\u2019s al-Salam and Jenina neighbourhood as well as on the Philadelphi route along the Egyptian border. \u201cTroops are advancing and retreating around these areas,\u201d a security source said. Cairo, which has been involved in mediation efforts during the war, says a potential Israeli takeover of Philadelphi could violate its landmark 1979 peace deal with Egypt, writes AFP. In northern Gaza\u2019s Beit Lahia, witnesses reported airstrikes near Kamal Adwan hospital on Saturday, according to the news agency. The hospital\u2019s director Hussam Abu Safiya told AFP on Friday that the facility, which has received \u201clarge numbers of injured and killed\u201d from fighting in nearby Jabalia, was running low on medical supplies and fuel to power generators. The fuel aid that had reached the hospital was \u201cbarely enough for a few days\u201d, Abu Safiya said. The World Health Organization has received no medical supplies in Gaza since the Rafah operation began on 6 May, spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said on Friday. Israel said it killed two senior Islamic Jihad militants in separate airstrikes in the northern West Bank and in Rafah. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad confirmed that a local commander was killed in an overnight strike on the occupied West Bank\u2019s Jenin refugee camp (see 14.36 BST). However there was no immediate comment from the group, which has fought alongside Hamas, on the army\u2019s announcement that a \u201csignificant\u201d operative was killed in Rafah. According to AFP, a military statement did not name the slain militant and said he had been involved in \u201cpreparing \u2026 for operations against IDF [army] ground troops in the area\u201d. With key land crossings closed or operating at limited capacity due to fighting, some relief supplies have begun to flow into Gaza via a temporary, floating pier constructed by the US, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Israeli army said 310 pallets began moving ashore in \u201cthe first entry of humanitarian aid through the floating pier\u201d. In the coming days, about 500 tonnes of aid are expected to be delivered to Gaza through the pier, according to US Central Command (Centcom). But UN agencies and humanitarian aid groups have warned sea or air deliveries cannot replace far more efficient truck convoys into Gaza, where the UN has repeatedly warned of looming famine. According to AFP, the EU welcomed the first shipment from Cyprus to the Gaza pier, but called on Israel to \u201cexpand deliveries by land and to immediately open additional crossings\u201d. The Rafah crossing, a vital conduit for humanitarian assistance, has been closed since the Israeli Rafah operation began early last week. Israeli military said its air forces \u201cstruck over 70 targets\u201d across the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours while ground troops \u201ccontinue precise operations\u201d in eastern Rafah, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). More than 10 days into what the Israeli military called a \u201climited\u201d operation in Rafah that triggered an exodus of Palestinians sheltering there, fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants has also flared again in Gaza\u2019s north, according to the news agency. The Kuwaiti hospital said an overnight Israeli strike killed two people in a displacement camp in Rafah, with witnesses reporting heavy gunfire and shelling in the city\u2019s southeast and jets bombarding its eastern areas. The army said its forces \u201cconducted targeted raids\u201d in Rafah and found weapons and explosives, report AFP. AFP correspondents, witnesses and medics said there were intense battles overnight in the northern Jabalia refugee camp, after the Israeli army reported on Friday \u201cperhaps the fiercest\u201d violence in the town in more than seven months of war. Israeli forces \u201celiminated terrorists in a number of battles\u201d in the Jabalia area and parts of central Gaza, the army said. According to AFP\u2019s report, Israel in early January said it had dismantled Hamas\u2019s command structure in northern Gaza, but the army said the Palestinian group \u201cwas in complete control here in Jabalia until we arrived a few days ago\u201d. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say they killed a senior Palestinian militant during an airstrike on an \u201coperations centre\u201d in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin. \u201cA number of significant terrorists were inside the compound,\u201d the IDF said in a statement posted to Telegram. The strike, carried out on Friday night by a fighter jet and a helicopter, killed Islam Khamayseh, a \u201csenior terrorist operative in the Jenin camp\u201d who was responsible for a series of attacks in the area, the IDF said. Al-Quds Brigade, the armed wing of the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, confirmed in a statement that one of their members was killed and several others wounded during the Israeli raid. Al-Quds Brigade said Khamayseh was a leader of the Jenin battalion, which is affiliated with Islamic Jihad. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said one person was killed while eight were wounded and receiving hospital treatment as a result of the strike. With thousands now held without charge, lawyers say Israel is signalling that no detainee is safe, write Ruth Michaelson, Sufian Taha and Quique Kierszenbaum in Jerusalem and Ramallah: Marwan Barghouti spends his days huddled in a cramped, dark, solitary cell, with no way to tend to his wounds, and a shoulder injury from being dragged with his hands cuffed behind his back. Barghouti holds almost mythic status within Palestinian politics, seen as a figure whose potential to unify different factions has only grown during his 24 years in prison. \u201cMentally he\u2019s a very strong person, but physically his condition is deteriorating, you can see it. He\u2019s struggling to see out of his right eye, as a result of one of the assaults,\u201d said his lawyer Igal Dotan, who visited Barghouti in Israel\u2019s Megiddo prison two months ago. \u201cHe has lost weight \u2013 he doesn\u2019t look good. You wouldn\u2019t recognise him if you compare his current appearance with the famous photos of him,\u201d he said. Israel jailed Barghouti on five counts of murder while accusing him of directing attacks against civilians, which he denies. His lawyers and supporters fear that as one of the highest profile Palestinian detainees, he was abused to send a message to others that no one is safe. He has been moved to three different detention facilities since October, each time held in solitary confinement. Last December in Ayalon prison, \u201che was beaten on several occasions,\u201d said Dotan, including an incident where guards swore at him while Barghouti was \u201cdragged on the floor naked in front of other prisoners\u201d. \u201cWhat Barghouti has endured amounts to torture, but that has become standard across all detention facilities since 7 October,\u201d said Tal Steiner, of the rights group the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. The Israeli prison service did not respond when contacted for comment. Both PCATI and the International Committee of the Red Cross have been denied formerly routine visits to Israeli prisons since last October. You can read the full version of this story here: German-Israeli Shani Louk\u2019s father says that finally laying his daughter to rest will be a gift after her body was recovered from Gaza, months after she was killed in Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on southern Israel, reports Reuters. Louk, a 23-year-old tattoo artist, was celebrating with friends at the Nova music festival just inside Israel before it was attacked by gunmen from the Palestinian militant group. Her body was soon seen in a video, slung across the back of a pickup truck, surrounded by gunmen and paraded through Gaza. On Friday, the Israeli military informed her parents, Nissim and Ricarda Louk, that their daughter\u2019s body had been found by Israeli commandos in Gaza. Nissim Louk said that to be sure, he had viewed photos. \u201cWe also saw the tattoos on her hands,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cNow she will have her own place next to us and we can go there whenever we want. And she can rest.\u201d According to Reuters, he said the funeral will be held on Sunday, which is Ricarda Louk\u2019s birthday. Having Shani\u2019s grave nearby would be a comfort, said Ricarda Louk. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find more peace,\u201d she said. Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that new divisions have emerged among Israel\u2019s leaders over postwar Gaza\u2019s governance, with an unexpected Hamas fightback in parts of the Palestinian territory piling pressure on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu came under personal attack from Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant for failing to rule out an Israeli government in Gaza after the war. According to AFP, the Israeli premier\u2019s outright rejection of postwar Palestinian leadership in Gaza has broken a rift among top politicians wide open and frustrated relations with top ally the US. AFP spoke to experts who said that the lack of clarity only serves to benefit Hamas, whose leader has insisted no new authority can be established in the territory without its involvement. \u201cWithout an alternative to fill the vacuum, Hamas will continue to grow,\u201d International Crisis Group analyst Mairav Zonszein told AFP. Emmanuel Navon, a lecturer at Tel Aviv University, echoed this sentiment. Navon told AFP: \u201cIf only Hamas is left in Gaza, of course they are going to appear here and there and the Israeli army will be forced to chase them around. Either you establish an Israeli military government or an Arab-led government.\u201d Gallant said in a televised address on Wednesday: \u201cI call on prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a decision and declare that Israel will not establish civilian control over the Gaza Strip.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s war planning also came under recent attack by army chief Herzi Halevi as well as top Shin Bet security agency officials, according to Israeli media reports. Washington has previously called for a \u201crevitalised\u201d form of the Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza after the war, but Netanyahu has rejected any role for the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza. Speaking on Thursday, Netanyahu said that it \u201csupports terror, educates terror, finances terror\u201d. \u201cWith Gallant\u2019s criticism of Netanyahu\u2019s failure to plan for the day after in terms of governing Gaza, some real fissures are beginning to emerge in the Israeli war cabinet,\u201d Colin P Clarke, director of policy and research at the Soufan Group thinktank, wrote on X. In case you missed it last night, humanitarian assistance has begun to arrive in Gaza along a US-made pier, but the US aid chief said the new sea corridor could not be a substitute for land crossings, and warned that deliveries of food and fuel entering Gaza had slowed to \u201cdangerously low levels\u201d. The White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, confirmed on Friday that truckloads of humanitarian aid, including food from the United Arab Emirates, sent by ship from Cyprus, had been unloaded on the Gaza coast and handed over to the control of the UN. Kirby told reporters at a White House briefing: \u201cHopefully by the time we\u2019re done here, some of that stuff will actually be in the mouths of some hungry people.\u201d The Associated Press, however, quoted an unnamed UN official as saying distribution of the shipment had not begun as of Friday afternoon. Here are some of the latest images from Jenin in the occupied West Bank after an Israeli airstrike that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said killed a senior Palestinian militant. Austria said on Saturday it will restore its funding to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) after suspending it over allegations that staff were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Israel alleged in January that some Unrwa employees may have participated in the Hamas attacks on 7 October and in the weeks that followed, numerous donor states, including Austria, suspended or paused $450m in funding. Many donor countries, including Germany, Sweden, Canada and Japan, had since resumed funding. \u201cAfter analysing the action plan in detail\u201d submitted by Unrwa \u201cto improve the functioning of the organisation\u201d, Austria has decided to \u201crelease the funds,\u201d its foreign ministry said in a statement, reports AFP. A total of \u20ac3.4m ($3.7m) in funds have been budgeted for 2024, and the first payment is expected to be made in the summer, the statement said. \u201cSome of the Austrian funds will be used in the future to improve internal control mechanisms at Unrwa,\u201d it added. According to AFP, Austria said it will \u201cclosely monitor\u201d the implementation of the action plan with other international partners, noting that \u201ca lot of trust had been squandered\u201d. Austria said it has substantially increased support for the Palestinian population in Gaza and the region since 7 October, making \u20ac32m($34.8m) in humanitarian aid available to other international aid organisations. One person has been killed and other passengers have been severely injured after a car was struck by a drone in the western part of Rafah, reports Al Jazeera correspondent Hani Mahmoud. Mahmoud, who is reporting from Deir el-Balah, said the car was on the way to central Gaza on the coastal road. The Guardian has been unable to independently verify the report. At least 35,386 Palestinians have been killed and 79,366 have been wounded in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The Hamas-run health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants. Israel on Friday attacked South Africa\u2019s case against it in the international court of justice as an \u201cobscene exploitation\u201d of the genocide convention, claiming it aimed not to protect Palestinian civilians but to defend Hamas militants. Israel\u2019s representatives told the court their country was fighting a war of self-defence it \u201cdid not want and did not start\u201d. They said Israel had made \u201cextraordinary\u201d efforts to protect civilians, and had complied with orders from the court to let more aid into Gaza. \u201cThere is a tragic conflict going on, but no genocide,\u201d Israel\u2019s justice ministry official, Gilad Noam, told the court. He asked judges to throw out South Africa\u2019s request that the court order a halt to the military offensive in Rafah and impose a ceasefire across Gaza. The hearing in The Hague came as all G7 countries apart from the US sent a joint letter urging Israel to comply with international law in Gaza and address the devastating humanitarian crisis there, Reuters reported. Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland also signed.

The UK said the aid delivery unloaded on Friday also included 8,400 kits to provide temporary shelter made of plastic sheeting. You can read more of Julian Borger\u2019s report here: Here are some of the latest images on the newswires: Israeli tanks and warplanes bombarded parts of Rafah on Friday, while the armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they fired anti-tank missiles and mortars at forces massing to the east, south-east and inside the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, reports Reuters. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), said more than 630,000 people had fled Rafah since the offensive began on 6 May. \u201cThey\u2019re moving to areas where there is no water \u2013 we\u2019ve got to truck it in \u2013 and people aren\u2019t getting enough food,\u201d Sam Rose, director of planning at Urwa, told Reuters on Friday by telephone from Rafah, where he said it was eerily quiet. British security firm Ambrey said on Saturday it had received information that a Panama-flagged crude oil tanker had been attacked approximately 10 nautical miles southwest of Yemen\u2019s Mokha. According to Reuters, Ambrey said a radio communication indicated the vessel was hit by a missile and that there was a fire onboard. It did not provide details of the communication. Ambrey later added that the tanker had received assistance and one of its steering units was reportedly functional. It did not indicate who provided the assistance. Vessels in the vicinity were advised to exercise caution and report any suspicious activity, Ambrey added in an advisory note. Earlier on Saturday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said a vessel in the Red Sea was struck by an unknown object and sustained slight damage. \u201cThe vessel and crew are safe and continuing to its next port of call,\u201d UKMTO said in an advisory note, adding the incident occurred 76 nautical miles northwest of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah. The bodies of three hostages kidnapped by Hamas, including the German-Israeli Shani Louk, have been retrieved from Gaza by the Israeli military, it announced. The other two hostages were identified as Amit Buskila, 28, and Itzhak Gelerenter, 56, according to the military spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, who said the three victims were taken to Gaza after being killed by Hamas at the Nova music festival. Footage of what appeared to be the body of Louk, 22, on the back of a pickup truck on the streets of Gaza was one of the first images to surface after 7 October, as the scale of the horror of the attacks became clear. The young woman was initially believed to have been kidnapped alive during Hamas\u2019s assault in Re\u2019im. However, on 30 October, Louk\u2019s sister Adi confirmed Shani had died, probably during the attack, after the discovery of human remains that suggested fatal injuries. The Israeli military did not give immediate details on where the bodies were found. Hamas issued a statement on Friday saying the US-built pier off the Gaza Strip is no alternative to opening all land crossings under Palestinian supervision, adding that they reject any military presence on Palestinian land. Trucks carrying badly needed aid for the Gaza Strip started rolling across a newly built US pier and into Gaza for the first time. Friday\u2019s shipment is the first in an operation that US military officials anticipate could scale up to 150 truckloads a day, reports the Associated Press (AP). It comes as Israeli restrictions on border crossings and heavy fighting hindered the delivery of food and other supplies seven months into the Israel-Hamas war. But the US and aid groups warn that the floating pier project is not a substitute for land deliveries that could bring in all the food, water and fuel needed in Gaza. Humanitarian assistance has begun to arrive in Gaza along a US-made pier, but the US aid chief said the new sea corridor could not be a substitute for land crossings, and warned that deliveries of food and fuel entering Gaza had slowed. This video explainer runs through the latest updates. The Israeli military said on Saturday it killed a senior Palestinian militant during an airstrike on an \u201coperations centre\u201d in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin. \u201cA number of significant terrorists were inside the compound,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement posted to Telegram, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The IDF said the strike by a fighter jet and helicopter killed Islam Khamayseh, a \u201csenior terrorist operative in the Jenin Camp\u201d who was responsible for a series of attacks in the area. The al-Quds Brigade, the armed wing of militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, confirmed in a statement that Khamayseh was killed and several others wounded during an Israeli raid on Friday night. It said Khamayseh was a leader of the Jenin Battalion, which is affiliated with Islamic Jihad. The Palestinian ministry of health said one person was killed and eight were injured and receiving hospital treatment as a result of Israel\u2019s operation in Jenin on Friday night, reports AFP. It has gone 10am in Gaza and Tel Aviv. This is our latest Guardian live blog on the Israel-Gaza war and the wider Middle East crisis. Hamas has said it rejects any military presence on Palestinian land, adding that a US-built pier off the coast of Gaza is no alternative to opening all land crossings under Palestinian supervision. As fighting in the north of Gaza reportedly ramped up, the US military said trucks started moving aid ashore from the temporary pier, the first to reach Gaza by sea in weeks. The World Food Programme, which expects food, water, shelter and medical supplies to arrive through the floating dock, said the aid was transported to its warehouses in Deir Al Balah in central Gaza and told partners it was ready for distribution. More on that in a moment, but first here is a summary of the latest developments: The bodies of three hostages kidnapped by Hamas, including the German-Israeli Shani Louk, have been retrieved from Gaza by the Israeli military. The other two hostages were identified as Amit Buskila, 28, and Itzhak Gelerenter, 56, according to military spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, who said the three victims were taken to Gaza after being killed by Hamas at the Nova music festival. Footage of what appeared to be the body of Louk, 22, on the back of a pickup truck on the streets of Gaza was one of the first images to surface after 7 October, as the scale of the horror of the attacks became clear. Israel on Friday defended its Gaza offensive at the international court of justice (ICJ) after South Africa asked judges to order it to halt operations in Rafah and completely withdraw from the Palestinian territory. Israeli justice ministry official Gilad Noam called South Africa\u2019s case, which accuses Israel of violating the genocide convention, \u201ccompletely divorced from facts and circumstances\u201d. Noam told the ICJ hearing that South Africa\u2019s charge of genocide was \u201can obscene exploitation of the most sacred convention\u201d, referring to the international treaty banning genocide, agreed after the Holocaust in the second world war. Noam said that Israel\u2019s military operations were not aimed at civilians, but at Hamas terrorists using Rafah as a stronghold, who have tunnel systems which could be used to smuggle hostages and militants out of Gaza. Hearings at the ICJ were briefly interrupted on Friday by a protester who called out \u201cliars\u201d as an Israeli official was presenting arguments. Reuters reported that a woman was seen being removed by court security guards. Israeli forces battled Hamas fighters in the narrow alleyways of Jabalia in northern Gaza on Friday in some of the fiercest engagements since they returned to the area a week ago, while in the south militants attacked tanks massing around Rafah. Israeli airstrikes on Friday hit an area of southern Lebanon far from the border killing an adult and two children, according to Lebanese official media. Hezbollah announced a fighter from Najjariyeh had died, while Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency said two Syrian children were killed in the Najjariyeh strike, identifying them as Osama and Hani al-Khaled."

            "date": "2024-05-31T14:23:32Z",
            "content": "The Kremlin has said Joe Biden\u2019s decision to allow Ukraine to use US-supplied weapons against targets in Russia demonstrates Washington\u2019s deep involvement in the conflict, as some of Vladimir Putin\u2019s allies increased their nuclear threats against the west. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told journalists on Friday that Moscow was already aware of attempts by Ukraine to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons provided by the US. Biden\u2019s decision on Thursday to allow Kyiv to use US weapons for counter-fire purposes inside Russia near the border with the Kharkiv region marked an important shift, after warnings from Moscow that the move could trigger a global conflict. The approval came after days of growing pressure on Biden from western allies and the Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, who argued that the delay in the use of western weapons had cost lives. \u201cI think it is absolutely illogical to have [western] weapons and see the murderers, terrorists, who are killing us from the Russian side. I think sometimes they are just laughing at this situation,\u201d Zelenskiy told the Guardian in an interview published on Friday. The German government announced on Friday that it would also give Ukraine permission to use weapons it supplied against military targets in Russian territory bordering the Kharkiv region to defend itself against Moscow\u2019s attacks. During a visit to Uzbekistan earlier this week, Putin warned against western countries allowing Ukraine to use their weapons to strike Russia. \u201cThis constant escalation can lead to serious consequences,\u201d the Russian president said on Tuesday, without giving further detail. Putin also issued a thinly veiled threat against Nato\u2019s smaller European members, saying they \u201cshould be aware that they are playing with fire\u201d because they had small land areas and very dense populations. In the lead-up to Biden\u2019s decision on Thursday, other western allies including the UK, France and the Netherlands, and the Nato secretary general, also said Ukraine should be able to use western weapons against military targets in Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish former Russian president and current deputy chair of the country\u2019s security council, called Biden\u2019s decision a \u201cserious escalation of the conflict\u201d. \u201cRussia regards all long-range weapons used by Ukraine as already being directly controlled by servicemen from Nato countries. This is no military assistance, this is participation in a war against us,\u201d he said, adding that Russia would destroy any western weaponry used to attack it \u201cboth in Ukraine and in the territory of other countries\u201d. Medvedev said it would be a \u201ccrucial mistake\u201d on the part of the west to believe that Russia was not ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine. He also spoke of the potential to strike unnamed hostile countries with strategic nuclear weapons. \u201cThis is, alas, neither intimidation nor bluffing,\u201d he said. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, dismissed warnings by Moscow that the decision to allow Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russian territory might lead to an escalation. \u201cThis is nothing new. It has ... been the case for a long time that every time Nato allies are providing support to Ukraine, President Putin is trying to threaten us to not do that,\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters on Friday on the sidelines of a Nato foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Prague. \u201cAnd an escalation \u2013 well, Russia has escalated by invading another country.\u201d Western countries\u2019 approval for the use of their weapons comes amid reports that France is planning to send military trainers to Ukraine, making it the first to publicly deploy troops on the ground. The country\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, could announce the move next week during a visit by Zelenskiy, who will attend a ceremony in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-day. Putin has said the French move would escalate the situation toward a global conflict, and some senior officials in Moscow have said French trainers would become legitimate targets for Russian troops. In the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Putin frequently invoked Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal, pledging to use all means necessary to defend his country. He later seemed to moderate his rhetoric, reportedly after Chinese officials persuaded him to abandon his nuclear threats, but he has recently returned to them. Russian forces started military drills near Ukraine last week that simulated the use of tactical nuclear weapons, in a move that Moscow said was a warning to the west not to escalate tensions further. Since the start of the war, Washington has voiced fears of provoking Putin into a nuclear response and drawing the US and Nato into direct conflict with Moscow. It has reportedly expressed anger over two Ukrainian drone strikes in the last week against Russian radar stations that provide warning of nuclear launches. At least one of the strikes in the south-eastern Krasnodar region appeared to have caused some damage, according to images circulating on social media. \u201cThey are sensitive locations because Russia could perceive that its strategic deterrent capabilities are being targeted, which could undermine Russia\u2019s ability to maintain nuclear deterrence against the United States,\u201d an unnamed US official told the Washington Post."

            "date": "2024-05-07T14:05:10Z",
            "content": "A planned nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk has been granted the first site licence in more than a decade as investors and government officials race to finalise a deal for the multibillion-pound project this year. The licence from the nuclear regulator is considered a milestone for EDF, which plans to build Sizewell C as a replica of its Hinkley Point C project in Somerset, which has been dogged by delays and cost overruns. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) has granted only two site licences to build new nuclear plants in more than 35 years: the first for Hinkley Point C in 2012, and the second for Sizewell. It was granted as EDF works to reach a final investment decision on the Sizewell C project by the end of this year, depending on a government framework to finance the project and fresh investment to cover its construction costs. EDF holds just under 50% stake in the project, while the UK government holds just over 50%. They are searching for further investment after EDF\u2019s partner at Hinkley Point, China\u2019s CGN, was barred from the successor project over security concerns. Mina Golshan, a director at Sizewell C, said the licence was a \u201cshow of confidence\u201d from the UK\u2019s nuclear regulator that the company had a suitable site and was ready to begin large-scale construction work on a safe design replicated from Hinkley Point C. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge milestone and demonstrates that this project is firmly on track,\u201d Golshan said. EDF has blamed inflation, Covid and Brexit for a four-year delay and cost overruns at the Hinkley Point C site. It believes that by learning the lessons from Hinkley it will be able to build Sizewell C in about nine years. Mark Foy, the ONR chief nuclear inspector and its chief executive, said the licence was granted after \u201cextensive engagement and review\u201d by the ONR team and would allow the regulator to take greater regulatory oversight and challenge the company as it progressed its plans. \u201cThe licensing process is fundamental in confirming that operators of a nuclear site are ready and able to meet their obligations under the nuclear site licence, to protect their workforce and the public,\u201d Foy said. A group campaigning against the nuclear plant, Stop Sizewell C, said it was \u201cappalled that a nuclear site licence has been issued when matters critical to the future safety of the site remain unresolved. \u201cThere isn\u2019t even a final design of the sea defences, which will be necessary to keep this vulnerable site safe for the next century and a half, at the very least. This seems to us like kicking the can down the road, on the assumption that some future generation will be able to clear up the mess,\u201d the group said."

            "date": "2024-05-21T17:17:43Z",
            "content": "Russian forces have started military drills near Ukraine simulating the use of tactical nuclear weapons in response to what Moscow deems threats from western officials about increased involvement in the conflict. Vladimir Putin ordered the drills earlier this month in a move Russian officials said was a warning to the west not to escalate tensions further. The Kremlin has particularly been angered by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who floated the possibility of sending European troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, and by remarks from the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, who said Ukraine had the right to use weapons supplied by London to target sites in Russia. The Russian defence ministry published footage on Tuesday showing trucks carrying missiles to a field where launch systems had been prepared and troops at an airfield readying a bomber to carry a nuclear warhead. The drills are taking place in Russia\u2019s southern military district, headquartered in Rostov-on-Don, which borders Ukraine and includes parts of the country which Russia occupies. The ministry said it was the first stage of the drills, which involved practising the loading of launch vehicles, driving to launch sites and loading planes with hypersonic Kinzhal missiles. Russia has numerous weapons systems capable of delivering tactical nuclear warheads, meaning those designed for battlefield use, as opposed to strategic warheads that could wipe out whole cities. Unlike strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Russia and the US, tactical weapons have never been limited by any such pacts, and Russia has not released their number or any other details about them. Putin frequently evoked Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal in the early days of its invasion of Ukraine, repeatedly pledging to use all means necessary to defend Russia. He later seemed to moderate his rhetoric, reportedly after Chinese officials persuaded him to abandon his nuclear threats, but he recently warned Nato countries they risked provoking a nuclear war if they deployed troops to Ukraine. In a recent speech to mark the Soviet Union\u2019s victory in the second world war, he said the country\u2019s nuclear weapons were \u201calways at combat readiness\u201d. Also on Tuesday, a Russian general fired last year after complaining about problems his troops faced in Ukraine was arrested on bribery charges. Maj Gen Ivan Popov, who commanded the 58th Combined Arms force, which is fighting on the frontline near Zaporizhzhia, said last summer that he had been fired after he brought up problems on the battlefield, including the lack of counter-battery fire, and deaths and injuries the army was suffering from Ukrainian attacks. Without naming them, Popov appeared at the time to attack the head of the army, Valery Gerasimov, and the then defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, two of the country\u2019s most powerful military men, accusing them of stabbing the country in the back. Popov\u2019s arrest came amid the largest reshuffle in the defence ministry and the army since the war in Ukraine began over two years ago, raising expectations of possible further purges. Putin removed his longtime ally Shoigu from his role as defence minister earlier this month. Two other senior defence officials have also been arrested on corruption charges."

            "date": "2024-05-29T01:54:07Z",
            "content": "The CSIRO says it stands by its analysis on the costs of future nuclear power plants in Australia after the Coalition attacked the work, which contradicted its claims reactors would provide cheap electricity and be available within a decade. The opposition\u2019s energy spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, claimed on Tuesday in the Australian newspaper that the CSIRO should re-run its modelling to account for longer life-spans and running times of nuclear generators in other countries with nuclear programs. Last week the CSIRO released its GenCost report on the costs of different generation technologies, saying nuclear would be at least 50% more expensive than solar and wind and would not be available any sooner than 2040. The Coalition has yet to reveal any detail on its nuclear plan, including what type of reactors it would build, how large they would be and where they would put them. A CSIRO spokesperson told Guardian Australia: \u201cCSIRO provides impartial and independent advice and does not undertake modelling for specific policy directions. \u201cWhile we stand by the data provided, any alternative scenarios assessed by others would not carry CSIRO\u2019s endorsement.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup O\u2019Brien pointed to an assumption used in the GenCost report that nuclear plants would have a \u201ccapacity factor\u201d \u2013 how often they are generating electricity relative to their maximum capacity \u2013 of between 53% and 89%. O\u2019Brien wanted the CSIRO to use a higher figure of 92.7% for nuclear based on the performance of plants in the US. But the GenCost report discusses the reasons for setting capacity factors, saying new baseload generators such as nuclear \u201care expected to struggle to present the lowest cost bids to the dispatch market\u201d and would, therefore, likely be generating less often. O\u2019Brien also wanted the CSIRO to model the full lifespan of nuclear plants \u2013 which could be as long as 80 years \u2013 and to add a start date of 2035 to its modelling. The report provides cost estimates for power from different generation technologies, including both large and small reactors, for the years 2023, 2030 and 2040. The CSIRO spokesperson said: \u201cSpecific issues in regard to economic life of generation assets and capacity utilisation, including large scale nuclear, have been assessed by the GenCost team as part of the consultation process for the 2023-24 report.\u201d Australia has never built a nuclear reactor for electricity and the technology has been banned since 1998. The CSIRO report said if a decision was made in 2025 to adopt nuclear power, it would be at least 15 years until a reactor was producing power. The report said: \u201cNuclear technologies need to undergo more extensive safety and security permitting, nuclear prohibitions need to be removed at the state and commonwealth level and the safety authorities need to be established.\u201d The report estimated if Australia could establish a nuclear industry, then a 1,000MW plant would cost $8.6bn, but the first reactors could cost double that amount \u2013 more than $17bn. The report said: \u201cGiven the lack of a development pipeline and the additional legal and safety and security steps required, the first nuclear plant in Australia will be significantly delayed. Subsequent nuclear plant could be built more quickly as part of a pipeline of plants.\u201d"

            "content": "Ministers have earmarked north Wales as the site of a large-scale nuclear power plant, which is part of plans to resuscitate Britain\u2019s nuclear power ambitions. Wylfa on Anglesey (Ynys M\u00f4n) has been named as the preferred site for the UK\u2019s third major nuclear power plant in a generation, coming after EDF\u2019s Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, which is under construction in Somerset, and its Sizewell C nuclear project planned for Suffolk. The government added that it is already in discussion with major energy companies interested in building a nuclear power plant at Wylfa, which could help the UK reach its goal of sourcing a quarter of its electricity from nuclear power by 2050. South Korea\u2019s state-owned nuclear developer has reportedly held early-stage discussions with Westminster officials about building a multibillion-pound power plant using its APR1400 reactor technology at Wylfa alongside the UK government. Meanwhile, the American nuclear developer Westinghouse and the construction group Bechtel have also proposed building the plant, using Westinghouse\u2019s AP1000 reactor technology. EDF said it was for the government to determine which nuclear reactor type is used at Wylfa but two more of its own reactor units would \u201cbe the surest choice\u201d by \u201cbuilding on the skills and experience being developed at Hinkley Point and Sizewell\u201d. Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said the government was \u201cpowering ahead with the biggest expansion of nuclear energy in 70 years\u201d. The UK set out a plan to increase Britain\u2019s nuclear power capacity fourfold to reach 24 gigawatts (GW) by 2050. So far the Hinkley Point project has faced delays and rising costs, and the Sizewell project has yet to make a final investment decision. Coutinho said: \u201cAnglesey has a proud nuclear history and it is only right that, once again, it can play a central role in boosting the UK\u2019s energy security. Wylfa would not only bring clean, reliable power to millions of homes \u2013 it could create thousands of well-paid jobs and bring investment to the whole of north Wales.\u201d A deal would revive Wylfa\u2019s nuclear hopes after Japanese developer Hitachi dropped plans to build two reactors on the site in early 2019 because of rising costs, throwing the site\u2019s future into doubt. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: \u201cA large-scale project at Wylfa would be the single biggest inward investment in Welsh history, and a huge step towards both energy security and net zero for the whole country.\u201d Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of Prospect union, said: \u201cGigawatt scale new nuclear power stations are vital to hitting net zero and for our energy security. But they also maintain well-paid and highly skilled jobs, meaning this project would be a major boost to the Welsh economy.\u201d \u201cNow we need a laser-like focus on delivery of new nuclear to make sure skills and experience are not lost, and costs are reduced as we progress,\u201d Ferns said. The decision on the nuclear developer, and what type of technology should be used at Wylfa, will be made by Great British Nuclear, which was launched with the aim of providing new power stations, including a fleet of small modular reactors."

            "date": "2024-05-03T14:57:52Z",
            "content": "The Biden administration on Friday finalized a rule that would expand healthcare coverage for immigrants who came to the US as children and are shielded from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as Daca. Under the new rule, recipients of the Obama-era Daca program would be newly eligible to access healthcare coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces for the first time. In a statement, Biden hailed the rule as a \u201chistoric step\u201d but acknowledged that only Congress could provide Dreamers and their families the security of permanent status and a pathway to citizenship. \u201cToday, my administration is expanding affordable, quality healthcare coverage to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) recipients,\u201d the president said. \u201cDreamers are our loved ones, our nurses, teachers and small business owners. And they deserve the promise of healthcare just like all of us.\u201d The White House move comes amid a searing election-year debate over immigration, as Republicans, led by their presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, attempt to blame a rise in border crossings on Biden and his administration\u2019s polices. Enrollees of the Daca program are authorized to study and work in the US, where they collectively pay an estimated $6.2bn in federal taxes every year. However, Daca enrollees were not eligible for government-subsidized health insurance programs because they were not by definition \u201clawfully present\u201d in the US. The rule modifies that definition to ensure Daca recipients are not excluded from individual healthcare marketplaces due to their immigration status. Like the majority of Americans, most Daca recipients get health insurance through an employer. But about one-third of the 580,000 Daca recipients do not have access to insurance, and until now were ineligible for federal health programs. Recipients of Daca are about three times more likely than the general public to be uninsured. The administration estimates that the new policy could cover as many as 100,000 previously uninsured Daca recipients. At a federal cost of about $5,000 a person, the program is expected to cost less than $1bn. The rule change does not make Daca recipients eligible for Medicaid, a health insurance program for poor and disabled Americans that is jointly run by the states and federal government. Proposals to make Daca recipients eligible for Medicaid infuriated Republicans, even as many a left-leaning states have extended Medicaid to to immigrants or their children, including those living in the US without authorization. Medicaid is often states\u2019 largest budget line item. \u201cMaking Dreamers eligible to enroll in coverage will improve their health and wellbeing and strengthen the health and wellbeing of our nation and our economy,\u201d the health and human services secretary, Xavier Becerra, told reporters, applauding so-called Dreamers as immigrants \u201cwho have worked hard to live the American dream\u201d. Uninsured people are more likely to skip preventive services, delay treatment when they are ill and to be saddled with medical debt. An estimated 22 million people in the US lacked health insurance in 2022 \u2013 an all-time low expected to climb as states boot people off Medicaid following the pandemic. Daca recipients can apply for coverage through HealthCare.gov and state-based marketplaces in November, and some may be eligible for financial assistance. However, like many Americans, even Daca recipients with insurance will not be entirely shielded from healthcare\u2019s exorbitant cost. Federally regulated insurance marketplaces have among the highest cost-sharing in the industry. For people who are not low-income, insurers can force people on a family plan to kick in up to $18,900 a year. The exchanges were established through the ACA, a law better known as \u201cObamacare\u201d that Biden helped push through Congress in 2010 as vice-president. During Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans tried and failed repeatedly to repeal the law, which has grown in popularity. Daca was created in 2012 by then president Barack Obama, after more than a decade of failed attempts by Congress to pass an overhaul of the nation\u2019s beleaguered immigration system. The White House action comes as the program, which has served roughly 800,000 immigrants since its creation, is in legal peril with its fate ultimately expected to be decided by the supreme court. A bipartisan border bill, backed by Biden and other top Democrats, did not include a pathway to citizenship for the hundreds of millions of Daca recipients, known as Dreamers. The legislation was derailed by Trump shortly after it was unveiled in the Senate earlier this year. But the lack of a provision providing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, a broadly popular policy proposal that was once a top priority for Democratic lawmakers, was a major setback for immigrant rights advocates. \u201cCongress must act to ensure that Dreamers can remain here permanently, so that they can fully contribute to our communities and our country,\u201d Neera Tanden, the White House domestic policy adviser, told reporters. \u201cDreamers are part of the American fabric. They\u2019re our friends, neighbors and coworkers and we must do right by that, not just for them but for the country.\u201d"

But when they began their transition as a teenager, they were made to feel \u201clike an oddity\u201d. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like a safe place because [the doctors] just really didn\u2019t understand gender at all,\u201d they say. The practice did not know how to meet Wileman\u2019s healthcare needs as a trans person and acted \u201cweird\u201d when they asked about hormone therapy, used by some trans people for medical affirmation of their gender. Wileman has since found more inclusive gender-affirming health services but says finding empathetic care is a common challenge for the queer community, who do a lot of informal peer support for each other. \u201cWhen somebody wants to go to a new doctor, or they need like a psychologist \u2026 the first thing that people will do is ask friends in the community: \u2018Do you know somewhere that\u2019s safe? Do you know somewhere that\u2019s affirming and knows their stuff?\u2019\u201d Wileman, the queer officer at Curtin University in Western Australia, says. \u201cLots of people I know will defer getting help because they\u2019re worried about discrimination.\u201d Stigma, assumptions and a lack of understanding A report published in May from Curtin University\u2019s Collaboration For Evidence, Research and Impact in Public Health found ongoing and significant barriers to LGBTQIA+ people using mainstream health services. These include a lack of knowledge and ignorance of the lived reality of LGBTQIA+ people, as well as stigma and discrimination. Dr Jonathan Hallett, the lead author of the report, says: \u201cA key part of the story that we found was the role of community-controlled organisations in providing a really important response to the health disparities that these communities experience.\u201d Community-controlled organisations are those governed and operated by and for specific communities, such as LGBTIQA+ people. \u201cBut they\u2019re chronically underfunded and under-resourced, and can\u2019t cope with the service need within these really diverse communities,\u201d Hallett says. The report \u2013 commissioned by not-for-profit LGBTIQA+ organisation Living Proud and funded by the WA Primary Health Alliance \u2013 analysed state and federal health policy to see how and whether LGBTIQA+ people were considered. A review of health disparities was also conducted, alongside consultations with queer services, mainstream health organisations, government health services and individuals with lived experience. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cThere have been improvements in the healthcare system but, when we spoke to study participants, they were still sharing some really awful stories of direct stigma, or a lack of understanding or assumptions about their lives,\u201d Hallett says. One lesbian woman living in regional Western Australia told the researchers about taking her son to the GP and constantly being asked about \u201cthe father\u201d. \u201cWhy do I have to out myself every single time I\u2019m here?\u201d she told the researchers. She says she avoided GPs as a result, ending up in emergency care on multiple occasions for health issues that could have been addressed earlier. The report called for secure, long-term government funding of community-controlled health organisations, including in regional areas where LGBTIQA+ people experience greater inequity and barriers to accessing appropriate and safe healthcare. Courtney Dunkerton, who lives in the town of Busselton in WA\u2019s south-west, no longer visits her local GP for her trans-related health issues after the doctor would not prescribe pain relief for a painful, three-hour electrolysis procedure to remove facial hair. \u201cThe outside of the top lip is one level of pain, which is very high, and then directly under the nose [the pain] is just off the charts, the worst of the worst.\u201d Instead, Dunkerton drives a more than four hours round trip to Perth to visit a GP who has lived experience as a trans person. \u201cShe just has a different level of knowledge and understanding of the trans experience.\u201d Trans young people are particularly vulnerable to the impact of stigma and rejection, the Curtin report found, with nearly three-quarters reporting a diagnosis of depression or anxiety, about 80% reporting self-harm and suicidal thoughts and 48.1% reporting a suicide attempt. Prof Adam Bourne, the director of the Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University, says the report findings \u201cvery much reflect what we observe in every state\u201d. \u201cWe need to be ensuring that every LGBTIQ person can go to any health service and receive the quality of care that they deserve in a safe and affirming environment \u2013 but that is taking and will continue to take a really long time to achieve,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the meantime, there are often LGBTIQA+ people in some quite acute circumstances. There\u2019s a need that needs to be met right now, not in 10 or 15 years\u2019 time, and I think that\u2019s where community-controlled organisations really can play a significant role. \u201cBut none of them are funded anywhere near the scale that\u2019s required to really move the needle in terms of health disparity.\u201d What needs to be done Progress is being made, with the federal government preparing the first ever national action plan for LGBTIQA+ health and wellbeing, due for release later this year. The plan\u2019s expert advisory group says engagement with LGBTIQA+ community controlled services is essential, given unsafe and negative experiences in primary care and challenges related to access and costs. Other barriers to primary care include misgendering or exclusionary language and shame-based narratives around HIV and other sexual health matters, the Curtin report found. Australian gay and bisexual men living in regions with higher levels of stigma are less likely to undergo HIV/STI testing, receive diagnoses, or engage in prevention. In May the federal health minister, Mark Butler, announced Australia as the fourth country to sign on to the principles of the Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U) global HIV campaign, joining Canada, the United States and Vietnam. The campaign aims to spread recognition that a person living with HIV on effective antiretroviral treatment will reach an \u201cundetectable\u201d viral load and cannot sexually transmit the virus. David Polson, who participated in 28 drug trials for HIV treatment, says adopting U=U is a significant step towards combatting stigma. Polson acknowledged those who have stood against stigma at a time when homophobia was particularly rife, including the nurses in Ward 17 South \u2013 Australia\u2019s first dedicated HIV/Aids treatment and care centre, which opened in 1983 and became the epicentre for treating Sydney HIV patients. \u201cAt a time of hatred and fear outside the ward, we felt their compassion [that] we didn\u2019t see outside,\u201d Polson says. Butler says the LGBTIQA+ community has been responsible for many health successes, including the near-elimination of HIV transmission in Sydney. The LGBTIQA+ community\u2019s proactive response to the virus \u201chas taught us more broadly in the health sector how to do good policy, how to do good design, how to do good delivery, how to put patients truly at the centre of a health response, rather than have that response to be simply government or clinician-led,\u201d he says. On 21 May, he announced $43.9m towards strategies to eliminate the transmission of HIV in Australia by 2030. In the meantime, NSW and WA are the only jurisdictions with specific health strategies for their LGBTIQA+ populations. A first-of-its-kind multidisciplinary LGBTIQ+ health service, the Kaleido health centre, will open in Sydney later in 2024, offering gender-affirming care, mental health care, sexual health care, drug and alcohol services and cancer screening. Hallett says his report aimed to provide a focal point for a discussion on a response. \u201cA lot of the really exciting work is coming out of community controlled LGBTIQA+ organisations, and it\u2019s really about centring the stories of those organisations and community in finding answers to addressing these problems \u2013 that pleasingly has been the story on a national stage, and it does feel like that\u2019s gaining momentum.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-26T12:00:53Z",
            "content": "NHS England has been accused of \u201cdragging its feet\u201d on bringing in new accessibility procedures, leading to disabled people routinely struggling to access healthcare and facing cancelled appointments. The Accessible Information Standard (AIS), originally implemented in 2016, was part of legislation designed to ensure that NHS and adult social care services providers make sure that people with a disability are able to have their accessibility requirements met when accessing health and social care. In 2022, NHS England accepted a recommendation to revise the AIS, which had stronger wording than the original, meaning that providers of NHS care \u201cmust comply with the information standard\u201d, whereas the earlier standard said providers only had to \u201chave regard to an information standard\u201d. The updated standard was meant to be published in 2023, but its publication has been delayed. Charities and organisations have said that the delay has meant that many deaf patients have been left without the ability to make GP appointments and receive test results because health services often rely on phone calls. Abigail Gorman, SignHealth policy and research manager, accused the NHS of dragging its feet in improving access, which was \u201cfailing deaf people and putting our lives at risk\u201d. She added: \u201cFor deaf people, poor access to healthcare is unfortunately one of the most common and sometimes life-threatening barriers we face. The updated AIS will go some way towards improving access for deaf patients, but it\u2019s not enough and the process is taking too long. \u201cThe NHS is not taking basic patient access seriously enough. We are calling on NHS England to publish the updated AIS and adequately resource the next steps necessary to carry it out.\u201d Ken*, who is in his 30s, from London, has an ethnic minority background and identifies as profoundly deaf with British Sign Language as his first language, said the lack of interpreters at his NHS appointments meant that he often had to have his mum translate, which led to further problems. \u201cNo information was provided in an accessible format for me, so I relied on my mum,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever the healthcare professional was explaining, my mum was relaying to me very little. I much prefer giving my own account and explanation of my symptoms and how it\u2019s impacting me, but it was communicated through my mum. She doesn\u2019t have proficient levels of BSL, she only got to level one, so there are lots of gaps in the information going both ways.\u201d He added that it was often not made clear to him whether an interpreter would be provided, and on some occasions they turned up to his appointment halfway through. \u201cThey\u2019re not meeting my need for an interpreter and I can\u2019t rely on written English because English isn\u2019t my first language,\u201d he said. Victoria Boelman, the director of insight and policy at Royal National Institute of Deaf People (RNID), said: \u201cThe lack of access to healthcare that deaf people and people with hearing loss face is a hidden national scandal. It\u2019s distressing that, on a daily basis, people miss life-changing diagnoses and treatment information, are forced to forfeit their rights to privacy surrounding their health, and face negative attitudes and behaviours from health staff.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cAll NHS services have a legal duty to provide clear and appropriate methods of communication to ensure that patients, service users and carers can fully understand everything they need to about their treatment and care.\u201d *This name has been changed."

            "date": "2024-05-21T04:00:31Z",
            "content": "When Rosy Bremer, 52, from Portsmouth, applied for a wheelchair from the NHS she did not expect it to take almost a year to arrive. She has spent hundreds since then hiring a private vehicle while she waits, despite having motor neurone disease (MND). Bremer is one of many who have had issues with the private wheelchair firm AJM Healthcare. The health service ombudsman told AJM to improve its complaints system amid concerns about delays. Some disabled people have reported waiting up to two years for a chair. She had been having trouble with mobility before her diagnosis of MND. \u201cI applied for my first wheelchair around the summer last year. I had been having problems with mobility but was not aware I could get a wheelchair from the NHS,\u201d she says. Bremer hired a private wheelchair while she waited, which initially cost \u00a3100 a week, although the costs later dropped to \u00a330 a week as she had it for longer. \u201cI hired it as a short-term measure but months later I still have it.\u201d To get a wheelchair, Bremer had to make two visits to her GP to be measured. Then she had one home visit from a physiotherapist organised through AJM. It is the physio\u2019s job to order the wheelchair but her first appointment was cancelled due to staff sickness. \u201cThe replacement appointment then wasn\u2019t booked on the system, although I had received an appointment letter,\u201d she says. Eventually, a physiotherapist took measurements. They also discussed what kind of wheelchair was needed based on her clinical needs. The wheelchair was prescribed in January, months after she initially enquired. \u201cAt that time I was not diagnosed with MND but had a neuromuscular condition,\u201d Bremer says. In March 2024, Bremer received her motor neurone disease diagnosis, which she says should mean her referral is \u201cclassed as urgent\u201d. She says: \u201cI have contacted AJM Healthcare ... [they] cannot give me anything resembling a date on which I can expect my wheelchair. \u201cI cannot get anything out of them, other than the fact there is a backlog to deal with. I don\u2019t know what that means \u2026 but that is all I know.\u201d The wheelchair Bremer hired has no posture support. She says that as her \u201chead, neck and back muscles deteriorate it is increasingly uncomfortable\u201d. She also has rheumatoid arthritis and finds the arm support and joystick unsuitable. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying and \u2026 as my condition progresses the lack of correct back head and neck support means when I do go out in my wheelchair I am very uncomfortable.\u201d The wheelchair is also expensive and Bremer is no longer working due to being medically retired. She has, as a result, incurred expense trying to fund a wheelchair on an interim basis from a private provider with the help of family. \u201cMND is a complex disease, which means I have a lot of different bodies to deal with ... Navigating that adds to the incredible burden of having a disability,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-05-06T19:27:41Z",
            "content": "Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, announced on Monday that he will run for a fourth six-year term \u2013 at the age of 82. In a video statement, Sanders thanked the people of Vermont \u201cfor giving me the opportunity to serve in the United States Senate\u201d, which he said had been \u201cthe honor of my life. \u201cToday I am announcing my intention to seek another term. And let me take a few minutes to tell you why.\u201d In his signature clipped New York accent, Sanders did so. Citing his roles as chair of the Senate health, labor and pensions committee, part of Senate Democratic leadership, and as a member of committees on veterans affairs, the budget and the environment, Sanders said: \u201cI have been, and will be if re-elected, in a strong position to provide the kind of help that Vermonters need in these difficult times.\u201d Should Sanders win re-election and serve a full term, he will be 89 years old at the end of those six years. In a decidedly gerontocratic Senate, that would still be younger than the current oldest senator, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who will turn 91 in September. The Republican is due for re-election in 2028 \u2013 and has filed to run. Sanders was a mayor and sat in the US House for 16 years before entering the Senate in 2007. In 2016 he surged to worldwide prominence by mounting an unexpectedly strong challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, from the populist left. He ran strongly again in 2020 but lost out to Joe Biden. Announcing another election run, Sanders stressed the need to improve public healthcare, including by defending social security and Medicare and lowering prescription drug prices; to combat climate change that has seen Vermont hit by severe flooding; to properly care for veterans; and to protect abortion and reproductive rights. \u201cWe must codify Roe v Wade [which protected federal abortion rights until 2022] into national law and do everything possible to oppose the well-funded rightwing effort to roll back the gains that women have achieved after decades of struggle,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cNo more second-class citizenship for the women of Vermont. Or America.\u201d Addressing an issue which threatens to split Democrats in the year of a presidential election, Sanders said: \u201cOn October 7, 2023, Hamas, a terrorist organization, began the war in Gaza with a horrific attack on Israel that killed 1,200 innocent men, women and children and took more than 230 hostages, some of whom remain in captivity today. Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terrorist attack.\u201d But Sanders, who is Jewish, also said Israel \u201cdid not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people, which was exactly what it is doing: 34,000 Palestinians have already been killed and 77,000 have been wounded, 70% of whom are women and children. According to humanitarian organizations, famine and starvation are now imminent. \u201cIn my view, US tax dollars should not be going to the extremist [Benjamin] Netanyahu government to continue its devastating war against the Palestinian people.\u201d In conclusion, if without mentioning Donald Trump by name, Sanders called the 2024 election \u201cthe most consequential election in our lifetimes\u201d. \u201cWill the United States continue to even function as a democracy? Or will we move to an authoritarian form of government? Will we reverse the unprecedented level of income and wealth inequality that now exists? Or will we continue to see billionaires get richer while working families struggle to put food on the table? Can we create a government that works for all of us? Or will our political system continue to be dominated by wealthy campaign contributors? \u201cThese are just some of the questions that together we need to answer.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-08T02:18:56Z",
            "content": "AstraZeneca has begun the worldwide withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine due to a \u201csurplus of available updated vaccines\u201d that target new variants of the virus. The announcement follows the pharmaceutical company in March voluntarily withdrawing its European Union marketing authorisation, which is the approval to market a medicine in member states. On 7 May, the European Medicines Agency issued a notice that the vaccine is no longer authorised for use. In a statement, AstraZeneca said the decision was made because there is now a variety of newer vaccines available that have been adapted to target Covid-19 variants. This had led to a decline in demand for the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied. \u201cAccording to independent estimates, over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone and over 3bn doses were supplied globally,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic. We will now work with regulators and our partners to align on a clear path forward to conclude this chapter and significant contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Other countries have already stopped supplying the vaccine. It has not been available for use in Australia since March 2023, though its use was already being phased out from June 2021 due to the widespread availability of newer vaccines. AstraZeneca changed the name of its Covid vaccine to Vaxzevria in 2021. The vaccine was authorised for use in those aged 18 and older, delivered as two injections, usually into the muscle of the upper arm, about three month apart. It was also used by some countries as a booster shot. Vaxzevria is made up of another virus of the adenovirus family modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The vaccine does not contain the virus itself and cannot cause the virus. Although the vaccine was found to be safe and effective overall, it carried the risk of a rare but serious side-effect, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The rare syndrome occurred in about two to three people per 100,000 who were vaccinated with the Vaxzevria vaccine. The chair of epidemiology at Deakin University in Australia, Prof Catherine Bennett, said the vaccine had played a pivotal part in the worldwide fight against the virus, particularly in the early days of the pandemic when limited vaccines were available. \u201cIt has saved millions of lives and that should not be forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a really important part of the initial global response. However, it targeted the initial ancestral variants. We\u2019ve now moved into a vaccine chain where we have products available that are chasing the variants that are emerging. \u201cThere\u2019s also a shift in the risk calculus as well, given populations are much more protected and, even though of course Covid still causes deaths, we are overall less vulnerable to the disease.\u201d The latest Covid-19 vaccine advice issued by the World Health Organisation in April advised that formulations of Covid-19 vaccines should target the JN.1 lineage of the virus, which is displacing existing XBB lineage variants."

            "date": "2024-05-19T12:00:34Z",
            "content": "Cast your mind back, if you will, to the beginning of the pandemic, before the World Health Organization had coined the term Covid-19. Back then, it was the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, a mysterious pathogen from a city that few people outside China had visited. On 12 January 2020, China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published the virus\u2019s genome on an international database, permitting scientists anywhere in the world to see that it was a coronavirus closely related to Sars \u2013 the pathogen that had caused a mini-pandemic in 2002-2004. On 20 January, Dr Zhong Nanshan \u2013 well known in China as the first person to have spoken out in 2003 about the threat posed by Sars \u2013 appeared on China Central Television to break the news that the Wuhan virus \u2013 or Sars-CoV-2 as it was now officially known \u2013 was \u201ccertainly transmissible from human to human\u201d. Three days later, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, instructed officials in Wuhan to lock down the city, placing 11 million under an unprecedented three-month quarantine. The problem was clinicians had been warning of a new Sars-like illness since 27 December 2019 and by late January cases had already appeared in Thailand, Japan and Korea. The Wuhan virus had gone global. What accounts for China\u2019s failure to prevent the pandemic? After all, unlike Sars, which was initially mistaken for bird flu, Sars-CoV-2 had been rapidly identified by several laboratories in China. And after Sars, China had overhauled its national disease reporting system to ensure it would not be caught flat-footed a second time. Wuhan also boasted some of the best hospitals in China and a world-class virology institute. As Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and an expert on Chinese bureaucracy, puts it in his new book, Wuhan: How the Covid-19 Outbreak in China Spiraled Out of Control, China began with a \u201cremarkably strong hand\u201d but quickly squandered its \u201cauthoritarian advantage\u201d. Why? Was it medical myopia \u2013 a refusal to recognise the monster at its door \u2013 bureaucratic incompetence, or something more sinister? Yang has little time for claims that the virus was a product of a \u201clab leak\u201d from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), devoting just one paragraph to the theory. Instead, he focuses on the bureaucratic obfuscation and missteps that allowed the outbreak to spiral out of control. Frontline physicians, he explains, were initially fearful of reporting their suspicions to Beijing in case they were accused of scaremongering. Officials at the municipal level were similarly reluctant to sully Wuhan\u2019s reputation as a \u201chealthy city\u201d, giving the go-ahead for a mass gathering of provincial Communist party officials on 15 January. The result was that it was not until New Year\u2019s Eve that the CDC\u2019s director, George Gao, dispatched a specialist emergency response team to Wuhan, after learning about the outbreak via social media. The second mistake came when the team from the national health commission decided to cordon off the Huanan market in Wuhan, even though by early January clinicians were already seeing patients with no connection to the market. The third came when the Wuhan health commission issued guidelines on how to diagnose the disease, stipulating that in addition to the usual clinical symptoms, patients had to have had a link to, or been in proximity to, the market. This meant that cases with no apparent connection to the market were ignored, lulling authorities into a false sense of complacency as the virus spread stealthily under the radar. The result was that rather than drawing on its post-Sars warning systems and its considerable epidemiological expertise, China prioritised dominance and control over transparency, censoring social media posts about the spreading contagion, disciplining medical whistleblowers and squandering its reserves of trust. Citing a study that showed that if Wuhan had locked down five days earlier, Covid-19 cases in China would have been two-thirds lower, Yang describes the four-week period from 31 December to the lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January as \u201camong the most important weeks in the history of pandemics\u201d. He concludes his book by arguing that if, rather than using its powers to silence whistleblowers and issue positive propaganda messages, Beijing had been open and honest with the citizens of Wuhan, it could have enlisted people\u2019s memories of Sars and fear of infection to encourage the voluntary adoption of social distancing measures, thereby limiting or avoiding catastrophe. I am not so sure. By backdating mutations in the virus, scientists estimate it most likely infected someone as early as November or late October 2019. In other words, long before patients began presenting with unusual pneumonias, the virus had probably already escaped Wuhan and was set to become a global problem. Aimed principally at an academic audience, Yang\u2019s book is hard going at times \u2013 I could have done without the bold subheadings, such as \u201cThe Stability Maintenance Regime\u201d, that pepper each chapter. However, as a forensic account of the initial response to the outbreak and China\u2019s dysfunctional bureaucracy, I doubt it will be bettered. For a more engaging, if episodic, take on those early, fear-filled weeks of the pandemic, readers should turn to Liao Yiwu\u2019s Wuhan. A Chinese dissident best known for his poems about the Tiananmen Square massacre, Liao is an outspoken critic of the Chinese regime. From exile in Italy, he has written an extraordinary \u201cdocumentary novel\u201d that draws on official Chinese websites plus social media posts and blogs by citizen-reporters, to create a ground-level view of the crisis that mixes fact and fiction. The main protagonist is \u201cKcriss\u201d, a former Chinese state TV host who travels to Wuhan to shed light on the rumours and ends up taking a job at a funeral home. It does not take Kcriss long to realise that Wuhan\u2019s crematoriums are working overtime and that the official death figures are a lie. But nothing can be allowed to stand in the way of the party and its message: \u201cOne Belt, One Road, do not look back.\u201d Unlike Yang, Liao does not dodge the questions surrounding the Wuhan Institute of Virology. However, his account, which draws largely on secondary sources, is inconclusive and he is unable to say whether \u201can evil\u201d was committed there. On the question of whether Wuhan could and should have been locked down sooner, however, he and Yang are in accord. \u201cLike a high-speed train rushing towards the edge of a deep abyss\u2026 the city was closed too late.\u201d According to Yang, this failure was down to a mixture of cognitive bias \u2013 the expectation that the outbreak at the market would be self-limiting \u2013 and China\u2019s multilayered party-state hierarchy, which followed its own institutional political logic, rather than that of the virus. The tragedy is that Chinese authorities appear to have learned little from their mistakes. Last month, the Shanghai-based virologist Zhang Yongzhen was evicted from his lab at short notice, apparently as a punishment for sharing the genome of the coronavirus without permission. On 5 January 2020, Zhang had been among the first to sequence the virus and, concluding it was spreading from person to person, urged the authorities to act. When they prevaricated, he decided to circumvent official channels and publish the genome on virological.org, where it was accessible to scientists anywhere in the world. A day later, the CDC followed suit. In response to his eviction, Zhang camped outside his lab in protest. \u201cI won\u2019t leave, I won\u2019t quit, I am pursuing science and the truth!\u201d he announced in a Weibo post that has since been deleted. Last week, he and his team were allowed back into the lab for the \u201ctime being\u201d. Unfortunately, in China bureaucrats have long memories and truth is determined by the party, not scientists.

            "date": "2024-05-20T22:29:19Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush-money trial entered its 19th day on Monday in Manhattan with what has become a routine procession. Trump walked into the hallway, and then the courtroom, with a phalanx of supporters that included his son, Eric, and Republicans of varying prominence. This morning, some of Trump\u2019s guests included Kash Patel and the law professor Alan Dershowitz, whose reputation has waned due to his past association with Jeffrey Epstein. Others present included: a former leader of the New York Hells Angels chapter, and a disgraced former NYPD commissioner. Trump\u2019s outsize entourage, albeit comprised of flickering political stars and talking heads, was in keeping with an important day at his trial. The prosecution rested after both sides concluded their respective questioning of Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s onetime consigliere-turned-prosecution witness. Here are some key takeaways from the day\u2019s proceedings: Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony concluded Cohen, who took the stand on Monday, 13 May and was the prosecution\u2019s most important witness, saw his cross-examination, and re-direct, end this afternoon. Indeed, prosecutors said that Trump, Cohen and tabloid honcho David Pecker plotted in summer 2015 to keep negative press about the then-candidate under wraps \u2013 so as not to derail his presidential campaign. During his direct testimony, Cohen told jurors that Trump instructed him to fix Stormy Daniels\u2019 account of an extramarital liaison in 2006 and personally signed checks that reimbursed him for the $130,000 hush-money payment. Trump\u2019s lead attorney, Todd Blanche, struggled to hit Cohen with \u201cgotcha\u201d moments, and the closest he arguably came was in offering an alternative explanation about why the ex-president\u2019s longtime confidant would receive $420,000 in payments for a $130,000 cost. Cohen received a $150,000 bonus in 2015, but a $50,000 bonus in 2016. Blanche suggested that Cohen used the repayment setup to get his hands on bonus money he thought he deserved. Cohen paid a tech company called Red Finch $20,000 to help make Trump look better in a poll about business leaders , and told then Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg that he was owed $50,000. In Blanche\u2019s understanding, this meant that Cohen stole $30,000 from Trump\u2019s namesake company. \u201cSo you stole from the Trump Organization?\u201d Blanche asked. \u201cYes, sir\u201d, Cohen said. Cohen regained his footing on re-direct After cross wrapped, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger had an opportunity to question Cohen again. She tried to undermine Blanche\u2019s suggestion that Cohen\u2019s cooperation against Trump was out of self-interest. She asked what had happened to him since he started speaking out and, ultimately, cooperating with law enforcement. \u201cMy entire life has been turned upside down as a direct result, I lost my law license, my businesses, my financial security,\u201d Cohen said. Hoffinger also tried to undercut Blanche\u2019s suggestion that Cohen was very distracted in October 2016, dealing with a litany of issues, such that he might not really recall how often he spoke with Trump about Daniels. Hoffinger asked: \u201cApproximately how many conversations would you say that you had with Mr Trump about the Stormy Daniels matter just in October of 2016, if you can approximate?\u201d \u201cMore than 20\u201d, Michael Cohen said. \u201cWould you have paid Stormy Daniels if Mr Trump had not signed off?\u201d Hoffinger pressed. He said: \u201cNo ma\u2019am\u201d, and, when asked why not, he explained: \u201cBecause, I wanted to ensure that I\u2019d get my funds back.\u201d Robert Costello claimed Cohen cleared Trump in conversations Costello was a defense lawyer with whom Cohen met after federal authorities raided his hotel room and apartment. Cohen told jurors that he was leery of Costello, who had described a close relationship with Trump ally Rudy Giuliani. Cohen said he didn\u2019t trust Costello, concerned that anything he said would get to Giuliani and thus, Trump. \u201cDo you know somebody named Michael Cohen?\u201d he was asked. Costello said he met Cohen on 17 April 2018, at the hotel where he was staying. \u201cHe was absolutely manic at the beginning and throughout the two hours of that meeting, he kept on pacing back and forth, left and right,\u201d Costello said. \u201cI explained to Michael Cohen that this entire legal problem he was facing would be resolved by the end of the week if he had truthful information about Donald Trump and cooperated with the southern district of New York,\u201d Costello told jurors. Cohen allegedly claimed: \u201cI swear to god, Bob, I don\u2019t have anything on Donald Trump. Costello prompted near-chaos in court Despite Costello\u2019s comments on Cohen, he wasn\u2019t exactly a great witness for the defense because of his courtroom composure. He said \u201cjeez\u201d at one point and instructed that something be stricken \u2013 which is something only a judge can do. Judge Juan Merchan directed the jury to leave at one point during his testimony and then told Costello: \u201cSo when there\u2019s a witness on the stand and you don\u2019t like my ruling, you don\u2019t say \u2018jeez,\u2019 and you don\u2019t say \u2018strike it\u2019. Because I\u2019m the only one who can strike ... \u201d Merchan said. It devolved further. \u201cYou don\u2019t roll your eyes, do you understand that? Do you understand that? Are you staring me down right now?\u201d Merchan said. Then, the judge ordered \u201cclear the courtroom,\u201d kicking the press and public out of court proceedings, for which there is a presumption of access under the US constitution, New York state and common law. He did not allow a media attorney to address the court regarding the access issue. So Merchan booted reporters from the courtroom; they were let back in several moments later."

            "content": "The Covid pandemic accelerated a decline in the number of people who regularly attend Church of England services, according to data. If there had been no pandemic \u2013 during which churches were closed for several months \u2013 the C of E estimates that about 747,000 people would have attended weekly services in 2023, continuing a declining trend. Preliminary analysis of data gathered by the C of E shows 685,000 worshippers attended services in 2023 \u2013 62,000 less than the projection \u2013 or 1.2% of the population of England. In the pre-pandemic year of 2019, weekly attendance was 854,000, or 1.5% of the population. However, some recovery was seen in 2023, with weekly attendance figures rising by almost 5% overall, and nearly 6% for under-16s. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, welcomed the figures, saying he hoped they would encourage clergy and congregations \u201cwho have shown such faith, hope and confidence over recent years to share the gospel with their communities\u201d. He added: \u201cThese are just one set of figures, but they show without doubt that people are coming to faith in Jesus Christ here and now \u2013 and realising it\u2019s the best decision they could ever make.\u201d Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, said: \u201cFor the first time in a long time we have seen noticeable growth. Of course we don\u2019t yet know whether this growth is a trend but I take it as a great encouragement that our focus on reaching more people with the good news of Jesus, establishing new Christian communities, wherever they are, revitalising our parishes, and seeking to become a younger and more diverse church, making everyone feel welcome, is beginning to make a difference.\u201d The C of E will publish full attendance data in the autumn."

            "date": "2024-05-08T10:00:42Z",
            "content": "The Welsh first minister, Vaughan Gething, has expressed regret over the donations scandal that has beset his first weeks in office but rejected a fresh allegation that he may have committed perjury in statements made to the UK Covid inquiry concerning deleted messages. In an interview with the Guardian, Gething said it was important not to \u201cget lost\u201d in controversy that drew attention away from the business of running Wales and winning the general election. He vowed to show \u201cresilience\u201d in the face of attacks on him. Seven weeks into his leadership, Gething continues to face criticism for taking \u00a3200,000 from a company whose owner was convicted of environmental crimes, with Labour insiders warning the scandal is critically undermining his authority. Asked if he regretted taking the donation, Gething said: \u201cI really do regret the impact it has had on so many people.\u201d He said he was trying to draw a line under the issue by asking the Senedd\u2019s standards of conduct committee to look at the issue of political donations and make sure they are \u201crobust, transparent and have the confidence of the public\u201d. Gething said he had followed the rules in accepting the donation and wanted to focus on the job of governing Wales and preparing for the general election. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to not get lost in a story that has importance but actually takes us away from our mainstream business.\u201d This week, however, the pressure was ratcheted up by the emergence of an exchange with fellow Labour members from the time of the pandemic when Gething was health minister in which he said he was going to delete iMessages. He wrote: \u201cI\u2019m deleting the messages in this group. They can be captured in an FoI [freedom of information request] and I think we are all in the right place on the choice being made.\u201d The UK Covid inquiry is considering whether to seek more information from Gething over the exchange, and a bereaved family support group expressed anger. In the Senedd on Tuesday, the Plaid Cymru leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, suggested Gething may have committed perjury in his evidence to the inquiry when he addressed the issue of how information from the period was retained. Gething called the idea that he may have committed perjury \u201cobnoxious\u201d. He told the Guardian he had not deleted any messages that related to decisions made by the Welsh government during Covid. He said the iMessages, leaked to the news service Nation Cymru, related to \u201cunkind comments\u201d that were potentially embarrassing made on a group following a Labour group meeting. The first minister said: \u201cThis is actually about not saying things that are embarrassing as opposed to trying to hide Covid decision-making. I stand by everything I\u2019ve said both about how my devices were managed [and] the information that\u2019s been provided.\u201d Asked if it was worrying that the messages had been leaked, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously concerning that a photo of a message from nearly four years ago has been provided to a journalist but that\u2019s what happens and part of the job is you need to be resilient enough to deal with that.\u201d He said there was \u201cmischief\u201d in how the messages had been presented and he had sent the full exchange to the UK Covid inquiry. Anna-Louise Marsh-Rees, of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru, said: \u201cYet more obfuscation from Vaughan Gething. His explanations simply don\u2019t stack up. He explained that the messages were just Labour group business. But if that was the case then FoI requests wouldn\u2019t apply.\u201d It is not the first time Gething has come under fire over Covid phone exchanges. During the Welsh leg of the inquiry in March, Gething blamed a \u201csecurity rebuild\u201d of his Senedd mobile phone for the deletion of WhatsApp messages from the time of the pandemic, calling it \u201ca matter of real embarrassment\u201d. Marsh-Rees said: \u201cWe must know why Welsh government didn\u2019t disclose this [iMessage] group chat to the inquiry before the Cardiff hearing. It\u2019s imperative that we have access these chats in their entirety.\u201d The Welsh Conservatives said the \u201ccloak and dagger decision-making in the Labour Welsh government\u201d was clear to see. The former Welsh Labour minister Leighton Andrews said: \u201cEvery day there is a new story about the first minister. It\u2019s distracting from the task of government and it\u2019s highly damaging to the Labour party. All these issues involve questions of principle and of judgment.\u201d The latest developments come as the Senedd celebrates its 25th anniversary and on Wednesday was voting on expanding the size of the parliament from 60 to 96 members and bringing in a new electoral system. Gething, who campaigned for devolution as president of NUS Wales, said the Welsh parliament\u2019s successes had ranged from innovations in recycling and its organ donation opt-out law to its Flying Start programme for young children in disadvantaged areas and the launch of the Welsh development bank but he said devolution remained \u201cfragile\u201d."

            "content": "The former chief scientific adviser to the government Sir Patrick Vallance has said another pandemic is \u201cabsolutely inevitable\u201d and urged the incoming British government to focus on preparing for it, warning \u201cwe are not ready yet\u201d. Speaking at a panel event at the Hay festival in Powys, Vallance said it is \u201cgreat we are having an election\u201d as there are \u201cclearly issues that need to be sorted out\u201d. One of the things the next government must do is implement \u201cbetter surveillance to be able to pick these things up\u201d, he said. He also reiterated what he said to G7 leaders in 2021, that \u201cwe need to be much faster, much more aligned \u2013 and there are ways to do this \u2013 at getting rapid diagnostic tests, rapid vaccines, rapid treatments, so that you don\u2019t have to go into the extreme measures that took place\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic. The measures he recommends are possible to implement, Vallance believes, but \u201crequire some coordination\u201d. He said that by 2023 the G7 had \u201csort of forgotten\u201d about the points he had made in 2021. \u201cYou can\u2019t forget about it,\u201d he urged, recommending that pandemic preparations are treated similarly to the armed forces. \u201cWe know we have to have an army, not because there\u2019s going to be a war this year, but we know it\u2019s an important part of what we need as a nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to treat this preparedness in the same way and not to view it as an easy thing to keep cutting back when there\u2019s no sign of a pandemic \u2013 because there won\u2019t be a sign of a pandemic.\u201d He mentioned the World Health Organization\u2019s push for the pandemic accord, a proposed agreement for countries to work together to prepare for pandemics, as one of the \u201csteps in the right direction\u201d that are being taken. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough focus,\u201d he said. If this issue gets pushed off G7 and G20 agendas, \u201cwe\u2019ll be in exactly the same position, and I hope that\u2019s an important outcome of the inquiry\u201d. That said, he said there are issues with the speed and efficiency of how inquiries are conducted, and said we have \u201cgot to work out a better way\u201d of doing them. Though Vallance thinks it is about time there was an election, he did praise the outgoing government\u2019s anti-smoking bill, and said he is disappointed it won\u2019t go through before the election. \u201cI think that needs to be picked up rapidly afterwards.\u201d Asked whether protesters should have been allowed to play Things Can Only Get Better during Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday, he said he thinks such protests are \u201cpart of our democracy\u201d and that Sunak and his team\u2019s decision not to find a location for the speech where he could have been heard \u201cis a sign of incompetence\u201d. \u201cThe chaos of that event was emblematic,\u201d he said. However, he does believe certain acts of protest cross a line. Vallance is the chair of the Natural History Museum and said he thinks an incident when paint was thrown over an exhibition was \u201cwrong\u201d, and had the Just Stop Oil protesters managed to damage Magna Carta earlier this month, that would have been wrong too."

            "content": "During the pandemic I did not reduce my monthly payments for childcare vouchers. As a result I have nearly \u00a32,800 in my tax-free childcare account. I now work remotely and don\u2019t need them but have been told I can\u2019t get a refund. I was paying the maximum \u00a3243 a month via salary sacrifice into my KiddiVouchers account. This worked until Covid hit but my employer has switched to permanent home working so I no longer need wraparound childcare. I explained my change in circumstances to [the scheme provider] and requested they refund my employer so it could be repaid (after tax and national insurance) to me. My employer is happy to do this. However, KiddiVouchers has refused because it \u201cdoes not meet the exceptional or unforeseen threshold for a refund\u201d. I can\u2019t believe that the pandemic is not considered \u201cexceptional or unforeseen\u201d. There are some holiday clubs and courses that accept vouchers, but given we could really do with the money, it doesn\u2019t make sense to be considering expensive residential holiday clubs to use them up. DO, East Lothian Childcare voucher schemes such as this \u2013 which closed to new entrants in 2018 making way for the tax-free childcare scheme \u2013 are a staff benefit offered by many companies, including the Guardian. The employer pays for the vouchers out of your gross wages so you don\u2019t pay tax and national insurance (NI) on the amount, saving a working parent roughly \u00a31,000 a year. Numerous companies run these schemes and, based on parenting forums, some are more willing than others to process a refund. However, the terms and conditions of KiddiVouchers, which is run by Wider Plan, state vouchers are non-refundable and requests are only granted in \u201cunforeseen and exceptional circumstances preventing the future use of the vouchers\u201d. After being refused a refund, NM, a company secretary and trained solicitor with \u00a34,200 in her account, pursued Wider Plan via the small claims process. The claim, which was heard in March, was dismissed, with the judge stating it was a \u201crisk\u201d to run up such a big balance but also that the company must exercise its discretion reasonably. It took a year to reach court and during mediation NM rejected a 50% refund. However, she believes the decision has provided a better base for other claims to be brought against Wider Plan and if you wish to consider this route you can request a transcript of the judgment to form your own conclusion. Wider Plan, which did not respond to a request for comment on your case, reminds you that the vouchers are valid until 1 September after your youngest child\u2019s 15th birthday (at present your daughters are 11 and 12) and can be spent on clubs and activities, with PGL adventure holidays a popular choice. They can also pay for tuition or online courses. You would be taxed on any refund so why not make the best of the help or experiences these vouchers could buy your children?

            "date": "2024-05-16T05:00:59Z",
            "content": "The World Health Organization has accused Nigel Farage of spreading misinformation after he launched a campaign to block an international treaty designed to improve global pandemic preparedness. WHO member states are negotiating a deal to shore up cooperation against new pathogens. If adopted, the legally binding treaty would commit countries to helping each other in the event of a pandemic, increase research and sharing of data, and promote fair access to vaccines. But populist figures including Farage and a number of Tory MPs are lobbying the UK government to block the deal, claiming that it will give the WHO power to enforce lockdowns on countries, dictate policy on mask wearing and control vaccine stocks. Farage is fronting the campaign group Action on World Health (AWH), which was registered on Companies House last week. The AWH\u2019s website lists supporters including the Tory MPs Henry Smith, Philip Davies and David Jones, as well as peers and others. Companies House filings show that it has three directors including the barrister Paul Diamond, whose work has included high-profile cases on behalf of socially conservative Christians and cases where the use of vaccines has been disputed. Visitors to the AWH\u2019s site are helped to locate and lobby their MP using template \u201csuggested text\u201d emails that claim the WHO treaty will \u201cstrip away\u201d the UK\u2019s decision-making powers. The potency of what some on the right view as a potential new \u201cwedge issue\u201d was underlined in contributions by Tory backbenchers such as Philip Hollobone, who echoed populist language by describing the WHO as being under the influence of \u201cthe global elite\u201d and urging against the UK backing the treaty. The UK health minister Andrew Stephenson urged MPs in parliament this week to dismiss what he described as myths being spread about the treaty, which the UK is considering whether or not to support. Lockdown mandates are not part of the deal and a claim by Farage that the treaty would require countries to give away 20% of their vaccines was \u201csimply not true\u201d, said Stephenson. His comments were echoed by the WHO directly. Responding to AWH\u2019s claims, a spokesperson said a draft of the treaty reaffirmed \u201cthe principle of sovereignty\u201d of member states. \u201cClaims that the draft agreement will cede sovereignty to WHO and will give the WHO secretariat power to impose lockdowns or vaccine mandates on countries are false and have never been requested nor proposed. This agreement will not, and cannot, grant sovereignty to WHO.\u201d Farage, who denies that the campaign is sharing misinformation, claimed the UK government was \u201crunning scared\u201d and that Conservative MPs had \u201csuddenly been shouting\u201d about the treaty on Wednesday. \u201cThe governing party are very scared of me and of anything that would look like a surrender of sovereignty after Brexit. I\u2019m trying to bring to the public\u2019s attention something that is not being debated \u2013 that\u2019s what I have done throughout my career \u2013 and I think we are getting traction already,\u201d he said. \u201cThis may not be a campaign with mass populist appeal but we can influence the government\u2019s position when they get to Geneva in a couple of weeks time. European ambassadors who met at the WHO headquarters in Geneva on Wednesday are understood to have voiced concern about misinformation of the type that the AWH has been accused of promoting. A leading WHO envoy who was the face of the body in the UK during the pandemic said that he feared public health workers and policymakers were having to work in an increasingly difficult environment. \u201cWe are being identified with particular behaviours as public health types and of doing things that we are not actually doing. It means that I fear that people who work in public health have become almost a despised community by certain groups and various organisations,\u201d said David Nabarro, co-director and chair of global health at Imperial College London\u2019s Institute of Global Health Innovation. Nabarro said: \u201cWhat we are trying to do above all is to help people to avoid death and to avoid misery. There\u2019s no effort by any of us to go for any kind of the political action we are being accused of and yet we do seem to have become seriously disliked.\u201d Other online campaigns targeting the WHO are already under way in the UK. Two of them \u2013 Say No To WHO and Save My Vape \u2013 are linked to an anti-EU pressure group run by Brian Monteith, a PR consultant and former Brexit party politician. Negotiators from the WHO\u2019s 194 member states had hoped to have a final draft agreement by Friday, with a view toward adopting the legally binding text at the World Health Assembly later this month."

            "title": "What is the pandemic accord and why have negotiations been so difficult? ",
            "date": "2024-05-23T16:01:45Z",
            "content": "Global health leaders will gather in Geneva on 27 May at the annual World Health Assembly, where a new agreement for countries to work together to prepare for, prevent, and respond to pandemics \u2013 known as the \u201cpandemic accord\u201d \u2013 will top the agenda. It was first proposed by world leaders in early 2021, with a promise to avoid the mistakes of the Covid-19 pandemic next time around. The negotiating process, involving almost 200 countries, has proved challenging, and the plan has been subject to what the World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called \u201ca torrent of fake news, lies and conspiracy theories\u201d. Talks are likely to go down to the wire, and a finished text may not be ready by the assembly deadline. But those involved say this is an opportunity to make the world safer \u2013 and fairer \u2013 that humanity cannot afford to miss. What is the idea behind the accord? The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact globally. About 7 million deaths have been attributed directly to the virus, but indirect deaths are thought to be at least double that. The disruption caused by the virus saw poverty and hunger increase. Health systems were no longer able to reliably provide the regular care people needed, and people living in poorer countries were often the hardest hit. The promise of the accord was to make sure that the world was better prepared for, and protected from, future pandemics \u2013 with equitable access to the tools needed to stop potential pandemic outbreaks in their tracks, as well as vaccines and treatments. Announcing the plans, world leaders said a treaty would be \u201cour legacy that protects our children and grandchildren\u201d and promised to \u201cbe guided by solidarity, fairness, transparency, inclusiveness and equity\u201d. Has it worked out that way? Many campaigners have expressed disappointment as details of the negotiations have emerged. This month, Global Justice Now accused rich countries of \u201crefusing to learn the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d and of blocking moves to take on the vested interests of big pharma companies. Others have questioned the need for a treaty at all, suggesting that it will not necessarily solve the problems that appeared during the Covid pandemic, with countries likely to ignore any elements of a treaty they disagree with during an emergency. Dr Precious Matsoso from South Africa, the co-chair of the intergovernmental negotiating body overseeing the talks, said that progress was being made and promised \u201ca meaningful, lasting agreement\u201d. And there is a sense it needs to be seen through. Michel Kazatchkine, a former member of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, said: \u201cIt is worthwhile, because it is providing a foundation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that it will answer all of the challenges that are on the plate \u2013 but I think a failure would be really terrible for the multilateral system, for the world of solidarity that we all want to see in the future, for WHO, for the United Nations system. So we need to work very hard until the last minute to get something.\u201d What stage are negotiations at? This week, negotiators have been meeting nearly every day from 9am to 9pm in a bid to finish negotiations in time for the assembly. It follows multiple negotiating sessions that have seen draft texts put forward and pulled apart. The latest publicly available draft suggests there has been agreement in many areas, including around the need for countries to \u201cstrengthen science, public health and pandemic literacy in the population\u201d. It includes plans to establish a \u201cconference of the parties (Cop)\u201d to regularly review the agreement\u2019s implementation, and promises of additional financial resources for lower-income countries. But there are still areas with real sticking points, including the issue of \u201cpathogen access and benefit sharing\u201d. If poorer countries grant richer nations \u2013 and their big pharmaceutical companies \u2013 access to materials and information on pathogens that could become a pandemic, can those poorer countries be guaranteed access to any resulting vaccines and medicines? More recent drafts of the accord have suggested such a system could be agreed in principle, but details have been pushed back for later discussion. It is not yet clear whether the accord will be a treaty \u2013 giving it greater force in international law \u2013 or a regulation. Does the accord take away countries\u2019 sovereignty? The accord has been the subject of vast amounts of misinformation and disinformation, including false claims that the agreement would give the WHO the power to impose lockdowns, or require countries to give away a fifth of their vaccines. A WHO spokesperson responded to recent similar claims by the UK\u2019s Nigel Farage by saying such claims were \u201cfalse and have never been requested nor proposed. This agreement will not, and cannot, grant sovereignty to WHO.\u201d But in many countries, the discussion has become politicised and concerns about sovereignty have hit mainstream politics. This month, the UK health minister, Andrew Stephenson, told the Commons that the current text was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d to the UK government, stressing that \u201cprotecting our sovereignty is a British red line\u201d. In New Zealand, too, negotiators have been told to prioritise sovereignty. The draft text of the agreement reaffirms \u201cthe principle of the sovereignty of states in addressing public health matters\u201d and recognises \u201cthe sovereign right of states over their biological resources\u201d."

            "content": "Global health leaders have said an international treaty governing how the world should deal with future pandemics may not be agreed for another year or more. After two years of negotiations, countries failed to agree on the text of an international pandemic accord by a deadline of 24 May. And at the World Health Assembly in Geneva on Tuesday delegates said extensive further negotiations would be needed. The accord contains a series of measures setting out how the world should prevent, prepare for and respond to pandemics. Setting out plans for a pandemic treaty in early 2021, world leaders described it as a legacy to protect their children and grandchildren. The former chief scientific adviser to the government Sir Patrick Vallance is among those who have warned of the threat of another pandemic, saying earlier this month that it was \u201cabsolutely inevitable\u201d. During a debate, some countries \u2013 including many African nations \u2013 urged efforts to conclude the treaty negotiation process before the end of 2024, in order not to lose momentum. Others, including the US, EU and Caribbean countries such as Jamaica, called for at least another year so that thorny issues could be properly addressed. While member states had reached agreement on many areas, serious disagreements remain, including on finance; how much product pharmaceutical companies should be required to set aside for those countries most in need; intellectual property rights and sanctions. One leading issue has been on what access to drugs and treatments developing countries can expect in return for their efforts monitoring and sharing information on pathogens found in their territories. The negotiations have also been the subject of widespread misinformation campaigns, with false claims that the treaty represents a power grab by the World Health Organization, giving them the ability to impose lockdowns on countries. A large blue bus was seen driving around Geneva urging people to \u201csay no to the pandemic treaty\u201d. Earlier on Tuesday, Roland Driece, who had been the co-chair of the intergovernmental negotiating body, told a panel discussion on the treaty that the issues still to be resolved were \u201creally politically sensitive and difficult\u201d, and suggested more than a few months of additional negotiation would be needed. Driece warned there was a risk of a sense of urgency slipping as time got further from the pandemic and other international issues came to the fore, but said: \u201cWe all have to realise we started with nothing. We started with a blank piece of paper.\u201d He said all the necessary elements were on the table \u201cif countries want to work with them\u201d. Parallel negotiations on how to amend International Health Regulations (IHR) from 2005 to strengthen health systems facing pandemics are thought to be closer to an agreement, and many countries are pushing for a final decision on amendments to be reached this week. In a statement on Tuesday night, the WHO said work would continue until the end of the assembly on 1 June to complete the package of amendments to the IHR, and agree the timing, format and process to conclude the pandemic agreement. Michel Kazatchkine, a former member of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, said: \u201cThe good news is that all countries want to continue. But we cannot wait for the accord to be agreed to accelerate pandemic preparedness at country and regional levels. Hopefully, important amendments to the IHR will be adopted at the end of the week.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-06T09:52:19Z",
            "content": "Scientists have created a vaccine that has the potential to protect against a broad range of coronaviruses, including varieties that are not yet even known about. The experimental shot, which has been tested in mice, marks a change in strategy towards \u201cproactive vaccinology\u201d, where vaccines are designed and readied for manufacture before a potentially pandemic virus emerges. The vaccine is made by attaching harmless proteins from different coronaviruses to minuscule nanoparticles that are then injected to prime the body\u2019s defences to fight the viruses should they ever invade. Because the vaccine trains the immune system to target proteins that are shared across many different types of coronavirus, the protection it induces is extremely broad, making it effective against known and unknown viruses in the same family. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that a relatively simple vaccine can still provide a scattershot response across a range of different viruses,\u201d said Rory Hills, a graduate researcher at the University of Cambridge and first author of the report. \u201cIt takes us one step forward towards our goal of creating vaccines before a pandemic has even started.\u201d Tests in mice showed that the vaccine induced a broad immune response to coronaviruses, including Sars-Cov-1, the pathogen that caused the 2003 Sars outbreak, even though proteins from that virus were not added to the vaccine nanoparticles. Details of the work, a collaboration between the universities of Cambridge and Oxford and the California Institute of Technology, are published in Nature Nanotechnology. The universal coronavirus vaccine can be made in existing facilities for microbial fermentation, Hills said, adding that the researchers were working with industrial partners on ways to scale up the process. The nanoparticles and viral proteins can be made at different times in different places and mixed together to produce the vaccine. Medical regulators do not have procedures for proactive vaccinology and the researchers say these would have to be worked out with the relevant bodies. If the vaccine were found to be safe and effective in humans, one option would be to use it as a Covid booster with the added benefit of it protecting against other coronaviruses. More likely is that countries would hold stocks of the vaccine, and others designed to target separate pathogens, once they have been manufactured and approved. \u201cIn the event that a coronavirus or other pathogen crosses over you could have pre-existing vaccine stocks ready and a clear plan to quickly scale up production if needed,\u201d Hills said. Prof Mark Howarth, a senior author of the study, said: \u201cScientists did a great job in quickly producing an extremely effective Covid vaccine during the last pandemic, but the world still had a massive crisis with a huge number of deaths. We need to work out how we can do even better than that in the future, and a powerful component of that is starting to build the vaccines in advance.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-08T02:18:56Z",
            "content": "AstraZeneca has begun the worldwide withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine due to a \u201csurplus of available updated vaccines\u201d that target new variants of the virus. The announcement follows the pharmaceutical company in March voluntarily withdrawing its European Union marketing authorisation, which is the approval to market a medicine in member states. On 7 May, the European Medicines Agency issued a notice that the vaccine is no longer authorised for use. In a statement, AstraZeneca said the decision was made because there is now a variety of newer vaccines available that have been adapted to target Covid-19 variants. This had led to a decline in demand for the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied. \u201cAccording to independent estimates, over 6.5 million lives were saved in the first year of use alone and over 3bn doses were supplied globally,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur efforts have been recognised by governments around the world and are widely regarded as being a critical component of ending the global pandemic. We will now work with regulators and our partners to align on a clear path forward to conclude this chapter and significant contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Other countries have already stopped supplying the vaccine. It has not been available for use in Australia since March 2023, though its use was already being phased out from June 2021 due to the widespread availability of newer vaccines. AstraZeneca changed the name of its Covid vaccine to Vaxzevria in 2021. The vaccine was authorised for use in those aged 18 and older, delivered as two injections, usually into the muscle of the upper arm, about three month apart. It was also used by some countries as a booster shot. Vaxzevria is made up of another virus of the adenovirus family modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The vaccine does not contain the virus itself and cannot cause the virus. Although the vaccine was found to be safe and effective overall, it carried the risk of a rare but serious side-effect, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or TTS. The rare syndrome occurred in about two to three people per 100,000 who were vaccinated with the Vaxzevria vaccine. The chair of epidemiology at Deakin University in Australia, Prof Catherine Bennett, said the vaccine had played a pivotal part in the worldwide fight against the virus, particularly in the early days of the pandemic when limited vaccines were available. \u201cIt has saved millions of lives and that should not be forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a really important part of the initial global response. However, it targeted the initial ancestral variants. We\u2019ve now moved into a vaccine chain where we have products available that are chasing the variants that are emerging. \u201cThere\u2019s also a shift in the risk calculus as well, given populations are much more protected and, even though of course Covid still causes deaths, we are overall less vulnerable to the disease.\u201d The latest Covid-19 vaccine advice issued by the World Health Organisation in April advised that formulations of Covid-19 vaccines should target the JN.1 lineage of the virus, which is displacing existing XBB lineage variants."

            "date": "2024-05-30T23:01:22Z",
            "content": "Thousands of patients in England are to be fast-tracked into groundbreaking trials of personalised cancer vaccines in a revolutionary world-first NHS \u201cmatchmaking\u201d scheme to save lives. The gamechanging jabs, which aim to provide a permanent cure, are custom-built for each patient in just a few weeks. They are tailored to the individual\u2019s tumours and work by telling their body to hunt and kill any cancer cells and prevent the disease from coming back. Under the new scheme, the first of its kind in the world, patients who meet the eligibility criteria and agree to have a blood test and sample of their cancer tissue analysed will gain immediate access to clinical trials for the new vaccines that experts say represent a new dawn of treatments for cancer. The head of NHS England, Amanda Pritchard, hailed the development as a \u201clandmark moment\u201d for patients. \u201cThe NHS is in a unique position to deliver this kind of world-leading research at size and scale,\u201d she said. Research into cancer vaccines is at an early stage, but trials have already shown they can be effective at killing off any remaining tumour cells after surgery and dramatically cut the risk of cancer returning. The NHS has enrolled dozens of patients on to its scheme, the Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad, with thousands more to be enlisted at 30 NHS sites across England. The first trials are expected to focus on colorectal, skin, lung, bladder, pancreatic and kidney cancer, officials said, but other forms of the disease could be added in future. \u201cAs more of these trials get up and running at hospitals across the country, our national matchmaking service will ensure as many eligible patients as possible get the opportunity to access them,\u201d Pritchard said. Details of the scheme were revealed on the eve of the world\u2019s largest cancer conference, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Asco) in Chicago, where tens of thousands of oncologists, health researchers and scientists will convene this weekend. The German biotech company BioNTech, one of the companies partnering with the NHS on the trials, will present new preliminary data at the Asco conference tomorrow on how measuring circulating tumour DNA could help increase early detection of colorectal cancer. Iain Foulkes, the executive director of research and innovation at Cancer Research UK, said it was \u201cincredibly exciting\u201d that patients were accessing personalised jabs in a development that will be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d in the fight against cancer. \u201cClinical trials like this are vital in helping more people live longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer,\u201d he said. The first NHS patient to join the Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad is Elliot Pfebve. The 55-year-old lecturer at Coventry University had no symptoms and was diagnosed with colorectal cancer after a routine health check with his GP. He had surgery to remove his tumour and 30cm of his large intestine, followed by chemotherapy. Pfebve then received his personalised cancer vaccine at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust, one of several sites taking part in the BioNTech colorectal cancer vaccine trial. It was designed with the same mRNA technology used to create the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine. \u201cThrough the potential of this trial, if it is successful, it may help thousands, if not millions of people, so they can have hope,\u201d Pfebve said. \u201cI hope this will help other people.\u201d His vaccine was created by analysing his tumour to identify mutations specific to his cancer. Doctors then used this data to create a personalised cancer vaccine. \u201cBeing part of this trial has been a really important decision in my life, both for me and my family,\u201d said Pfebve. \u201cHaving been through the difficulty of diagnosis and debilitating chemotherapy, it felt wonderful to be able to take part in something which could lead to a new way of treating cancer, and if others can benefit from what the trial might discover, then that\u2019s great, too.\u201d The trial\u2019s principal investigator, Dr Victoria Kunene, said it was too early to say if Pfebve had been cured completely, but said she was \u201cextremely hopeful\u201d. \u201cBased on the limited data we currently have of the in-body response to the vaccine, this could prove to be a significant and positive development for patients, but more data is yet needed and we continue to recruit suitable patients to the trial to establish this further.\u201d Cancer vaccines are designed to induce an immune response that may prevent cancer from returning after surgery to remove tumours, by stimulating a patient\u2019s immune system to recognise and destroy any remaining cancer cells \u2013 and stop them coming back. \u201cSeeing Elliot receive his first treatment as part of the Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad is a landmark moment for patients and the health service as we seek to develop better and more effective ways to stop this disease,\u201d Pritchard said. Last month the Guardian reported how doctors had begun trialling the world\u2019s first personalised mRNA cancer vaccine for melanoma, as experts hailed its \u201cgamechanging\u201d potential to permanently cure cancer. Prof Peter Johnson, NHS England\u2019s national clinical director for cancer, said: \u201cWe know that even after a successful operation, cancers can sometimes return because a few cancer cells are left in the body, but using a vaccine to target those remaining cells may be a way to stop this happening. \u201cAccess to clinical trials could provide another option for patients and their families, and I\u2019m delighted that through our national launch pad we will be widening the opportunities to be part of these trials for many more people, with thousands of patients expected to be recruited in the next year.\u201d NHS officials said vaccines being tested in the trials aimed to help patients with different forms of cancer and, if successfully developed, researched and approved, could become part of standard care."

            "title": "AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid vaccine is no more \u2013 but its remarkable success must not be forgotten | Robin McKie",
            "date": "2024-05-11T14:29:27Z",
            "content": "Last week\u2019s announcement that AstraZeneca would no longer market its Covid vaccine brings an end to one of the century\u2019s most remarkable medical stories. Created within a year of the arrival of the pandemic, the AZ vaccine was cheap, easily stored and transported, and helped stave off humanitarian crises in Asia and Latin America, where many countries could not afford the more expensive mRNA vaccines that were being snapped up by rich western nations. It is estimated that it saved 6.3 million lives in 2021 alone. Yet from the start the vaccine \u2013 created by research teams led by Professor Andy Pollard and Professor Sarah Gilbert at the Oxford Vaccine Centre \u2013 was dogged by controversy. It was linked to blood clots, US observers criticised protocols for its trials, and French president Emmanuel Macron claimed it was \u201cquasi-ineffective\u201d for people over 65. In fact, the vaccine is particularly effective for the elderly. In very rare cases, the AZ vaccine can cause blood clots. According to the British Heart Foundation, one study in the BMJ showed that for every 10 million people vaccinated with AstraZeneca there would be a total of 73 extra cases of blood clots. By contrast 10 million Covid cases would trigger thousands of extra blood clot cases. Many of the anxieties about the vaccine stemmed from national self-interests. However, others derive from the nature of vaccines themselves, and this raises issues that are likely to re-emerge with the arrival of any new pandemic in coming years, scientists have warned. A vaccine is unlike any other type of medicine because it works by stimulating a person\u2019s anti-pathogen defences, arming them in advance of a future infection. However, this preparation goes beyond helping one individual and can aid the general population, a point stressed by Professor Stephen Evans, of the London School of Medicine and Tropical Hygiene. \u201cIf I take a preventative drug \u2013 such as a statin \u2013 then I am the only one who benefits,\u201d said Evans. \u201cHowever, there are people who cannot mount responses to a vaccine because they are ill or have a weakened immune system. They remain vulnerable. However, if you can build up herd immunity by ensuring the maximum number of people are inoculated, virus levels will drop and the vulnerable will be protected. If we believe we have responsibilities to help others, being vaccinated achieves that. There are moral concerns about being inoculated, in other words.\u201d Convincing the public \u2013 which has witnessed a rise in anti-vax propaganda in recent years \u2013 of this may not be easy. In addition, there is a second crucial difference between standard medical treatments and vaccines, added Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, of the University of Cambridge. \u201cWe never know the identities of those who benefit [from a vaccine] \u2013 they are \u2018statistical\u2019 people \u2013 while those who are harmed can be named and their stories told.\u201d AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid vaccine provides an example. We only know those who were harmed by it but cannot pinpoint those who benefited. Again, this makes it trickier to pinpoint a vaccine\u2019s success and assure people of its efficacy. \u201cTo a certain extent, you can get round this and assess the impact of Covid vaccines by looking at the deaths of frontline workers in the health service during the pandemic\u2019s early days,\u201d added Evans. \u201cHundreds died, but if we had had a vaccine then it is now clear most would probably have survived.\u201d Most virologists and vaccine experts agree: when you look at the AstraZeneca vaccine from a global perspective, it probably benefited tens of millions of people, preventing deaths and reducing long-term consequences of Covid. It was a remarkable success, yet its passing has been marked by many who stressed its side-effects but never touched on its achievements. \u201cThe paradox of vaccines is that people forget how important they are,\u201d said Professor Adam Finn, of Bristol University. \u201cThey are like democracy. You enjoy it for a while and then forget how important it is to preserve it. It\u2019s a problem.\u201d On the other hand, it is also clear politicians and officials will have to be careful about the claims they make, added Fiona Fox, head of the Science Media Centre. \u201cPublic trust in vaccines will come from open and honest communication. The benefits massively outweigh the risks as they did with this vaccine. \u201cBut you won\u2019t win any arguments by claiming that vaccines are 100% safe or running for the hills at the first reports of problems, which unfortunately too many government and NHS communications officers tend to do. Downplaying risks is always tempting when you need people to take a mostly safe vaccine but it\u2019s ultimately self-defeating because it erodes trust in the longer term.\u201d \u2022 Robin McKie is science and environment editor for the Observer"

            "date": "2024-05-30T23:01:23Z",
            "content": "What are cancer vaccines? Cancer vaccines are a form of immunotherapy. Unlike vaccines that protect from an infection, such as the Covid-19 jab, cancer vaccines treat people who already have the disease. They are designed to help the patient\u2019s immune system recognise and then kill cancer cells \u2013 and prevent them from coming back. How are cancer vaccines made? The jabs are custom built for each person, typically in just a few weeks. To make them, a sample of a patient\u2019s tumour is removed during surgery, followed by DNA sequencing and in some cases the use of artificial intelligence. The result is a personalised anti-cancer jab specific to that patient\u2019s tumour. How do they help fight cancer? The cancer vaccines work by sending an instruction or blueprint to the patient\u2019s cells to produce an antigen or protein that can distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. The jabs stimulate the immune system to act. The immune system makes antibodies that can recognise and attack the harmless versions of the disease. Once the patient\u2019s body has made these antibodies it can recognise the disease if returns. What types of cancer can they treat? Scientists are studying many different types of cancer vaccines and how they might work in different forms of cancer. More research is needed to get a full picture of how well the vaccines work and which cancers they could treat. Experts believe they could be effective in a range of cancers, including but not limited to colorectal, lung, bladder, pancreatic and kidney. Doctors have also begun trialling the world\u2019s first personalised mRNA cancer vaccine for melanoma. Experts hailed its \u201cgamechanging\u201d potential to permanently cure the skin cancer. A phase 2 trial found that the vaccines dramatically reduced the risk of the cancer returning in melanoma patients. How can people access cancer vaccines? Research is still at an early stage, so the jabs are mainly available as part of clinical trials. The NHS is launching a scheme that will give thousands of patients in England access to cancer vaccine trials. What is the Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad? The NHS scheme in England is the first of its kind worldwide. It aims to recruit thousands of cancer patients, with a matchmaking service putting them into clinical trials of the jabs that could help them. When will it begin recruiting? It already has. The first NHS patient to join the Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad is Elliot Pfebve, a 55-year-old lecturer who had no symptoms and was diagnosed with colorectal cancer after a routine health check. How did doctors create this personalised vaccine? First, Pfebve had surgery to remove his tumour, followed by chemotherapy. His personalised vaccine was created by analysing his tumour to identify mutations specific to his own cancer. He then received his jab via an infusion at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust, one of several sites taking part in a BioNTech colorectal cancer vaccine trial. It was designed with the same mRNA technology used to create the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine. How is the patient doing? The principal investigator for the trial in Birmingham, Dr Victoria Kunene, said it was too early to say if the patient had been cured completely, but said she was \u201cextremely hopeful\u201d. \u201cBased on the limited data we currently have of the in-body response to the vaccine, this could prove to be a significant and positive development for patients, but more data is yet needed and we continue to recruit suitable patients to the trial to establish this further,\u201d she said. How can I sign up? The NHS has already enlisted dozens of patients to its Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad and will now accelerate recruitment, with thousands being offered access to cancer vaccine trials each year. Cancer patients can talk to their GP about whether they may be eligible to join the trials. How significant is the arrival of cancer vaccines? Vaccines have revolutionised medicine, protecting millions of people from measles and mumps, polio and coronavirus. They have also wiped out smallpox, one of the deadliest diseases in human history. Now experts believe they can form part of the toolbox needed to fight off cancer for good. They will not replace surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy any time soon but could play a key role in immunotherapy, the fourth weapon against cancer. There are many challenges, and making personalised jabs for individual patients takes time, but the hope is that the process could speed up in future. Doctors and scientists have been working on cancer vaccines for decades but they have now reached a point where they are seeing real benefits for patients."

            "date": "2024-05-15T01:52:28Z",
            "content": "The California governor, Gavin Newsom, announced on Tuesday that $3.3bn would be made available from the state\u2019s new mental health bond ahead of schedule to build more behavioral health treatment centers and homeless housing as the state grapples with a growing homelessness crisis. It is the first pot of money from a ballot measure designed to help cities, counties, tribes and developers build or renovate treatment centers and clinics, among other things. Voters passed it by a razor-thin margin in March after Newsom threw all of his political weight behind it, touting it as linchpin of the state\u2019s efforts to reduce homelessness. It authorizes the state to borrow nearly $6.4bn to build 4,350 housing units and require counties to spend two-thirds of the money from a tax on millionaires on housing and programs for unhoused people with serious mental illnesses or substance abuse problems. Applications for the money will open in July. Newsom, standing in front of an ongoing construction project that would create 117 psychiatric beds near Redwood City, said on Tuesday he wanted local governments to build as quickly as they can. \u201cIt\u2019s time to do your job. It\u2019s time to get things done,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cYou asked for these reforms, we\u2019ve provided them. Now it\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d The Democratic governor, a top surrogate for Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign who is also widely believed to harbor presidential aspirations of his own, has made homelessness a political priority and vowed to transform the state\u2019s mental health system. Homelessness has become one of the most frustrating issues in California, where Newsom\u2019s administration spent billions of dollars to get people off the streets but no dramatic change has been seen in Los Angeles and other large cities. California accounts for nearly a third of the homeless population in the United States; roughly 171,000 Californians are in need of housing. The state, with a current inventory of 5,500 behavioral health beds, needs some 8,000 more units to treat mental health and addiction issues. The grant money Newsom announced could fund a wide range of programs including short-term crisis facilities, addiction programs, outpatient services and locked treatment beds. The state will evaluate the projects based on gaps in local services. \u201cVoluntary care is always best, but sometimes we need a little bit more,\u201d the state senator Susan Eggman, who authored a bill that became part of the ballot measure, said of funding potentially going to locked treatment beds. \u201cDon\u2019t say no. Let\u2019s say how.\u201d Social providers and some county officials opposed the proposition, worrying the new funding structure of the tax on millionaires will threaten programs that are not solely focused on housing or drug treatment but keep people from becoming homeless in the first place. Disability rights advocates were also concerned that the new investments will result in more people being locked up against their will. Administration officials previously said the state would streamline the application process as much as possible, but there would not be a set requirement on when proposed projects need to be completed. Some proposals, such as those that would renovate existing facilities, could open in a few months, officials said. Newsom said the state would approve proposals in the fall so the money could be dispersed to local governments by early next year. The bond funding will allow counties to move faster in providing needed services, said Mike Callagy, the executive officer in San Mateo county. \u201cNow we can dream bigger because of this,\u201d he said. Newsom, who pushed for a new law that makes it easier to force people with mental health and addiction issues into treatment last year, also blasted counties for not already implementing the program on Tuesday, though the state gives most counties a December deadline to launch their efforts. Eight counties implemented the initiative last year and have received 450 applications in the last six months, according to the governor\u2019s office. \u201cThe state\u2019s vision is realized at the local level,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that job. They need to do their job.\u201d The state also has plans to make bond funding for housing available by the end of this year. The funding, totaling nearly $2bn, will help expand existing state\u2019s housing initiatives, including a $3.5bn effort to convert rundown motels into homeless housing. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 May 2024. An earlier version misnamed Mike Callagy as \u201cMark\u201d Callagy."

            "content": "Police Scotland is \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the \u201cappalling\u201d demands made on officers by failing mental health services and a court system that requires complete reform, according to its chief constable, Jo Farrell. The first woman to lead Police Scotland, the UK\u2019s second largest force, Farrell took command of the national service last October. She inherited an organisation under pressure: falling officer numbers, a stressed and demoralised workforce, under-reporting of misogyny and racism within the ranks, and public outcry over police station closures. Since then she has faced specific challenges such as the continuing investigation into Scottish National party finances, Operation Branchform, and most recently the implementation of the Scottish government\u2019s controversial Hate Crime Act. Now Farrell has hit back, challenging other agencies to \u201cstep up\u201d and allow officers to focus on core policing. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s threatening themselves or a danger to other people, that\u2019s absolutely where the police should be,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cBut we are babysitting people who are not criminals, they don\u2019t meet the threshold to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act but we feel the need to wrap around them because there\u2019s nobody else.\u201d \u201cWhen people say \u2018Why aren\u2019t you doing that better or more of that and why haven\u2019t we got a community officer here?\u2019 this is some of the reason.\u201d A number of English forces, including the Met, have deliberately stepped back from attending mental health calls. Farrell says she has met chief executives of local authorities across Scotland to press her point, and goes on to highlight court appearances as another major drain on police time. According to Farrell, only 15% of those who attend actually give evidence that day, with the rest re-cited to court at a later date. She estimates that Police Scotland spent \u00a33m of overtime last year on court appearances, while a third of officers go to court on a rest day or annual leave day, affecting their work-life balance. The problem went \u201csystem-wide\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a prison population that\u2019s tipped over 8,000 [close to full capacity], we\u2019ve got a disproportionately high number of people on remand. That says this is a system that is not working efficiently or effectively.\u201d NEWThe implementation of the Hate Crime Act saw officers flooded with more than 7,000 online complaints in the first week of April, only 3.8% of which were found to be legitimate, just as figures showed the number of officers had fallen to its lowest level since 2008. But Farrell insisted it had not damaged public trust as critics predicted. \u201cI\u2019ve been hugely impressed with the way in which officers and staff dealt with the high level of demand in those early weeks,\u201d she said, adding that \u2013 with 124 online reports last week \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019re probably at the new norm\u201d. \u201cWhat we have seen is increases in the number of crimes against some of those new protected characteristics\u201d \u2013 this is particularly the case for disability hate crime \u2013 \u201cwhich was the purpose of the legislation\u201d. When he stepped down last summer, Farrell\u2019s predecessor Sir Iain Livingstone defended the length of the Branchform inquiry and rejected claims of political motivation. Given the investigation remains live, all Farrell would do was reiterate the operational independence of her force, and add: \u201cWe will be submitting our report to the crown in relation to the individual who\u2019s been charged and we\u2019ll be doing that in a matter of weeks.\u201d It is not the first time Farrell has had oversight of an investigation into prominent political figures. In her previous role as chief constable of Durham she led the \u201cBeergate\u201d inquiry into the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and also drew criticism for not questioning Dominic Cummings for his breach of lockdown rules. She would not be drawn on what lessons from Durham she might apply to Branchform but said: \u201cBroader than that, I\u2019ve been in policing for over three decades. Inevitably there are lots of opinions around it, but we are objective and we follow the evidence.\u201d Farrell was speaking to the media on Friday, as it emerged that a former Police Scotland officer, Gemma MacRae, who was sexually assaulted by a colleague and complained about bullying and misogyny at a Moray station, had accepted a payout from the force of \u00a3431,968. MacRae made her initial complaint in 2018 but how much had changed? Farrell said she was \u201coptimistic\u201d that people were now more confident in reporting misconduct by colleagues, but said she was \u201cnot in any doubt there\u2019s work to be done\u201d. Farrell also suggested that her attempts to focus resources on areas of growing crime such as cyberfraud and online child abuse had been \u201cweaponised by some\u201d after criticism of the \u201cproportionate response\u201d model which means that police do not investigate every minor crime. \u201cWhether it was misunderstood deliberately or not \u2013 these are people like you and me who want a crime number because they were silly enough to leave their phone on a table in a pub. Where people are vulnerable, where they\u2019ve been the repeat victim of crime, or they simply say to us, \u2018I really need to see somebody,\u2019 we will respond.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-16T15:00:04Z",
            "content": "The European Commission has opened an investigation into the owner of Facebook and Instagram over concerns that the platforms are creating addictive behaviour among children and damaging mental health. The EU executive said Meta may have breached the Digital Services Act (DSA), a landmark law passed by the bloc last summer that makes digital companies large and small liable for disinformation, shopping scams, child abuse and other online harms. \u201cToday we open formal proceedings against Meta,\u201d the EU commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton, said in a statement. \u201cWe are not convinced that it has done enough to comply with the DSA obligations to mitigate the risks of negative effects to the physical and mental health of young Europeans on its platforms Facebook and Instagram.\u201d The investigation will explore potential addictive impacts of the platforms, known as \u201crabbit hole\u201d effects, where an algorithm feeds young people negative content, such as on unrealistic body image. It will also look at the effectiveness of Meta\u2019s age verification tools and privacy for minors. \u201cWe are sparing no effort to protect our children,\u201d Breton said. A Meta spokesperson said: \u201cWe want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them. This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.\u201d Last month the commission opened an inquiry into Meta under the DSA over its handling of political content amid concerns that it was not doing enough to counter Russian disinformation before the EU elections in June. Under the DSA, platforms are obliged to protect the privacy and safety of children. Following a preliminary investigation, EU officials are concerned that Facebook and Instagram \u201cmay exploit the weaknesses and inexperience of minors and cause addictive behaviour\u201d. They are also sceptical about the platform\u2019s age-verification tools. Users are meant to be at least 13 years old to open an account on Facebook or Instagram. One official said that it was \u201cso obviously easy to circumvent some controls\u201d that the commission wanted to know how it was ever assessed by Meta that these measures could be effective and appropriate. An EU official said on Thursday that the commission wanted to use the bloc\u2019s European digital identity wallet for age verification. The wallet, which is still at the testing stage, is intended to make it easier for people across the 27-country union to prove who they are, whether they are opening a bank account, applying to university or applying for a job. The commission has also begun two investigations into TikTok, which led the Chinese-owned video-sharing platform to voluntarily withdraw its TikTok Lite reward-to-watch service in France and Spain last month. This followed the launch of DSA proceedings into X for alleged hate speech and into the online commerce site AliExpress over its advertising transparency and complaint handling. The latest Meta investigation is similar to the TikTok case as both are examining the potentially addictive nature of online platforms. Breton has previously said the TikTok Lite service could be \u201cas toxic and addictive as cigarettes\u201d. The DSA, which entered into force in February for platforms operating in Europe, was intended to force powerful online platforms that were \u201ctoo big to care\u201d to take responsibility for online safety. If the commission is not satisfied with Meta\u2019s response it can impose a fine equating to 6% of its global turnover. More immediately, it can carry out on-site investigations and interview company executives, with no deadline publicly fixed to complete the investigation."

            "date": "2024-05-07T15:32:43Z",
            "content": "When it comes to sporting success stories anyone would be hard pressed to find elite athletes more impressive than Simone Biles, Bryony Page and Holly Bradshaw. But while the trio are great competitors and multiple medal winners, they are also notable for their openness about the mental health of athletes. In summer 2021 Biles withdrew from the women\u2019s gymnastics team final at the Tokyo Olympics saying she had lost her air sense and admitted she \u201cwas still scared to do gymnastics\u201d months later. The pole vaulter Bradshaw voiced concerns earlier this year about damaging herself in the pursuit of sporting achievement, while the British gymnast Page has recounted struggles with \u201clost skills syndrome\u201d, which, she says, fuelled anxiety leading up to the Olympics in Rio. Even before Biles brought high-profile global exposure to the issue, the International Olympic Committee had recognised the need to support athletes and established a mental health toolkit for competitors before Tokyo. With a new Games looming into view at Paris 2024, that has been updated and new measures implemented. The upcoming Games will be used to promote wellness and the IOC has launched a mindfulness programme providing 2,000 licences to athletes for the Calm app as a day-to-day attempt to support mental health and wellbeing. A mental fitness helpline will also be available. Moreover, any Olympian competing in Paris, and for four years afterwards, can access mental health, wellbeing, and support in their home country in more than 70 different languages. Alongside a gym, the intention is to have a mentally fit zone, a space designated for mental decompression to beat the Olympic village noise. The Games will also utilise AI to weed out abuse on social media. Kirsty Burrows, head of the safe sport unit at the IOC, says these environments are an essential inclusion for athletes. \u201cThey should feel that there are support systems around them. They should feel if they have a concern around mental health or wellbeing or any areas, that they are able to speak up and they\u2019re able to seek support. And there are systems in place that help them to do that,\u201d says Burrows. This is all part of a plan that looks to promote better mental health outcomes at all levels by 2026 with Paris 2024 acting as a barometer for how the programme develops. Burrows confirms that the IOC is implementing systems to support athletes where the governing body has direct control, such as at the Olympics, and is also helping other organisations outside those events; the national federations and national Olympic committees, to put more of a priority on \u201cpsychological safety\u201d. The measures this summer will build off the mental health action plan written by the IOC last July. The updates to the mental health toolkit developed by the same body in 2021 mean it outlines a step-by-step approach for sports organisations or members of an athlete\u2019s medical entourage on how to foster \u201cpsychologically safe athletic environments\u201d. It also has an overview of mental health symptoms and disorders as well as their prevalence at the elite level. The psychiatrist Alan Currie, who sits on the IOC working group for mental health, has applauded the collaborative nature of the process, with some athletes becoming active ambassadors. \u201cIt\u2019s to a large extent by the athlete and we\u2019ve had athlete representation on the working group since its inception. Core members around the table are invaluable,\u201d says Currie. \u201cSo I think possibly one of the best things that we\u2019ve done in this space is to remember who sport is for and to make sure that the athlete\u2019s voices are heard.\u201d Bradshaw described the post-Olympic blues in her contribution to research for an academic paper in which 14 anonymous athletes spoke about being treated as \u201cmedal-winning machines\u201d and struggled to deal with the experience after a Games. These athletes favour the move to include them in the process. Alongside this provision for mental health support, the IOC is working to tackle the effects of abuse and discrimination on athletes. A study published last November by the University of Stirling found abuse of female footballers, a sport at this summer\u2019s Games, often goes unchecked on social media. This includes misogynistic and sexualised comments that, when not monitored, become normalised and acceptable to clubs and their followers. The IOC is rolling out a discovery tool to athletes and accredited media that utilises AI to recognise when there is targeted abuse. It is flagged and sent for human triage, with anything confirmed as abuse then removed from the platform before the individual sees it. Any criminal content will then be sent to law enforcement. There is hope the tool can be used this summer to further insulate athletes from abuse. Fifteen million people are expected to attend this summer\u2019s Games in Paris as opposed to the 20,000 at the Covid-disrupted games in Tokyo, which is likely to bring its own challenges and more pressure on the athletes. But for the first time all parties seem well placed to weather the storm."

            "date": "2024-05-01T04:00:48Z",
            "content": "Too many people with mental health issues who have committed violent crimes missed out on treatment as a result of cuts to support services, Sadiq Khan has warned. In an interview with the Guardian ahead of this week\u2019s local elections, he said such crimes were preventable and said years of austerity has left NHS mental health provision on its knees. The mayor of London\u2019s remarks came after a \u201cdevastating\u201d attack by a man armed with a sword left a 14-year-old boy dead and four others injured in east London, including two police officers who sustained serious wounds. Khan praised officers for running towards the suspect, even though he was armed, to try to keep the public safe. The Guardian understands police are investigating whether the individual has a history of mental ill-health. \u201cWe\u2019ve had too many examples in recent years of people responsible for the most serious crimes having mental ill-health,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in no way excusing criminality but it\u2019s quite clear there are complex causes \u2013 deprivation, poverty, alienation, lack of opportunity, ill-health. Of course we\u2019re tough on crime and support the police, but we also need to be tough on the complex causes of crime. \u201cWe need to make sure that young people in particular get proper medical treatment rather than waiting years and years and in the end having to have a crisis before they get the help they need.\u201d There has been a fall in homicide rates in England and Wales since 2008 yet despite this, research shows that the relative contribution of mental ill-health as a proportion of all homicide has increased. Khan highlighted the case of Barnaby Webber and Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar, stabbed to death in Nottingham last year by Valdo Calocane, who was given an indefinite hospital order for manslaughter by diminished responsibility, after he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. \u201cI studied the awful case in Nottingham \u2026 and how those families were let down because of the failure of the state to take action against this person who had mental ill-health,\u201d the Labour politician said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the bad news is that my years of experience tell me that there are too many people who should be receiving medical treatment who aren\u2019t and go on to commit serious acts of violence, sometimes homicide. \u201cIt\u2019s perverse in my view that it\u2019s only when they\u2019re in custody that they receive the treatment they should\u2019ve received as outpatients. \u201cI don\u2019t think these crimes are inevitable, I think they\u2019re preventable, just as austerity was a choice made 14 years ago, the consequences we\u2019re living with now.\u201d Khan, who is running for a third term as London mayor, said that if re-elected he would approach mental health as a public health issue, mirroring the national Labour party\u2019s focus on early intervention. He has pledged to invest in a pilot scheme with mental first aiders and counsellors in 30 schools across London. NHS data showed 120,000 children waited six months or longer between referral and treatment in 2022-23. \u201cNot all of those are going to go on to commit acts of violence, and not all of those will become criminals. But even if a small fraction are, that\u2019s a big number,\u201d he said. Khan\u2019s Tory rival, Susan Hall, has so far resisted politicising the attack despite knife crime being a key election issue. But former Conservative party chair Greg Hands, a London MP, asked on X: \u201cWhat has our great capital city come to when a 13-year-old [sic] boy is killed in a sword attack?\u201d The Tottenham Conservative party posted a video of the suspect on X, with the words: \u201cKnife crime has risen 54% in London and is at a five-year high. We can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d The post was later deleted. In response, Khan, who visited Redbridge earlier in the day, said: \u201cToday of all days, I really don\u2019t want to get involved in using this poor boy as a political football. \u201cAll I\u2019d say to those who wish to capitalise on this politically is look at the evidence around the country over the last 14 years: police numbers being cut; youth clubs closing down; cost of living crisis increasing.\u201d Knife crime offences in London rose year-on-year to 14,577, according to the latest official figures, up 20% but not yet at levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic. However, figures also show Londoners are less likely to be a victim of crime than people across the country as a whole. Khan said: \u201cYou can\u2019t run away from the fact that crime across the country is far too high. You can pick and choose the numbers you want but it\u2019s a fact that people feel scared. \u201cLondon\u2019s not the exception, people across the country don\u2019t feel safe. I\u2019m angry that the government has got away with austerity, cuts in the police and youth clubs and the NHS. It was a choice.\u201d Khan has doubled funding to the Metropolitan police to \u00a31.1bn since he came to office in 2016, while government funding to the force was cut by 32%, or \u00a31bn over the same period. He has also invested hundreds of millions of pound in youth clubs, which have seen savage cuts. He denied that a recent joke suggesting that Hall should stop watching gritty US cop series The Wire made light of the situation. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m angry about the Conservatives choosing pictures from Penn Station in New York in their party political broadcast. I\u2019m proud of the fact that, warts and all, this is the greatest city in the world.\u201d \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 1 May 2024 to better reflect the mayor\u2019s comments."

            "date": "2024-05-17T17:04:34Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt has been accused of exaggerating the Conservatives\u2019 economic record and presenting a \u201cdodgy dossier\u201d on Labour\u2019s spending plans, as he moved to put low tax at the heart of his party\u2019s offering at the next election. The chancellor gave a speech in central London on Friday, pitching the Conservatives as having helped the UK recover from economic troubles more quickly than expected. He also signalled a further cut to national insurance in the autumn, having already reduced the tax from 12p in the pound to 8p. \u201cIf we can afford to go further, responsibly, to reduce the double tax on work this autumn, that is what I will do,\u201d he said, arguing the economy had already \u201cturned a corner\u201d. In contrast, he painted Labour as a party of high tax and released a dossier claiming it had \u00a338bn of unfunded policies, from spending on more GP appointments to extra mental health support teams. The costings were carried out by civil servants at the request of the government, but were based on interpretations of Labour\u2019s policies provided by Conservative special advisers. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, described the document as a \u201cdesperate and cheap political stunt with a flawed dodgy dossier to distract from the Tories\u2019 record in government\u201d. \u201cBut if the Tories want to play that game, we\u2019re happy to play it because we are confident our plans are fully funded and costed,\u201d he said. Labour said there were at least 11 serious flaws in the Conservatives\u2019 claims about the opposition\u2019s spending on policies and that the Tories had stated they wanted to abolish national insurance, which would cost \u00a346bn, without saying how they would pay for that. Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government and a former Treasury civil servant, said such costings from Whitehall should be \u201ctaken with a very large pinch of salt\u201d as they were commissioned by government ministers and relied on their political advisers\u2019 assumptions. Economists also questioned Hunt\u2019s claims that the Conservatives had managed the economy well over the last 14 years. In his speech, Hunt acknowledged families had been \u201cbattered by the global shocks\u201d of the Covid pandemic and the energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine but argued the Conservatives had sheltered people\u2019s finances. He also insisted the economy was doing well, with inflation down to 3% and the country emerging from a shallow recession with a \u201csoft landing\u201d. Dario Perkins, a former Treasury official who now heads global research at the economics consultancy TS Lombard, said Hunt\u2019s claim that Conservative policies had benefited the UK economy was \u201cbizarre\u201d. He said: \u201cWe have had the worst decade of productivity growth since the Industrial Revolution and shockingly low levels of public and business investment. And this has led to an enormous squeeze on living standards. \u201cThe Conservatives had an obsession with austerity after the financial crash [in 2008] at a time when businesses and households were also cutting back on borrowing, which was a calamity for the economy. \u201cIt is hard to see how, if you are looking at the long-term health of the economy, you pull anything positive out of the last 14 years.\u201d Carys Roberts, the executive director at the IPPR thinktank, also questioned Hunt\u2019s interpretation, saying: \u201cThe economic story of the last 14 years has been one of turbulence. \u201cWithout a doubt the financial crisis, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have put external pressures on the UK economy. However, the UK has experienced meagre productivity growth, stagnant incomes and deepening regional inequalities, and these have deeper roots than the recent pressures. There is much to be proud of in the UK but our recent economic record is not one of them.\u201d Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said Hunt was \u201cquite right to draw attention\u201d to the pandemic and energy shock, which were \u201cnot the fault of the government\u201d. He said it was certainly the case that \u201creal earnings are rising at the moment but our expectation is that household incomes will be no higher at the end of this year than they were at 2019, which is pretty remarkable\u201d. He added: \u201cWhat we have had is a long period of stagnation and if you look over a year or 18 months, we are still in a period of stagnation. \u201cThe first quarter\u2019s numbers, we will have to wait until they are repeated two or three times before we are really confident that things are turning round. But if you look at the last two years, it is basically a picture of stagnation, with what might be the beginning of a more significant uptick now, but too early to start getting excited.\u201d In his speech, Hunt also hit out at Labour for claiming the Conservatives\u2019 ambition to get rid of national insurance would lead to the end of the state pension in its current form. The chancellor said it was \u201cfake news\u201d and a lie intended to scare older people, and that pensioners should trust the Conservatives to cut taxes. However, pensioners\u2019 tax levels are not lowered by cuts to national insurance as it is a tax on earnings from employment. Hunt\u2019s speech is the fourth major press conference held by a senior politician in the past two weeks. He followed the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, as the parties move into election campaign mode. No date has been announced yet."

            "date": "2024-05-30T11:26:22Z",
            "content": "Nigeria has reverted to a national anthem it dropped nearly 50 years ago after lawmakers replaced the current one, prompting widespread criticism over the lack of public consultation on the change. The country\u2019s president, Bola Tinubu, confirmed the law on Wednesday, a day after it was approved by both chambers of Nigeria\u2019s national assembly, which is dominated by the governing party. The federal lawmakers introduced and passed the bill in less than a week \u2013 an unusually fast process for important bills that usually take weeks or months to be considered. Nigeria\u2019s economy has plunged during Tinubu\u2019s first year in office, with inflation reaching a 28-year high of 33.2%, and the change of anthem was dismissed by some as a cynical distraction from an escalating economic crisis. The reintroduced anthem was played publicly for the first time at a legislative session attended by Tinubu. Titled Nigeria, We Hail Thee, it was introduced in 1960 when Nigeria gained independence from Britain. It was written by Lillian Jean Williams, a British expatriate. It was replaced in 1978 by Arise, O Compatriots under the military government of Olusegun Obasanjo. That anthem was composed at a time when the country was reeling from a deadly civil war and calls on Nigerians to \u201cserve our fatherland with love and strength\u201d and not to let \u201cthe labour of our heroes past [be] in vain\u201d. The change was met with incredulity by some Nigerians given the economic crisis and deteriorating security. \u201cIt is a waste of time,\u201d said Cheta Nwanze, a lead partner at SBM Intelligence. \u201cWhat is more important are inflation and security problems: that is what the government should squarely be looking at.\u201d Chioma Agwuegbo, an activist and the head of TechHer, an Abuja nonprofit working to get more women into technology, said: \u201cIt is a disaster but it is much deeper than that. This administration isn\u2019t going to bother to pay lip service to public consultations like the [previous, Muhammadu] Buhari administration did. They\u2019re just going to do the first thing that comes to their heads. \u201cTwo, this administration is very aware of the power of the media and the public sphere. This means that they\u2019re not bumbling about. Everything they are doing is targeted. They knew yesterday would be a disaster, hence this distraction with the anthem. There is no reason for this reversal. None whatsoever.\u201d Oby Ezekwesili, a former education minister and presidential candidate, said the law showed that the country\u2019s political class did not care about the public interest. \u201cIn a 21st century Nigeria, the country\u2019s political class found a colonial national anthem that has pejorative words like \u2018native land\u2019 and \u2018tribes\u2019 to be admirable enough to foist on our citizens without their consent,\u201d Ezekwesili posted on X. Supporters of the new anthem argued it was wrong for the country to use an anthem introduced by the military. \u201cAnthems are ideological recitations that help the people to be more focused. It was a very sad development for the military to have changed the anthem,\u201d said the public affairs analyst Frank Tietie. Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting"

That claim will be tested over the next six weeks \u2013 with every piece of economic news more closely scrutinised than usual for evidence that the UK\u2019s tentative economic recovery is gaining momentum or has started to falter. There are five key dates \u2013 crammed into a 10-day period in the middle of the campaign \u2013 to look out for. 11 June: labour market figures This could be one of the trickier pieces of economic news for Sunak to cope with since the last set of official data showed unemployment rising and job vacancies declining. Despite this evidence that the labour market is cooling, earnings growth remained strong, rising at an annual rate of 5.9%. In better news for the prime minister, wages have been rising more strongly than prices for the past 10 months, resulting in rising living standards.

Labour will say: for the first time in recent history, voters will be worse off at the end of a parliament than they were at the start. 12 June: growth figures for April One factor behind Sunak\u2019s decision to call an election was the unexpectedly strong growth figures for the first three months of 2024, which showed national output 0.6% higher than in the final three months of 2023 and brought to an end the UK\u2019s short and shallow recession. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, expects gross domestic product to rise by 02% between March and April, pushing up the quarterly growth rate from 0.6% to 0.8%. The Conservatives will say: Britain is growing faster than other leading developed economies. Labour will say: over the past 14 years Britain\u2019s growth and productivity record has been dismal. 19 June: annual inflation in the year to May This is probably the most important single piece of economic news during the campaign, given Sunak\u2019s claim that the UK\u2019s cost of living problem has now been cracked. The all-items annual inflation rate came down from 3.2% in March to 2.3% in April and is set to fall further in May. In part, that\u2019s because consumer prices rose by 0.7% last May, a hefty increase that is unlikely to be repeated this year. Bruna Skarica, the chief UK economist at Morgan Stanley, sees the headline inflation rate falling to 2% \u2013 smack on the government\u2019s target. Services inflation, which is closely watched by the Bank of England, should fall from 5.9% to 5.4%, Skarica says. The Conservatives will say: our tough action has brought stability to the economy. Labour will say: prices are 20% higher than they were at the start of the cost of living crisis and are still going up. 20 June: Bank of England interest rate decision The Bank of England raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023 \u2013 a jump from 0.1% to 5.25% \u2013 and there had been growing speculation that its monetary policy committee might start reducing borrowing costs at its June meeting. In theory, there is nothing to prevent the Bank cutting rates during an election campaign, but it would need to have strong evidence to do so. The City now sees little chance of a rate cut next month, with attention focused on whether the Bank will cut rates at its first post-election meeting in August. The Conservatives will say: interest rates are coming down soon because we have fixed the economy. Labour will say: homeowners are paying for Tory mismanagement through higher mortgage rates. 21 June: retail sales and public finances The last of the big five economic events between now and the election, and, while less significant than the other four, it is not without interest. A strong retail sales number would chime with recent evidence that consumers are feeling more confident about the state of their own finances and the economy more generally. Falling retail sales would suggest the absence of a feelgood factor. The poor state of the public finances helps explain why Sunak called an early election because had they been in better shape Jeremy Hunt would now be planning to cut national insurance contributions for a third time in an early autumn statement. The size of the May deficit will have little bearing on the election but will provide a guide to the difficult choices either a Conservative or Labour chancellor might be faced with in the next parliament. The deficit in May 2023 was just over \u00a314bn. The Conservatives will say: life is getting better, so don\u2019t let Labour wreck things. Labour will say: you are paying higher taxes because the Tories crashed the car. Take away the keys. Dales says overall the economic news over the next six weeks will be \u201creasonably positive\u201d but suspects it will not have much of an impact. \u201cPeople\u2019s views on the economy are formed and baked in,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are not going to change that much.\u201d"

            "content": "Your claim that \u201cRachel Reeves prefers a deadening consensus, sacrificing policies to placate business\u201d is absurd, and fails to recognise the radicalism of Reeves\u2019 recent Mais lecture (Editorial, 28 April). Although the need for fiscal stability was mentioned, the main theme of the lecture was quite different. It was about Britain\u2019s increasing economic backwardness \u2013 \u201ca failure to deliver the supply-side reform needed to equip Britain to compete in a fast-changing world\u201d. Reeves\u2019s allocation of primacy to institutional reform recalls the analysis of economic backwardness by the great Harvard economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron. Gerschenkron argued that economic success derives from the development of new institutions that channel funds into the large-scale investment that is necessary not just to catch up but to surpass successful competitors. In the Mais lecture, Reeves set out the rationale for \u201ca new model of economic management\u201d. She recognises that the dire state of Britain\u2019s economy is of sufficient urgency as to motivate the \u201cdecade of national renewal, shaping the institutional architecture of the British economy in the direction of mission-led government\u201d. Accordingly, she proposes new, focused institutions \u2013 a new British Infrastructure Council, a revived Industrial Strategy Council, a national wealth fund and Great British Energy. The challenge Reeves faces is whether her \u201cnew model of economic management\u201d is sufficiently strong to overcome the obstacles to change. Inevitably, in even the best-run reform, there will be mistakes and failures. Building momentum around confidence in the success of her programme of renewal is crucial to dealing with bumps in the road. Britain has undoubted economic potential that can be mobilised by investment in the science base and in the engineering and skills that transform invention into innovation, both in goods and services. John Eatwell Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge \u2022 Proponents of modern monetary theory, discussed in your editorial, have been plugging away for some time to break the stranglehold that neoliberal economic theory has on the discipline. Stephanie Kelton\u2019s book The Deficit Myth, which you also mention, is an excellent example of this. Such is this stranglehold that politicians, when expounding this, that or other policy to the media, are inevitably confronted with the simplistic question \u201cHow are you going to pay for it?\u201d, and the usual reply is a mixture of jiggling about with the tax system, economies in other areas (cuts and productivity increases) and economic growth. The question should be \u201cHave we the resources to do this?\u201d Then the proper political debate can commence. It is refreshing to see that one section of our media is starting to address this. John Boodle Whitwick, Leicestershire \u2022 At last, someone with a voice has brought modern monetary theory into the light. Please keep it there. More discussion needs to be had about the UK being a country that issues its own sovereign currency, which can therefore \u201cprint\u201d the money it needs to invest and to support its citizens. After all, they found a way to do it for the banks with quantitive easing. We must not fall for the \u201cmaxing out of the country\u2019s credit card\u201d scam, because it only serves those who wish to perpetuate austerity. Where to spend the money is a choice. And not to create the money when it is so desperately needed is a choice. Austerity is an ideological choice, not a necessity. Clever minds could work out how to spend first and then make it work; avoiding inflation by appropriate taxation and borrowing after our spending priorities. Now is the time to pursue this seriously, because we already know the results of the alternative approach from the last 14 years. A government\u2019s priority must be the welfare of its citizens.

            "date": "2024-05-17T14:00:37Z",
            "content": "The economic damage wrought by climate change is six times worse than previously thought, with global heating set to shrink wealth at a rate consistent with the level of financial losses of a continuing permanent war, research has found. A 1C increase in global temperature leads to a 12% decline in world gross domestic product (GDP), the researchers found, a far higher estimate than that of previous analyses. The world has already warmed by more than 1C (1.8F) since pre-industrial times and many climate scientists predict a 3C (5.4F) rise will occur by the end of this century due to the ongoing burning of fossil fuels, a scenario that the new working paper, yet to be peer-reviewed, states will come with an enormous economic cost. A 3C temperature increase will cause \u201cprecipitous declines in output, capital and consumption that exceed 50% by 2100\u201d the paper states. This economic loss is so severe that it is \u201ccomparable to the economic damage caused by fighting a war domestically and permanently\u201d, it adds. \u201cThere will still be some economic growth happening but by the end of the century people may well be 50% poorer than they would\u2019ve been if it wasn\u2019t for climate change,\u201d said Adrien Bilal, an economist at Harvard who wrote the paper with Diego K\u00e4nzig, an economist at Northwestern University. \u201cI think everyone could imagine what they would do with an income that is twice as large as it is now. It would change people\u2019s lives.\u201d Bilal said that purchasing power, which is how much people are able to buy with their money, would already be 37% higher than it is now without global heating seen over the past 50 years. This lost wealth will spiral if the climate crisis deepens, comparable to the sort of economic drain often seen during wartime. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear that the comparison to war is only in terms of consumption and GDP \u2013 all the suffering and death of war is the important thing and isn\u2019t included in this analysis,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cThe comparison may seem shocking, but in terms of pure GDP there is an analogy there. It\u2019s a worrying thought.\u201d The paper places a much higher estimate on economic losses than previous research, calculating a social cost of carbon, which is the cost in dollars of damage done per each additional ton of carbon emissions, to be $1,056 per ton. This compares to a range set out by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that estimates the cost to be around $190 per ton. Bilal said the new research takes a more \u201cholistic\u201d look at the economic cost of climate change by analyzing it on a global scale, rather than on an individual country basis. This approach, he said, captured the interconnected nature of the impact of heatwaves, storms, floods and other worsening climate impacts that damage crop yields, reduce worker productivity and reduce capital investment. \u201cThey have taken a step back and linking local impacts with global temperatures,\u201d said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University who wasn\u2019t involved in the work and said it was significant. \u201cIf the results hold up, and I have no reason to believe they wouldn\u2019t, they will make a massive difference in the overall climate damage estimates.\u201d The paper found that the economic impact of the climate crisis will be surprisingly uniform around the world, albeit with lower-income countries starting at a lower point in wealth. This should spur wealthy countries such as the US, the paper points out, to take action on reducing planet-heating emissions in its own economic interest. Even with steep emissions cuts, however, climate change will bear a heavy economic cost, the paper finds. Even if global heating was restrained to little more than 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century, a globally agreed-upon goal that now appears to have slipped from reach, the GDP losses are still around 15%. \u201cThat is still substantial,\u201d said Bilal. \u201cThe economy may keep growing but less than it would because of climate change. It will be a slow-moving phenomenon, although the impacts will be felt acutely when they hit.\u201d The paper follows separate research released last month that found average incomes will fall by almost a fifth within the next 26 years compared to what they would\u2019ve been without the climate crisis. Rising temperatures, heavier rainfall and more frequent and intense extreme weather are projected to cause $38tn of destruction each year by mid-century, according to the research. Both papers make clear that the cost of transitioning away from fossil fuels and curbing the impacts of climate change, while not trivial, pale in comparison to the cost of climate change itself. \u201cUnmitigated climate change is a lot more costly than doing something about it, that is clear,\u201d said Wagner. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 May 2024 because an earlier version misquoted Gernot Wagner in the last sentence."

            "content": "The British technology company Raspberry Pi has confirmed its intention to float in the UK, in a significant boost to the London Stock Exchange. The Cambridge-based business, which is best known for selling low-cost computers aimed at helping children to learn about computing, has been a UK business tech success story, selling 60m units worldwide since 2012. In an update to the market the company said it would send a registration to join the stock market in London, with an intention to fully list. The business could be valued at up \u00a3500m, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the intention to float. The Raspberry Pi decision comes as welcome news for the London Stock Exchange, which has struggled to attract listings from big companies this year, while some members have moved their listings to other exchanges. Earlier this month the Paddy Power owner, Flutter, announced its decision to switch its primary listing to New York. This followed the Anglo-German travel company Tui and the building materials firm CRH, who have also switched listings away from the UK in the past year. However, according to recent reports, the China-founded fast-fashion company Shein is stepping up preparations for a London listing after its attempt to float in New York faced regulatory hurdles and pushback from US lawmakers. Raspberry Pi is a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which was founded in 2008 with a goal of promoting interest in computer science in children. It was co-founded by Eben Upton, who is now the chief executive of Raspberry Pi. The foundation, which has received $50m (\u00a340m) in dividends from the company since 2013, will remain a major stakeholder after the float. The company\u2019s main products are small computer boards that can cost as little as $15 and can operate as fully functioning computers when plugged into screens. They are mainly intended for children to build their coding and IT development skills, but are also now used by companies to power systems such as security cameras and ventilation. For the year ending 31 December 2023, the company posted operating profits of $37.5m, on revenues of $265.8m. Upton said: \u201cFor the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a patient and supportive shareholder, this IPO brings the opportunity to double down on their outstanding work to enable young people to realise their potential through the power of computing. \u201cIn an ever more connected world, the market for Raspberry Pi\u2019s high-performance, low-cost computing platforms continues to expand. We have the technology roadmap to play an increasingly significant role, and we are excited to embark on the next stage of our growth.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-01T21:00:39Z",
            "content": "Just 60% of pharmacies stock naloxone, a life-saving medication that rapidly reverses the effects of an opioid overdose, as concerns grow about the danger posed by synthetic opioids. A survey of 530 pharmacies across New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, led by researchers from Monash University, found 321 pharmacies have naloxone in stock. A co-author of the study and deputy director of the Monash Addiction Research Centre, Prof Suzanne Nielsen, said this was an improvement from 2016, when only 23% of pharmacies stocked naloxone. But she said with unintentional opioid-related deaths in Australia nearly tripling since 2006, more pharmacies should stock naloxone. The findings are being presented at a research symposium being held by the centre on Thursday. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The introduction of the national Take Home Naloxone program in 2022 means anyone can access the drug from a pharmacy free, without a prescription, with people at risk of an opioid overdose or adverse reaction, their carers, friends and family members encouraged to have it on hand. Nielsen said she was aware of pharmacies that had not received information about the program, which demonstrated the need for additional support. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen great gains in Australia \u2026 the fact we have a nationally funded program is quite unique globally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re aware implementing new programs takes time \u2026 but we still need to do the necessary work to make sure that the other 40% of pharmacies can provide naloxone.\u201d The survey is an update to the centre\u2019s research published on Thursday in the medical journal, Drug and Alcohol Review, which found only 38% of Victorian pharmacies stocked naloxone in 2020, and a third of which had not supplied their stock to any customer in the past year. Nielsen and her colleagues found that pharmacists lacked the training necessary to confidently identify at-risk patients and supply naloxone over the counter. Synthetic opioids, known as nitazenes, are mixed into other drugs like MDMA and heroin without the user\u2019s knowledge. A cluster of 20 drug overdoses in NSW in April prompted the state\u2019s health department to issue a public warning about the danger of synthetic opioids, which are often substantially more powerful than heroin and to promote the importance of take-home naloxone. Nielsen called for naloxone to be part of the mainstream first aid response, particularly in environments like festivals where illicit drugs that \u201cmay or may not contain synthetic opioids\u201d are more common. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that we have this medication that can reverse an opioid overdose and be administered by a person with very little training,\u201d she said, with naloxone easily administered through injection or nasal spray. Dr Paul MacCartney, an addiction medication specialist at the Melbourne not-for-profit health service CoHealth, said heavy stigma around opioid use within both the general public and medical profession hindered naloxone\u2019s availability. \u201cThe most popular newspaper in our city ran an active campaign against people who use drugs in order to prevent a second safe injecting room being implemented \u2026 and that stigma persists in society through the medical profession,\u201d he said. On 23 April the Victorian government rejected a proposal for a second safe injecting room, which was to be located in the city, after a strong backlash from some media outlets and members of the public. MacCartney said pharmacists were under the impression that opioid users were more likely to be aggressive. \u201cPeople who use drugs are on edge when they go into a medical setting \u2026 they may not even feel comfortable asking a pharmacist for naloxone for fear they might be judged,\u201d he said. He called for pharmacists to be \u201cproactive\u201d in offering the medication to those at risk of an overdose. He also suggested that naloxone be given out alongside prescription opioids, as in Australia, more people die from overdoses of prescribed opioids compared with illicit types."

            "date": "2024-05-31T06:00:31Z",
            "content": "The market for carbon offsets shrank dramatically last year, falling from $1.9bn (\u00a31.5bn) in 2022 to $723m in 2023, a new report has found. The drop came after a series of scientific and media reports found many offsetting schemes do nothing to mitigate the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. The research by Ecosystem Marketplace, a nonprofit initiative that collects data about the carbon market from brokers and traders, found the market had shrunk 61%. It attributed the contraction to a flurry of scientific studies and media reports that concluded millions of offsets were \u201cworthless\u201d, with some projects linked to human rights concerns. Each carbon credit is meant to represent the reduction or removal of one tonne of CO2 emissions removals or reductions, and they have been used by leading companies to label their products \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d, or to tell consumers they can fly, buy new clothes or eat certain foods without making the climate and biodiversity crises worse. Offsets generated by schemes protecting rainforests, the most popular type, lost 62% of their value between 2022 and 2023. These schemes were the focus of a joint investigation by the Guardian, which found more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets from a large sample of projects from Verra \u2013 the world\u2019s leading certifier \u2013 are worthless, and uncovered potential human rights abuses at a flagship project. Verra disputed the findings. Julia Jones, a co-author on one of the studies in the investigation and a professor at Bangor University, said urgent reforms were necessary so carbon markets could work as intended. \u201cThe media scrutiny revealing that many projects issuing Redd+ credits to the voluntary carbon market have sold more credits than justified is important,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I am deeply concerned that some of the recent coverage of the issue gives the impression that the very idea of tackling climate change by slowing tropical deforestation is a scam \u2013 this is not true and the idea could harm forests. \u201cDramatically more finance is urgently needed to stop the ongoing loss of forests and the vital services they provide \u2013 a reformed voluntary carbon market could play a key role in providing that finance,\u201d she said. On Tuesday, the White House held an event to support industry-led efforts to reform carbon markets, backing initiatives to help companies avoid greenwashing and ensure credits represent actual environmental impact. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said companies should be prioritising cuts to emissions, but the Biden administration still wanted carbon credits \u201cto succeed\u201d. The move comes amid deep divisions between environmental groups about the role of carbon credits in helping companies meet net zero targets. Stephen Lezak, a programme manager at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, said people should not turn away from carbon markets. \u201cThe current market for carbon offsets is a bit like a burning building. We need folks to be firefighters and run toward it, rather than walk away and let it burn to the ground. Limiting global warming to 1.5C simply isn\u2019t feasible without having a functioning market for this sort of climate finance,\u201d he said. Kaya Axelsson, a research fellow at Oxford Net Zero, said: \u201cThis is a critical transition moment. Carbon markets will lose relevance unless they radically reform in line with net zero aims.\u201d Rene Velasquez, managing partner at the carbon markets consultancy Valitera, disputed the size of the fall reported by Ecosystem Marketplace and said there were problems with the methodology. \u201cAs with previous years, their report is incomplete and relies on a survey of market participants to provide confidential trade data,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is fewer and fewer institutional respondents participate.

Retail traders\u2019 interest in GameStop, the struggling video games chain, has been reignited by the re-emergence of an influencer known as Roaring Kitty. GameStop soared by as much as 98% during early trading on Wall Street, before losing steam in volatile trading, after rallying 74% on Monday. AMC, the world\u2019s largest cinema chain, climbed by as much as 120%. By the time markets closed in New York, GameStop was up 60% and AMC was up 31%. Meme stocks \u2013 boosted by memes on social media \u2013 first emerged as a force three years ago, when amateur traders mobilized on platforms including Reddit to boost shares in GameStop. Their bids triggered an extraordinary, but fleeting, increase in GameStop\u2019s stock market value. It also left hedge funds that had bet against the company nursing heavy losses. Earlier this week Keith Gill, the influencer known as Roaring Kitty, posted on X for the first time since the height of the meme stock frenzy in 2021. He shared a sketch of a gamer leaning forward, as if things were getting serious \u2013 and followed up with a string of clips from movies and TV shows. Three years ago Gill\u2019s videos on YouTube, and posts on Reddit, where he is known as DeepFuckingValue, placed him at the front of an army of meme-toting day traders who tried to mount a rebellion against Wall Street \u2013 and the financial titans dominating the market. The story of the initial meme stock rallies has already been transformed into a Hollywood movie. Paul Dano played Gill, the central character in Dumb Money, which was released last year. Gill himself has largely kept his head down, however \u2013 and steered clear of social media \u2013 until now. His posts on Sunday evening and Monday unleashed a torrent of speculation around his plans. Other meme stocks including BlackBerry and Tupperware also rallied on Tuesday. Shares in GameStop have fallen dramatically since their extraordinary peak in early 2021. Questions have been raised, too, about the strength of GameStop\u2019s business, which has reported falling sales and endured a series of high-profile departures from its management team. Institutional investors were quick to condemn the latest rally. \u201cIt is gambling,\u201d Cole Smead, a fund manager, told CNBC. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember these are young people, these are 40-year-old people like me, who are going out and doing stuff that is just frankly stupid.\u201d AMC, which also owns the Odeon chain of cinemas in Europe, was quick to capitalize on its stock\u2019s latest rally \u2013 raising $250m by selling shares."

While the average family may not be able to spring for the costly fruit, the expensive pineapple is a visible reminder of the demand among wealthy customers for luxurious produce. The Rubyglow pineapple is a rarity, with only a few thousand produced each year, the local news station KTLA reported. The fruit is being made available at Melissa\u2019s Produce, a speciality produce shop in Vernon, California. The rare fruit is known for its ruby color \u2013 similar to the precious gemstone \u2013 and sweet, yellow interior.

But Del Monte decided to introduce the luxury fruit to North America for the first time. The Rubyglow pineapple is the latest high-end fruit to make a splash in the US. Oishii strawberries, widely known as the world\u2019s most expensive strawberries, have gone viral across social media for their sweeter taste. A pack of six strawberries can cost more than $10 in some areas. Other pricy produce, such as Sumo Citrus, has similarly captured hearts and stomachs across the US. Though many have publicly aired grievances about the rising costs of certain common grocery items, luxury fruits continue to entice some American shoppers. \u201cConsumers are willing to pay for something that\u2019s special,\u201d Cindy van Rijswick, a global strategist for fruit, vegetable and floriculture sectors with Rabobank, told CNN.

The figures are likely to be seized on by Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, with much of the prime minister\u2019s justification for calling a summer election based around his claim that \u201cthe economy is turning a corner\u201d. May\u2019s better data follows poor sales values in April and March that were blamed on bad weather and the ongoing cost of living crisis. The amount of goods bought in April also dropped 2.3% month on month, according to Office for National Statistics data, with furniture, clothing, sports equipment, and games and toys among the big ticket items customers elected to do without. The fall was partly blamed on Easter falling earlier than usual, at the end of March. Shop prices are also growing more slowly, according to the CBI\u2019s measure of selling price inflation. Inflation was at its slowest since August 2020 and below its long-run average, with the expectation of only a slight pickup in June. This matched earlier data from the British Retail Consortium showing that store prices grew at an annual rate of 0.6% in May, down from 0.8% the previous month. This was a huge drop from the high of 9% reached in May 2023 and the slowest price growth since November 2021. The data will be welcomed by the Bank of England as further proof that the economy is cooling as it considers a cut to interest rates in June. However, the long-term picture was less positive. The CBI polled 137 businesses involved in retail, of which 56 were chains, and found that jobs in the sector were shrinking, with employment declining for the seventh consecutive quarter. The number of people employed in retail is also expected to decline, though more slowly, next month. Retailers said they were less likely to invest now than they were in February, demonstrating pessimism about the future state of the economy. \u201cThe mixed mood from our survey demonstrates just how nascent the economic recovery is,\u201d Paleja said."

Here is a wrap up: Five state education ministers have urged the federal government to properly fund public schools ahead of the budget on Tuesday; Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison has condemned a vote by the Australian government at the United Nations in support of giving a Palestinian delegation more rights; Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers has promised a \u201cbalanced\u201d federal budget that will combat inflation while offering Australians some cost-of-living relief; Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor says the government should follow financial rules laid down by Peter Costello when putting together its budgets; Warragamba Dam is spilling after continuous rain across the Sydney metropolitan area and reports of thunderstorms across northern New South Wales and south- east Queensland; The Greens have called for the government to commit to making childcare free; A tornado has hit Bunbury, about 175km south of Perth, causing millions of dollars in damage and scattering asbestos through the local community. We will be back tomorrow morning with all the latest. Asbestos emergency after tornado hits Bunbury in WA southwest Asbestos scattered over residential streets has prompted a \u201chazmat emergency\u201d response in Western Australia\u2019s southwest, with specialist crews urgently working to contain any possible exposure following a devastating tornado. More than 100 homes were damaged when the tornado ripped off roofs, collapsed walls and sucked up debris into the sky at Bunbury on Friday afternoon. The town\u2019s prison, a sporting centre, other community buildings and infrastructure were badly damaged but no one was seriously injured. Seven homes have so far been declared uninhabitable and seven others were severely affected. That number is expected to rise after crews finish assessing the scale of the damage. Residents living in three blocks have been told to stay away from their homes due to asbestos contamination fears near the Hay Park sports complex. WA Premier Roger Cook says there is \u201ca lot of asbestos in the streets\u201d. We\u2019ve got specialist teams on the ground trying to clean that up but there are exclusion zones which ensures that we can secure the public\u2019s safety. Authorities are now turning their attention to recovery, Department of Fire and Emergency Services Acting Commissioner Melissa Pexton says. Specialist contractors have been hired to sweep affected streets to reduce the size of the exclusion zone. We are hopeful that in the next two to three days we will have that finalised and we\u2019re very comfortable with the progress that\u2019s being made; we\u2019ll definitely keep the community up to date. Nine people are booked into emergency accommodation and Bunbury locals will gather at a community meeting on Sunday afternoon to discuss what other services are needed. - AAP Elective surgery target slashed by Victorian government A key target for 240,000 Victorians to go under the knife for elective surgery each year is no more, with the state government quietly moving the goal-posts. In 2022, the Andrews Labor government boldly set itself a target to carry out 240,000 elective surgeries a year by 2024, as part of a $1.5bn Covid catch-up plan. But buried in Tuesday\u2019s budget papers, was a new, lower target of 200,000 for 2024/25 after failing to reach the earlier target in 2023/24. The budget attributed the shortfall to continued demandfor health services post-pandemic. In November, the state\u2019s health Minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, told ABC Radio Melbourne the government would not stop until it hit the ambitious target, saying she couldn\u2019t accept anything less on behalf of Victorians. We\u2019re going to hit it. We will come very close ... and if we don\u2019t achieve that target we\u2019ll keep working until we do. Thomas told reporters on Sunday that the government had changed the target because of staff shortages within the health system. We\u2019re still not able to access the workforce that we need. We\u2019re in a global war for talent when it comes to getting healthcare workers. The opposition health spokeswoman, Georgie Crozier, says the government has broken a promise, leaving tens of thousands of Victorians to languish in pain waiting for vital surgery. Whether it\u2019s elective surgery, building hospitals like at Arden Street or the 10 community hospitals that they promised two elections ago, this government is full of broken promises and as a result it\u2019s Victorians who are paying the price. - AAP Proposed laws will tighten Queensland\u2019s assisted reproductive technology regulation Assisted reproductive technology companies will face greater scrutiny and regulation under laws proposed by the Queensland government. The state health service will be able to enter and inspect premises, put conditions on licences and even suspend or cancel non-compliant IVF clinic services, bringing Queensland into line with other states and jurisdictions. A donor conception register is also set to be unveiled in the legislation put forward by Health Minister Shannon Fentiman following recommendations from a parliamentary inquiry. Queensland has fallen behind the rest of Australia in regulating assisted reproductive technology providers, Fentiman says. It\u2019s so important that Queensland Health has the compliance and enforcement powers it needs to make sure that the services these companies are providing are safe,\u201d she told reporters on Sunday. There was really no powers for Queensland Health to be able to enter these premises, inspect these premises, make sure that these providers were doing the right thing by families. This legislation now will give Queensland Health those powers that most other states already have. The $2m donor conception register will allow donor-conceived people to access genetic and medical information from the past 50 years. Counselling will be offered to those using the register as part of its implementation. - AAP Australians need more cost-of-living relief, higher wages, ACTU president says ACTU President Michele O\u2019Neil has called for the government to prioritise cost-of-living relief and support for continued wage growth. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s budget, O\u2019Neil says Australians have dealt with 10 years of weak nominal wage growth, while real wages stagnated under the previous 10 years of a Coalition government. But she says that had changed under the new government. Australians suffered historic low wage growth under the Coalition government, and it remains the economic and ideological position of the Dutton Coalition to drive down workers wages as [an] answer to economic growth. Wage growth has finally turned around as a result of decisions made by the Albanese government, and we expect the 2024 budget to continue to deliver on the economic conditions that support higher wages. The government has made good steps in addressing the cost-of-living, with workers seeing improvements in bargaining rights, support for increases in the minimum wage, and a pay rise for aged care workers. Particularly important is the cost-of-living tax bonus from 1 July for workers who need it the most, as well as last year\u2019s energy bill relief, which took pressure off household budgets. Woman suffers serious spinal injury at Australian band Trophy Eyes\u2019 New York gig A woman has been left partially paralysed after the lead singer of Newcastle post-punk bank Trophy Eyes attempted to crowd surf during a show in New York. Local news organisation WGRZ reported that Bird Piche, 24, attended a show by Trophy Eyes at Mohawk Place in Buffalo last week. Video of the incident later posted to the band\u2019s Reddit page shows the moment where frontman, John Floreani, jumps from the stage during a crowdsurf. Floreani, however, appears to land on Piche\u2019s head as others lift the singer. Those who claimed to be at the concert posted in the Reddit thread that people thought the women had fainted but when she didn\u2019t get back up, the show stopped and people, including Floreani, rushed to help her. She was taken to a hospital emergency room. She is thought to be in a stable condition with a severe spinal cord injury, although she still has use of her arms and is able to communicate through text messages. Stores up in smoke following suspected tobacco war attacks Victoria\u2019s tobacco wars show no signs of abating, with two stores in Melbourne\u2019s north-west suffering extensive fire damage after suspected targeted attacks. Two tobacconists have been torched in more suspected fire bombings linked to ongoing tobacco wars in Victoria. The stores at Hadfield and Gladstone Park in Melbourne\u2019s north-west caught alight within the space of 45 minutes on Sunday morning. Nobody was inside either store at the time and both stores suffered significant damage. A burned-out ute remained in front of the Gladstone Park store on Sunday morning, while an SUV with major fire damage to its front was outside the Hadfield shop. No arrests have been made for the suspected arsons. Investigators are treating the fires as targeted attacks and will look at any possible links to other recent fires. Victoria police set up Taskforce Lunar in 2023 to investigate the firebombing of dozens of shop fronts and other venues in an ongoing battle for control of the state\u2019s tobacco market. In April, assistant commissioner Martin O\u2019Brien told a parliamentary inquiry that youths recruited into the illegal tobacco and vape wars were being paid as little as $500 to commit arson attacks. O\u2019Brien says gangs have stepped into the market as the cost of legal tobacco products soars, shipping in illegal tobacco and vapes from China and Arab nations. The Victorian government has committed to establishing a tobacco retailer and wholesale licensing scheme in the second half of 2024. - AAP Australian data expected to show robust wage growth Australian workers have likely logged a robust start to the year for wage growth, even as the jobs market continues to soften around the edges. While the federal budget on Tuesday is likely to dominate the headlines this week, there are a couple of top-shelf data releases due as well. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is scheduled to drop the March quarter wage price index on Wednesday and the April labour force report on Thursday. Wages have been growing strongly due to a tight labour market and robust public sector pay decisions, lifting 0.9% in the December quarter, and 4.2% for the year. For March, Westpac economists had a 0.9% quarterly rise pencilled in, keeping the annual pace flat at 4.2%. The April jobs data from the statistics bureau will follow March\u2019s unemployment rate ticking higher to 3.8%, from 3.7% in February. Australia\u2019s labour market has proved resilient in a slowing economy, although there are signs it is softening, with job vacancies increasing and the underemployment rate edging up. The National Australia Bank business survey for April will be released on Monday, which will show how the private sector is coping. There\u2019s also a speech expected from Reserve Bank of Australia chief economist Sarah Hunter on Thursday, which will follow the central bank\u2019s decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.35% in May. Local investors will assess modest gains on Wall Street on Friday as investors digested the Federal Reserve\u2019s comments about monetary policy and eyed upcoming inflation data. - AAP \u2018Exemplar\u2019 solutions to housing crisis being blocked by councils, resident groups When a group of Melburnians banded together with a plan to build their dream homes, they did not envision the barriers they would face from local council. The proposed development of 21 townhouses overlooking a creek in Eltham, on Melbourne\u2019s fringe, promised environmentally-conscious design, plenty of shared space and respect for heritage and the local neighbourhood. According to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, it is the type of project that \u201ccould and should have been supported and fast-tracked\u201d, an \u201cexemplar of an innovative approach\u201d to dealing with the state\u2019s housing crisis. Instead, the Brougham Street co-housing project has been \u201cmet with substantial delays and opposition\u201d from the local Nillumbik Shire council and residents group, in what Vcat says is a growing issue across the state. \u201c[It] is part of a wider trend we are observing, that will fail to produce appropriate housing projects that can start to address the existing shortfall of housing supply presently being experienced across metropolitan Melbourne,\u201d Vcat says. For more on this story read the full report by Guardian Australia Victorian state correspondent Benita Kolovos: Auction activity has remained stable this weekend with 2,168 auctions scheduled. This is just below the 2,202 held last week but a gain on the 1,692 auctions on the corresponding weekend last year. CoreLogic\u2019s found on results collected so far that the preliminary clearance rate was 72.6% across the country, which is lower than the 73.5% preliminary rate recorded last week but well above the 65.9% actual rate on final numbers. Across the capital cities: Sydney: 572 of 753 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 75.9%. Melbourne: 766 of 1066 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 68%. Brisbane: 103 0f 152 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 76.7%. Adelaide: 60 of 115 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 91.7%. Canberra: 35 of 69 auctions with a preliminary clearance rate of 71.4%. Tasmania: Two auctions to be held. Perth: Eight of 11 auctions held. Thunderstorms forecast for south-east Queensland and northern NSW The wet weather along the east coast is set to continue through Sunday into the evening with thunderstorms forecast for south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales. Rainfall is expected to continue further south towards Sydney. Celestial display lights up southern skies Australians living in the southern states were treated to a light show on Saturday night as the aurora australis lit up the night sky. Guardian Australia reporter Stephanie Convery snapped these photos overnight. South Australia\u2019s department for environment and water is encouraging residents to share their best photos of the event. Sudanese Australians desperate to reunite with families There are renewed calls for the Australian government to set up a special humanitarian scheme for Sudanese people to be repatriated with families in Australia, similar to those offered to Afghans and Ukrainians. A 48-year-old Sudanese-Australian civil engineer, Ahmed El Tahir, is among those desperate to reunite with his family which has been displaced to Egypt following ongoing violence that Human Rights Watch has described as a genocide. El Tahir says the circumstances his wife and daughter are living under are intolerable. When she (his daughter) hears a chopper or an aeroplane, she starts to hide under the bed. My daughter is an Australian citizen and has her passport. I applied to get my wife here but ... I still haven\u2019t received a humanitarian visa for her. All my thinking is geared towards them. I can\u2019t concentrate the whole time. His seven-year-old daughter had no citizenship papers at the outbreak of the conflict in April 2023 to prove she could be evacuated with other Australian nationals, let alone with her mother who is a Sudanese national. She and her mother had an arduous journey waiting for four months at the border crossing between Sudan and Egypt. El Tahir says the government has not done enough to assist Sudanese people in similar situations. We tried to mention this to (the immigration minister) Andrew Giles. We are Australian and are supposed to be treated the same but when it comes to the Sudanese crisis, nothing has happened. - AAP Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s federal budget, Victorian Greens Senator Steph Hodgins-May has called for free childcare. The senator says making childcare free would provide women with economic security and provide a \u201clifeline\u201d to those seeking to escape violent partners by ensuring their children are safe while they try to find work. She cited research by the Australia Institute that found free childcare would combat inflation by boosting the participation of women in the workforce. In this cost-of-living crisis, early childhood education and care is too expensive and too hard to access. As a result, women are missing out on paid work, they\u2019re being left behind because they can\u2019t afford childcare. For women trying to flee violent partners, free childcare means women aren\u2019t forced to choose between violence and poverty. If we can spend $368bn on submarines, we can spend money on making childcare free for all parents across Australia. Labor must prioritise women\u2019s safety. Childcare is an essential public service, and for children the early years are the most important in their development. It removes barriers that limit choices for women, boosts women\u2019s capacity to engage in paid work and relieves financial pressures in a cost-of-living crisis. Hodgins-May replaced Greens Senator Janet Rice at the start of May after Rice retired. New scholarship program will train regional nurses to treat endometriosis Endometriosis Australia is partnering with the Australian College of Nurses to launch a scholarship aimed at delivering 100 trained nurses to regional, rural and remote communities across the nation. The scheme, funded by government grants and community donations, will train nurses to treat those living with endometriosis without access to health services available in major cities. Endometriosis is a disease that causes tissue similar to the lining of the uterus to grow in other parts of the body. Its symptoms include period pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, fatigue, pain during sex and reduced fertility. Director and co-founder of Endometriosis Australia, Donna Ciccia, said nurses better understanding the condition could drastically change how patients are treated. Some communities only have nurses - they don\u2019t have any GPs in town, or it might take longer to see a GP or clinic that specialises in endometriosis and pelvic pain. Having a nurse that can dedicate more time so they can understand what\u2019s happening to [patients\u2019] bodies can be life-changing. It\u2019s also just awesome to have someone who [understands] endometriosis, that you don\u2019t need to walk into a clinic and explain what endometriosis is. - AAP Government investment in extra urgent care clinics \u2018misguided\u2019, GPs college says The Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) says the government has the wrong priorities on healthcare in its budget. The RACGP\u2019s president, Dr Nicole Higgins, says amajor investment in 29 extra urgent care clinics is a \u201cmisguided investment\u201d when frontline GP services are struggling. There is no substitute for the personalised quality care delivered by a GP who knows you and your history. The urgent care clinics will make some difference, but the government should be boosting investment in general practice care so that no patients anywhere are left behind. There is no greater health need right now than supporting people struggling with their mental health and suffering from chronic conditions. Higgins says the urgent care clinics will \u201ctake years to roll route, create confusion for the public and disrupt care people usually receive from their regular GP\u201d. These clinics are also likely to redirect limited general practice workforce capacity away from regular clinics where they are needed most. Sydney\u2019s Warragamba Dam is spilling over after reaching capacity following heavy downpours across New South Wales. WaterNSW has confirmed the dam began spilling at 7.30am on Sunday following widespread rain across Sydney catchments. The water reservoir last spilled after heavy rain on 6 April, causing catastrophic damage to some homes near the catchment area. The SES has issued minor flood warnings for the Hawkesbury River at North Richmond and the Colo River but does not expect any significant impact to properties in the area. There will possibly be low-lying flooding over roads but we\u2019re not expecting major impacts like there was [during] the last spill. Over the past 24 hours to 9am on Sunday, Sydney had recorded rainfall totals in excess of 30mm at Campbelltown (35.4mm) and Observatory Hill (31.2mm). Heavy rain and significant runoff led to a 10-metre wide sink hole opening in a residential street at Dover Heights in Sydney\u2019s east on Saturday night. NSW SES Waverley-Woollahra Deputy Unit Commander Anthia Kollaras says: We were on scene until 1 o\u2019clock this morning, using sandbags and a retaining wall to divert water away from properties. The hole was quite big, and part of the road had washed away. It was one of 273 incidents SES volunteers attended across the state in the 24 hours to 8am on Sunday. \u2013 AAP Executive Council of Australian Jewry: Australia\u2019s UN vote on Palestine breaks with \u2018like-minded democracies\u2019 The Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Alex Ryvchin has responded to the Australian government\u2019s vote in favour of a United Nations resolution giving more rights to Palestine: As the government admits, the resolution alters practically nothing. The real obstacles to a two-state solution remain untouched. Hamas has not been eliminated, the Palestinian Authority is still corrupt and undemocratic and still won\u2019t declare that it seeks a state alongside the Jewish national home and not in place of it. Ryvchin says the Australian government has \u201cbroken with like-minded democracies\u201d in casting its vote. Australia voted in the same way as New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. The US voted against the resolution while the UK abstained. Chalmers: \u2018Deploying\u2019 private investment a \u2018massive focus\u2019 of the budget The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, also flagged a bump in spending on Medicare, saying the country needs to train more health workers to meet growing demand. There is a provision in the budget in aged care, early childhood education to make sure that we are paying people in the care economy what they need and deserve. This is also another important reminder that a budget which is primarily about cost of living and A Future Made in Australia [policy] also has really substantial investments in health and the care economy and Medicare, in housing, in universities reform and in skills you do need to train the workers that we\u2019ll need in the care economy. Asked what is its Future Made in Australia policy, Chalmers says the focus is \u201cabout grabbing these fast, industrial and economic opportunities from the fast growth\u201d as the country moves to a net zero economic. What you will see in the budget is a whole combination of levers to turn this opportunity into prosperity, whether it is using the tax system, whether it is using targeted grants, whether it is attracting and absorbing and deploying more private investment \u2013 which is a massive focus of the budget on Tuesday night. There will be a range of different levers and different measures and policies to make sure that we can make our economy an indispensable part of the global push to net zero [carbon emissions]. Chalmers says Australia isn\u2019t trying to compete dollar-for-dollar with bigger economies but it wants the settings right so it can grab opportunities as they arise. Our world is changing and the pace of that change is accelerating; other countries are changing their orthodoxies in order to take full advantage and we need to do that as well. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has kicked off Sunday morning with a media blitz, giving an extended interview to the ABC and appearing on channels Nine and Sky. Speaking to ABC earlier this morning, Chalmers promised a \u201cresponsible\u201d budget that would respond to persistent inflation pressures while offering modest cost-of-living relief. Chalmers is trying to present the budget as a good news story saying \u201cit is a good opportunity to remind people that we have made pretty substantial progress in this inflation fight\u201d as inflation is \u201cless than half of what its peak was in 2022\u201d. There is a really sharp near-term focus on the inflation fight in this budget. It\u2019s the most important thing we can focus on in the near term but we need to remember that we have a growth challenge as well and we will invest in the future. Challenged on the decision to tweak broad-ranging tax cuts instead of winding back or scrapping them, Chalmers said the government\u2019s approaches \u201care bang on for the circumstances that we are confronting\u201d. We found other ways to provide cost-of-living help to those who may be not in the tax system, for example, or people who are under pressure in particular. Taylor evasive on immigration detainee decisions made on Dutton\u2019s watch The back-and-forth continues between the federal government and opposition over former immigration detainees accused of participating in a violent home invasion in Perth, and whose fault it is that they were released into the community without electronic monitoring. The coalition has been hammering the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, because one of the alleged offenders was out on bail and the government-appointed community safety board did not recommend he wear an electronic ankle bracelet. Over the weekend, it\u2019s emerged another of the alleged offenders was released when the Coalition was in government and Peter Dutton was immigration minister. Dutton and his shadow ministers, Dan Tehan in immigration and James Paterson in home affairs, have all called for Giles to take responsibility for the decision in the first case. This morning on the ABC\u2019s Insiders, shadow treasurer Angus Taylor was asked if Peter Dutton will now take responsibility for a decision made on his watch. Taylor didn\u2019t answer directly but pointed the finger back at Labor. This was an illegal arrival under a Labor government that gave this person a protection visa. So there\u2019s a bit of hypocrisy going on here. Expect this issue to get a bit of attention when parliament resumes this week, budget or no budget. Taylor coy on full extent of Coalition\u2019s plans for supermarket sector On the National party\u2019s push to break up Australia\u2019s supermarket duopoly, Angus Taylor says Liberal policy is for a mandatory code for the supermarket sector. Asked again about divestiture powers, Taylor says: We\u2019re working through the issue. Taylor: Coalition\u2019s nuclear position will be \u2018significant change\u2019 in Australia\u2019s energy policy Asked whether he believes nuclear power in Australia will deliver a financial return, Angus Taylor is bullish. We\u2019ll have more to say about nuclear in time but, yes, I do. Taylor has also accused the government of being \u201cmugged by reality\u201d on energy policy saying \u201cwe have collapsing supply in Bass Straight and we need to get more gas out of the ground and into our pipelines\u201d. When will the public get to see the Coalition\u2019s nuclear policy? We have already been moving at a rapid pace towards nuclear, which will be one of the most significant changes in energy policy in this country in a long while. There\u2019s a sense from some in the commentariat that we\u2019re not contrasting with Labor. We\u2019re making serious contrasts with Labor right now as an opposition and they\u2019re important. Nuclear is one of them and gas has been another. Taylor warns \u2018major manufacturers leaving\u2019 Australia Angus Taylor says \u201cwe\u2019re seeing major manufacturers leaving the country\u201d. It is worth bearing in mind that the first act of the Abbott Coalition government in 2016 was to demand General Motors Holden \u201ccome clean\u201d about its plans for the future, which precipitated the collapse of a major manufacturing industry in 2016. He says he has yet to see the detail of the government\u2019s plan to encourage solar panel manufacturing or the plan to buy a Quantum computer. Taylor is also asked whether a Coalition government would subsidise a nuclear power plant. It has to be capable of delivering a commercial return. That\u2019s an important threshold test for any investment. Time to embrace free market, Coalition\u2019s Taylor says The key theme from Angus Taylor this morning is that the government needs to \u201cget back to basics\u201d saying that more housing and more manufacturing require an embrace of the free market. You have to make sure you get your industrial relations right, which ensures that we have productive competitive workplaces, which are good for both employees and employers. You have to make sure government is not getting in the way and you\u2019re getting approvals done. Those there are basics. If you don\u2019t get them right you try to do loads of government spending and it fails. Shadow treasurer says government must \u2018show restraint\u2019 when it comes to spending Angus Taylor is challenged on his budget spending claim, with it being pointed out that Labor\u2019s spending increase is only 1.4% compared with 4.1% under the previous Coalition government. The shadow treasurer says this is \u201cgoing back to Covid-era spending\u201d. It is pointed out to him that it actually refers to spending over the past 30 years. Asked what the Coalition\u2019s proposed spending rule will look like, Taylor says it would involve \u201cstructural budget balance, not windfall surplus\u201d. What we\u2019ve got at the moment is a focus on windfall. Taylor says with Australian households \u201cstruggling with their budgets\u201d, it\u2019s now \u201ctime for the Australian government to show restraint\u201d. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor says the government should be cautious about its spending or risk \u201canother flop\u201d in its 2024 budget. Taylor says the government should \u201cre-establish the fiscal rules that Peter Costello put in place back in the 1990s to have a structural budget balance. The shadow treasurer accused the government of $209bn in additional spending since it came to power. \u201cThat\u2019s over $20,000 for every Australian household. I bet there\u2019s not many Australian households out there listening to this who feel as though they\u2019ve got that benefit. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Challenging on this figure, Taylor says \u201cit\u2019s in the budget papers\u201d. Part of this figure includes automatic increases in Jobseeker and rent assistance, which the Coalition has supported. And the winner is \u2026 The 2024 Eurovision song contest has been decided with Switzerland\u2019s Nemo taking out the competition. It is the third time Switzerland has won, with the previous win taking place in 1988 when Celine Dion performed Ne partez pas sans moi. Australia failed to make it through to the final after Electric Fields was eliminated but an Australian representing Cyprus, Silia Kapsis, did make it through and wowed with her final performance. For more, check out the Guardian\u2019s Eurovision live blog: The education ministers of five states have urged the Albanese government to fairly fund public schools in Tuesday\u2019s federal budget. The ministers for South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland joined the Australian Education Union and principals\u2019 associations to call for the federal government to bring the School Resourcing Standard up to 100%. The Gonski 2.0 education reforms require states to fund 75% of the standard for public schools, with the federal government funding 20%, leaving a funding gap. The education ministers say fair funding would lead to billions more flowing to schools that need it. Only in the ACT are public schools funded to the full standard. The NSW minister Prue Car said: State governments are facing unprecedented pressure as our public schools do the heavy lifting when it comes to educating growing populations, and supporting students with increasingly complex needs. The Victorian minister Ben Carroll said: Federal Labor changed the course of education funding with the Gonski Review, the biggest reforms in 40 years. Today, we have a collective opportunity to change course after the inequities delivered by the federal Coalition to the school system. We stand ready to work with the commonwealth government to deliver fair and full funding to government schools. The Australian Government Primary Principals Association President Pat Murphy said: When it comes to education there is no bigger elephant in the room than why government school students are not funded at 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard. Since 2012 when the Gonski report identified the minimum funding a student should receive, we see only 3% of public school students in Australia receiving this minimum standard. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, has struck deals with the NT and Western Australia \u2013 who did not sign onto the call on Sunday \u2013 and has said as part of negotiations with the other states that he wants the extra funding tied to reporting obligations on the states. The shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor is speaking to ABC Insiders host David Speers this morning. Earlier the treasurer Jim Chalmers spoke to Sky after the shadow finance minister Jane Hume was interviewed. We will bring you the highlights from those interviews across the morning. Scott Morrison has described Australia\u2019s vote in support of a United Nations motion to give additional rights to Palestine as the \u201cmost hostile act of an Australian government to the state of Israel in our history\u201d. The former prime minister said Palestine was \u201ccurrently governed by terrorists\u201d and that any recognition \u201cmust only occur where there is an agreement and when Palestine can be a functional state\u201d. Labor backbencher Josh Burns, who supports a two-state solution, said on Instagram that Australia should have abstained from the vote while Hamas remained in power in the Gaza Strip. An abstention would have signalled we\u2019re open to further recognition, but that we acknowledge the short-term hurdles that need to be overcome in order to achieve lasting piece. Anti-Semitism is on the rise in Australia and this decision will make Jewish Australians feel even more isolated as they remain gravely concerned for hostages in Gaza. The foreign minister Penny Wong has defended the move, saying Australia\u2019s vote is \u201cthe opposite of what Hamas wants\u201d. Australia was among 143 UN general assembly members to pass the resolution calling on the security council to reconsider granting full membership to Palestine. The resolution was significantly watered down in last-minute negotiations. For more on this story, read the full report below: And welcome to another Sunday Guardian live blog. Education ministers from five Australian states have urged the Albanese government to fairly fund public schools ahead of Tuesday\u2019s federal budget. Ministers from South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland joined with the Australian Education Union and principals\u2019 associations asking federal Labor to fully fund public schools. The Labor MP Josh Burns and the former prime minister Scorr Morrison have been two of the more vocal critics after Australia voted in support of a United Nations vote on Palestinian membership. The foreign minister Penny Wong said supporting the draft resolution was not about recognising Palestine as a state. I\u2019m Royce Kurmelovs and I\u2019ll be taking the blog through the day.

            "date": "2024-05-22T08:12:09Z",
            "content": "The annual inflation rate fell sharply in April. Prices are rising more slowly than at any time in almost three years. Inflation is lower in the UK than it is in the EU. Even so, the latest bulletin on the cost of living from the Office for National Statistics was mildly disappointing. April\u2019s inflation figure was always going to be good, with a sharp fall guaranteed by the fact the energy price increases of a year earlier were not repeated. But at 2.3%, the number was slightly higher than expected. The consensus among economists polled by Reuters was 2.1%. Some had even predicted it would drop below the government\u2019s 2% target. The main reason for the fall from 3.2% in March was the continuing downward trend in household energy bills. According to the ONS, prices of electricity, gas and other fuels were 27.1% lower this April than in April 2023, the sharpest decline since records began in 1989. Food price inflation was also down \u2013 from 4% to 2.8%. These developments are helpful for poorer households, which spend a bigger share of their income on heating, lighting and putting food on the table. But there was also some less good news. Core inflation \u2013 which strips out food, energy, tobacco and alcoholic drinks \u2013 fell from 4.2% to 3.9%, rather than the 3.6% expected. Even more worryingly, inflation in the services sector \u2013 which is closely monitored by Bank of England interest rate setters \u2013 barely budged, falling from 6% to 5.9%. One reason for that appears to be that businesses passed on at least some of the higher costs from the higher national living wage, which went up from \u00a310.42 to \u00a311.44 last month, to their customers. Inflation in the hotels and restaurants sector \u2013 parts of the economy with a heavy concentration of minimum-wage workers \u2013 rose last month from 5.8% to 6%. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee will be paying a lot more attention to services inflation than they will to the headline 2.3% figure because it thinks it is a reasonable guide to price pressures generated by the domestic UK economy. Rob Wood, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there were plenty of examples of sticky service inflation: accommodation, water bills, air fares, catering, and recreation and cultural services all experienced hefty price increases last month. \u201cUpside surprises elsewhere were widespread, not focused in a few erratic components,\u201d he said. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, had been predicting a much bigger fall to 5.2% in services inflation in April, and says the much smaller decrease will affect the timing of cuts in official borrowing costs. \u201cEven though there is still a wages and an inflation release to go before the Bank of England meeting on 20 June, it feels as though a cut then now seems very unlikely. Even a cut in August is looking a bit more doubtful,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Inflation across the US eased slightly last month as concerns about the cost of living loomed over the battle between Joe Biden and Donald Trump for the White House. The closely watched consumer price index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 3.4% in April, down from an annual pace of 3.5% the previous month. The White House released a low-key statement after the figures were released. \u201cFighting inflation and lowering costs is my top economic priority,\u201d said Biden. \u201cI know many families are struggling, and that even though we\u2019ve made progress we have a lot more to do.\u201d Policymakers have been surprised by stubborn price growth, which they hope to bring down to 2%. The Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates to a two-decade high to tamp down inflation and had been expected to start cutting them this year. But price gains have remained higher than the central bank\u2019s target and hopes of a rate cut have faded. \u201cWe did not expect this to be a smooth road,\u201d Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said before the news on Tuesday, \u201cbut these [inflation readings] were higher than I think anybody expected.\u201d The \u201ccore\u201d CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.3% in April, down from 0.4% in the previous three months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The annual rate of core CPI was 3.6% in April, its lowest rate since April 2021. Rising housing and fuel costs were the two biggest factors behind April\u2019s price increases. \u201cThe index for shelter rose in April, as did the index for gasoline. Combined, these two indexes contributed over 70% of the monthly increase in the index for all items,\u201d the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. Food prices were flat and egg prices dropped sharply \u2013 7.3% \u2013 over the month. \u201cWhile on the surface it is positive to see inflation fall from the previous month, looking at the trend over the past 12 months provides a different picture. Inflation has been bouncing around the 3%-4% range for a considerable period of time now, and this is now arguably singlehandedly preventing the Federal Reserve from pushing the button on rate cuts,\u201d said Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors. Inflation has fallen sharply since peaking at 9.1% \u2013 its highest level in a generation \u2013 almost two years ago. But the pressure exerted by elevated prices on household budgets nationwide has become a key flashpoint in the run-up to November\u2019s presidential election, with a string of polls indicating that the economy is a top issue for voters. Biden has hit back at polls that suggest many Americans question his handling of the economy, labeling them as \u201cwrong\u201d last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve already turned it around,\u201d he told CNN. In the interview, Biden also pointed to the robust growth of the US labor market, which has added hundreds of thousands of jobs this year. Trump is, nevertheless, seeking to cast Biden as \u201cthe destroyer of America\u2019s jobs\u201d, claiming the president\u2019s policies have fueled \u201crunaway\u201d inflation."

            "date": "2024-05-10T14:51:00Z",
            "content": "The UK is officially out of recession after figures showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the period from January to the end of March marked a return to growth after a mild recession in the second half of 2023. It was the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021, and a better performance than expected by economists, who forecast growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. The downturn came to an end after an increase in activity across the services sector, which has flourished since the turn of the year as wages have outstripped inflation, easing pressure on consumers. However, forecasters expect the UK to grow slowly this year as high interest rates and last year\u2019s inflation surge continue to take their toll on disposable incomes. The Bank of England has predicted that a lack of momentum in the economy means gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by only 0.5% this year. The Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 5.25% on Thursday but indicated it may begin cutting them from June. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cThere is no doubt it has been a difficult few years, but today\u2019s growth figures are proof that the economy is returning to full health for the first time since the pandemic.\u201d Speaking after a trip with Hunt to a Siemens factory near Oxford, Rishi Sunak said it would take time for people to \u201creally feel better\u201d. \u201cOf course there\u2019s more work to do,\u201d said the prime minister. \u201cAnd I get that. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m keen to stick to our plan and keep delivering for people. But I think today\u2019s figures show that we now have momentum.\u201d Hunt said the UK had the best outlook among European G7 countries over the next six years, \u201cwith wages growing faster than inflation, energy prices falling and tax cuts worth \u00a3900 to the average worker hitting bank accounts\u201d. However, apart from Germany, other eurozone countries avoided a recession last year. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said last week that the UK would be the worst performing economy in the G7 next year, as high interest rates and the lingering effects of last year\u2019s surge in inflation drag on growth. Responding to the first-quarter GDP numbers, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said it was a case of going \u201cfrom no growth to low growth\u201d. She said: \u201cThis is no time for Conservative ministers to be doing a victory lap and telling the British people that they have never had it so good. The economy is still \u00a3300 smaller per person than when Rishi Sunak became prime minister.\u201d The ONS said consumer spending and business investment recovered in the first quarter after declines across the second half of 2023. An increase in transport and storage services was the biggest driver of the 0.7% increase in the services sector. The boom in private healthcare and renewed activity in the NHS after a series of strikes last year were among the other factors pushing up services sector growth. Construction activity fell in response to a decline in housebuilding, while the manufacturing sector benefited from a recovery in car production. Textile factory output fell by 3.6% to register the sixth consecutive quarter fall. Energy production increased between January and March. However, the ONS said growth in this sector and manufacturing was partly offset by a fall of 2.4% in the output of activities associated with the big water companies, including sewage and waste management. Ruth Gregory, an economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the increase in GDP showed the economy had been recovering from last year\u2019s contraction with more strength and momentum than was previously understood. But she doubted the increase in GDP would prevent the Bank of England from making its first interest rate cut in the summer. \u201cAt this stage we doubt the recovery will be strong enough to prevent inflation from falling further and the Bank from cutting rates to 3% next year,\u201d she said. GDP per head is estimated to have increased by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2024, after seven consecutive quarters without positive growth. It is estimated, based on ONS projections of the UK\u2019s rising population, that GDP per head is 0.7% lower compared with the same quarter a year ago."

            "date": "2024-05-22T09:00:07Z",
            "content": "Nearly three in five Americans wrongly believe the US is in an economic recession, and the majority blame the Biden administration, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The survey found persistent pessimism about the economy as election day draws closer. The poll highlighted many misconceptions people have about the economy, including: 55% believe the economy is shrinking, and 56% think the US is experiencing a recession, though the broadest measure of the economy, gross domestic product (GDP), has been growing. 49% believe the S&amp;P 500 stock market index is down for the year, though the index went up about 24% in 2023 and is up more than 12% this year. 49% believe that unemployment is at a 50-year high, though the unemployment rate has been under 4%, a near 50-year low. Many Americans put the blame on Biden for the state of the economy, with 58% of those polled saying the economy is worsening due to mismanagement from the presidential administration. The poll underscored people\u2019s complicated emotions around inflation. The vast majority of respondents, 72%, indicated they think inflation is increasing. In reality, the rate of inflation has fallen sharply from its post-Covid peak of 9.1% and has been fluctuating between 3% and 4% a year. In April, the inflation rate went down from 3.5% to 3.4% \u2013 far from inflation\u2019s 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2013 triggering a stock market rally that pushed the Dow Jones index to a record high. A recession is generally defined by a decrease in economic activity, typically measured as gross domestic product (GDP), over two successive quarters, although in the US the National Bureau of Economic Research (NEBR) has the final say. US GDP has been rising over the last few years, barring a brief contraction in 2022, which the NEBR did not deem a recession. The only recent recession was in 2020, early in the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, the US economy has grown considerably. Unemployment has also hit historic lows, wages have been going up and consumer spending has been strong. But the road to recovery has been bumpy, largely because of inflation and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates to tamp down high prices. Despite previously suggesting the Fed could start lowering rates this year, Fed officials have recently indicated interest rates will remain elevated in the near future. While inflation has eased considerably since its peak in 2022, officials continue to say inflation remains high because it remains above the Fed\u2019s target of 2% a year. After a tumultuous ride of inflation and high interest rates, voters are uncertain about what\u2019s next. Consumer confidence fell to a six-month low in May. So even though economic data, like GDP, implies strength in the economy, there\u2019s a stubborn gap between the reality represented in that data \u2013 what economists use to gauge the economy\u2019s health \u2013 and the emotional reality that underlies how Americans feel about the economy. In the poll, 55% think the economy is only getting worse. Some have called the phenomenon a \u201cvibecession\u201d, a term first coined by the economics writer Kyla Scanlon to describe the widespread pessimism about the economy that defies statistics that show the economy is actually doing OK. While inflation has been down, prices are at a higher level compared with just a few years ago. And prices are still going up, just at a slower pace than at inflation\u2019s peak. Americans are clearly still reeling from price increases. In the poll, 70% of Americans said their biggest economic concern was the cost of living. About the same percentage of people, 68%, said that inflation was top of mind. The poll showed little change in Americans\u2019 economic outlook from a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian on the economy in September 2023. A similar percentage of respondents agreed \u201cit\u2019s difficult to be happy about positive economic news when I feel financially squeezed each month\u201d and that the economy was worse than the media made it out to be. Another thing that hasn\u2019t changed: views on the economy largely depend on which political party people belong to. Republicans were much more likely to report feeling down about the economy than Democrats. The vast majority of Republicans believe that the economy is shrinking, inflation is increasing and the economy is getting worse overall. A significant but smaller percentage of Democrats, less than 40%, believed the same. Unsurprisingly, more Republicans than Democrats believe the economy is worsening due to the mismanagement of the Biden administration. Something both Republicans and Democrats agree on: they don\u2019t know who to trust when it comes to learning about the economy. In both September and May, a majority of respondents \u2013 more than 60% \u2013 indicated skepticism over economic news. The economy continues to present a major challenge to Joe Biden in his re-election bid. Though he has tried to tout \u201cBidenomics\u201d, or his domestic economy record, including his $1.2tn bipartisan infrastructure bill from 2022, 70% of Republicans and 39% of Democrats seem to think he\u2019s making the economy worse. But it\u2019s not all bad news for Biden. Republican voters were slightly more optimistic about the lasting impacts of \u201cBidenomics\u201d than they were in the September Harris poll. Four in 10 Republicans, an 11 percentage-point increase from September, indicated they believe Bidenomics will have a positive lasting impact, while 81% of Democrats said the same. And three-quarters of everyone polled said they support at least one of the key pillars of Bidenomics, which include investments in infrastructure, hi-tech electronics manufacturing, clean-energy facilities and more union jobs. Yet even with these small strands of approval, pessimism about the overall economy is pervasive. It will be an uphill battle for Biden to convince voters to be more hopeful. \u201cWhat Americans are saying in this data is: \u2018Economists may say things are getting better, but we\u2019re not feeling it where I live,\u2019\u201d said John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll. \u201cUnwinding four years of uncertainty takes time. Leaders have to understand this and bring the public along.\u201d"

That\u2019s a gain of 52 points, or 0.6%, and means the blue-chip share index has racked up its third weekly gain in a row. It\u2019s been on quite the rally since mid-April. Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \u201cIt\u2019s Friday afternoon, the sun\u2019s out, and the FTSE 100 has closed at an all-time high \u2013 no this is not a dream. Investors are finally starting to look at UK businesses and see reasons to be optimistic. The Bank of England held rates steady earlier in the week but hinted at rate cuts to come. Meanwhile, economic growth came in better than expected, but crucially not too much better to drive up fears it could cause inflation to spike. This comes on the cusp of major UK banks reporting over the past couple of weeks, and there was a huge array of optimism from management teams around the outlook for the UK. Many will look at this run and assume it has no legs, UK investors have been beaten down too many times in the past. UK bulls will argue it\u2019s been long overdue, with the market suffering from a hefty valuation discount to global peers for some time. Next week\u2019s jobs and wages data will be key for momentum, markets will want to see continued signs that stickier elements of inflation are easing, or it\u2019ll raise fresh questions about if and when rate cuts might come.\u201d Time to recap\u2026. The UK is officially out of recession after figures showed the economy grew by 0.6% in the first three months of the year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the period from January to the end of March marked a return to growth after a mild recession in the second half of 2023. It was the strongest rate of quarterly growth since the end of 2021, and a better performance than expected by economists, who forecast growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. The downturn came to an end after an increase in activity across the services sector, which has flourished since the turn of the year as wages have outstripped inflation, easing the pressure on consumers. However, forecasters expect the UK to grow slowly this year as high interest rates and last year\u2019s inflation surge continue to take their toll on disposable incomes. The Bank of England has predicted that a lack of momentum in the economy means gross domestic product (GDP) will grow by only 0.5% this year. The Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 5.25% on Thursday but indicated it may begin cutting them from June. Economists broadly hailed the pick-up in growth, which suggests the UK economy may do better this year than expected. Here\u2019s the full story: And our analysis: Optimism over economic prospects, and hopes that interest rates will soon be cut, helped to push the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 to a new intraday high of 8455 points today \u2013 on track for another strong week. And in other news: Deutsche Bank has lifted its forecast for UK growth this year, saying: We now expect UK GDP to expand by 0.8% (previously: 0.5%), converging with the OBR\u2019s central projection, but sitting some way above consensus (0.3%) and the Bank of England\u2019s now slightly stale growth forecast (0.5%). We maintain our GDP growth projections for 2025 and 2026 at 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively (Figure 10). Over in the City of London today, Standard Chartered has been accused of being complicit in environmental destruction by environmental activists, at its annual general meeting. A group called the Climate Choir Movement sang a tune called \u201cFossil Fuels are Trouble\u201d, a reworking of Taylor Swift\u2019s hit \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d They say Standard Chartered is complicit in environment destruction and human rights violations in the Philippines and Mozambique. Here\u2019s a clip from the AGM: Jo Flanagan, co-founder of the Climate Choir Movement, says: \u201cLast year we sang at Barclays AGM. In March we occupied and sang in the Houses of Parliament. And today we say to Standard Chartered \u2018your standards are twisted\u2019. While they continue to invest in dirty gas and coal, global warming has exceeded temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius over a 12-month period. This is a dire warning to humanity \u2014 a warning that some bankers still do not seem to heed.\u201d Luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has reported its highest ever yearly sales and its biggest profit in nearly a decade. In a sign that JLR\u2019s customers are not cutting back, the auro maker has reported \u00a329bn revenues in the year to March, over a quarter higher than the previous year. This was driven by record sales of its Range Rover vehicles. Around 133,000 vehicles had been ordered at the end of the financial year, three quarters of which were for Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Defender models. The group\u2019s pre-tax profit hit \u00a32.2bn, the highest amount since 2015, it said. Customers clearly weren\u2019t put off by a wave of thefts of Range Rovers, which has pushed up the cost of insuring the cars. Inded, JLR reports that there is strong interest in its Range Rover Electric, with over 28,700 sign ups to the waiting list since opening in December 2023. With less than 90 minutes trading to do, the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 share index is on track to post its second-best week of the year. It\u2019s gained around 2.8% this week, rising to a new alltime high of 8,455 points today, its best weekly gain since a fortnight ago. George Lagarias, chief economist at Mazars, sees plenty of positive signs from UK large caps (companies with a high market capitalisation), saying: For one, the rally was broad-based, with only a handful of stocks underperforming. Even more important, the outperformers centred largely around the consumer discretionary sector. Following this morning\u2019s positive Q1 GDP print, on the back of a strong services sector, the stock market seems even more confident that British consumers will manage to bring the UK economy back towards trend growth.\u201d Today\u2019s UK GDP report shows that the economy is \u201cfinally catchig up a bit\u201d, says Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. Schmieding explains: After years of self-inflicted Brexit turmoil, the UK economy can \u2013 from a somewhat depressed level \u2013 expand at a pace at least in line with that of its biggest trading partner, the Eurozone. The solid gain in GDP reduces the need for an immediate rate cut. Schmieding adds that the UK economy has underperformed the US and the Eurozone since the start of the pandemic, telling clients: The slump in 2020 was deeper and the subsequent recovery levelled off in 2022 even more so than in the Eurozone in the wake of the surge in energy and food prices. The strong Q1 GDP data partly correct an unexpectedly weak finish to 2023 Richard Walker, the executive chairman of Iceland Foods, says it is \u201cimmeasurably wrong\u201d of the government to tell people to be grateful the recession is over. Speaking to Radio 4\u2019s The World At One, Walker explains that consumers are still suffering from the cost of living squeeze, even though the economy is growing. Walker \u2013 who quit the Conservatives last October \u2013 says: My customers are still paying the price of the Truss calamity. Inflation is still baked in and day-to-day living expenses are still very much affected. We\u2019ve had years of price rises now, and people do feel worse off, because they are. Walker adds that Iceland recently conducted a survey of 4,000 customers \u2013 it found that 94% said conditions are not getting any better. Many cited sub-par public services and unaffortable childcare. He adds: I think it\u2019s immeasurably wrong of the government to tell people to feel grateful that we\u2019ve exited recession. Rishi Sunak has insisted that \u201cthings are starting to feel better\u201d and that confidence in the economy is growing after the UK economy moved out of recession, PA Media report. On a visit to Siemens Healthineers factory in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, Sunak claimed that the Government\u2019s economic plan was working. Sunak told Siemens workers: \u201cAfter undoubtedly a difficult couple of years that the country has had, actually now things are starting to feel better. \u201cConfidence is returning to the economy and the country, and I hope that you\u2019re starting to feel that too.\u201d Sunak, and chancellor Jeremy Hunt, were shown Siemans machines at the factory and given a demonstration of the magnet technology being developed at Eynsham. The UK economy is likely to keep growing at a decent pace during the current quarter, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). They are predicting GDP will rise by 0.6% in April-June, matching the forecast-beating 0.6% expansion reported in January-March this morning. NIESR say: The fact that the UK\u2019s GDP growth transitioned into positive territory after experiencing the shallow recession in the second half of 2023 is encouraging. However, the UK economy has largely flatlined following the initial stages of post-pandemic recovery. To escape the low-growth trend into a new and sustained era of high output growth requires structural changes and public investment. We expect that monthly GDP will continue its momentum in April, growing by 0.1 per cent relative to March, driven by growth mainly in services and production, particularly Agriculture. Indeed, the S&amp;P Global/CIPS UK services PMI reported an optimistic balance of 55.0 in April up from 53.1 in March. In line with this positive sentiment, we now forecast GDP to grow by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2024, mainly driven by services sectors. The European Central Bank is poised to start cutting its key interest rates next month, the record of their last meeting show. The minutes of the ECB\u2019s April meeting, where it left borrowing costs on hold, have been released \u2013 and show that policymakers were more confident that the \u201cdisinflationary process\u201d was continuing. This indicates that the ECB\u2019s governing council could vote for a rate cut next month, if new economic forecasts suggest inflation is indeed falling. The minute say: Members concurred that the most recent information had broadly confirmed the March staff projections, thus increasing their confidence that the disinflationary process was continuing At the same time, important new data \u2013 including new staff projections \u2013 would be released ahead of the June meeting, allowing the Governing Council to make a more comprehensive assessment. While progress had been seen, monitoring the triangle between wages, productivity growth and profits continued to be key. It was seen as plausible that the Governing Council would be in a position to start easing monetary policy restriction at the June meeting if additional evidence received by then confirmed the medium-term inflation outlook embedded in the March projections. Huw Pill also declines to say whether he was at the dovish, or hawkish, range of the seven MPC policymakers who voted to hold interest rates at 5.25% this week. Pill says the Monetary Policy Committee contains a healthy range of views, which are expressed fully and richly \u2013 a strength of the UK central bank, he explains. Pill also suggests it won\u2019t be hard to find out where he lies on the hawk-dove range\u2026. [the other six policymakers who voted for no change include governor Andrew Bailey, who was dropping dovish hints yesterday that rates might fall faster than expected. But noted hawks include Catherine Mann and Jonathan Haskel, who earlier this year both wanted to raise rates higher]. BoE chief economist Huw Pill also cautions that the Bank\u2019s medium-term inflation forecasts don\u2019t necessarily give a signal on rate moves at the next meeting (in June) or the one after (in August). Those forecasts suggest inflation will be below target at the end of the Bank\u2019s forecast horizon. Pill also refuses to be lured by a question on the impact of the upcoming UK election. He tells the Bank\u2019s agents that the central bank is independent, and makes its decisions without political influence. It\u2019s forecasts are conditional on the announced policy of the government of the day, he adds. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, is briefing the Bank\u2019s agents now following yesterday\u2019s interest rate decision. Pill says the Bank has sent a \u201crelatively clear signal\u201d that it is comforted by recent falls in inflation, which do raise the prospect of reducing the amount of restrictive monetary policy in the system. But, if rates are to be cut, there needs to be sufficient evidence that the downward path of inflation is strong enough to justify it, Pill says. Pill explains that he is focused on the underlying components of inflation, not the headline rate \u2013 which dropped to 3.2% per year in March. He also suggests it\u2019s \u201ca little ill-advised\u201d to just focus on the June meeting \u2013 reminding agents that governor Andrew Bailey said yesterday a June rate cut was neither ruled out nor a fait accompli. Will Britain\u2019s strong recovery deter the Bank of England from cutting interest rates? Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at Axa, thinks not \u2013 and is expecting the first cut next month. Following today\u2019s GDP report, Dickens told clients: More broadly, the recovery was the result of stronger households\u2019 spending amid the recovery in real incomes and stronger demand underpinning a rebound in the manufacturing sector. Momentum is strong, and the composite Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index remains consistent with growth of around 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in Q2. We have revised up our 2024 GDP forecast to 0.6%, from 0.4%. For now, we think the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee will largely look through the strength in activity, as long as inflation and labour market data evolve as it expects. We continue to forecast the first rate cut in June. The Bank should be focused on inflation, rather than GDP, as it\u2019s mandate is to get CPI to 2% in the medium term. Yesterday, its latest forecasts showed that CPI inflation is on track to fall to 1.6% in three years, based on the current market path of interest rates (suggesting rates may need to fall faster than expected\u2026). The first quarterly expansion in a year. Recession receding into the rear-view mirror. A stronger performance in recent months than the Bank of England and the City had thought likely. Faster growth in early 2024 than any other member of the G7 group of leading industrial nations. When you are in as deep a political hole as the current government you seize on any good news, and there was plenty for Jeremy Hunt to choose from in the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The figures were proof that the economy was returning to \u201cfull health for the first time since the pandemic\u201d, the chancellor said. Yet when people look back on the early months of 2024 they will probably remember the relentlessly awful weather rather than a time when the economy was cooking with gas. Boom-boom Britain it certainly isn\u2019t. To be sure, the UK has emerged from recession but the downturn in the second half of 2023 was a much more modest affair than some of the monster downturns of the past 50 years. The hollowing out of manufacturing in the early 1980s was a genuine slump, as was the housing market crash in the early 1990s and the near collapse of the banks in the global financial crisis of 2008. The bigger picture is that Britain\u2019s growth performance during the current parliament has been extremely weak\u2026.. More here: City economists are likely to upgrade their forecasts for UK growth during 2024, following this morning\u2019s news of 0.6% growth in January-March. As Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway points out, this is a welcome return to \u2018trend growth\u2019 Simon French of Panmure Gordon predicts this will trigger some growth upgrades: With independent consensus for UK growth of 0.4% in 2024 - we are at 1.2% YoY - then Q1 24 growth of 0.6% means that economist upgrades will [begrudgingly] emerge over the coming days. James Smith of ING suspects growth will only be slightly slower in the April-June quarter: The bottom line is that the economy is entering a brighter period. The timing of the March bounce provides a nice starting point for the second quarter, where growth could easily come in at 0.4% or 0.5%. Professor Costas Milas, of the University of Liverpool, has crunched the data, and tells us: Today\u2019s first estimate of 0.2%, q-on-q4 growth for 2024Q1 is higher than yesterday\u2019s estimate of -0.1% produced by the Bank of England. This will create a momentum effect which is bound to lift next quarter\u2019s growth from q-on-q4 growth of 0% (as estimated by the BoE) to something considerably higher. Whether this momentum effect is able to generate additional inflation remains to be seen. As things stand, it is more likely than not that the Bank\u2019s MPC will keep interest rates on hold in June. Needless to say, things might change until then! The stock market rally in London today has helped to lift the pan-European Stoxx 600 share index to a new alltime high. Hopes of interest rate cuts in the eurozone in June, and a strong earnings season, are both lifting shares. In Paris, the French CAC 40 has also hit a fresh record high this morning too (jumping 0.8% to 8256 points). The broad picture is that the UK economy is entering a period of stronger growth, says ING developed markets economist James Smith: \u201cThe UK economy powered out of its technical recession in the first quarter, judging by the initial GDP figures released today. The economy expanded by a whopping 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Admittedly the data underlying that number has been pretty volatile. Some caution should be taken when interpreting these figures, just like the weaker numbers at the end of last year. Still, it tallies with other economic indicators which suggest the economy is entering a period of stronger growth. The purchasing managers indices are the most obvious example, and these are consistent with continued momentum in the second quarter. Even here though, there is some debate over whether the numbers are being artificially boosted by \u201cresidual seasonality\u201d (i.e., not properly adjusting for seasonal trends after the pandemic). The 2023 drop in GDP, now consigned to history, is the third UK recession in 16 years. The contraction in the third-and fourth quarter of last year follows the slump in the first half of 2020 during Covid-19 lockdowns, and the contraction from spring 2008 to summer 2009 during the financial crisis. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, says the recent frequency of recessions is a concern. \u201cThe UK swiftly exited its latest recession in 2024 with the strongest economic growth since late 2021. \u201cBut the wider backdrop is still worrying. Britain is falling into recession twice as frequently as it did in the second of the 20th century, and it remains a stagnation nation. These all-too regular shocks and slumps in between are reducing living standards and straining the public finances. \u201cThe battle of ideas on how to change this record should be key during the election campaign.\u201d The odds of the Bank of England cutting interest rates next month have narrowed this morning. The money markets indicate that a June rate cut, to 5%, is now a 48% chance, while there\u2019s a 52% possibility that the BoE holds rates at 5.25%. Yesterday, the decision was almost a coin-toss too, with a 55% chance of no-change in June. On Thursday the BoE left rates on hold, with two policymakers voting for a cut but seven choosing not to ease policy. Derek Halpenny, head of research for global markets at financial group Mitsubishi UFJ, says the BoE is inching toward a June rate cut He told clients: Most of the key guidance comments from [governor Andrew] Bailey and [deputy governor Ben] Broadbent in the press conference and again from Bailey in a Bloomberg TV interview after the press conference were clear in signalling rate cuts are coming. Mostly notable was Bailey\u2019s Comment that the monetary stance would \u201clikely\u201d need to be made less restrictive and \u201cpossibly more so than currently priced into market rates\u201d. That comment really couldn\u2019t be much clearer in signalling where the bias is shifting within the MPC and in our view strengthens the prospect of a June cut. High interest rates are likely to weigh on growth this year, even if we do get the two quarter-point cuts which markets expect. Moody\u2019s Analytics senior economist David Muir explains: \u201cWith inflation moderating, the Bank of England is signalling that a rate cut is on the cards for the summer. But first the Monetary Policy Committee needs further evidence that wage growth and price pressures within services are easing sufficiently. If that evidence builds quickly, a rate cut could come as soon as June, but we think August is the more likely date. That said, even as rates are lowered, they will remain a constraint on the pace of economic growth through this year.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is arguing that the UK\u2019s GDP growth shows that the Government\u2019s decisions are paying off. He told Sky News this morning: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that inflation is falling faster and I think people recognise it has been a very, very challenging period but they don\u2019t vote for Conservative governments for us to do popular things, they trust is to do the right thing for the long-term benefit of the economy.\u201d He told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that families who have been through \u201ca really tough time\u201d can see that the \u201cvery difficult decisions\u201d taken to get the economy back on its feet after the pandemic and the energ shock\u201d are working. Hunt also claims that the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects are strong \u2013 citing IMF forecasts for faster growth than France, Italy, Germany or Japan over the next six years. Hunt also disputed that the Conservative\u2019s reputation for economic competence had been crushed by Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. Hunt, who replaced Kwasi Kwarteng after the markets reacted very badly to the Truss administration\u2019s package of unfunded tax cuts, concedes that mistakes were made, but that he corrected them within weeks. Hunt says: When interest rates and the prices people pay for mortgages have gone up all across the developed world following the energy shock caused by the invasion of Ukraine, it\u2019s just wrong to attribute that to the mini-budget. Hunt also predicted that mortgage rates are likely to start to fall, as inflation drops towards the UK\u2019s 2% target \u2013 which could allow the Bank of England to lower interest rates. Is Hunt right, though, that the mini-budget shouldn\u2019t take the blame for the UK\u2019s mortgage shock? It is true that morgage rates have risen in the US, and in the eurozone, as central banks have tightened monetary policy by raising interest rates. Looking back, the mini-budget triggered a massive selloff in government bonds \u2013 forcing the Bank of England to launch emergency action to halt a run on Britain\u2019s pension funds. More than two-fifths of Britain\u2019s mortgage deals were withdrawn in the week after the mini-budget, as lenders rushed to reprice them, higher. UK mortgage rates did fall in 2023, as the shock of the mini-budget subsided, but have been rising in recent weeks on concerns that interest rates might not be cut as soon as hoped (although the BoE suggested yesterday it could cut faster than expected). So, even if the Truss shock has now dissipated, some unlucky mortage-holders who had to refinance their loan shortly after the mini-budget ended up paying much more\u2026 Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index has soared to another all-time high in early trading in London, amid relief that the UK\u2019s recession is over. The FTSE 100 index has jumped over the 8400 point mark for the first time, hitting a new intraday high of 8425 points \u2013 up 45 points this morning. Mobile network operator Vodafone is the top riser, up 2%, after the UK cabinet office conditionally approved its merger with rival Three (although the competition authorities are yet to give their ruling). Mining companies are also in the top risers, along with luxury goods maker Burberry (+1.7%), airline easyJet (+1.4%) and housebuilder Berkeley (+1.3%) Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, says today\u2019s growth report is lifting confidence: The 0.6% growth registered in the first three months of the year was higher than forecast, with the green shoots seen in January and February flowering into a stronger growth spurt in March. Confidence breeds more optimism, and with the economy showing signs of repairing and the FTSE 100 rallying higher, the glass half full sentiment is settling in. The blue-chip index has powered higher in early trade and set fresh records, after a sheen of positivity has descended on the UK. The FTSE 100 has been on a strong rally since mid-April, and is on track for its third weekly rise in a row. It\u2019s gained almost 9% so far this year. Hopes that the economy was strengthening, and that interest rates will be cut this year, have both pushed up share values in London in recent weeks. However, the FTSE 100 isn\u2019t really a barometer of the strength of the UK economy, rather it is an outward-looking index comprising largely of multinational conglomerates. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says: \u201cAfter the FTSE 100 hit a record high for the fourth straight session on Thursday, the UK index has opened higher yet again and is potentially on track to close at another all-time high. Shares in Anglo American are up on a report that Rio Tinto also considered a bid following BHP\u2019s rejected offer. M&amp;A speculation is helping to keep Anglo shares supported at the moment. The UK has grown faster than many of its major rivals at the start of this year, as it emerged from recession. The 0.6% growth recorded in January-March is faster than the US, where GDP rose by 0.4%, Germany (+0.2%), France (+0.2%) or Italy (+0.3%). Out of the remaining G7 nations, Canada is estimated to have also grown by 0.6% in Q1, while economists predict Japan will have grown by 0.2%. Since the pandemic, the UK is one of the slower-growing economies, today\u2019s GDP report shows: Although Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon, reports that the UK is in bronze medal position since 2016: Britain\u2019s \u201cliving standards recession\u201d is also, finally, over, after a two year squeeze. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that real GDP per head is estimated to have increased by 0.4% in the first quarter. This measure of GDP per capita divides UK GDP by the total UK population, to get a more accurate view of how living standards are changing. GDP per head had fallen steadily through 2023, and indeed hadn\u2019t grown for seven quarters in a row. Even after rising by 0.4% in January-March, GDP per head is estimated to be 0.7% lower than a year ago. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says: \u201cThe UK economy has stopped shrinking. But one quarter of decent growth won\u2019t make up for 14 years of lost living standards. The Tories are still presiding over the worst period for economic stagnation and livelihoods in modern history. Real wages are worth less than in 2008 and working people will end this parliament worse off than at the start. Workers would be over \u00a310,000 richer if pay had kept pace with its pre-crisis trend. The Conservatives have succeeded only in making families poorer.\u201d City experts are welcoming the news that Britain\u2019s economy has returned to growth. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, hopes that the UK\u2019s economic stagnation will subside this year: \u201cWith interest rate cuts seemingly pencilled in for the summer, the good news continues to flow for the UK as today\u2019s data shows the UK is out of recession. The first quarter saw GDP grow by 0.6%, better than expected, as inflation has eased and the worst of the cost-of-living crisis is behind us. The increase in GDP has primarily been driven by the UK\u2019s strong services sector, which it has come to rely on in recent years to help push the economy forward. \u201cWhile growth remains fairly lacklustre compared to the likes of the US, this data shows this should be the year that economic stagnation subsides in the UK and the economy returns to consistent, if unspectacular, growth. It is the unspectacular nature of the growth, however, that is likely to be focus. While the very shallow and short recession appears over, there is a clamour for interest rate cuts to begin in order to stimulate growth and get business moving again. Markets await the first interest rate cut with bated breath, so it will be interesting to see the economic reaction once those rate cuts begin feeding through. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, believes the worst is over, and that there will be continued growth for the rest of this year. Falling inflation and real pay increases should help repair some of the damage to household incomes and support households\u2019 consumption. Growth prospects have also improved in Europe, which could spur a recovery in exports. \u201cDespite the better near-term outlook, the improvement in GDP growth looks likely to be constrained by the ongoing weakness in productivity growth as well as reduced scope to increase employment levels. This could see annual GDP growth in the region of just 1% per year in the medium term. \u201cUK GDP grew by 0.4% in March, supported by a rise in services output which grew by 0.5%. Forward looking indicators point to further momentum in the coming months, consistent with our view that the worst is behind the UK economy.\u201d But\u2026 Suren Thiru, economics director of ICAEW, says the end of the recesion is a \u201crather hollow victory\u201d, which could encourage the Bank of England to keep interest rates high for longer\u2026 \u201cThese figures confirm an easy exit from the shallowest of recessions for the UK, as lower inflation helped return the economy to growth in the first quarter. The UK\u2019s escape from recession is a rather hollow victory because the big picture remains one of an economy struggling with stagnation, as poor productivity and high economic inactivity limits our growth potential. The economy could struggle to kick on further in the second quarter as the boost to people\u2019s incomes from weaker inflation is partly curtailed by renewed caution to spend and invest, amid higher unemployment and ongoing political uncertainty. The strong exit from recession may inadvertently keep UK interest rates higher for longer by giving those policymakers still worried about underlying inflationary pressures enough comfort on economic conditions to continue putting off cutting rates.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has posted that it\u2019s \u2018time for change\u2019. Following this morning\u2019s GDP report, Reeves says: From no growth to low growth - is that really the scale of the Conservatives\u2019 ambitions? Food prices are still high, families are paying more on their monthly mortgage bills and working people are worse off. Although most of the economy grew in the last quarter, there are some warning lights flashing in the construction sector. Construction output fell by 0.9% in January-March, for the second quarter in a row. That means construction is in recession; output is 0.7% lower than the same quarter a year ago. The fall reflects a decline in new work of 1.8% driven by private commercial new work, which fell by 5.3%. However, repair and maintenance increased 0.3%, which the ONS says may be due to housing associations re-directing their budgets towards repairs and upgrading \u201cto deal with problems such as damp arising from tenants using less heating because of the higher cost of living\u201d. Wet weather this year also dampened construction activity, as the swathe of storms kept workers off building sites. Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, says: Construction remains the one area of weakness, particularly in the commercial sector. That\u2019s no surprise. Real estate is particularly exposed to the effect of higher interest rates, and the upheaval of the pandemic is still rocking the office and retail sector - with increased home working and online shopping permanently changing demand. That\u2019s not a trend that\u2019s unique to the UK. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has hailed the news that Britain\u2019s recession is over, saying: \u201cThere is no doubt it has been a difficult few years, but today\u2019s growth figures are proof that the economy is returning to full health for the first time since the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re growing this year and have the best outlook among European G7 countries over the next six years, with wages growing faster than inflation, energy prices falling and tax cuts worth \u00a3900 to the average worker hitting bank accounts.\u201d I hate to burst the chancellor\u2019s bubble, but the UK is also expected to be the worst-performing economy in the G7 next year. Still, these forecasts are there to be beaten\u2026. ONS director of economic statistics Liz McKeown has told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the 0.6% growth recorded in the last quarter is stronger than people expected. Compared to recent figures, we last saw growth this strong in the last quarter of 2021, McKeown explains. McKeown pointed to the pick-up in service sector growth, but also pointed out that construction shrank \u2013 due to a decline in new work. McKeown says: \u201cAfter two quarters of contraction, the UK economy returned to positive growth in the first three months of this year. \u201cThere was broad-based strength across the service industries with retail, public transport and haulage, and health all performing well. Car manufacturers also had a good quarter. These were only a little offset by another weak quarter for construction. \u201cIn the month of March the economy grew robustly led, again, by services with wholesalers, the health sector and hospitality all doing well.\u201d Growth in March alone was also stronger than expected. GDP rose by 0.4% in March, the ONS reports, beating City forecasts for 0.1% growth. The services sector had a good month, growing by 0.5% in March, while production output grew by 0.2%. Construction output fell by 0.4% in the month, though. February\u2019s GDP data has been revised higher too, to show growth of 0.2% (up from 0.1% first estimated). Newsflash: The UK\u2019s short, shallow, recession is over. The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the first quarter of this year, the Office for National Statistics has reported. That\u2019s stronger growth than expected. The ONS says the recovery was driven by the services sector, and industry: In output terms, services grew by 0.7% on the quarter with widespread growth across the sector; elsewhere the production sector grew by 0.8% while the construction sector fell by 0.9%. In expenditure terms, there were increases in the volume of net trade, household spending and government spending, partially offset by falls in gross capital formation. This rise in GDP means that the economy is no longer in a technical recession, after activity fell in the third and fourth quarters of last year. GDP is the standard measure of economic activity, but it has its critics too. It tracks what\u2019s happening across the economy, but does not distinguish between harmful and beneficial activity. Back in 1968, US presidential candidate Bobby Kennedy issued a magisterial rebuke, saying GDP \u2018measures everything except that which is worthwhile\u2019. Kennedy told the University of Kansas: It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman\u2019s rifle and Speck\u2019s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. You can hear the speech here; and here: In order to measure GDP, statisticians use three approaches: measuring the total value of goods and services produced; the total amount spent in the economy, and the total amount of income from profits and wages. All three methods should, in theory, give the same number. The Bank of England is confident that the UK recession has ended. Yesterday, the BoE said UK GDP is expected to have risen by 0.4% in the first quarter of this year, explaining: UK GDP growth had strengthened since the start of the year, reversing the fall in output that was estimated to have occurred in the second half of 2023. The [Monetary Policy] Committee expected the recovery in output to be underpinned by a pickup in household consumption, supported by higher real incomes. Good morning. We\u2019re about to discover if Britain\u2019s economy has clambered out of recession. New gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the first three months of this year are released at 7am, and City economists are hopeful that the economy expanded in the quarter. If so, that would mean that the shallow recession that began in the second half of last year has ended. A technical recession, in City jargon, is at least two quarterly falls in GDP in a row. As things stand (and data are often revised\u2026) the UK economy shrank by 0.1% in July-September 2023, and then by 0.3% in October-December as consumer spending slumped, triggering the technical recession declared earlier this year. Analysts are expecting to learn that UK GDP rose by around 0.4% in the January to March quarter, which would consign the recession to history. Recent falls in inflation, and hopes that interest rates will be cut this summer, are supporting the economy. Previous data has shown that GDP rose by 0.1% in February, and 0.3% in January. Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief UK economist, Sanjay Raja, says: The UK economy likely shrugged off the short and marginal technical recession it fell into last year. After contracting by 0.3% q-o-q in Q4-23, we expect the economy to bounce back, expanding by 0.4% q-o-q in Q1-24 with March GDP rising by 0.1% m-o-m. What\u2019s driving the recovery? In short, some positive payback with household spending bouncing back to start the year. Government investment too will have likely supported GDP through the first quarter. And we think some build up in inventories will have also helped push GDP higher in Q1-24. In short, we expect Q1-24 to signal a sustained recovery back to trend growth. Where to now? We expect 2024 GDP to expand by 0.5%. There are some upside risks to our projection, given the continued strength of business activity data.

            "date": "2024-05-08T15:00:17Z",
            "content": "It seems that some people really want a recession. The estimates of inflation not falling below 3% until the end of next year has led some commentators to demand higher rates as though there is an ability to have inflation drop quickly while at the same time delivering the hoped for economic \u201csoft landing\u201d. After the RBA\u2019s decision on Tuesday to keep rates steady, you would be forgiven for thinking that a rate rise is imminent. Other than Peter Hannam, who maintained a level of calm, some media organisations were suggesting rate rises are now much more likely and that there is a sense of doom ahead for inflation. It might therefore be somewhat surprising to be told that the market\u2019s expectations for a rate rise are actually lower now than before the RBA\u2019s decision on Tuesday. A month ago, I suggested that it was unlikely we would see a rate cut soon. Back then the market was still predicting rate cuts this year; now they are not. Cuts are on the horizon, but probably not until next year: If the graph does not display click here This is not what those who believe rates need to rise want to hear. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Judo Bank chief economic adviser Warren Hogan has, for example, called for higher interest rates \u2013 as high as 5.1%. Hogan last year commented on a scenario in which the then newly appointed RBA governor, Michele Bullock, \u201cmust lead the bank in taking the cash rate to a level that will drive Australia into a disruptive recession\u201d. Meanwhile, one academic bizarrely suggested Australians should stop buying things in order to \u201cdrive the nation into a short, sharp recession\u201d. Calling for a short recession for the good of the economy is a bit like calling for a small war to teach another country a lesson. They never end up being small or short and the people calling for them invariably know they will not have to suffer. It\u2019s why the past year has focused around the desire for a \u201csoft landing\u201d. This essentially involves shifting from rising inflation to low, steady inflation without a recession, and without significant rises in unemployment. In essence we want to avoid what happened in the 1990s, when killing inflation involved destroying the economy. Generally, you want to avoid replicating the 1990s experiences, and yet inflation is falling pretty much in line with the pace of the falls during 1990-1992: If the graph does not display click here The 1990s was a stark lesson to anyone thinking we can just fine-tune inflation without having to worry about going too far. One of the oft-forgotten aspects of the 1990s recession is that when inflation was falling the RBA was madly cutting rates in a desperate (and failed) attempt to prevent a recession: If the graph does not display click here Throughout 1990, 1991 and 1992 the real problem wasn\u2019t slowing inflation but trying to stave off a deep recession. It failed. Inflation, rather than reaching 3% and realising \u2013 as though through osmosis \u2013 that it should stabilise, just kept dropping \u2013 hitting 0.3% at the end of 1992. The RBA at this point was cutting rates in the hope of raising inflation because inflation below 2% is hardly the sign of a strong economy (something we experienced from 2014-2019 when the RBA kept cutting rates in an attempt to get the economy going). There has been some commentary that the RBA has never before failed to raise rates when inflation has been this high. The problem with that history is that similarly the RBA has never raised rates before when the economy has been this weak. In November, when the RBA raised rates to 4.35%, GDP per capita fell 1%. Prior to last year, the slowest the economy had grown at a time the RBA raised rates was in June 2010 after the GFC. At that point GDP per capita was growing at 0.6% \u2013 a pace that is historically weak, but which is faster than Australia\u2019s economy has grown for nearly 18 months: If the graph does not display click here And is the economy about to rebound? Well, no. The latest statement on monetary policy issued by the Reserve Bank on Tuesday showed the second lot of downgrades for economic growth since it last raised rates in November: If the graph does not display click here Bullock in her press conference on Tuesday afternoon was also very careful to note that, while we do have historically low unemployment, many people are struggling. This was made clear by the weak retail trade figures released on Tuesday, which showed that the volume of retail trade fell for the fifth quarter out of the past six. If the graph does not display click here And while unemployment remains low, most economists believe wage growth has peaked. Certainly, the average wage growth obtained through enterprise bargaining agreements shows no signs of wages growing faster than last year: If the graph does not display click here We might be experiencing low unemployment and have avoided a recession despite very fast rising interest rates, but households are letting the government and the Reserve Bank know that they are feeling the pain. They are not spending money in a manner that would suggest there is a strong level of demand in the economy. Wages are also not rising at a speed that would suggest we are about to embark on the mythical \u201cwage-price spiral\u201d. Those calling for higher interest rates and for a faster drop in inflation should read about the 1990s recession and not cheer for that experience to be visited upon us again. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work"

At least 15 UK campuses have joined in the protests and, in a joint statement by the Oxford and Cambridge University and College Union branches, campaigners have said that they refuse to accept their universities\u2019 complicity in Israel\u2019s attacks on the Palestinian people. The students are on the right side of history, and governments will need to listen to demands from some for disinvestment in companies sustaining Israel\u2019s tyranny. People have a right to know why their supposedly democratic governments and professed upholders of human rights, international law and the rules-based order are not only failing to uphold them but are undermining them by their support of Israel.

They are doing what their elders are demonstrably not doing. They are showing compassion despite being misrepresented as attention-seekers by the rightwing press and governments, despite the risk of arrest, and despite the disruption to their studies. These are highly moral human beings representing the conscience sadly missing in their president, who courts popularity with both the Arab and Jewish diasporas, who meekly accepts the contempt of Israel\u2019s prime minister whose behaviour he fails to condemn, and continues to supply weapons, which create the misery that he tries to assuage only by advocating an increase in aid supplies to Gaza.

            "date": "2024-05-22T16:50:44Z",
            "content": "Democrats from two powerful committees are urging Joe Biden\u2019s justice department to investigate the fossil fuel industry over its decades-long attempts to sow doubt about the climate crisis. \u201cWe believe that there is adequate evidence that fossil fuel industry companies and trade associations may have violated one or more federal statutes,\u201d the Senate budget committee chair, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, wrote in a Wednesday letter to the attorney general, Merrick Garland. The letter follows a multi-year joint investigation into the oil industry by the two committees, launched in 2021 by the House oversight committee, which was disbanded when Republicans took control of the chamber in 2022. \u201cFossil fuel companies do not dispute any longer that they had known for more than 60 years that burning fossil fuels causes climate change,\u201d Raskin told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cAnd yet they\u2019ve worked for decades to undermine public understanding of that fact.\u201d The Department of Justice declined to comment. Late last month, the lawmakers released a report on the sector\u2019s history of climate misinformation, based on a tranche of subpoenaed documents from Exxon, Shell, BP, Chevron and the lobbying organizations the American Petroleum Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce. These firms have worked together to mislead the public about the planet-warming nature of fossil fuels, the report said. Though they frequently made public commitments to slash their emissions, invest in carbon-free energy and take on the climate crisis, they privately sought to defend their fossil fuel-heavy business models, including by obfuscating the dangers of gas. In recent years, the report said, the sector has stopped denying the existence of climate change outright in favor of a more sophisticated strategy of \u201cdeception, disinformation and doublespeak\u201d. \u201cThe goal is the same: deceive the public to stop real limits on fossil fuel production, and increase profits,\u201d Whitehouse said at Wednesday\u2019s press conference. The evidence, the lawmakers wrote, \u201ccalls to mind the historic congressional investigation into deceptive practices of the tobacco industry and its trade associations, which led to investigations and litigation by several state attorneys general and the Department of Justice\u201d. Sharon Eubanks, who served as lead counsel on behalf of the US in the successful 2005 federal lawsuit against big tobacco, has made the same comparison. At a Senate budget committee hearing earlier this month focused on the investigation, she too said the US could reasonably take legal action against the oil industry. \u201cThere is certainly an adequate legal foundation for litigation against this industry and individuals and as groups,\u201d Eubanks testified at the hearing. \u201cWe should not waste any time wringing our hands.\u201d Cassidy DiPaola, communications director for the Make Polluters Pay campaign, which focuses on climate accountability, said a justice department investigation into the sector would probably require companies to turn over additional documents, and for executives to testify about their behavior and business models. It could also uncover new information about the role of \u201ctrade associations, public relations firms and other third parties\u201d in the efforts to \u201cshape public opinion on climate change\u201d, she said. \u201cThe fossil fuel industry has operated under a cloud of suspicion for many years,\u201d said DiPaola, who supports the lawmakers\u2019 efforts. \u201cA DoJ investigation could help clear the air and establish the facts about the industry\u2019s climate deception. The public deserves to know the truth.\u201d Last week, Raskin launched a House oversight investigation into nine oil companies after Donald Trump reportedly offered to dismantle Biden\u2019s environmental rules for their benefit, and requested $1bn in contributions to his presidential campaign. Whitehouse has also expressed interest in formally investigating the meeting. \u201cTrump\u2019s offer of a blatant quid pro quo to oil executives is practically an invitation to ask questions about big oil\u2019s political corruption and manipulation,\u201d he said last week. Lawmakers have pushed the Department of Justice to investigate big oil for years. Last July, the Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal and California representative Ted Lieu, both Democrats, sent a plea to the agency, signed by 20 members of Congress. Days later, the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders sent another missive to Garland, calling for the department to not only launch an investigation, but also bring lawsuits against the industry."

            "date": "2024-05-21T12:00:03Z",
            "content": "US gas utilities are partnering with one of the nation\u2019s most trusted non-profits as part of a \u201ccynical PR stunt\u201d to combat efforts to curb fossil fuel usage, a Guardian investigation has found. Local Habitat for Humanity affiliates have teamed up with at least four utilities across 10 states to build \u201czero-net energy homes\u201d, which are meant to produce more energy than they use. The houses, which are sold at affordable rates to low-income families, are weatherized and meticulously insulated to boost efficiency and equipped with rooftop solar panels. But they also come with appliances powered by gas, a planet-heating fossil fuel that has been shown to degrade indoor air quality. The utilities say the homes provide lower electricity bills and affordable mortgages for vulnerable families. \u201cIt\u2019s part of our culture to really give back to the communities that we serve,\u201d Jennifer Altieri, vice-president of public affairs for Atmos Energy\u2019s Colorado-Kansas division, said in a video announcing the utility\u2019s first Habitat home in Evans, Colorado, in September 2021, which was provided to a single mother and her children. Yet Atmos has privately described the project as something closer to a public relations tactic, intentionally launched in a state that is \u201con the frontlines\u201d of attempts to quell reliance on gas. Atmos has since expanded the Habitat partnerships to seven communities, with plans to launch similar initiatives in at least two more. National Fuel in the north-east, SoCal Gas in southern California, and Nicor in Illinois have also partnered with Habitat on zero-net energy (ZNE) projects. The moves by utilities to attach themselves to social justice causes come as the US is embroiled in a broader political culture war over federal, state and local attempts to phase out gas and make new buildings electric. The projects by Atmos and others have won widespread praise from gas interest groups. An autumn 2022 feature in Southeast Gas\u2019s magazine Natural Living says the Atmos-Habitat partnerships promote \u201chealthy living\u201d, and that same year, its Evans, Colorado, home was a finalist for an ESG award from the Southern Gas Association. \u201cThese ZNE homes demonstrate that natural gas is a part of the solution to achieve our low-carbon energy future,\u201d the award submission says. Habitat for Humanity International has participated in international climate negotiations and says it prioritizes climate safety. In a statement, the non-profit said: \u201cWe know that innovation is required so future construction doesn\u2019t exacerbate the climate crisis.\u201d Habitat for Humanity says it helps millions of people access affordable homes each year who are often \u201camong the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change\u201d. But to do so, it relies on independent, locally run affiliates, which can decide how houses are built and funded. Asked about the perceived conflict between the gas utility partnerships and its climate-related statements, a spokesperson for the organization said the group\u2019s affiliates \u201cengage a wide range of partners\u201d. The world is \u201cfacing a growing crisis in affordable, adequate housing\u201d which requires \u201ca multi-faceted challenge that demands non-profit organizations, individuals, corporate partners, elected officials and more to work alongside one another\u201d, he said. He said Habitat\u2019s advocacy and partnerships were \u201cdesigned to confront the housing crisis and ensure more people have a decent place to call home\u201d. But critics say those arrangements appear to have opened the door for gas utilities to attach themselves to the organization and its reputation. \u201cIt\u2019s a cynical PR stunt by the gas utilities,\u201d said Itai Vardi, research and communications manager at the utility watchdog group the Energy and Policy Institute, which provided some research about the partnerships to the Guardian. \u201cWe know that we need to transition very rapidly and dramatically off of fossil fuels, and there\u2019s really no good reason to build new construction that is not all electric.\u201d Zero-net energy homes \u201cZero-net energy\u201d is a building standard requiring a home to produce as much energy as it uses. Builders first work to boost a home\u2019s efficiency with insulation and air sealing, then equip the home with energy production capacity, such as solar panels. But efficient homes that still use gas should not be considered climate-friendly, said Mike Henchen, who leads the carbon-free buildings program at the pro-electrification non-profit RMI. \u201cWhen it comes to climate, gas is part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s this effort to hype natural gas as clean energy, but it\u2019s not.\u201d Gas is primarily composed of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more planet-warming than carbon dioxide in the short term. In the US, gas accounts for the vast majority of planet-heating pollution from buildings, which makes up more than one-10th of all US greenhouse gas emissions. The utilities say the projects illustrate that gas can be part of decarbonization efforts. Describing its Habitat partnerships to American Gas Magazine, a representative from the gas utility Nicor said: \u201cThese homes demonstrate the importance of natural gas as part of a diverse energy mix in a net-zero future.\u201d Jennifer Golz, spokesperson for Nicor, said that \u201cresearch shows a hybrid energy approach will help drive greater emissions reductions at lower overall costs\u201d while improving reliability during extreme weather. A spokesperson for Atmos said: \u201cWe believe a balanced energy approach that includes natural gas and preserves energy choice, rather than supporting specific fuels or technologies, will achieve goals of reducing emissions while maintaining energy reliability.\u201d But climate experts agree that gas must be swiftly curbed to avert climate catastrophe. Spokespeople from Atmos and Nicor did not directly respond to questions about that scientific consensus. In an emailed comment, a representative from Colorado\u2019s Greeley-Weld Habitat affiliate said: \u201cWe have long constructed homes with a variety of energy sources, including natural gas and electricity.\u201d Daniel Aldana Cohen, a co-director of the progressive thinktank Climate and Community Project, said the gas-powered ZNE projects made an unnecessary compromise: they tie access to affordable housing to increased planet-heating pollution. \u201cThe two great existential crises that most people face are eviction and climate breakdown, and the second one is making the first one worse,\u201d said Aldana Cohen, whose research has informed federal Green New Deal for Public Housing proposals. Health concerns Experts have long warned that gas appliances can emit pollutants, including carcinogens. In recent years, a slew of studies have linked gas stoves to increased risk of childhood asthma, chronic lung disease and other health impacts. Low-income people and people of color may be at higher risk if exposed to these pollutants, as they are more likely to have asthma and other underlying respiratory issues due to disproportionate exposure to environmental contaminants. Gas trade groups note a recent World Health Organization-funded study found gas stoves had a non-significant impact on childhood asthma. The same study noted a connection between gas use and pneumonia and lower respiratory infections. Last year, US regulators suggested a potential eventual nationwide gas stove ban, though Biden later ruled out such a policy. Yet the utilities behind the partnerships have repeatedly referred to gas as \u201cclean\u201d. And during a dedication ceremony for a zero-net energy home built by a Habitat affiliate and Atmos in Lafayette, Louisiana, a representative from the utility claimed that the air quality in the home would be of \u201cthe best quality breathing air that you can have\u201d. Spokespeople from Atmos and Nicor did not respond to inquiries about whether the ZNE homes included gas stoves. But an Atmos representative in a December 2023 industry webinar said there was \u201cnatural gas cooking in these homes, in every single one of them\u201d. Asked about concerns that gas appliances can degrade indoor air quality, a representative for Atmos Energy directed the Guardian to claims made by the American Gas Association, a major trade group for private gas utilities. Public relations Despite evidence of the dangers of gas, utilities and their interest groups are using the Habitat partnerships as a public relations tool. The Energy Solutions Center, a trade association of gas utilities, cited the partnerships in a gas-promoting marketing document for its members, which was reviewed by the Guardian. (In an emailed statement, the executive director of Energy Solutions Center, Sonia Vahedian, pointed to recent studies that it said showed gas \u201cremains essential for energy security and will significantly contribute to economic security beyond 2050\u201d.) And during a December 2023 industry webinar, a recording of which was also reviewed by the Guardian, a representative from Atmos said that the project began as a response to attempts to ban gas in buildings. \u201cIn Colorado, they are a little bit on the frontlines, as far as some of the efforts to maybe dissuade people from utilizing natural gas,\u201d a representative of the utility said. \u201cAnd as such, that became the chosen site for our very first natural gas-fueled ZNE home build.\u201d Another representative went on to describe the need to produce a \u201cmarketable\u201d product. \u201cLike everyone in the natural gas industry \u2026 we\u2019ve kept an eye on the growing loud voice for green energy and squeezing out fossil fuels as an energy source,\u201d he said, adding that the partnerships sought to show that \u201cnatural gas can be a part of that future solution or transition state\u201d. The choice to \u201ccombine with renewables\u201d, the representative says, is \u201ckind of a great talking point that \u2018hey, we\u2019re partnering with renewables, we\u2019re not against them.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a strategy that was highlighted in a congressional report last month, based on a tranche of subpoenaed internal documents. A 2018 draft presentation from BP said one way to \u201charness excitement\u201d about renewables was to suggest gas could be a backup fuel source for wind and solar. Atmos representatives on the call also said Habitat had a \u201cwell-oiled machine in terms of public relations\u201d. \u201cUtilities enter into places where government investment is lacking and use that to promote its product, but also brandish its image through these kinds of PR stunts,\u201d Vardi said. Environmental justice Each ZNE home in these projects has gone to low-income members of vulnerable communities, including immigrants, people of color and veterans. \u201cThe gas companies,\u201d said Aldana Cohen, \u201care essentially using poor people as human shields to perpetuate a business model that is going to do the most harm to poor people.\u201d It\u2019s not the only instance of fossil fuel interests hitching their wagon to this kind of advocacy. Reports show that utilities have long funded Black civil rights leaders; the NAACP in 2020 urged local chapters to stop accepting this funding. Promotional materials often say the ZNE homes can help lower energy bills. \u201cNatural gas is really important to the homes we build because it\u2019s reliable, predictable and affordable month to month,\u201d a representative of the Habitat affiliate in Austin, Texas, said in a 2021 report on environmental, social and governance investments. In a 2022 call with financial analysts shared with the Guardian by the Energy and Policy Institute, Atmos\u2019s CEO, Kevin Akers, said the ZNE homes demonstrated \u201cthe value and vital role natural gas plays in helping customers reduce their carbon footprint in a cost-effective manner\u201d. Recent research, however, shows that newer, efficient electric appliances \u2013 such as heat pumps and induction stoves \u2013 can cost the same amount or even less to run as their gas-powered counterparts, though they can be more expensive to install. In some cases, utilities are also using customers\u2019 money to pay to build the homes. In Mississippi, public utility commission documents shared by the Energy and Policy Institute show Atmos is recovering costs to build the ZNE homes from ratepayers. Zero-net? Though the projects are billed \u201czero-net energy\u201d homes, it is not clear that they are always meeting that goal. SoCal Gas in 2017 partnered with Habitat for Humanity of Orange county on a ZNE home, and has touted the benefits of \u201cdual-fuel\u201d ZNE homes over all-electric ones, saying customers prefer them. But a 2021 study funded by SoCalGas and the California Energy Commission comparing two ZNE homes in the city of Stockton \u2013 one fully electric model and another home that included both solar panels and gas appliances \u2013 seemed to undercut the purported benefits of gas. Researchers found that the all-electric home produced more energy than it used, but the gas-powered model did not achieve ZNE status. In webinars held last year researchers noted that even when ZNE homes do not achieve \u201cabsolute zero\u201d, they can still help to promote efficiency. ZNE homes with gas can meet the zero-net benchmark \u2013 in a statement, Atmos said its Habitat homes have done so \u2013 and not all fully electric ZNE homes necessarily achieve the goal. Still, Vardi said the SoCal Gas-funded study provided yet more evidence that gas is unnecessary. \u201cThere is really no reason to build new construction that is not all electric,\u201d he said. Some Habitat partnerships show that this is possible. Habitat\u2019s affiliate in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, built all-electric homes in partnership with a Cape Cod utility, which in 2021 were the \u201cbest-rated\u201d Habitat homes in the nation in terms of efficiency. Another affiliate in Massachusetts\u2019s Pioneer Valley built an affordable, all-electric ZNE home that won praise from the federal government. This year, the federal government announced $2bn for a coalition of non-profits including Habitat for Humanity International and Rewiring America to build fully electric low-income housing. The costs The projects began amid a widespread lack of affordable housing in the US. A poll this year found that most US renters believe they will never be able to afford a home, and that a majority live in areas that are so unaffordable that they are \u201cbarely livable\u201d. Meanwhile, US public housing stock shrank by 25% between 2009 and 2022, according to a recent analysis of federal data by Climate and Community Project. Habitat depends on financial donations to fund their work, which Aldana Cohen said created the opportunity for \u201cdramatic inconsistency or contradiction, like using affordable housing to prop up the gas industry\u201d. In another example, Habitat International, has accepted donations from the multinational fossil fuel conglomerate Koch Industries. \u201cWhen you delegate things to any number of non-profits and for-profit companies, you\u2019re far more likely to just get totally self-serving interventions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to lock a single social policy priority, like affordable housing, into the survival of the fossil fuel industry,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-05-22T19:01:03Z",
            "content": "On social media and in a Tuesday fundraising email, Donald Trump raised an alarming concern. The Department of Justice, he said, was ready to kill him. The wild distortion came against the backdrop of Trump\u2019s hush-money trial in New York and amid fears of rising political violence around the coming presidential election, predominantly from the far right. The comments cement an inverted picture Trump and his allies have painted, in which a patriotic Trump is pitted against anti-democratic deep-state foes. The outlandish claims could ratchet up anger among his supporters and stoke conspiracy theories. \u201cYou know they\u2019re just itching to do the unthinkable,\u201d read the Trump campaign fundraising email, signed with the former president\u2019s name. \u201cJoe Biden was locked &amp; loaded ready to take me out &amp; put my family in danger.\u201d On his social media website, Truth Social, Trump echoed the claim. \u201cCrooked Joe Biden\u2019s DoJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\u201d he alleged. Trump was apparently referencing the order for a search warrant executed in August 2022, when plainclothes agents of the FBI raided Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in search of classified documents Trump had allegedly refused to turn over to the government. A May court filing by Trump\u2019s legal team, under a section titled \u201cThe Illegal Raid\u201d, quotes from a line in the search warrant. \u201cThe Order contained a \u2018Policy Statement\u2019 regarding \u2018Use Of Deadly Force,\u2019 which stated, for example, \u2018Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary,\u2019\u201d attorneys representing Trump wrote. The language cited in the filing was apparently taken from DoJ policy outlining the use of force in executing search warrants. The unabridged text of the policy reads: \u201cLaw enforcement officers and correctional officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.\u201d The agency executed the warrant to search Trump\u2019s Florida home while Trump was in New York and reportedly communicated with the Secret Service agents present to ensure a smooth operation. In a statement, the FBI described the language as \u201ca standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\u201d The Washington Post has previously reported that FBI agents picked a day for the raid when Trump would not be at Mar-a-Lago and told the Secret Service ahead of time. But Trump\u2019s statements about the filing have unleashed a frenzy. Christina Bobb, an attorney for the former president who signed documents before the search claiming Trump had complied with the subpoena for documents, reacted with similar hyperbole. \u201cWTF?!! They were prepared to kill me?! A few dozen FBI agents v. me and they were ready to kill me?!!! What in the world happened to the United States of America?!\u201d wrote Bobb, on X. \u201cThese people are sick,\u201d wrote Paul Gosar, an Arizona congressman and staunch Trump ally, also on X. \u201cBiden ordered the hit on Trump at Mar-A-Lago,\u201d he added in a subsequent post. The rhetorical redirection \u2013 from the content of Trump\u2019s legal battles, which range from alleged financial improprieties to the mishandling of classified documents to his brazen attempt to overturn the 2020 election \u2013 form part of a strategy Trump and his allies are embracing before the 2024 presidential election. The public relations strategy turns Trump\u2019s anti-democratic tendencies back at his critics \u2013 \u201cenemies\u201d, in the former president\u2019s parlance \u2013 as allegations. In communications shared widely with his followers, it is the Department of Justice, the media, the Democrats and Rinos \u2013 Republican in name only \u2013 who dare to criticize him who threaten democracy. Trump, who has warned of \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d if charged with crimes and who defended supporters calling for the assassination of former vice-president Mike Pence for refusing to join the plot to overturn the election, urges his supporters to see him as the victim. \u201cNOW WE KNOW, FOR SURE,\u201d Trump added in his post accusing the D0J of preparing to use lethal force, \u201cTHAT JOE BIDEN IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO DEMOCRACY.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-29T03:51:04Z",
            "content": "Taiwan\u2019s opposition-controlled parliament has passed a controversial reform bill after days of hostile debate and physical fights between MPs inside, and mass protests by citizens outside. The bills passed 58 votes to 45, Bloomberg reported, after a third reading on Tuesday evening in Taipei during which there were further scuffles and members of the ruling party throwing paper planes and hurling garbage bags at the opposition. The bills were driven by the two major opposition parties, the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) and populist Taiwan People\u2019s party (TPP), which together hold a majority of the parliament after gaining ground over the ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP) in January\u2019s elections. The DPP won the presidency, with Lai Ching-te formally inaugurated last Monday. Late on Tuesday, the ruling party told media it would reject the new bill and send it back for review. The party also said it would seek a legal ruling on its constitutionality. Caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said the content of the bill was \u201cabsolutely unconstitutional\u201d, and also questioned the legality of the voting process. The bills sought to expand the legislature\u2019s power to call on and question officials, military figures, and citizens, as well as demand documents. The DPP has accused the opposition of wanting to use the reforms to undermine Lai\u2019s presidency. Taiwan already has a branch of government \u2013 the control yuan \u2013 with the power to investigate government officials and order impeachments. On Thursday its spokesperson warned the new bill risked violating the separation of powers, Bloomberg reported. When the final votes were tallied, triumphant KMT and TPP legislators waved small balloons the shape of suns. Remnants of more than a week of hostilities and late-night deliberations, including placards, flowers, and piles of furniture surrounded the parliamentarians, while tens of thousands of protesters gathered outside. After the bill passed, KMT caucus whip Fu Kun-chi announced the opposition would create a special task force to investigate alleged corruption within the DPP. Readings of the bill repeatedly stretched to midnight amid delays and hostilities, with the DPP and supporters accusing the opposition of undermining Taiwan\u2019s democratic processes to push the bill through. Last week confrontations between opposing legislators turned violent, with at least two MPs briefly treated in hospital. Proponents say legislative reform is needed in Taiwan for greater accountability and argue that these bills are not dissimilar to some which the ruling DPP attempted to introduce when they had a legislative majority. However, critics have said the bills go further than the DPP\u2019s attempts, and are also ill-defined, with many citing a newly introduced criminal offence of \u201ccontempt of congress\u201d. They have said the proposed law can easily be abused to attack political opponents and disrupt the functioning of Lai\u2019s administration. Translations of the amendments, provided earlier in the week, included stipulations that officials under questioning can be fined for giving false statements, or \u201creverse-questioning\u201d, a term which critics said was undefined and most likely went against free speech. The Taiwan Bar Association had previously accused the opposition parties of having \u201cfailed to substantively discuss or review\u201d the bills before pushing them through. Outside the building tens of thousands of people gathered in protest against the bills for the third time in a week. Friday had drawn the largest crowd, with estimates of between 50,000 and 100,000 people. The protests have grown more organised with each showing, with crowd control measures, medical care, food and water, and garbage collection. The rally had begun on Tuesday morning, with a full day of speakers and musical acts. Crowds swelled after work and school finished around the same time the bill passed. The protests are the largest Taiwan has seen since the 2014 Sunflower Movement \u2013 a time that many protesters this week referenced and drew inspiration from. Many told the Guardian they were prepared to continue protesting against what they saw as undemocratic behaviour by the opposition. Lai is likely to face a difficult first term with a hostile parliament, while also managing China\u2019s threats to annex Taiwan. On Saturday, Lai offered his support to the previous night\u2019s protests, saying \u201cthe power of Taiwan\u2019s civil society is in full display\u201d. \u201cThe deliberations of the legislative yuan should abide by procedural justice,\u201d he said, accusing the opposition of \u201cforcing votes through a majority and depriving the legislative yuan of the bill\u2019s due discussion\u201d."

            "content": "Rishi Sunak has ruled out a deal with Nigel Farage after the Reform politician suggested they should \u201chave a conversation\u201d before the election. Farage has held back from running as a candidate for the Reform party, which is led and funded by Richard Tice, but on Wednesday he extended an olive branch to Sunak in an interview with the Sun, telling him: \u201cGive me something back. We might have a conversation.\u201d In the 2019 election, the Eurosceptic campaigner stood down some of his Brexit party candidates in marginal seats, handing a huge boost to Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. However, Sunak rejected the idea on Wednesday, despite making a huge push to win over voters tempted by Reform with policies such as tax cuts for pensioners and the reintroduction of national service. Asked whether he would speak to Farage about a deal, Sunak said: \u201cThere\u2019s only going to be one of two people who will be prime minister: Keir Starmer or me. So the choice is a vote for anyone who isn\u2019t Conservative is a vote for Keir Starmer in No 10.\u201d Pressed on whether that meant he was ruling out a deal with Farage, he said: \u201cYes.\u201d Sunak was speaking as he toured a military vehicle manufacturer in Honiton in Devon, where the Conservative candidate, Simon Jupp, is running in a new seat with the Liberal Democrats his likely rival. The prime minister was pressed by staff at SC Group on how the national service plans would help support young people, with one woman telling him she was reserving judgment until she saw more details. Another employee asked what Sunak was doing to help pensioners who just want support with the cost of living, or people who are not seeking apprenticeships. The prime minister claimed the Conservatives would cut taxes in office. Sunak has spent some of the last week in Lib Dem-facing seats in Buckinghamshire and the south-west, despite announcing policies designed to win back voters to Reform, who tend to be more of a threat in Labour-facing seats in the north and Midlands. Reform is polling at about 12%, with most of its support coming from former Conservative voters who backed Johnson in 2019. Any decision by Reform to back off from fielding candidates in marginal seats could be crucial to the Conservatives party defending constituencies. In his Sun interview, Farage dismissed the idea that he wanted a peerage or honour as \u201crubbish\u201d, but hinted he did want something else from the Conservatives. He said: \u201cI got rid of Mrs May with the Brexit party. I stood aside for Boris to help him win a massive majority. \u201cWhat are they going to do back for me? \u2026 I\u2019m not asking them for anything other than \u2013 I\u2019ve done them some huge favours over the years as a party. Give me something back. We might have a conversation.\u201d Farage has said that he mainly wants to focus on helping to get Donald Trump elected in the US, but will help Tice with his campaign."

            "content": "The Conservative MP Lucy Allan has been suspended from the party after saying she will back Reform UK at the general election, in a further blow to Rishi Sunak and his faltering campaign. The MP for Telford, who announced last year that she was standing down, was suspended from the Conservatives after posting a tweet saying she would support her local Reform candidate in the coming contest. Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader, said he welcomed Allan\u2019s support, as the Conservative MP tweeted a link to the website of Alan Adams, the party\u2019s local candidate, to allow people to help and donate to his campaign. The Conservative party said she has been suspended. \u201cLucy Allan has been suspended from the party with immediate effect,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe people of Telford now have the chance to vote for a dedicated and hardworking new candidate who will put Telford first. A vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer.\u201d Allan said she had already resigned from the Conservatives to support Adams rather than Tory candidate, Hannah Campbell Allan said: \u201cI have resigned from the Conservative party to support Alan Adams to be Telford\u2019s next MP. I have known Alan for many years and he is genuinely the best person for the job. I want the best for Telford and I can\u2019t just let the Labour candidate have a walkover.\u201d She won Telford in 2019 with a majority of 10,941, but in 2017 the Conservatives won by just 720 - and she first won the seat in 2015 with a majority of 730. Allan is the second Tory MP to say they would back Reform after Lee Anderson, the former deputy chair, joined Tice\u2019s party this year. He had been suspended from the Tories for refusing to back down after saying Labour\u2019s London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was controlled by Islamists. Reform sources confirmed that Allan had been in touch with the party about giving them her support. Her support will be a boost for Reform, which has been polling at over 10% but suffered a setback last week when Nigel Farage said he would not stand for the party. The former Ukip leader made his announcement on X hours before the Reform leader, Richard Tice, launched the party\u2019s general election campaign at a press conference in London. Farage tweeted: \u201cI have thought long and hard as to whether I should stand in the upcoming general election. As honorary president of Reform UK, I am fully supportive of Richard Tice\u2019s leadership and urge voters to put their trust in him and Lee Anderson [the party\u2019s sole MP]. I will do my bit to help in the campaign, but it is not the right time for me to go further than that.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-02T14:00:27Z",
            "content": "Reform UK has chosen to stand by candidates who have promoted conspiracy theories online, called the climate emergency \u201cmake-believe\u201d and expressed vaccine-sceptic views. Those fringe views, and more, were put forward by a group of seven candidates selected to stand for the rightwing populist party at the next general election \u2013 including several who will contest seats that some analyses consider to be their top targets. In an indication of the types of beliefs that Reform is willing to give a platform to, the party said it was \u201cproud\u201d to field them as prospective parliamentary candidates (PPCs) on Thursday. Among the views the party has publicly backed are Chris Farmer\u2019s claim that the climate emergency was invented as cover for a plan to install dictators in positions of power. The PPC for Gloucester also said a group of mayors representing the world\u2019s leading cities was trying to use the climate emergency to justify banning people from travelling by private car. Reform has also backed Trevor Lloyd-Jones\u2019s promotion of content online relating to the 15-minute city conspiracy theory. Lloyd-Jones, who is the party\u2019s candidate in Aldershot \u2013 identified as one of Reform\u2019s top targets \u2013 spread anti-vaccine content on Facebook, as well as a post that falsely claimed the former health secretary Matt Hancock \u201ckilled [pensioners] with midazolam [a sedative] and called it Covid\u201d. The party has also backed Lynn Murphy \u2013 their candidate in Easington, another key seat \u2013 who referred to a \u201cmake-believe climate crisis\u201d and said: \u201cYou are deluded if you think the world is going to end due to climate change.\u201d In recent months, Reform has been forced to drop a host of PPCs for expressing objectionable views, prompting serious questions about the vetting processes of a party some polls have in third place. Earlier this month, the party\u2019s leader, Richard Tice, claimed it had published its candidates list so the media could carry out vetting on its behalf. But Reform appears to have changed approach more recently, telling the Mirror days later that it was standing by a candidate accused of posting racist messages online \u2013 characterising the posts as merely asking \u201cquestions of the leftwing establishment\u201d. Also deemed acceptable behaviour by Reform was Hamish Haddow\u2019s claim that the RNLI \u2013 which is often called upon to rescue people who have attempted the perilous Channel crossing to reach the UK \u2013 has been \u201cworking as a taxi service for illegal immigrants\u201d. Haddow, the party\u2019s PPC in Chipping Barnet, stood down as a Conservative candidate for local elections in 2022 after saying he was rooting for Vladimir Putin. He claimed later he was joking about the reference to Putin. This did not bar his selection for Reform. The party has also backed Andrea Whitehead, who has posted online about the chemtrail conspiracy theory, which claims vapour trails left in aircrafts\u2019 wakes are evidence that malign forces are spraying the populace with dangerous chemicals. Also judged acceptable by Reform this week was Alex Stevenson\u2019s promotion of anti-vaccine content online. In addition, the prospective candidate for the key Amber Valley seat promoted some of the conspiracy theories pushed by the former Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen, who lost the whip in January after comparing the use of Covid vaccines to the Holocaust. Reform has said it will stand by the PPC Noel Matthews, who is also the party official often given responsibility for dropping fellow PPCs whose views have been judged to be too toxic. Matthews, who stood unsuccessfully in 2019, was reselected for the next general election in the knowledge he had reportedly defended the convicted fraudster and far-right agitator Tommy Robinson online, as well as saying Islamophobia was \u201cmade up\u201d. Far from distancing Reform from such views as those put forward by the seven PPCs, a party spokesperson indicated some were in tune with official party policy. The spokesperson claimed the newly uncovered posts amounted only to a \u201cseries of people posting mostly comedy memes and questions about issues that affect many people of the country\u201d. The spokesperson added: \u201cSome of their views may be considered eccentric, but none here are malicious.\u201d The spokesperson confirmed that the party supported opposing \u201cnet zero and the climate-change agenda\u201d and believed Covid lockdowns had been \u201cdamaging to the country, its economy and the wellbeing of its people\u201d. Whitehead said she viewed the coming to light of her posts about chemtrails as an opportunity for \u201cfree publicity\u201d. Matthews claimed never to have said Islamophobia was made up, adding: \u201cI do not deny that there is unwarranted hatred of Muslims in society and I abhor it.\u201d He said he was quoting someone else when he tweeted the words \u201cIslamophobia is a silly, made up word\u201d. And he did not respond to a request to clarify how his denial tallied with separately tweeting: \u201cIs it Islamaphobia or Islamophobia? I missed it when that word was made up.\u201d Lloyd-Jones and Haddow declined to comment. Stevenson, Murphy and Farmer have not responded to requests for comment."

            "content": "Four months ago, a prominent Conservative MP described Richard Tice as a \u201cpound-shop Nigel Farage\u201d. That MP, Lee Anderson, would four months later defect to Tice\u2019s party, Reform UK, after being suspended from the Tories for suggesting the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was controlled by Islamists. Tice and Anderson have now appeared alongside each other on the top deck of a turquoise Reform-branded battlebus and in video clips, preaching the same refrain that they \u201cwant our country back\u201d. Anderson\u2019s previous criticism, however, is still a cutting one. Tice has fronted and bankrolled Reform for three years with \u00a31.4m in loans, and without much practical help from Farage. Yet in terms of name recognition there is no contest: 73% of the public say they know who Farage is compared with just 16% for Tice, according to an Ipsos Mori survey from March. Tice may be less well known than Farage but his modest profile has been growing among the millions of new viewers of GB News and TalkTV, where he has been a presenter and appears regularly as a guest. Tice\u2019s colleagues say regular TV presenting has made the once stiff and Tory-looking businessman more \u201cmatch-fit\u201d for giving interviews. Tice resists comparisons to Farage, but his style of speech is increasingly similar, using political catchlines from the former Ukip leader that were regulars on the campaign trail in 2015 to 2019. One former colleague of the Reform leader, however, says a key difference between the two men is that Tice is \u201cmuch more prickly\u201d than Farage. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that Reform is doing so well without him being really the right person for the job,\u201d they said. A Reform source says Tice has \u201cundoubtedly changed\u201d in the past few years. He came in trying to run the party like a business, but realised it was reliant on volunteers and goodwill and toned down his leadership style. \u201cHe has earned a lot of loyalty by turning up and being there,\u201d the source said. That said, Tice still has a day job running a property company at the same time as being out around the country campaigning with a growing band of Reform activists. Born Richard James Sunley Tice in Surrey in 1964, he comes from a wealthy property-developing family. He was brought up in a Northamptonshire village until, at 14, he went to Uppingham, a boarding school in Rutland in the East Midlands, where he is now a trustee. After studying construction economics at Salford University, he started working in the property industry before later joining the Sunley Group, a housebuilder and commercial property firm founded by his grandfather Bernard Sunley. Tice would later strike out on his own, leading major property companies and buying and selling commercial sites. He is now the chief executive of Quidnet Capital, which owns a number of industrial warehouses including a depot near Newark, a storage centre near Northampton, a manufacturing site in Derbyshire and an office building in Crawley A donor first and politician second, he entered the world of Conservative politics by lending an office to the Tory contender David Davis in the 2005 leadership election, before donating to Ukip in 2013, playing a major role in the Leave.EU campaign alongside Farage and donating just short of \u00a31m to the Brexit party just after the 2019 election. When Farage bowed out of the Brexit party in 2021, Tice was the natural choice to run the rebranded Reform UK, although some within the movement feared he was too bland-sounding to be a convincing heir. Tice could undoubtedly be described as rich, given the scale of his donations. When declaring he would stand in the next election in Hartlepool in the north-east of England, his company, Tisun Investments, appears to have bought a property to use as an office in the town outright in December 2022 for \u00a3110,000. It was then brightly branded in Reform colours and slogans. Some, however, think that looks like a bad decision given the swing to Labour in Hartlepool at the local elections. \u201cAnderson should be running in their best seat in the north, and Tice should be down somewhere south and Tory,\u201d says the colleague. Friends of Tice point to his success in helping the party to convincing poll leads of 9-15% that could put it second in a large number of seats in the country. But others close to the party worry there is too much of a scattergun strategy that will see it building up an even spread of votes across the country rather than piling up support in targeted seats. With Brexit less of a guiding mission, Tice and the party have increasingly focused on issues of immigration and anti-net zero politics \u2013 with policies on banning sharia, outlawing pro-Palestine protests, and calling for a \u201csingle British culture\u201d. If anything is driving Reform\u2019s polling, apart from its links with Farage, research from More in Common in 2022 found that immigration was the leading cause of voters switching from the Tories. Tice has recorded numerous videos and appeared on rightwing television channels speaking against the government\u2019s immigration policies and failure to stop small boats crossing the Channel. He published a video last month criticising Regent Street for having decorations that celebrate Ramadan and Pride but not St George\u2019s Day, and in another film from last year, reportedly viewed 2m times, he interviewed an asylum seeker affecting to be sympathetic to his complaints about poor accommodation. The video is captioned: \u201cAsylum seeker complains: size of room, bathroom too small &amp; bad wifi in his Central London hotel &amp; not enough weekly money. Been here 2 years. I apologise on behalf of British taxpayers for the poor wifi \u2026 \u201d Tice has also made it very clear he is on Anderson\u2019s side in the former Tory\u2019s dispute with Sadiq Khan, and has himself suggested the Labour Muslim politician might \u201cshare the underlying sentiment\u201d of antisemitic protests. The Reform leader\u2019s message on multiculturalism has become more central over the years. Along with Farage, he is clear that he thinks it has failed, giving an interview to the New Culture Forum saying he was in favour of a multi-ethnic Britain that \u201cbuys into a single British culture\u201d and \u201cif you have mass immigration that doesn\u2019t come under and buy into that single British culture, then you are diluting it, you are damaging it\u201d. At an election, Tice will be hoping to scoop up Conservative votes by outflanking Sunak to the right. Having put so much of his money behind the project and led it for three years, he insists he would still be happy to have Farage back onboard in a prominent role at the general election. Critics say Tice does not have the star quality of the former Ukip leader, but he has managed to keep the party in the headlines and put pressure on Sunak by rising in the polls even without Farage\u2019s firepower."

            "content": "Dozens of rivers and streams in Alaska are turning rusty orange, a likely consequence of thawing permafrost, a new study finds. The Arctic is the fastest-warming region in the globe, and as the frozen ground below the surface melts, minerals once locked away in that soil are now seeping into waterways. \u201cIt\u2019s an unforeseen impact of climate change that we\u2019re seeing in some of the most pristine rivers in our country,\u201d said Brett Poulin, study author and assistant professor of environmental toxicology at University of California Davis. The permafrost thaw is exposing minerals to oxygen in a process known as weathering, which increases the acidity of the water and dissolves metals like zinc, copper, cadmium and iron \u2013 the most apparent metal that gives the rivers a rusty color visible even from satellite images. The study highlights the potential degradation of drinking water and risk to fisheries in the Arctic. \u201cWhen mixed with another river, it can actually make the metals even more potent [in its] impact to aquatic health,\u201d Poulin said. The phenomenon was first observed in 2018, when researchers noticed the milky orange appearance of the rivers across northern Alaska\u2019s Brooks Range, a stark contrast to the crystal clear waters seen the year prior. Within the year, a tributary of the Akillik river in Kobuk Valley national park saw the complete loss of two local fish species: the dolly varden and the slimy sculpin. \u201cOur data suggests that when the river turned orange, we saw a significant decrease in macroinvertebrates and biofilm on the bottom of the stream, which is essentially the base of the food web,\u201d Poulin said of the rusting phenomenon. \u201cIt could be changing where fish are going to be able to live.\u201d The rusting is a seasonal phenomenon, occurring in the summer typically during July and August, when the soil is thawed the deepest. The researchers at the National Park Service, US Geological Survey and University of California Davis now want to better understand the long-term implications of the changing water chemistry in places with continuous permafrost, which includes Arctic regions such as Alaska, Canada, Russia and parts of Scandinavia. \u201cIt\u2019s an area that\u2019s warming at least two to three times faster than the rest of the planet,\u201d said Scott Zolkos, an Arctic scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center who was not involved in the study. \u201cSo we can expect these types of effects to continue.\u201d The research group shared that they were working closely with tribal liaisons in Alaska to ensure local communities get accurate information on the developing phenomenon."

            "title": "Economic damage from climate change six times worse than thought \u2013 report",
            "date": "2024-05-17T14:00:37Z",
            "content": "The economic damage wrought by climate change is six times worse than previously thought, with global heating set to shrink wealth at a rate consistent with the level of financial losses of a continuing permanent war, research has found. A 1C increase in global temperature leads to a 12% decline in world gross domestic product (GDP), the researchers found, a far higher estimate than that of previous analyses. The world has already warmed by more than 1C (1.8F) since pre-industrial times and many climate scientists predict a 3C (5.4F) rise will occur by the end of this century due to the ongoing burning of fossil fuels, a scenario that the new working paper, yet to be peer-reviewed, states will come with an enormous economic cost. A 3C temperature increase will cause \u201cprecipitous declines in output, capital and consumption that exceed 50% by 2100\u201d the paper states. This economic loss is so severe that it is \u201ccomparable to the economic damage caused by fighting a war domestically and permanently\u201d, it adds. \u201cThere will still be some economic growth happening but by the end of the century people may well be 50% poorer than they would\u2019ve been if it wasn\u2019t for climate change,\u201d said Adrien Bilal, an economist at Harvard who wrote the paper with Diego K\u00e4nzig, an economist at Northwestern University. \u201cI think everyone could imagine what they would do with an income that is twice as large as it is now. It would change people\u2019s lives.\u201d Bilal said that purchasing power, which is how much people are able to buy with their money, would already be 37% higher than it is now without global heating seen over the past 50 years. This lost wealth will spiral if the climate crisis deepens, comparable to the sort of economic drain often seen during wartime. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear that the comparison to war is only in terms of consumption and GDP \u2013 all the suffering and death of war is the important thing and isn\u2019t included in this analysis,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cThe comparison may seem shocking, but in terms of pure GDP there is an analogy there. It\u2019s a worrying thought.\u201d The paper places a much higher estimate on economic losses than previous research, calculating a social cost of carbon, which is the cost in dollars of damage done per each additional ton of carbon emissions, to be $1,056 per ton. This compares to a range set out by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that estimates the cost to be around $190 per ton. Bilal said the new research takes a more \u201cholistic\u201d look at the economic cost of climate change by analyzing it on a global scale, rather than on an individual country basis. This approach, he said, captured the interconnected nature of the impact of heatwaves, storms, floods and other worsening climate impacts that damage crop yields, reduce worker productivity and reduce capital investment. \u201cThey have taken a step back and linking local impacts with global temperatures,\u201d said Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University who wasn\u2019t involved in the work and said it was significant. \u201cIf the results hold up, and I have no reason to believe they wouldn\u2019t, they will make a massive difference in the overall climate damage estimates.\u201d The paper found that the economic impact of the climate crisis will be surprisingly uniform around the world, albeit with lower-income countries starting at a lower point in wealth. This should spur wealthy countries such as the US, the paper points out, to take action on reducing planet-heating emissions in its own economic interest. Even with steep emissions cuts, however, climate change will bear a heavy economic cost, the paper finds. Even if global heating was restrained to little more than 1.5C (2.7F) by the end of the century, a globally agreed-upon goal that now appears to have slipped from reach, the GDP losses are still around 15%. \u201cThat is still substantial,\u201d said Bilal. \u201cThe economy may keep growing but less than it would because of climate change. It will be a slow-moving phenomenon, although the impacts will be felt acutely when they hit.\u201d The paper follows separate research released last month that found average incomes will fall by almost a fifth within the next 26 years compared to what they would\u2019ve been without the climate crisis. Rising temperatures, heavier rainfall and more frequent and intense extreme weather are projected to cause $38tn of destruction each year by mid-century, according to the research. Both papers make clear that the cost of transitioning away from fossil fuels and curbing the impacts of climate change, while not trivial, pale in comparison to the cost of climate change itself. \u201cUnmitigated climate change is a lot more costly than doing something about it, that is clear,\u201d said Wagner. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 May 2024 because an earlier version misquoted Gernot Wagner in the last sentence."

            "date": "2024-05-16T12:42:17Z",
            "content": "Climate change will be a lesser priority in Florida and largely disappear from state statutes under legislation signed on Wednesday by the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, in a move which experts say ignores the reality of Florida\u2019s climate threats. The legislation, which comes after Florida had its hottest year on record since 1895, also bans power-generating wind turbines offshore or near the state\u2019s lengthy coastline. Florida is facing rising seas, extreme heat, flooding and increasingly severe storms. The legislation takes effect on 1 July and also boosts expansion of natural gas, reduces regulations on gas pipelines in the state, and increases protections against bans on gas appliances such as stoves, according to a news release from the governor\u2019s office. \u201cThis purposeful act of cognitive dissonance is proof that the governor and state legislature are not acting in the best interests of Floridians, but rather to protect profits for the fossil fuel industry,\u201d said Yoca Arditi-Rocha, executive director of the non-profit Cleo Institute, which advocates for climate change education and engagement. DeSantis, who suspended his presidential campaign in January and later endorsed his bitter rival Donald Trump, called the bill a commonsense approach to energy policy. \u201cWe\u2019re restoring sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots,\u201d DeSantis said in a post on the X social media platform. Florida is already about 74% reliant on natural gas to power electric generation, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Opponents of the bill DeSantis signed say it removes the word \u201cclimate\u2019 in nine different places and moves the state\u2019s energy goals away from efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gases blamed for a warming planet. Greg Knecht, director of the Nature Conservancy in Florida, told the Washington Post the new measure was \u201cvery much out of line with public opinion\u201d, with polls showing that a majority of Floridians believe in climate change and want action. Knecht said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing flooding and we\u2019re seeing property damage and we\u2019re seeing hurricanes \u2026 [and] we\u2019re turning around and saying, \u2018Yeah, but climate change isn\u2019t really real, and we don\u2019t need to do anything about it.\u2019\u201d The legislation also eliminates requirements that government agencies hold conferences and meetings in hotels certified by the state\u2019s environmental agency as \u201cgreen lodging\u201d and that government agencies make fuel efficiency the top priority in buying new vehicles. It also ends a requirement that Florida state agencies look at a list of \u201cclimate-friendly\u201d products before making purchases. In 2008, a bill to address climate change and promote renewable energy passed unanimously in both legislative chambers and was signed into law by then governor Charlie Crist, at the time a Republican. Former governor Rick Scott, now a Republican US senator, took steps after taking the governor\u2019s office in 2011 to undo some of that measure and this latest bill takes it even further. The measure signed by DeSantis would also launch a study of small nuclear reactor technology, expand the use of vehicles powered by hydrogen and enhance electric grid security, according to the governor\u2019s office.

            "content": "A TV meteorologist condemned the Florida governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s so-called \u201cdon\u2019t say climate change\u201d law on air and urged viewers to vote. Steve MacLaughlin of WTVJ in Miami addressed viewers on Saturday amid rising heat records across the state, saying: \u201cOn Thursday, we reported \u2026 that the government of Florida was beginning to roll back really important climate-change legislation and really important climate-change language.\u201d MacLaughin condemned DeSantis\u2019s position on the matter, saying that it came \u201cin spite of the fact that the state of Florida over the last couple of years has seen record heat, record flooding, record rain, record insurance rates, and the corals are dying all around the state\u201d. He said: \u201cThe entire world is looking to Florida to lead in climate change, and our government is saying that climate change is no longer the priority it once was. \u201cPlease keep in mind the most powerful climate change solution is the one you already have in the palm of your hands \u2013 the right to vote. And we will never tell you who to vote for, but we will tell you this: we implore you to please do your research and know that there are candidates that believe in climate change and that there are solutions. And there are candidates that don\u2019t.\u201d McLaughlin delivered his comments after DeSantis recently signed several bills the governor claimed sought to \u201crestore sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots\u201d. \u201cRadical green zealots want to impose their climate agenda on people through restrictions, regulations and taxes,\u201d a notice posted by DeSantis said. In addition to prohibiting windfarms offshore and near coastlines, the bill prioritizes the expansion of natural gas and bolsters protections against gas appliance bans and repeals climate policies enacted during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. The gas industry has helped drive climate change and its resulting effects, including severe weather becoming more commonplace. Over the weekend, south Florida saw record temperatures, with Fort Lauderdale and Miami each reaching record highs of 95F (35C) on Sunday. Typical highs for this time of year are about 86F (30C), the Palm Beach Post reported. Since McLaughlin shared his segment on X on 18 May, it has been viewed nearly 407,000 times on the platform, with more than 3,300 likes and 1,400 reshares. Many were quick to praise McLaughlin for speaking out, with one user saying: \u201cI know there\u2019s often pressure on meteorologists not to speak. Thank you for speaking.\u201d Another user wrote: \u201cThank you, Steve, for giving us the facts.\u201d Someone else said: \u201cSo needed. Thank you for this.\u201d Meteorologists across the US have faced harassment over their climate crisis reporting. Speaking to the Associated Press last year, Sean Sublette, a former TV meteorologist who now works at Virginia\u2019s Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper, said: \u201cMore than once, I\u2019ve had people call me names or tell me I\u2019m stupid or these kinds of harassing type things simply for sharing information that they didn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d Meanwhile, last July, meteorologist Chris Gloninger announced he was stepping down from Des Moines\u2019s CBS TV station affiliate KCCI due to post-traumatic stress disorder that he developed as a result of threats over his climate-crisis coverage."

            "date": "2024-05-23T15:12:43Z",
            "content": "We are told the focus groups are clear as a bell. No, Labour\u2019s Keir Starmer is not exhilarating. No, the economy is not screaming for new management. Yes, the world is a mess. But one message for sure was splashed across Starmer\u2019s lectern on Wednesday: give us \u201cchange\u201d. Rishi Sunak has not been a signally worse prime minister than his recent predecessors. Eighteen months ago he was handed a tougher job than that of possibly any postwar holder of his office. The closest parallel was Douglas-Home\u2019s year-long inheritance of the wreck of Macmillan\u2019s government in 1963. Sunak confronted a second-rate cabinet, a crippled economy and a destitute public sector. It would have taken a political titan to have succeeded. He has struggled at least to be responsible, sincere and well-meaning. The definition of a democracy is not that it votes its leaders into office. Russia and China pretend to do that. Democracy requires that they also be voted out. Most constitutions impose term limits on rulers to ensure regime refreshment. The issue is not the quality of government but its openness to renewal. It is Tennyson\u2019s plea to \u201cLet the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change.\u201d No one could accuse the political clubland that is Westminster of failing change. After 10 years, two of Britain\u2019s longest-serving recent prime ministers, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, simply lost the public\u2019s patience without a vote. The trauma of Brexit later supplied the country with five leaders in just eight years. Unlike the US, Britain\u2019s constitution at least allows mistakes to be swiftly corrected. Boris Johnson was toppled by a few opinion polls. Truss lasted 49 days. Trump enjoyed four years. Sunak is gambling against change. In announcing the election he pleads that state security requires continuity. He professes to be \u201cthe strongest possible protection\u201d against a world \u201cmore dangerous than it has been since the end of the cold war\u201d. He also hopes that the electorate will see him as a restorer of \u201ceconomic stability\u201d. To this, Starmer could hit back not with different policies but only with a change of leader, a promise to end \u201cpolitical chaos feeding decline\u201d. This illustrates just how lost the days are when Labour and Conservative fought elections from divergent ideological platforms. There is now little talk of public sector versus private, of privatisation versus nationalisation, or free markets versus price controls. Ministers and shadow ministers speak the same language, as if they had both just stepped out of the same PPE course. The only criticism they can level at each other is an exchange of tame abuse. Politics thus offers the electorate an empty intellectual discourse. Public services and institutions are governed by a consensus that appears to be failing on all sides. Competence matters more than ideology, which means that politics is less about policy than about the people to whom we entrust it. Since voters cannot tell how competent a minister is likely to be, they can only fall back on trial and error, wait and see. When Gordon Brown entered No 10 as prime minister in June 2007, he muttered to the cameras: \u201cLet\u2019s get on with change.\u201d Yet he had been chancellor of the exchequer for 10 years. What was the change he had in mind? The answer could not be policy, only that of prime minister. Boris Johnson took office in 2019 and swiftly won an election on a tide of personal popularity. He brought to British politics something it had long lacked: charm and even a sense of humour. It turned out he could not run a whelk stall. Having been given no choice of policy between him and Labour, the electorate had to judge their new leader on his performance in office. The result was lethal. Johnson\u2019s popularity plummeted from nearly 70% to under 30%. Populist politics is the politics of whimsy. It cried out for another change. Change is both Starmer\u2019s opportunity and his burden. His slogan is starkly negative. It is to be not Sunak, not Tory, not the past 14 years. It is to be a relief from years of Tory backbiting, splitting and disloyalty. Like Blair in 1997, Starmer is likely to inherit an improving economy and the possibility of better times ahead. But his chief handicap, as after a long period in opposition, is a lack of ministerial experience. Blair\u2019s cabinet disastrously backed Thatcher\u2019s privatisation of water, trains and care homes for lack of cabinet colleagues who knew any better. Starmer may find that chaos in public services is the result not of Tory incompetence, but of structural failure that he needs to put right, and fast. Or his criticism of Sunak will return to haunt him: that the country needs change. Initially Starmer will expect a honeymoon and a sense of a new dawn. We saw it in the \u201cfirst hundred days\u201d of Blair\u2019s administration, and even Cameron\u2019s coalition. There was a brief respite from political vituperation and blame. It was a period of new faces on the television screen and a new political discourse. Every government announcement no longer required the BBC to add an abusive opposition put-down. Politics was eerily happy. Of course the challenges will remain the same, but the personalities will be different. A new club will be in power. We have only to gaze at the world as it is today to realise that this is democracy\u2019s most precious gift.

            "date": "2024-05-17T16:37:13Z",
            "content": "Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence could lead to short-term increases in unemployment, a rise in carbon emissions and leave regulators trailing in the wake of technological advances, according to an international panel of experts. The inaugural report on the safety of advanced AI, inspired by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, raised a number of concerns about a technology which has shot up the political and regulatory agenda after leaps forward such as the ChatGPT chatbot. The panel behind the study, chaired by the leading computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, acknowledges there is far from universal agreement about the technology. \u201cAI has tremendous potential to change our lives for the better, but it also poses risks of harm,\u201d said Bengio. Bengio was commissioned by the UK government to preside over the report, which was announced at last year\u2019s global AI safety summit at Bletchley Park, with the panel members nominated by 30 countries as well as the EU and UN. Released in advance of next week\u2019s successor AI summit in Seoul \u2013 where Rishi Sunak will co-chair the opening session by video link \u2013 the report focuses on general-purpose AI, the term for computer systems that can perform a wide variety of tasks typically associated with intelligent beings. Broaching one of the most sensitive aspects of the technology\u2019s impact, the panel says AI could have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the labour market by allowing the automation of a number of tasks. As well as ChatGPT, a text-generating tool that is also highly adept at writing software code, recent advances have brought products that can produce highly convincing video, image and audio from simple hand-typed prompts \u2013 potentially threatening a host of professions. The report says many people could lose their jobs, but adds that some economists believe redundancies could be offset by the creation of new roles due to the technology and demand in non-automated sectors. It also cites an International Monetary Fund paper that says 60% of jobs in advanced economies are exposed to AI, although that could result in a range of outcomes \u2013 from automating substantial parts of someone\u2019s job to complementing it. However, the gap between workers learning new skills or moving location for fresh jobs could still result in short-term unemployment. \u201cLabour market frictions, such as the time needed for workers to learn new skills or relocate for new jobs, could cause unemployment in the short run even if overall labour demand remained unchanged,\u201d it says. The report also raises environmental concerns by flagging the growing use of datacentres to train and operate the AI models that underpin products like ChatGPT. \u201cThis trend might continue, potentially leading to strongly increasing CO2 emissions,\u201d the report says, adding that it could make AI the largest contributor to datacentre electricity consumption in the near future. The Seoul summit is taking place against a backdrop of increased political and regulatory activity related to AI in the UK, US and EU. The panel warns that regulators could be caught out by the rapid pace of change, referring to the \u201cpotential disparity between the pace of technological progress and the pace of a regulatory response\u201d. Other potential risks raised in the report include concerns around bias, reflected by the fact that widely used AI models are trained on data that \u201cdisproportionately represents western cultures\u201d, as well as fears over losing control of AI systems. The report concludes that the near future around general purpose AI is \u201cuncertain\u201d, with \u201cvery positive\u201d and \u201cvery negative\u201d outcomes, and the decisions of societies and governments will play a key role in how the technology progresses."

            "date": "2024-05-31T06:00:31Z",
            "content": "The market for carbon offsets shrank dramatically last year, falling from $1.9bn (\u00a31.5bn) in 2022 to $723m in 2023, a new report has found. The drop came after a series of scientific and media reports found many offsetting schemes do nothing to mitigate the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. The research by Ecosystem Marketplace, a nonprofit initiative that collects data about the carbon market from brokers and traders, found the market had shrunk 61%. It attributed the contraction to a flurry of scientific studies and media reports that concluded millions of offsets were \u201cworthless\u201d, with some projects linked to human rights concerns. Each carbon credit is meant to represent the reduction or removal of one tonne of CO2 emissions removals or reductions, and they have been used by leading companies to label their products \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d, or to tell consumers they can fly, buy new clothes or eat certain foods without making the climate and biodiversity crises worse. Offsets generated by schemes protecting rainforests, the most popular type, lost 62% of their value between 2022 and 2023. These schemes were the focus of a joint investigation by the Guardian, which found more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets from a large sample of projects from Verra \u2013 the world\u2019s leading certifier \u2013 are worthless, and uncovered potential human rights abuses at a flagship project. Verra disputed the findings. Julia Jones, a co-author on one of the studies in the investigation and a professor at Bangor University, said urgent reforms were necessary so carbon markets could work as intended. \u201cThe media scrutiny revealing that many projects issuing Redd+ credits to the voluntary carbon market have sold more credits than justified is important,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, I am deeply concerned that some of the recent coverage of the issue gives the impression that the very idea of tackling climate change by slowing tropical deforestation is a scam \u2013 this is not true and the idea could harm forests. \u201cDramatically more finance is urgently needed to stop the ongoing loss of forests and the vital services they provide \u2013 a reformed voluntary carbon market could play a key role in providing that finance,\u201d she said. On Tuesday, the White House held an event to support industry-led efforts to reform carbon markets, backing initiatives to help companies avoid greenwashing and ensure credits represent actual environmental impact. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said companies should be prioritising cuts to emissions, but the Biden administration still wanted carbon credits \u201cto succeed\u201d. The move comes amid deep divisions between environmental groups about the role of carbon credits in helping companies meet net zero targets. Stephen Lezak, a programme manager at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, said people should not turn away from carbon markets. \u201cThe current market for carbon offsets is a bit like a burning building. We need folks to be firefighters and run toward it, rather than walk away and let it burn to the ground. Limiting global warming to 1.5C simply isn\u2019t feasible without having a functioning market for this sort of climate finance,\u201d he said. Kaya Axelsson, a research fellow at Oxford Net Zero, said: \u201cThis is a critical transition moment. Carbon markets will lose relevance unless they radically reform in line with net zero aims.\u201d Rene Velasquez, managing partner at the carbon markets consultancy Valitera, disputed the size of the fall reported by Ecosystem Marketplace and said there were problems with the methodology. \u201cAs with previous years, their report is incomplete and relies on a survey of market participants to provide confidential trade data,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is fewer and fewer institutional respondents participate. While I will concede the market retreated, this skews the numbers.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features"

            "date": "2024-05-02T05:00:49Z",
            "content": "Oil and gas equipment intended to cut methane emissions is preventing scientists from accurately detecting greenhouse gases and pollutants, a satellite image investigation has revealed. Energy companies operating in countries such as the US, UK, Germany and Norway appear to have installed technology that could stop researchers from identifying methane, carbon dioxide emissions and pollutants at industrial facilities involved in the disposal of unprofitable natural gas, known in the industry as flaring. Flares are used by fossil fuel companies when capturing the natural gas would cost more than they can make by selling it. They release carbon dioxide and toxic pollutants when they burn as well as cancer-causing chemicals. Despite the health risks, regulators sometimes prefer flaring to releasing natural gas \u2013 which is 90% methane \u2013 directly into the atmosphere, known as \u201cventing\u201d. The World Bank, alongside the EU and other regulators, have been using satellites for years to find and document gas flares, asking energy companies to find ways of capturing the gas instead of burning or venting it. The bank set up the Zero Routine Flaring 2030 initiative at the Paris climate conference to eradicate unnecessary flaring, and its latest report stated that flaring decreased by 3% globally from 2021 to 2022. But since the initiative, \u201cenclosed combustors\u201d have begun appearing in the same countries that promised to end flaring. Experts say enclosed combustors are functionally the same as flares, except the flame is hidden. Tim Doty, a former regulator at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said: \u201cEnclosed combustors are basically a flare with an internal flare tip that you don\u2019t see. Enclosed flaring is still flaring. It\u2019s just different infrastructure that they\u2019re allowing. \u201cEnclosed flaring is, in truth, probably less efficient than a typical flare. It\u2019s better than venting, but going from a flare to an enclosed flare or a vapour combustor is not an improvement in reducing emissions.\u201d The only method of detecting flaring globally is by using satellite-mounted tools called Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite of detectors (VIIRS), which find flares by comparing heat signatures with bright spots of light visible from space. But when researchers tried to replicate the database, they saw that the satellites were not picking up the enclosed flares. Eric Kort, an associate professor at the University of Michigan, said: \u201cThe VIIRS satellite database is still the standard product that scientists use globally. It\u2019s the best, most consistent product we currently have. \u201cIf you enclose the flare, people don\u2019t see it, so they don\u2019t complain about it. But it also means it\u2019s not visible from space by most of the methods used to track flare volumes.\u201d Without the satellite data, countries were forced to rely mostly on self-disclosed reporting from oil and gas companies, researchers said. Environmentalists fear the research community\u2019s ability to understand pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector could be jeopardised. Colorado became the first and only US state to ban routine flaring in 2021. But Maxar satellite imagery shows enclosed flares replacing open-lit flares in the run-up to the Colorado ban on flaring, which provided a carve-out clause for enclosed flaring devices. Google Earth historical images of one site in Jackson County, Colorado, show a lit flame disappearing and being replaced with an enclosed flaring device. Because the flaring within the site is not detectable, it is difficult for researchers to determine when it is burning and for what purpose. The NGO Earthworks, with an optical gas-imaging camera usually used by industry specialists looking for emissions leaks, recorded footage showing invisible pollutants coming from the device. However, the site\u2019s owner, Fulcrum Energy Capital Funds, told the Guardian it had eliminated flaring from its facilities. Methane and carbon dioxide plumes were seen coming from enclosed flaring devices in the Four Corners region of New Mexico, according to satellite data from CarbonMapper, which provides publicly accessible data on greenhouse gases. In November 2023, the EU announced a plan to phase out routine flaring as part of legislation designed to tackle methane emissions. But enclosed flares have started to appear in the EU, with information from oil and gas equipment supplier websites suggesting the devices are being sold in multiple member states. Satellite images show enclosed flares at Ineos facilities in Grangemouth, Scotland, and the Ineos Rafnes refinery in Norway. In Germany, enclosed flares can be seen at facilities owned by the steel manufacturer ArcelorMittal. An Ineos spokesperson said the enclosed flare \u201cleads to significantly less noise being emitted and much lower luminosity\u201d, adding that these things were important for communities living and working close to its sites. An ArcelorMittal spokesperson said: \u201cWe installed an enclosed flaring device as a precautionary measure, so that the flare is not visible from a distance if gas had to be flared at night.\u201d The device had a 100% combustion rate andno measurable emissions, the company added. Zubin Bamji, the programme manager of the World Bank\u2019s Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Partnership, said volumes from enclosed flares were \u201cvery small and are unlikely to have a significant impact on flare volume estimates at a regional, country or global level\u201d, but confirmed that VIIRS did not classify enclosed flaring devices as flares. A source with knowledge of upcoming EU methane legislation said it \u201ccovers all flares, not just those detectable by satellite\u201d, and added that flaring in emergency situations would still be allowed. It was not immediately clear how the EU would determine whether flaring inside enclosed flares was routine or for emergency situations.

            "title": "Corporations invested in carbon offsets that were \u2018likely junk\u2019, analysis says ",
            "date": "2024-05-30T10:00:27Z",
            "content": "Some of the world\u2019s most profitable \u2013 and most polluting corporations \u2013 have invested in carbon offset projects that have fundamental failings and are \u201cprobably junk\u201d, suggesting industry claims about greenhouse gas reductions were likely overblown, according to new analysis. Delta, Gucci, Volkswagen, ExxonMobil, Disney, easyJet and Nestl\u00e9 are among the major corporations to have purchased millions of carbon credits from climate friendly projects that are \u201clikely junk\u201d or worthless when it comes to offsetting their greenhouse gas emissions, according to a classification system developed by Corporate Accountability, a non-profit, transnational corporate watchdog. Some of these companies no longer use CO2 offsets amid mounting evidence that carbon trading do not lead to the claimed emissions cuts \u2013 and in some cases may even cause environmental and social harms. However, the multibillion-dollar voluntary carbon trading industry is still championed by many corporations including oil and gas majors, airlines, automakers, tourism, fast-food and beverage brands, fashion houses, banks and tech firms as the bedrock of climate action \u2013 a way of claiming to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint while continuing to rely on fossil fuels and unsustainable supply chains. Yet, for 33 of the top 50 corporate buyers, more than a third of their entire offsets portfolio is \u201clikely junk\u201d \u2013 suggesting at least some claims about carbon neutrality and emission reductions have been exaggerated according to the analysis. The fundamental failings leading to a \u201clikely junk\u201d ranking include whether emissions cuts would have happened anyway, as is often the case with large hydroelectric dams, or if the emissions were just shifted elsewhere, a common issue in forestry offset projects. \u201cThese findings add to the mounting evidence that peels back the greenwashed facade of the voluntary carbon market and lays bare the ways it dangerously distracts from the real, lasting action the world\u2019s largest corporations and polluters need to be taking,\u201d said Rachel Rose Jackson, Corporate Accountability\u2019s director of research. The fossil fuel industry is by far the largest investor in the world\u2019s most popular 50 CO2 offsetting schemes. At least 43% of the 81m CO2 credits purchased by the oil and gas majors are for projects that have at least one fundamental flaw and are \u201cprobably junk\u201d, according to the analysis. The transport industry, which accounts for about a fifth of all global planet-warming emissions, has also relied heavily on carbon offsetting projects to meet climate goals. Just over 42% of the total credits (55m) purchased by airlines and 38% purchased by automakers (21m) for the top 50 projects are likely worthless at reducing emissions, the analysis found. The new analysis, shared with the Guardian, builds on a joint investigation last year into the top 50 CO2 offset projects \u2013 those that have sold the most carbon credits in the global market. The vast majority of the most popular 50 offset projects were classified as likely or potentially junk due to one or more fundamental failing that undermines its promised emission cut, according to the criteria and classification system applied to the analyses. The top 50 projects include forestry schemes, hydroelectric dams, solar and wind farms, waste disposal and greener household appliances schemes across 20 (mostly) developing countries, according to data from AlliedOffsets, the most comprehensive emissions trading database, which tracks projects from inception. They account for almost a third of the entire global voluntary carbon market (VCM), suggesting that junk or overvalued carbon credits that exaggerate emission reduction benefits could be the norm. The VCM industry works by carbon credits being tradable \u201callowances\u201d or certificates that allows the purchaser to offset 1 ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent in greenhouse gasses by investing in environmental projects anywhere in the world that claim to reduce carbon emissions. Climate experts say that the carbon trading market has failed to produce the promised planetary benefits, delayed the transition away from oil, gas and coal, and caused harm to forests and communities in developing countries where most offset projects are located. On Tuesday, the Biden administration published new guidelines on responsible participation in VCMs which they say will drive credible and ambitious climate action. But critics argue that offsets are fundamentally flawed. \u201cOverall, carbon offsets are, according to most expert analyses, neither credible nor scalable to the urgency and scale of the carbon dioxide problem,\u201d said Richard Heede, co-director of the Climate Accountability Institute, a nonprofit research and education group. \u201cThis report documents the prevalence of \u2018worthless\u2019 or \u2018likely junk\u2019 carbon offsets in the global Voluntary Carbon Market, and undermines the corporate rationale for claiming emissions reductions based on such credits,\u201d Heede added. The new sector-by-sector analysis found: Fossil fuel firms and airlines Oil and gas majors are among the largest corporate buyers of likely junk offsets. Almost half (49%) the 3.7m carbon credits purchased by ExxonMobil are for two projects classified as likely junk or worthless. Internal company documents show that scientists at Exxon, which is one of the world\u2019s worst greenhouse gas emitters, were accurately predicting the impact of fossil fuels on the climate in the 1970s. A spokesperson for ExxonMobil said: \u201cCarbon offsets are a viable way to [reduce emissions and reach net zero], which is why we continue to evaluate them. We\u2019re working to verify the claims cited in this analysis.\u201d With the exception of fossil fuel firms, Delta has purchased more carbon credits than any other corporation. Just over 35% of the 41m carbon credits purchased by Delta were from 11 offset projects which are likely worthless or junk, according to Corporate Accountability. In California, a 2023 civil class-action alleged that Delta misrepresented itself as carbon-neutral as the company\u2019s reliance on the carbon trading market renders its climate friendly representations as false and misleading. The judge reduced the scope of the lawsuit last month after Delta rejected the allegations and filed a motion to dismiss. The case continues. A spokesperson said the company is investing in sustainable aviation fuel, more fuel-efficient aircraft and reducing fuel use through operational efficiencies in a bid to reach \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050. \u201cWe have shifted away from carbon neutrality and offsets.\u201d Meanwhile almost 72% of the 11m carbon credits ever purchased by easyJet, a popular low-cost European airline, were for projects classified as likely junk. In 2022, the airline announced plans to transition away from offsetting in favor of a \u201croadmap to net zero\u201d emissions by 2050 through more fuel-efficient aircraft and perational efficiencies as well as sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture and storage \u2013 technologies which scientists have warned could exacerbate the climate crisis. An easyJet spokesperson said: \u201cIn the short period we did offset customer emissions, we had robust due diligence processes in place, with all projects recommended by expert partners and all required to meet the highest standards available.\u201d A 2021 joint investigation by the Guardian revealed that major airlines including Delta and easyJet were using unreliable \u201cphantom\u201d carbon credits to claim their flights were carbon neutral. Car makers, entertainment giants, luxury goods Almost half (46%) of the 11m CO2 credits purchased by Volkswagen from the top 50 projects were likely junk, according to the analysis. The German carmaker recently announced a joint venture to develop its own carbon credit projects and said they increasingly rely on on-site inspections, due diligence and audit processes to verify projects. VW aims to reduce its emissions by 90% compared to 2018 by converting its energy supply and increasing energy efficiency among other measures. In the world of entertainment, almost 62% of the 5.8m carbon credits retired by Disney are from two offset projects which have been classified as likely junk or worthless. The analysis also found that 75% of the 4.4m carbon credits purchased by the Italian luxury fashion house Gucci have been for projects classified as likely junk. Gucci, which was once a high-profile proponent of offsetting, last year dropped its carbon neutral claim amid growing evidence that the rainforest projects it relied on were likely junk and potentially harmful. Gucci is finalizing new climate commitments with a greater focus on cutting absolute emissions through its supply chain. The food and drinks industry is a major climate polluter \u2013 and investor in carbon markets, with 37% of the industry-wide credits purchased from projects classified as likely junk. Food and drinks industry The analysis found that almost 36% of the 2.2m carbon credits purchased by Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s largest food and beverage company, were from five offset projects which have been classified as likely junk. Nestl\u00e9 said that it stopped purchasing credits from these projects in 2021/2022. \u201cReaching net zero emissions at Nestl\u00e9 does not involve using offsetting: we focus on GHG emissions reductions and removals within our value chain to reach our net zero ambition.\u201d While some corporations have signaled a shift away from carbon offsetting, the VCM is still valued between $2 and $3bn \u2013 despite warnings that the industry is a false solution delaying the world\u2019s transition away from oil, gas and coal. \u201cThis research once again shows that big corporate polluters claiming climate credentials are the main buyers of junk credits. But racking up carbon credits doesn\u2019t make you a climate leader. Cutting fossil fuels does. We can\u2019t offset our way to a safe climate future,\u201d said Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law (Ciel). \u201cFor all the talk about carbon credits accelerating climate action, they are actually greenwashing climate destruction.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-11T06:00:22Z",
            "content": "Ministers are considering plans to weaken the UK\u2019s carbon-cutting plans by allowing the unused portion of the last carbon budget to be carried over to the next period. This would go against the strong recommendation of the government\u2019s statutory climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee. But it would make the next targets easier to meet. The UK has emitted less carbon dioxide in recent years than was expected, owing to factors including the Covid-19 pandemic and sluggish economic growth. This should be ignored, allowing for the next set of five-yearly emission targets to be more stringent, the better to reach net zero by 2050, the CCC has said. Ministers have until the end of this month to decide, and have only publicly said that such a decision would be made \u201cin due course\u201d. Campaigners fear they are likely to take advantage of the loophole. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, warned: \u201cThe government will make a grave error of judgment if it weakens plans to cut emissions, \u2018carrying forward\u2019 a right to burn carbon that only exists because the UK economy has grown less quickly than we thought when we set the third carbon budget in 2008.\u201d The UK would still have to meet its target of cutting emissions by 68% by 2030, set at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. \u201cCashing in phantom credits wouldn\u2019t change our international commitments \u2013 it just means we\u2019d need to double the rate at which we cut emissions late this decade, making the job much harder,\u201d Benton said. \u201cIt would contradict advice from the UK\u2019s climate watchdog, which is never a good look. By shifting the goalposts, it sends yet another signal that this government isn\u2019t serious about supporting the green industries of the future.\u201d He pointed to Green Alliance research that has shown only half of carbon reductions needed by 2032 are covered by confirmed policy. \u201cWe need action to close the gap \u2013 not excuses for inaction,\u201d he said. The UK overachieved on meeting its third five-year carbon budget, which ran from 2018 to 2022, requiring reductions of 38% compared with 1990 levels. The emissions cap for the budget was 2,544 megatons of CO2 equivalent, but the actual emissions were 391 MtCO2e fewer, or 15% below the budget. Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, ministers are allowed to count the surplus of emissions savings, compared with the budgetary requirement, towards the next carbon budget. That would make the next budget easier to meet, but could also slow the UK\u2019s path towards meeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions. In February, the CCC asked the government not to carry over the surplus savings. The government has yet to make a decision, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. A spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cWe are the first major economy to halve emissions and have the most ambitious legally binding emissions targets in the world. We have overdelivered on every carbon budget to date, and will continue to meet our emissions targets. A decision on whether the UK\u2019s overachievement on the third carbon budget is carried over will be made in due course.\u201d A spokesperson for the Labour party called on the government not to carry over the surplus, but stopped short of commuting to reverse any such decision if elected. \u201cThe government must meet their climate targets - that is the way to cut bills for good, create jobs, and make the UK energy independent,\u201d they said. \u201cAfter the high court has again found their plans to deliver these benefits unlawfully inadequate, the government should be doing what is necessary to get back on track, not fiddling their numbers.\u201d"

The cybersecurity minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, said late on Friday night the breach was \u201caffecting many Australians\u201d but appeared restricted to the release of names, dates of birth and email addresses. She said Australians should be especially vigilant for scams. She said Ticketek had told customers \u201cthat their passwords and credit card information have not been compromised\u201d. On Saturday, the federal government\u2019s Australian Cyber Security Centre issued an alert saying it was \u201caware of successful compromises of several companies\u201d that used the services of US-based cloud storage company Snowflake. In a statement, Ticketek said it had \u201calready commenced notifying those customers who may have been impacted\u201d and promised further updates \u201cas more information becomes available\u201d. Ticketek would not say how many Australian customers had been affected. The Guardian asked Ticketek if the cloud-based platform it had referred to was Snowflake, but the company did not respond. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The breach is the second reported this week of a major global ticketing outlet. Hackers took the personal information of 560 million customers of Ticketmaster, but that company has not said if any Australians were affected. On Friday night, Ticketek emailed customers about the \u201ccyber incident\u201d affecting account holder information \u201cstored in a cloud-based platform, hosted by a reputable, global third party supplier\u201d. The email said: \u201cWe would like to reassure you that Ticketek has secure encryption methods in place for all passwords and your Ticketek account has not been compromised. \u201cIn addition, we utilise secure encryption methods to handle credit card information and transactions are processed via a separate payment system, which has not been impacted. Ticketek does not hold identity documents for its customers.\u201d The email did not name the \u201cthird party supplier\u201d but said since Ticketek was told of the incident \u201cover the past few days we have worked diligently to put every resource into completing an investigation, so that we can communicate with you as quickly as possible\u201d. Ticketek said the \u201cavailable evidence at this time\u201d indicated that \u201cfrom a privacy perspective, your name, date of birth and email address may have been impacted\u201d. \u201cWe sincerely apologise to all those who may have been affected by this incident,\u201d the email said, and asked customers to visit a webpage with guidance on cybersecurity. O\u2019Neil wrote on X: \u201cI understand that [Ticketek] has taken action to quickly identify and notify affected people. Where companies hold a significant amount of data, Australians expect that they look after it.\u201d She said Australians needed to be \u201cespecially vigilant\u201d and to be on alert for scams, including phishing emails. The National Cyber Security Co-ordinator said Ticketek was \u201ca different company to Ticketmaster, which is a subsidiary of Live Nation Entertainment\u201d \u2013 referring to the global hack of Ticketmaster. The co-ordinator said the Australian Signals Directorate and Australian Federal Police were aware of the Ticketek incident.

            "content": "The UK is not paying enough attention to a \u201cgamechanging\u201d shift in China\u2019s cyber-espionage tactics towards infiltrating critical infrastructure including energy and communications networks, a former head of Britain\u2019s cybersecurity agency has warned. Ciaran Martin, the ex-chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, said a warning from the US this year that Chinese state-backed hackers were targeting key sectors was a pivotal moment in Beijing\u2019s approach to cyberwarfare. \u201cThe UK has not paid enough attention to a gamechanging warning from the US that China is planning disruption to key critical infrastructure,\u201d Martin said. He said there should be more focus on the threat across the public and private sectors and \u201cswaths of civil society\u201d. Martin said the government should make clear in its public messaging to China that the threat of disruption to key infrastructure was unacceptable. \u201cWe should be clear where our red lines are and disruption of civilian infrastructure should be a red line,\u201d he said. Speaking to the Guardian at the DTX conference at Manchester Tech Week, Martin said China had no history of disruptive cyber-operations, unlike Russia, but was now moving to Moscow-style tactics. \u201cThey\u2019re preparing to be like Russia,\u201d he said. He pointed to a warning in April from Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, the US domestic intelligence agency, that Chinese state-backed hackers had infiltrated key US infrastructure and were waiting for \u201cjust the right moment to deal a devastating blow\u201d. Wray said a group known as Volt Typhoon had burrowed into American companies in the telecommunications, energy, water and other critical sectors, with 23 pipeline operators targeted. The tactic is known as \u201cpre-positioning\u201d. Wray said China was developing the \u201cability to physically wreak havoc on our critical infrastructure at a time of its choosing\u201d. He added: \u201cIts plan is to land low blows against civilian infrastructure to try to induce panic.\u201d The US first revealed that Chinese state-backed hackers were seeking to lodge themselves in key domestic IT networks in February. Martin said an example of the disruption caused by infrastructure attacks could be seen at the British Library, which has been severely affected by a ransomware attack. Such attacks are typically carried out by Russia-based criminal gangs. \u201cWhat if we had 100 British Library attacks all at once,\u201d he said. Making further comments at a keynote speech at DTX, Martin said the disruption from cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t directly kill anybody but it would hurt\u201d. In March the UK confirmed that Beijing-backed hackers were responsible for a cyber-attack targeting the UK elections watchdog and a surveillance operation on British politicians. At the time, Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, said the government would \u201cnot hesitate to take swift and robust actions wherever the Chinese government threatens the United Kingdom\u2019s interests\u201d. Martin, a professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, welcomed a report by the tech website The Record that the UK government was considering making reporting of ransomware attacks mandatory and requiring victims to seek a licence before making ransom payments. \u201cI am really glad they are taking it so seriously,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-05-12T20:08:22Z",
            "content": "The success of New York\u2019s spring art auctions was in jeopardy on Sunday, a day after auction house Christie\u2019s confirmed that its website had been hacked, potentially shutting out some bidders on $850m worth of art work going up for bids this week. Yet despite failing to regain control of its website, Christie\u2019s said that its auctions \u2013 the most important of the year in the art world \u2013 would go ahead in person and by phone. On Saturday, even that was regarded and being uncertain as Christie\u2019s staff and cybersecurity contractors scrambled to fix the issue. It is unknown who or what caused the auction house\u2019s computer systems to collapse. Christie\u2019s called it a \u201ctechnology security issue\u201d, but the company has been hacked previously. A spokesperson for the company told the New York Times on Sunday that the sales of modern and contemporary art would \u201ctake place as planned\u201d. Last summer, a German cybersecurity company said that there had been a breach in the form of a leak of the locations of artworks held by some of the world\u2019s wealthiest collectors. Beneath a calm exterior in which prospective buyers toured the midtown auction house looking at hundreds of potential acquisitions on Saturday, including Andy Warhol\u2019s Flowers silk-screen painting from 1964 \u2013 estimated at $30m at the top end. But the upcoming auctions account for as much as half the revenue Christie\u2019s may bring in annually. Any slip-up \u2013 especially the loss of confidential client data \u2013 is a potential crisis. \u201cA cyber-attack like this is the 21st-century equivalent of a hand grenade in a small room,\u201d the art market lawyer Thomas Danziger told the Times. At the same time, the New York spring sales are so important to the art market that they may be less vulnerable to online interference because top-end buyers tend to bid in person \u2013 through an art adviser \u2013 or directly by phone through a Christie\u2019s representative. Nonetheless, the hack will be seen as embarrassing for Christie\u2019s owners, the Pinault family, which controls the auctioneer through Groupe Art\u00e9mis. Art\u00e9mis also controls the fashion conglomerate Kering, owner of Gucci, which has issued a series of profit warnings and seen its share price decline by almost two-thirds over the past year. But over the next week, more than 1,700 modern and contemporary artworks are expected to come under the hammer through the three dominant houses \u2013 Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips. Between them, art estimated at $1.2bn to $1.8bn is expected to be auctioned soon. That\u2019s a decline of roughly one-third over two years. In 2022, auctioneers shifted $2.8bn of merchandise at the May sales, a record some attributed to buildup of cash during the pandemic. With many of the world\u2019s regional economies struggling for growth, the demand for art in the US is seen as a potential savior as Chinese and European buyers hold back as compared to previous years. A Bank of America study recently found that the average price of artworks sold at auction in 2023 decreased by 32%. \u201cThe art market is still in search of price equilibrium years after coming off the highs of 2021,\u201d the bank said. Not only were buyers expecting lower prices, but sellers were holding back until \u201cdemand regains its prior price elasticity\u201d. \u201cThe art market correction is adjusting price expectations,\u201d the report said, noting that there was a bright spot. \u201cWomen artists are finally getting their due,\u201d the report found, noting that sales of works by female artists were up 10% last year to $788m, an increase on top of gains of 29% in 2022 and 55% in 2021."

            "content": "Ticketmaster is yet to confirm whether it has experienced a major data breach or if Australians are impacted, after a notorious hacker collective claimed it had the personal details of millions of the ticketing giant\u2019s global customers for sale. The collective, ShinyHunters, claimed on Wednesday on the dark web it had the personal details of 560 million Ticketmaster customers available for a one-time sale of US$500,000. It also demanded a ransom for the data not to be released. The collective, which has been responsible for other high-profile data breaches, claimed the personal details it had for sale included names, addresses, emails, phone numbers and the last four digits and expiration date of credit cards. Ticketmaster\u2019s parent company, Live Nation, did not respond to a request for comment, and was yet to make a public statement on the alleged data breach. The Australian government confirmed it was aware of a cyber-incident impacting Ticketmaster and had engaged the ticketing giant to understand the details. Home affairs directed questions on details of the incident to Ticketmaster. One Australian Ticketmaster customer told Guardian Australia he was concerned that he had not yet received any communication from Ticketmaster detailing the breach, or advice for its customers. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Prof Nigel Phair, a Monash University expert in cybersecurity, said there were about 5 million Ticketmaster customers in Australia and New Zealand. He said it was troubling that Ticketmaster had not yet made a public statement regarding the alleged data breach. \u201cOrganisations need to be more proactive in their communications and inform the public what has happened and how they are remediating the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a vacuum of information, whether from the government or the business itself, it makes it a whole lot worse. \u201cConsumers need to remain hyper-vigilant in the online world and be on the lookout for unusual emails, SMS or phone calls. They should also look for any suspicious credit card transactions.\u201d Brett Callow, a threat analyst with cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, said it appeared the breach could be genuine, but it was unclear when it happened or how. \u201cIt would be in Ticketmaster\u2019s best interest to make a statement sooner rather than later. People are understandably concerned and they have a right morally if not legally to be informed as to what\u2019s happening,\u201d Callow said. Callow said the forum on which ShinyHunters posted claims of the breach, BreachForums, recently went quiet after it was seized by a team of international law enforcement agencies. He said the post about the breach may be part of efforts to gain attention and resurrect the forum again. ShinyHunters has a history of high-profile data breaches, Callow said, including leaking information about 73 million AT&amp;T current and former customers. The telecommunications company confirmed nearly two weeks after the data was offered on the dark web that it was legitimate. Christopher Budd, director of threat research at Sophos, said it was too early to tell whether there was a breach given there\u2019s only the \u201cattackers\u2019 words to go on\u201d. \u201cRegardless of whether the breach is legitimate, the attackers have been successful in drawing attention to a criminal forum that was recently taken down. As with many takedowns like this, we often see the sites rebooted, so organisations should never let their guard down,\u201d he said. Prof Matthew Warren, an RMIT expert in cybersecurity, said the advice was always to not pay a ransom for stolen data, given it can increase the chances of future attacks. \u201cOnce the data has been stolen from the organisation there is nothing that the organisation can do to protect the data. If the organisation had encrypted the data, then if the data had been stolen, it would have been unusable by the hacker,\u201d he said. Phair said data breaches were becoming all too common and called on the government to do more. \u201cThe current legislative approach is clearly not working, as organisations are still not putting sufficient effort into cyber-risk management,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-05-10T15:00:23Z",
            "content": "The IT company targeted in a Chinese hack that accessed the data of hundreds of thousands of Ministry of Defence staff failed to report the breach for months, the Guardian can reveal. The UK defence secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs on Tuesday that Shared Services Connected Ltd (SSCL) had been breached by a malign actor and \u201cstate involvement\u201d could not be ruled out. Shapps said the payroll records of about 270,000 current and former military personnel, including their home addresses, had been accessed. China has not been openly named by the government as the culprit. The MoD was told of the hack in recent days but a number of sources said SSCL, an arm of the French tech company Sopra Steria, became aware of the breach in February. Sopra Steria did not respond to requests for comment. One Whitehall insider did not comment on the timeframe but said that concern about SSCL being \u201cslow to respond\u201d was one of the issues being examined in an official inquiry into the hack. It can also be revealed that SSCL was awarded a contract worth more than \u00a3500,000 in April to monitor the MoD\u2019s own cybersecurity \u2013 several weeks after it was hacked. Officials now believe this contract could be revoked. The payroll data that was hacked reflects only a fraction of the work SSCL does for the government. Sopra Steria and SSCL are understood to have other undisclosed government cybersecurity contracts, according to Whitehall sources. However, these are deemed so sensitive that they have never been publicly disclosed. The Cabinet Office declined to comment on the detail of contracts, citing security restrictions. The cybersecurity arm of the UK\u2019s intelligence services, the National Cyber Security Centre, has warned of a growing threat to the country\u2019s businesses and critical national infrastructure from hostile states. Chinese and Russian state-sponsored actors were highlighted among attackers using a range of routes to try to hide malicious activity on networks containing sensitive information. Whitehall worries over a lack of transparency by SSCL have raised concerns that there could be a wider compromise of its systems. Sopra Steria is one of a handful of strategic suppliers to the government, with work ranging from administering pensions to wider payments systems for government departments and agencies. Shapps told parliament that the government had \u201cnot only ordered a full review of its [SSCL\u2019s] work within the MoD, but gone further and requested from the Cabinet Office a full review of its work across government, and that is under way\u201d. He added that specialists had been brought in to carry out a \u201cforensic investigation\u201d of how the breach happened. Earlier this week, a spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said: \u201cAn independently audited, comprehensive security review of the contractor\u2019s operations is under way and appropriate steps will be taken based on its findings.\u201d SSCL was part-owned by the government until October last year when it sold its 25% stake to Sopra Steria for \u00a382m. SSCL was aware of being a \u201cmagnet\u201d for cyber-attacks, sources said. A public warning about identity theft has been on the website of its parent company, Sopra Steria, for at least three years, according to an examination of the page\u2019s history. The hack was first internally detected in February, sources said, with concerns about potentially successful phishing attacks on the company dating back to December 2019. SSCL and its parent company hold a total of \u00a31.6bn in government contracts. These include a range of highly sensitive functions such as Home Office recruitment and online testing for officers, according to information from contracts gathered by the data company Tussell. The Chinese embassy has said China was not responsible for the hack. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe urge the relevant parties in the UK to stop spreading false information, stop fabricating so-called China threat narratives, and stop their anti-China political farce.\u201d"

            "content": "Labour\u2019s tanks roll relentlessly across Tory lawns, not pausing a heartbeat to celebrate phenomenal local election results in England. It treated the local polls as a military rehearsal for the general election, with ruthless focus on places that will deliver most seats: that includes the south, as well as the north and Midlands, and the party is heading for Scottish turf too. But the mesmerising ferocity of blue-on-blue abuse is the current news-making drama. Fighting bare-knuckle over post-election ideology, the Tory right are looking forward to an election defeat as long as one of their own isn\u2019t at the helm. Besides, they have Sunak in their grip, while the Mail calls Boris Johnson a \u201ccoiled mamba\u201d waiting \u201cto save the Tories from total annihilation\u201d. Mournful one-nationers echo the losing West Midlands mayor Andy Street\u2019s dignified call for moderation, unheeded. Sunak can stay or go: Labour relishes either equally. Before the winded government finds words that make any sense, Labour is out there pummelling them again. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivers a speech on Tuesday to nip any \u201cgreen shoots\u201d talk in the bud, ahead of the week when the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee may signal interest rate cuts soon, and ONS figures show a small rise from recession and April\u2019s inflation figures hitting the 2% target. Reeves is getting in first, pre-empting these results with a torrent of data that may feel far closer to people\u2019s real life experience. \u201cConservatives are gaslighting the British public,\u201d she says. \u201cThey say we\u2019ve turned a corner. But try telling that to the 6.4m households across England and Wales that saw their rent increase or had to re-mortgage in the last 18 months, at an additional \u00a3210 a month. Or the 950,000 families whose mortgage deal is due to expire between now and January.\u201d When Sunak says \u201cthe plan is working\u201d, she can show the UK is set for the slowest growth in the G7. This will be the first parliament \u201cwhere real disposable incomes are going to be lower at the end of it than they were at the beginning\u201d, she says. Had the UK economy grown at the average OECD rate over the past decade, it would be \u00a3140bn larger today: \u201cThe Tory legacy is a Britain that is poorer.\u201d Her litany of woe points to people worse off, with \u201ceconomic growth on the floor\u201d, taxes rising, \u201cyet public services in ever deeper crisis\u201d. She lands blow after blow. \u201cBy the time of the next election, we can, and should, expect interest rates to be cut, Britain to be out of recession and inflation to have returned to the Bank of England\u2019s target,\u201d she says, listing the last threads that Sunak\u2019s government hangs by. But Labour focus groups who are shown ministers\u2019 statements on \u201cfalling inflation\u201d laugh out loud, with people asking: \u201cWhere do they do their shopping?\u201d Told that inflation is falling while they see prices rising \u201cmakes them want to throw their butter at the TV\u201d, one Labour aide says. \u201cExcept it costs too much.\u201d When Reeves says the Tories are gaslighting voters, that\u2019s exactly what they think, when food prices remain 25% higher than two years ago. No \u201crecovery\u201d will bring them back down. People describe the economy as damaged, broken, tanked, even \u201ca pyramid scheme\u201d, their minds firmly made up, as they were in 1997, when living standards were genuinely improving. Average wages will not return to 2008 levels until 2026, says the Resolution Foundation. Telling people they should feel better when they only feel tightened belts and empty purses adds to political cynicism, as Reeves tries to counter the \u201cthey\u2019re all the same\u201d mindset. Households are slashing spending, even on basics, with grocery spending up 16% but buying 8% less in volume. Less is spent on appliances, hairdressing, travel, restaurants and recreation and less on culture \u2013 music venues and theatres attest to that. That squeeze will not be gone by election time. Reeves keeps asking that old question, \u201cDo you and your family feel better off than you did 14 years ago? Do our hospitals, our schools and our police work better than 14 years ago?\u201d No wonder the Tories strive to shift the battleground to Rwanda, trans issues or any \u201cwokery\u201d they can drum up. And they get it wrong: a YouGov survey has found that 59% think the government is taking too little action on climate change. Labour discontents might even be cheered by scares that Starmer is a closet Marxist, as the Telegraph\u2019s Camilla Tominey warns Tory defectors not to give \u201cbirth to a monster\u201d. Pay no attention to his \u201cbanging on about patriotism and the St George flag\u201d, as this \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d is \u201cno cuddly Blairite\u201d. But some may remember how the same red scare on \u201cdemon eyes\u201d Blair back in 1997 failed miserably. As for Reeves, her attacks on the wretched state of living standards turn that vital question back on her: will people feel better under Labour? In her Mais lecture in March, Reeves laid out her \u201csecuronomics\u201d programme, a smaller-scale Bidenomics to kickstart investment for growth. It relies on 1.5m homes to be built after a planning reform \u201cblitz\u201d. Her national wealth fund seeds investment to boost jobs with a \u201cskills revolution\u201d and a \u201cgenuine living wage\u201d. Her green prosperity plan still offers \u00a328bn by the second half of the next parliament, and an increase to the windfall tax on oil and gas. But none of that can quite answer the question. Extreme caution has gained Labour rare public trust on the economy: without that there\u2019s no chance of victory. What Reeves does in office is another matter and Labour will need to be bolder than she can say now. That\u2019s asking the impatient to take it on trust that she can conjure up enough growth to repair public services and restore incomes. But winning always has to come first.

            "date": "2024-05-06T14:50:10Z",
            "content": "As a Joe Biden v Donald Trump rematch looms, much is at stake. From the future of reproductive rights to the chances of meaningful action on climate change, from the strength of US support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, and Israel in its war with Hamas, to the fate of US democracy itself, existential issues are firmly to the fore. Here\u2019s a look at why. Economy \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d So said the Democratic strategist James Carville, in 1992, as an adviser to Bill Clinton. Most Americans thought stewardship of the economy should change: Clinton beat George HW Bush. Under Biden, post-Covid recovery remains on track. Unemployment is low, stocks at all-time highs. That should bode well but the key question is whether Americans think Biden\u2019s economy is strong, or think it is working for them, or think Trump was a safer pair of hands, forgetting the chaos of Covid. According to polling, many do prefer Trump. Cost-of-living concerns dominate. Inflation remains a worry. For Biden, Republican threats to social security and Medicare might offset such worries. For Trump, whose base skews older, such threats must be downplayed \u2013 though they are present in Republicans\u2019 own transition planning. Immigration House Republicans impeached Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden\u2019s secretary of homeland security. The Senate quashed that but at Trump\u2019s direction, Republicans sank a bipartisan border and immigration deal. One day in February, Biden and Trump both went to the southern border. Biden highlighted Republican obstruction but called on Trump to work with him, aiming to show voters which party wants to work on the issue. Since then, Trump has focused on denunciations of Biden and claims of border chaos stoked by sinister forces. Expect such contrasts on loop. Equality Ron DeSantis made attacks on LGBTQ+ rights a hallmark of his attempt to \u201cMake America Florida\u201d. The governor\u2019s failed campaign suggests how well that went down, but Republican efforts to demonize so-called \u201cwoke\u201d ideology should not be discounted. States have introduced anti-trans legislation, book bans and restrictions on LGBTQ+ issues in education. The US supreme court weighed in by ending race-based affirmative action in college admissions. Struggles over immigration, and Republicans\u2019 usual focus on crime, show race-inflected battles will play their usual role, particularly as Trump uses extremist \u201cblood and soil\u201d rhetoric. On the Democratic side, a worrying sign: Black and Hispanic support is less sure than it was. Abortion Democrats are clear: they will focus on Republican attacks on abortion rights, from the Dobbs v Jackson supreme court ruling that struck down Roe v Wade to the mifepristone case, draconian bans and candidates\u2019 support for such measures. It makes tactical sense: The threat to women\u2019s reproductive rights is a rare issue on which Democrats poll very strongly, fueling electoral wins in conservative states. This year\u2019s Alabama IVF ruling, which said embryos should be legally treated as people, showed the potency of such tactics again; from Trump down, Republicans scrambled to deny wanting to end treatment used by millions. Trump must balance boasting about ending Roe, by appointing three justices who voted to strike it down, with trying to avoid blame for attacks on reproductive rights even as his supporters call for, and implement, harsher abortion bans. Expect Biden and Democrats to hit and keep on hitting. Foreign policy For Biden, the Israel-Gaza war presents a fiendish proposition: how to satisfy or merely mollify both the Israel lobby and large sections of his own party, particularly the left and the young \u2013 those more sympathetic to the Palestinians. Spiraling and ongoing campus protests against Israel\u2019s pounding of Gaza show the danger of coming unglued from the base. So do protest votes against Biden in the Democratic primary. Republicans have no such worries: They are simply pro-Israel. Elsewhere, Biden continues to lead a global coalition in support of Ukraine in its fight against Russia, scoring a win at home in April as the Republican speaker of the US House, Mike Johnson, finally oversaw passage of a new aid bill despite fierce opposition from the right of his party. Throw in the lasting effects of the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan (teed up by Trump, fumbled by Biden), questions about what happens if China attacks Taiwan, and the threat Trump poses to Nato, and heavy fire on foreign policy is guaranteed. Democracy Biden is keen to stress the threat to democracy at home. After all, Trump refused to accept the result of the 2020 election, incited the deadly January 6 attack on Congress, is linked to plans to slash the federal government in a second term, and even says he wants to be a \u201cdictator\u201d on day one of re-election. Trump maintains the lie that his 2020 defeat was the result of electoral fraud even as his various criminal cases proceed: 14 of 88 charges concerning election subversion. The other 74 charges concern hush-money payments (34, now on trial in New York) and retention of classified information (40, going slowly in Florida). It should be easy to portray an 88-time indicted potential felon as a threat to constitutional order, particularly given Trump\u2019s clear need to win power as a way of avoiding prison. Accordingly, the issue has been profitable for Biden at the polls. But some doubt its potency. David Axelrod, a close ally of Barack Obama, told the New Yorker: \u201cI\u2019m pretty certain in Scranton [Pennsylvania, Biden\u2019s home town] they\u2019re not sitting around their dinner table talking about democracy every night.\u201d Climate From forest fires to hurricanes and catastrophic floods, it is clear climate change is real. Polling reflects this belief: 70% of Americans \u2013 strikingly, 50% of Republicans included \u2013 want meaningful action. But that isn\u2019t reflected in Republican campaigning. Trump says he doesn\u2019t believe human activity contributes to climate change, nor that climate change is making extreme weather worse, and is opposed to efforts to boost clean energy. Biden\u2019s record on climate may be criticized by campaigners but his record in office places him firmly and clearly against such dangerous views."

            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy faces a renewed threat as Russia\u2019s intensifying war takes its toll on power plants and forces Kyiv to send key workers to the frontline, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has warned. In its latest economic update, the EBRD cut its growth forecasts and said more than two years of fighting in Ukraine was affecting not only the warring countries but also their neighbours. Beata Javorcik, the EBRD\u2019s chief economist, said the war was \u201ccasting a long shadow\u201d as she announced the bank had cut its growth forecast for the regions in which it operates from 3.2% to 3% this year. The EBRD was set up to help rebuild the economies of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe after communism collapsed in the early 1990s, but subsequently expanded to offer support to countries in the Balkans, the Middle East and north Africa. Interviewed by the Guardian after Russia\u2019s offensive towards Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, Javorcik said: \u201cThe war has intensified. Mobilising additional men to fight will hit the economy, and the destruction of power generation is something that will have repercussions. The situation is challenging.\u201d Heavy bombing in March and April had cut Ukraine\u2019s electricity production by 40%, with many thermal and hydro plants destroyed, she said. Ukraine\u2019s economy contracted by almost a third in 2022 before rebounding modestly in 2023. The EBRD is expecting it to grow by 3% this year. Javorcik said the good news for Kyiv was that $61bn of US financial aid had covered the gap between government spending and revenue this year and that the Black Sea corridor was open for its exports. \u201cThe authorities have managed to keep the macro economy stable and that\u2019s a big achievement. \u201cThe war is the big unknown. In the initial phase of the war the military fighting took place in an area that generated 60% of Ukraine\u2019s economic activity. Subsequently, the fighting moved to a much smaller area. If the area affected by the fighting goes back to the early days of the war that would take its toll of the economy.\u201d The EBRD has revised up its 2024 growth forecast for Russia this year from 1% to 2.5% but Javorcik said the exodus of foreign firms and skilled workers would eventually be felt. \u201cWhile the short-term outlook for Russia has improved, in the medium term Russia is going to feel the effects of the war. Sanctions and the impact of the brain drain will affect its productivity growth.\u201d The EBRD said the weakness of the German economy, wariness among central banks about cutting interest rates and the running down of savings accumulated during the Covid pandemic had also contributed to weaker growth in its regions. \u201cGeopolitical tensions are having a profound impact on the EBRD regions and beyond, leading to rapid fragmentation of trade and investment and a notable rise in defence spending\u201d, it said. \u201cBridging\u201d economies that traded with both eastern and western blocs had been large recipients of foreign direct investment and stood to benefit from fragmentation. China accounted for half of greenfield inward investment by value in the EBRD regions, Javorcik said."

            "content": "Rachel Reeves will draw the economic battle lines for the next general election on Tuesday, challenging the government\u2019s claims that the economy is turning a corner when millions are still struggling with the cost of living. The shadow chancellor will accuse Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt of \u201cgaslighting\u201d the public with over-optimistic statements about the UK economy that are \u201cout of touch\u201d with most people\u2019s lives. Labour will draw on \u201cnew economic thinking\u201d from leaders in Europe and America, Reeves will say, and she will claim that when it comes to Britain\u2019s finances the government has \u201ccrashed the car and left it by the side of the road\u201d. Sunak will this week attempt yet another reset of his government after a disastrous set of local elections for the Conservatives in which their vote collapsed in councils across the country and they lost the flagship West Midlands mayoralty. Sunak argued on Monday that the general election result was not a \u201cforegone conclusion\u201d despite the results, the Tories struggling to close the gap with Labour in the polls and many of his MPs privately conceding defeat was likely. Tory plotters had warned that a poor set of results could be a moment of high peril for Sunak, yet rebels laid down arms after admitting they had not persuaded enough MPs to join them to force a vote of no confidence in his leadership. The prime minister said he was \u201cabsolutely determined\u201d to fight on in the run-up to polling day, expected this autumn, to show that the government was making a difference on issues including the economy, citing tax cuts and falling inflation. As part of sweeping changes to the welfare system that have been criticised by disability groups, the government will announce on Tuesday that a plan to help the long-term sick back into work will be piloted in 15 areas of England. In a speech in the City of London, Reeves will argue that Sunak\u2019s message to voters that the economy is improving is \u201cdeluded\u201d, ahead of the release of a raft of economic data that the government hopes will help reverse its fortunes. The Bank of England\u2019s latest decision on interest rates comes on Thursday, with economists expecting the base rate to remain at 5.25% despite pressure from the government for rates to start falling before the election. Ministers may be more cheered by quarterly GDP data on Friday that is expected to show the UK has emerged from recession, while inflation figures later this month are expected to show the Bank hitting its 2% target. Reeves will tell business leaders: \u201cBy the time of the next election, we can, and should, expect interest rates to be cut, Britain to be out of recession and inflation to have returned to the Bank of England\u2019s target. Indeed, these things could happen this month. \u201cI already know what the chancellor will say in response to one or all these events happening. He has been saying it for months now: \u2018The economy is turning a corner,\u2019 \u2018our plan is working\u2019, \u2018stick with us\u2019. I want to take those arguments head on because they do not speak to the economic reality.\u201d Labour\u2019s internal research shows that Tory claims around the economy improving go down badly with the voters they need to win back at the next election, with people still feeling the pain of high inflation and mortgage rates. Focus group respondents described the economy as \u201cdamaged\u201d, \u201cfragile\u201d and \u201cunbalanced\u201d, and party strategists believe that even if people start to feel less worse off by the election, the government will not get the credit. \u201cDuring the local elections I travelled across the country. I spoke to hundreds of people. I listened to their stories,\u201d Reeves will say. \u201cAnd when they hear government ministers telling them that they have never had it so good, that they should look out for the \u2018feelgood factor\u2019, all they hear is a government that is deluded and completely out of touch with the realities on the ground. The Conservatives are gaslighting the British public.\u201d Labour plans to fight the election on the economy, believing that the government\u2019s response to global pressures and Liz Truss\u2019s disastrous mini-budget have destroyed the Tories\u2019 reputation for economic competence, while Keir Starmer\u2019s party now offers a more stable alternative. Reeves will highlight Labour\u2019s plans to boost the economy, including a national wealth fund to deliver private and public investment, changes to planning laws to build 1.5m homes, and creating 650,000 jobs in the UK\u2019s industrial heartlands. Yet the shadow chancellor, whose ambitions for the economy have tended to be laced with caution, will add: \u201cI know warm words are not enough. I do not underestimate the challenges we face.\u201d Economists have said that whoever wins the general election will face some very tough choices on tax and spending if they want to make sure the public finances do not deteriorate further. The Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation have said the economic inheritance facing the next government will arguably be one of the bleakest any has faced since the second world war. But Reeves will insist the constraints holding back Britain\u2019s potential \u201care not immutable forces\u201d and can be overcome with \u201cvision, courage and responsible government\u201d, pointing to the more active approaches of other countries. \u201cVision \u2013 to pursue a different approach, drawing on new economic thinking shaping governments in Europe, America and around the world \u2013 but which this Conservative government resists,\u201d she will add. Labour has sought inspiration from Joe Biden\u2019s plan to tackle inflation and create jobs in the US, as well as a bigger role for government in running the free-market economy, with a focus on supply-side reforms and green industrial strategy. Tory party chair Richard Holden said: \u201cLabour have no plan and would take us back to square one with higher taxes, higher unemployment, an illegal amnesty on immigration and a plot to betray pensioners.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, will seek to put pressure on Sunak to call a June general election by tabling a motion of no confidence in the government when parliament returns on Tuesday, although this has no chance of passing."

This would normally be suboptimal from a campaign perspective, but to date is having no effect on support for Donald Trump. Moreover, whether you think the US economy is going gangbusters or collapsing depends not on whether wages and employment are rising but on whether you side with Democrats or Republicans, with the latter currently reporting that economic conditions are worse than in the depths of Covid. This is what political polarisation looks like, a disease we\u2019re regularly told has spread across advanced economies, posing the biggest 21st-century threat to our democracies. Which is odd, because it\u2019s not. Recent research spells out that the US is an outlier on polarisation, defined as the extent to which you feel more negatively towards political parties other than the one you support. Examining 12 OECD countries over the past four decades, it confirms the US\u2019s polarisation surge. But there was no uniform pattern. Five countries (including France and Switzerland) had more modest increases, while six saw polarisation fall back, including Germany and the UK. Brexit was polarising but those claiming Britain\u2019s party politics is unusually divided today have forgotten a lot about the 1980s, including the miners\u2019 strike. Seeing the British electorate as two immovable blocks of support for Labour and Conservative is strange when voters handed the Tories their biggest victory since Thatcher in 2019, but are now on track to give Labour a thumping win. Just because we\u2019re having our election at the same time as the US doesn\u2019t mean our politics has much in common. The defining feature of British voters? Not that they\u2019re polarised, but that they\u2019re pissed off and volatile. \u2022 Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation and author of Great Britain?

            "date": "2024-05-17T15:36:50Z",
            "content": "The US, whose founders tried to emulate the laws and governmental structures of the Roman republic, is headed for a similarly self-inflicted collapse, director Francis Ford Coppola has said at the premiere of his first film in more than a decade. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in America, in our republic, in our democracy, is exactly how Rome lost their republic thousands of years ago,\u201d Coppola told a press conference at the Cannes film festival on Friday. \u201cOur politics has taken us to the point where we might lose our republic.\u201d \u201cAmerica was founded on the ideas of the Roman republic,\u201d Coppola added. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want a king, Rome didn\u2019t want a king, so they invented a new form of government called the republic with the Senate and with Roman law and with all of the things which we embrace.\u201d Megalopolis, which premiered at Cannes on Thursday night, draws inspiration from the Catiline conspiracy to overthrow the rules of the Roman republic in 63BC and is set in a New York-like metropolis of the future. Even though the 85-year-old veteran director first started developing his passion project in the 1980s, he said the analogy had only become more prescient in recent years. \u201cMy feeling was to make a Roman epic set in modern America, and I had no idea that the politics of today would make that so relevant.\u201d The Roman republic, which had elements of modern democracy, in its last years succumbed to economic problems, corruption and the rise of Julius Caesar as a dictator. The maker of Apocalypse Now, The Conversation and The Godfather said he was observing a trend \u201ctowards the more neo-right, even fascist tradition\u201d not just in the US but across the globe, \u201cwhich is frightening, because \u2026 anyone who was alive during World War II saw the horrors that took place, and we don\u2019t want a repeat of that\u201d. Coppola acknowledged that not everyone shared his opinion and nodded towards Jon Voight a few seats to his left, who had \u201cdifferent political opinions than me\u201d. Voight, who plays the banker Hamilton Crassus III in Megalopolis, was one of Hollywood\u2019s most prominent supporters of former US president Donald Trump. Decline was a theme that Coppola detected not just in US political culture but in its once all-dominant film industry. \u201cThe film industry has become more a matter of people being hired to meet their debt obligations, because the studios are in great debt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the job is not so much to make good movies. The job is to make sure that they pay their debt obligations.\u201d Newer companies such as Amazon, Apple and Microsoft were temporarily stepping in to finance Hollywood\u2019s film industry but couldn\u2019t be relied on to do so in the long run, he said. \u201cIt might be that the studios that we knew for so long, some wonderful ones, are not to be here in the future any more.\u201d Reviews for Megalopolis have been mixed, with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw calling it a \u201cbloated, boring and bafflingly shallow film\u201d, while Time said the film was a \u201cmessy, imaginative sprawl\u201d containing \u201cgorgeous, poetic images\u201d. Coppola sounded unregretful about the $120m project that he largely self-financed. \u201cThere are many people, when they die, they say: \u2018Oh, I wish I had done this, I wish I had done that\u2019. But when I die, I\u2019m going to say: \u2018I\u2019ve got to do this and I\u2019ve got to see my daughter win an Oscar and I\u2019ve got to make wine and I\u2019ve got to make every movie I wanted to make.\u201d The director, whose wife Eleanor died last month, aged 87, added: \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to be so busy thinking of all the things that I\u2019ve got to do that when I die, I won\u2019t notice it.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-16T07:09:01Z",
            "content": "Mike Hixenbaugh had been a journalist for years, reporting on a variety of topics ranging from education policy to healthcare, the military and other subjects, when one day he discovered a potential story literally in his front yard. It was the summer of 2020, and in response to a local Facebook thread spreading false information about antifa operating in his neighborhood, Hixenbaugh and his wife, who is Black, put up a Black Lives Matter lawn sign in their front yard. The response was prompt: \u201cEvery weekend for two months after my wife put the sign up, someone drove their four-wheeler into our yard and did donuts in it, churning up deep divots in the grass.\u201d At that point, Hixenbaugh realized that something had been happening in his quiet suburb, something that was probably very big \u2013 unraveling just what was afoot would be the journalistic work of years, and would ultimately result in his new book, They Came for the Schools. Looking at the wider phenomenon of conservative pushback against recent cultural movements meant to address things like systemic racism and the rights and inclusion of LGBTQ+ individuals, Hixenbaugh focuses on public schools as a flashpoint. Speaking with one Black mother from Dallas suburb Southlake, he reports that \u201cin exchange for an elite public school education, her children had dealt with near-daily insults \u2013 some subtle, some less so \u2013 which she said they\u2019d been conditioned to accept as a normal part of life.\u201d The mother, he states, was extremely upset to watch \u201cmembers of her community rise up in recent months to oppose efforts that she believed would make Carroll safer and more welcoming for children like hers\u201d. Much of Hixenbaugh\u2019s book focuses on giving voice to the very human toll of this backlash and trying to understand what would motivate people to come out so vigorously against educators and policies intended to make schools a safer place for all. \u201cThese are proxies for a much bigger clash in society and what America stands for and is,\u201d he told me via interview. \u201cGroups that have been lobbying for their world view for decades have hitched their wagon to this battle.\u201d One case that he looks at in detail is that of Em Ramser, who in January 2021 was a 25-year-old, teaching in her first year at Grapevine High School. Prior to writing his book, Hixenbaugh reported on Ramser\u2019s story in great detail, and he came to know her well. \u201cAs a queer person who grew up in a community where she was not validated,\u201d he told me, \u201cshe wanted to create a classroom that was welcoming.\u201d Trouble arose for Ramser when one student in particular, who has been assigned male at birth, asked Ramser to identify her as a girl and to go by her chosen name of \u201cRen\u201d. Soon thereafter, Ramser was shocked to find that Ren had gone missing, choosing to run away from a very religious mother who for years had told Ren her identity was immoral, and who had rejected Ren when she tried to come out. Ren was eventually returned to her mother, who accused Ramser of attempting to indoctrinate her child with a book titled The Prince and the Dressmaker, a graphic novel that deals with cross-gender themes. After Ren\u2019s mother told her story to a far-right newspaper, Ramser\u2019s inbox began to fill up with hate-laden messages. \u201cYou have this beloved teacher, who is painted as perverted radical political actor,\u201d Hixenbaugh told me. \u201cIt was just so far from the reality. When you apply these strategies to a school, you end up harming teachers and students who aren\u2019t playing a political game.\u201d Ren\u2019s father, who lives in Oregon, was eventually granted custody of his daughter, who eventually began a gender transition via hormone replacement therapy, and according to reports is now living happily as a young woman. Meanwhile in Grapevine, the issue lives on, Ren\u2019s mother becoming a folk-hero of the right; riding her story, far-right candidates had captured control of the school board and had introduced harsh policies meant to curb actions designed to make the school more welcoming for Black and queer students, as well as those from other marginalized groups. After having her classroom stripped of many of the things that had felt so meaningful to her, Ramser felt terrible. \u201cShe was advised not to comment, so she felt voiceless,\u201d said Hixenbaugh. But after talking with the reporter for his story, things changed. \u201cShe said this was her chance to reclaim her voice, and this was something she emphasized for her kids, not being silenced. She felt good to have her side out there.\u201d Hixenbaugh shared that, at times, he could also find himself the victim of the political forces that he reported on. He said that while working on a story on book bans, he interviewed a 17-year-old queer student whose story he included in his piece. \u201cThe next day, my phone was blowing up with bullshit messages,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey wanted to file a police report against me for soliciting a minor, and they accused me of being a sexual predator. I\u2019ve got a thick skin for the most part, but these accusations of being a child predator, and of calling the police, this was beyond the pale. It knocked the wind out of me.\u201d In addition to reporting from the front lines of these battles over schools and libraries, They Came for the Schools also goes deeply into the history of these movements, and how contemporary campaigns against things like LGBTQ+ inclusion are reminiscent of earlier battles. \u201cIn yearbooks in the 1980s, you can see kids in blackface. Thirty years ago there were these same complaints,\u201d he told me. \u201cBattles over sex ed, integration, and secular humanism were such a powerful wedge in the \u201970s and \u201980s. You could literally swap \u2018critical race theory\u2019 for \u2018secular humanism\u2019 into those stories, and it would sound like a current story.\u201d After years of reporting on these battles, Hixenbaugh and his family eventually made the choice to relocate to an environment that felt safer for them. Their story mirrors many others \u2013 according to one estimate, the explosion of anti-LGBTQ+ laws in recent years has led to hundreds of thousands of internal refugees, possibly the largest such involuntary migration in the US since the Dust Bowl. Hixenbaugh fears that if Donald Trump is elected president, his agenda will be \u201cto make America Southlake\u201d, essentially a nationalization of the policies pioneered in states like Florida and Texas. If that were to come true, perhaps there would be nowhere in the US for Hixenbaugh and his family to find a home that feels safe. They Came for the Schools is published in the US by HarperCollins"

            "date": "2024-05-30T20:01:06Z",
            "content": "The Biden campaign launched a new attack against Donald Trump, accusing him of racism after a former producer on The Apprentice said he used an anti-Black slur on the set. Meanwhile, jury deliberations are ongoing in Trump\u2019s business fraud trial in New York City, and a verdict could be delivered at anytime. Earlier in the day, the supreme court released a batch of new opinions, covering topics from banking regulation to free speech rights. But the conservative-dominated court did not yet weigh in on Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from prosecution over the 2020 election, or two abortion-related cases, all of which remain pending before the justices. Another batch of opinions is expected next Thursday. Here\u2019s what else happened today: Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman and Trump antagonist, proposed a way to force conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas to recuse themselves from January 6 cases. John Roberts, the supreme court\u2019s chief justice, declined a request for a meeting from two Democratic senators concerned over Alito\u2019s flag flap. Do swing state voters care if Trump is convicted in his New York business fraud trial? Our reporters searched for the answer. Most evidence in the New York case seems to point to Trump\u2019s guilt, but the jury could reach a variety of conclusions. Trump can sue his niece Mary Trump for potentially violating the terms of a settlement over his father\u2019s estate, a New York state appeals court ruled. Should Donald Trump win the November election, the Guardian\u2019s Robert Tait reports that his ally, speaker of the House Mike Johnson, is prepared to move quickly to pass his agenda through Congress. Here\u2019s what Johnson told Semafor he is looking at: Mike Johnson, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, is planning a sweeping ideological legislative drive that aims to make Donald Trump \u201cthe most consequential president of the modern era\u201d if the Republicans win power in November. A far-reaching bill containing a range of policy priorities at once \u2013 including tax cuts worth trillions, border security and rolling back Obamacare \u2013 is being prepared to avoid the mistakes the GOP believed happened early in Trump\u2019s first term, when Johnson says the party wasted time because its victory over Hillary Clinton took it by surprise. In an interview with Semafor, Johnson said he had already spoken to Trump about introducing an omnibus package immediately after he retakes office. \u201cI told him that I believe he can be the most consequential president of the modern era, if we are focused on a policy and agenda-driven administration and Congress \u2013 and that\u2019s our intention,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to make the mistake that we made in the past. Back in the 2017 timeframe and in previous years, we Republicans kind of took a single-subject approach. We did one round of healthcare reform, one round of tax reform. But for [fiscal year 2025], we want to have a much larger scope, multiple issues to address in addition to the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\u201d For the second time in as many days, Donald Trump has defended supreme court justice Samuel Alito amid criticism from Democrats over his display of flags associated with rightwing causes. Alito, an appointee of Republican president George W Bush, is a reliably conservative vote on the court, and Trump has loudly denounced the Democratic lawmakers who have called for him to recuse himself from cases dealing with January. Here\u2019s what the ex-president wrote, on Truth Social: \u2018Playing the Ref\u2019 with Justice Alito doesn\u2019t work. It works with many others, but not with him! Here\u2019s more from the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington about the firestorm around conservative supreme court justice Samuel Alito, and the rightwing flags found flying at his residences: Justice Samuel Alito is rejecting calls to step aside from supreme court cases involving the former president Donald Trump and January 6 defendants because of the controversy over flags that flew over his homes. In letters to members of Congress on Wednesday, Alito says his wife was responsible for flying an upside-down US flag over his home in 2021 and an \u201cAppeal to Heaven\u201d flag at his New Jersey beach house last year. Neither incident merits his recusal, he wrote. \u201cI am therefore duty-bound to reject your recusal request,\u201d he wrote. The court is considering two major cases related to the 6 January 2021 attack by a mob of Trump supporters on the Capitol, including charges faced by the rioters and whether the former president has immunity from prosecution on election-interference charges. Alito has rejected calls from Democrats in the past to recuse on other issues. In his letter to the Democratic leaders of the Senate judiciary committee, supreme court chief justice John Roberts argued it would be inappropriate to meet with them. \u201cI must respectfully decline your request for a meeting,\u201d wrote Roberts, who was appointed by Republican president George W Bush, and is considered among the more moderate of the court\u2019s conservative justices. He continued in the letter addressed to the committee\u2019s chair Dick Durbin and senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who chairs the subcommittee on federal courts: As noted in my letter to Chairman Durbin last April, apart from ceremonial events, only on rare occasions in our Nation\u2019s history has a sitting Chief Justice met with legislators, even in a public setting (such as a Committee hearing) with members of both major political parties present. Separation of powers concerns and the importance of preserving judicial independence counsel against such appearances. Moreover, the format proposed \u2013 a meeting with leaders of only one party who have expressed an interest in matters currently pending before the Court \u2013 simply underscores that participating in such a meeting would be inadvisable. Last week, the two Democrats had requested a meeting with Roberts, after reports emerged that conservative justice Samuel Alito had flown flags associated with rightwing causes at two of his properties. \u201cWe therefore call for Justice Alito to recuse himself from certain proceedings as outlined above, renew our call for the Supreme Court to adopt an enforceable code of conduct for Supreme Court justices, and request a meeting with you as soon as possible. Until the Court and the Judicial Conference take meaningful action to address this ongoing ethical crisis, we will continue our efforts to enact legislation to resolve this crisis,\u201d Durbin and Whitehouse wrote to Roberts. John Roberts, the chief justice of the US supreme court, has rebuffed a request from senior Democratic US senators to meet as the lawmakers push for supreme court justice Samuel Alito to recuse himself from cases before the court that relate to Donald Trump and will ripple into the 2024 presidential election. Roberts declined an invitation to talk about supreme court ethics and the controversy over flags that flew outside homes owned by Alito, the Associated Press further reports. Roberts\u2019 response came in a letter to Democratic senators Dick Durbin a day after Alito separately wrote to them and House of Representatives members to reject their demands that he recuse himself from major cases involving Trump and the January 6 rioters because of the flags, which are like those carried by some rioters at the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Senate judiciary committee chair Dick Durbin of Illinois and senator and committee member Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island had written Roberts a week ago to ask for the meeting and ask that Roberts take steps to ensure that Alito recuses himself from any cases before the court concerning the January 6 attack or former president Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump, the Guardian adds, is being prosecuted in a federal criminal case on charges relating to election interference and obstructing an official proceeding. The supreme court will rule next month on two cases before it that have grave implications in that case, and for the election. A recap that a year ago a judge in New York threw out Donald Trump\u2019s 2021 lawsuit accusing New York Times reporters of an \u201cinsidious plot\u201d to obtain his tax records. Trump was ordered to pay all attorneys\u2019 fees and legal expenses that the Times and its reporters had incurred. The lawsuit alleged that the newspaper sought out Trump\u2019s niece Mary Trump and persuaded her \u201cto smuggle the records out of her attorney\u2019s office\u201d. At the time, Trump\u2019s claim against his niece had not been ruled on. Today, we learned that Donald is permitted to proceed with suing Mary. The Times\u2019s 2018 Pulitzer-winning stories relied on information from Mary Trump to cast doubt on the ex-president\u2019s claims that he was a self-made millionaire, showing that he had inherited hundreds of millions through \u201cdubious tax schemes\u201d. The series also revealed a history of tax avoidance. Robert Reed, the New York supreme court justice, said at the time of his ruling, in May 2023, that Trump\u2019s claims \u201cfail as a matter of constitutional law\u201d, which allows for reporters to engage in legal, ordinary news-gathering. \u201cThese actions are at the very core of protected first amendment activity,\u201d Reed wrote. Alina Habba, a lawyer for Donald Trump, said the former president looked forward to holding his niece, Mary Trump, \u201cfully accountable for her blatant and egregious breach of contract\u201d in her exchanges with New York Times journalists for a story about her uncle\u2019s finances and evasive tax habits. Thursday\u2019s decision upheld a June 2023 ruling by Justice Robert Reed of the New York state supreme court. Also, Reed had dismissed Donald Trump\u2019s claims against the New York Times and three reporters, and in January ordered him to pay $392,639 of their legal fees, Reuters reports. In November 2022, Reed dismissed Mary Trump\u2019s separate lawsuit accusing her uncle and two of his siblings of defrauding her out of a multimillion-dollar inheritance. The New York Times\u2019 reporting challenged Donald Trump\u2019s claim that he was a self-made billionaire. It said he received the equivalent of $413m from his father, largely the result of \u201cdubious\u201d tax schemes in the 1990s, including undervaluing his family\u2019s real estate holdings. Donald Trump has denied wrongdoing. Mary Trump previously identified herself as a Times source in her 2020 tell-all bestseller Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man. Here\u2019s more on the news that a court has said Donald Trump can sue his niece Mary Trump. The court in New York ruled that the former president can sue Mary Trump, 59, a psychologist and writer, for supplying information to the New York Times as part of its coverage into the then president\u2019s finances and his alleged effort to avoid taxes. The coverage won the Pulitzer prize. The appellate division in Manhattan found a \u201csubstantial\u201d legal basis for Donald Trump to claim that his niece violated confidentiality provisions of a 2001 settlement over the estate of his father, Fred Trump Sr, Reuters reports. A five-judge panel said it was unclear whether Mary Trump\u2019s disclosures were subject to confidentiality, or how long both sides intended the provisions to remain in effect. It also signaled that Donald Trump might deserve only minimal damages, not the $100m he sought. The court said: At a minimum, nominal damages may still be available on the breach of contract claim even in the absence of actual damages. Lawyers for Mary Trump said the lawsuit violated a state law barring frivolous cases designed to silence critics and \u201cchill and retaliate against\u201d their free speech. These cases are called strategic lawsuits against public participation, or Slapps. Anne Champion, Mary Trump\u2019s lawyer, said in a statement: Mary has made valuable contributions to the public\u2019s knowledge of the former president with her unique perspective as a family member. We are confident she will be vindicated as the case proceeds. Champion also said Donald Trump \u201ccan claim no injury for the publication of truthful information.\u201d A New York state appeals court said Donald Trump can sue his niece Mary Trump for giving the New York Times information for its Pulitzer Prize-winning 2018 probe into his finances and his alleged effort to avoid taxes. The appellate division in Manhattan found a \u201csubstantial\u201d legal basis for Donald Trump to claim that his niece violated confidentiality provisions of a 2001 settlement over the estate of his father, Fred Trump Sr, Reuters reports. More to come on this. Adding from the Guardian, Trump originally sued his estranged niece and the New York Times in 2021 over a 2018 story about his family\u2019s wealth and tax practices that was partly based on confidential documents she provided to the newspaper\u2019s reporters, and there has been a whole legal odyssey ever since. The Biden campaign has launched a new attack against Donald Trump, accusing him of racism after a former producer on The Apprentice said he used an anti-Black racial slur on the set. Meanwhile, jury deliberations are ongoing in Trump\u2019s business fraud trial in New York City, and a verdict could be delivered at anytime. Earlier in the day, the supreme court released a batch of new opinions, covering topics from banking regulation to free speech rights. But the conservative-dominated court did not yet weigh in on Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from prosecution over the 2020 election, or two abortion-related cases, all of which remain pending before the justices. Another batch of opinions is expected next Thursday. Here\u2019s what else has happened today: Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman and Trump antagonist, proposed a way to force conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas to recuse themselves from January 6 cases. Do swing state voters care if Trump is convicted in his New York business fraud trial? Our reporters searched for the answer. Most evidence in the New York case seems to point to Trump\u2019s guilt, but the jury could rule in any direction. In a statement, the Biden campaign\u2019s Black media director, Jasmine Harris, accused Donald Trump of racism after a former producer on The Apprentice accused him of using a racial slur on set: No one is surprised that Donald Trump, who entered public life by falsely accusing Black men of murder and entered political life spreading lies about the first Black president, reportedly used the N-word to casually denigrate a successful Black man. Anyone notice a pattern? Donald Trump is exactly who Black voters know him to be: a textbook racist who disrespects and attacks the Black community every chance he gets, and the most ignorant man to ever run for president. It\u2019s why Black voters kicked him out of the White House in 2020, and it\u2019s why they\u2019ll make him a loser a second time this November. In addition to handing the National Rifle Association a lifeline in its lawsuit against New York state, the supreme court also denied resentencing to an Arizona man on death row, the Guardian\u2019s Joanna Walters reports: The US supreme court issued opinions on Thursday relating to free speech and the death penalty, in one case clearing the way for a National Rifle Association (NRA) lawsuit against a former New York state official. The court gave a boost to the influential gun rights group that has accused the official of coercing banks and insurers to avoid doing business with it and, in the process, violating the NRA\u2019s free speech rights. The justices, in a unanimous decision from the nine-member bench, threw out a lower court\u2019s ruling that dismissed the NRA\u2019s 2018 lawsuit against Maria Vullo, a former superintendent of New York\u2019s department of financial services. The NRA, in the case NRA v Vullo, claimed that Vullo unlawfully retaliated against it following a mass shooting in which 17 people were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida. The NRA was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Biden administration argued some of its claims should go forward, an unusual alliance between often opposing parties considering the NRA is a strongly Republican-aligned organization. Meanwhile, the supreme court, in a 6-3 decision, struck down an appeals court ruling giving Danny Lee Jones a new sentencing hearing in a death penalty case in Arizona. The conservative supermajority decided that errors in Jones\u2019s legal defense, in the case Thornell v Jones, did not justify him having a chance at resentencing. The supreme court just scheduled its next opinion release day. The court is expected to issue more decisions on Thursday, 6 June. Among the pending cases is Donald Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from prosecution over trying to overturn the 2020 election, and two lawsuits related to abortion access. If a New York jury finds Trump guilty of business fraud charges, what impact would it have on the election? Reporting from two swing states, the Guardian\u2019s Alice Herman and George Chidi looked for the answer: For Josh Ellis, a refrigerator technician from southern Wisconsin, Donald Trump\u2019s trial in New York is a sideshow. He\u2019s not convinced of the prosecution\u2019s narrative, or the former president\u2019s \u2013 and the verdict will not likely affect his vote in November, anyway. \u201cBiden\u2019s running this country into the ground,\u201d said Ellis, who said the economy is his main concern. At 49, Ellis has long viewed politicians as out-of-touch on economic issues; he used to vote for Democrats, but switched in 2016 to vote for Trump, who he saw as possibly offering a change. The jurors in Trump\u2019s New York trial are deliberating over the question of whether or not Trump unlawfully falsified business records to hide a sex scandal before the 2016 election \u2013 and it\u2019s not clear how much of an impact their verdict will have on voters, despite the historic nature of a possible conviction. Like Ellis, voters across the country seem ambivalent about Trump\u2019s criminal charges. Denise White, who helps manage a social services agency in Atlanta, wears her cynicism about the trial like armor. \u201cPrivilege,\u201d she said. \u201cPatriarchy. All of that is on full display right now. And I am not confident that there will be a just outcome.\u201d A former producer on The Apprentice, the reality show Donald Trump hosted prior to going into politics, recounted that the then New York real estate mogul used a racial slur in a recorded conversation. Trump used the word when discussing Kwame Jackson, a Black finalist on the show who at the time was working at investment bank Goldman Sachs, writes Bill Pruitt in a piece for Slate: \u2018I think Kwame would be a great addition to the organization,\u2019 Kepcher says to Trump, who winces while his head bobs around in reaction to what he is hearing and clearly resisting. \u2018Why didn\u2019t he just fire her?\u2019 Trump asks, referring to Omarosa. It\u2019s a reasonable question. Given that this the first time we\u2019ve ever been in this situation, none of this is something we expected. \u2018That\u2019s not his job,\u2019 Bienstock says to Trump. \u2018That\u2019s yours.\u2019 Trump\u2019s head continues to bob. \u2018I don\u2019t think he knew he had the ability to do that,\u2019 Kepcher says. Trump winces again. \u2018Yeah,\u2019 he says to no one in particular, \u2018but, I mean, would America buy a [N-word] winning?\u2019 Kepcher\u2019s pale skin goes bright red. I turn my gaze toward Trump. He continues to wince. He is serious, and he is adamant about not hiring Jackson. Pruitt says he is coming forward with his story now because a non-disclosure agreement he signed when coming onto the show expired. For his part, a spokesman for Trump, Steven Cheung, told Slate, \u201cThis is a completely fabricated and bullshit story that was already peddled in 2016\u201d and which is only coming to light now because Democrats are \u201cdesperate\u201d. The supreme court will likely announce more opinions sometime in June. Meanwhile, in New York City, jurors are on their second day of deliberations in Donald Trump\u2019s business fraud trial. The Guardian\u2019s Victoria Bekiempis reports on two notes sent by the jury to the court, that may offer hints at how their discussions are going: Donald Trump\u2019s criminal hush-money case in New York enters its second day of jury deliberations on Thursday with panelists weighing whether a payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels was part of a plot to sway the 2016 election. The jurors deliberated for approximately four and a half hours on Wednesday after beginning their discussions at about 11.30am. Outside of the courtroom on Wednesday, Trump ranted about the proceedings and likened himself to a saint, claiming in the hallway: \u201cMother Teresa could not beat these charges. The charges are rigged. The whole thing is rigged.\u201d Earlier in the day, the jury sent two notes to the court in the afternoon. One missive was a request to hear some trial testimony from two key witnesses. The second message was a request to re-hear Judge Juan Merchan\u2019s instructions to them. After receiving more information from jurors about which instructions they wanted re-read, Merchan went through the requested directives: they wanted guidance about how to interpret evidence and draw inferences from facts. The jurors seemed attentive during Merchan\u2019s re-reading. Some scribbled on notepads. Others eyed Merchan intently as he read through the instructions. One sometimes handled a pen in a way that seemingly hearkened back to the purpose of a fidget spinner; using the writing implement as passive physical activity while paying attention to Merchan and jotting notes. In a unanimous opinion, the supreme court allowed a lawsuit brought against the New York state government by the National Rifle Association to proceed on free speech grounds. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press on the court\u2019s decision in National Rifle Association of America v Vullo: The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for a National Rifle Association lawsuit against a former New York state official over claims she violated its free-speech rights. The unanimous opinion reverses a lower-court decision tossing out the gun rights group\u2019s lawsuit against ex-New York state Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo. It does not, however, shield the NRA and other advocacy groups from regulation, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said. \u201cUltimately, the critical takeaway is that the First Amendment prohibits government officials from wielding their power selectively to punish or suppress speech, directly or (as alleged here) through private intermediaries,\u201d she wrote. The NRA said Vullo pressured banks and insurance companies to blacklist it after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead in 2018. The group was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Biden administration argued some of its claims should go forward. The supreme court has finished releasing opinions for the day, without weighing in on Donald Trump\u2019s immunity claim, or the two abortion-related cases pending before the justices. The court issued two unanimous decisions, one dealing with banking regulations, and the other regarding a free speech claim made in a lawsuit between the National Rifle Association and the New York department of financial services. Its third decision was a 6-3 split between the conservative supermajority and the liberal minority, and reversed an appeals court decision in a death penalty case. The supreme court has issued two opinions so far, both on less politically charged matters before the court. Further decisions are expected, and we will let you know what they are. It\u2019s nearly 10am in Washington DC, which means the supreme court will begin releasing opinions or, at least, an opinion, shortly. We only find out which cases they have decided when the opinions come out. While the conservative-dominated court could issue its much-awaited decisions on Donald Trump\u2019s immunity claim, emergency abortions or the abortion pill mifepristone, it could also issue opinions on other less anticipated \u2013 but still important \u2013 cases. We\u2019ll know for sure in a few minutes. Meanwhile, in New York City, jurors will continue deliberating over whether Donald Trump is guilty of falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments ahead of the 2016 election. The Guardian\u2019s Hugo Lowell reports that prosecutors have presented a mass of evidence pointing to his guilt \u2013 but whether jurors will agree is, as always, an open question: As the jury began deliberations on Wednesday, Donald Trump appeared to have little room to extricate himself from the mass of evidence presented in the weeks-long case. A recording of Trump directing hush money to be paid in cash. Handwritten notes by Trump\u2019s ex-chief financial officer about how to reimburse Cohen. A parade of witnesses who testified the Trump campaign was desperate to suppress the story of his affair with the adult film star Stormy Daniels. That evidence fitted in to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s case that Trump caused false entries to be made in the Trump Organization\u2019s business records and that the falsifications were done as part of a plot to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of felony falsification of business records. And the jury will now have to decide whether prosecutors proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt, or whether the Trump\u2019s defense lawyers poked enough holes in the prosecution\u2019s case. Clarence Thomas\u2019s wife called for the 2020 election to be overturned. Samuel Alito had rightwing flags flying at two of his properties. Yet both conservative justices are set to rule on Donald Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from prosecution for his election meddling, despite calls from Democrats that they step back from that and other cases because they are conflicted. In an opinion essay published in the New York Times, Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin, a prominent Trump antagonist in the House of Representatives, proposed a novel way to force the two justices off the case: The US Department of Justice \u2013 including the US attorney for the District of Columbia, an appointed US special counsel and the solicitor general, all of whom were involved in different ways in the criminal prosecutions underlying these cases and are opposing Mr Trump\u2019s constitutional and statutory claims \u2013 can petition the other seven justices to require Justices Alito and Thomas to recuse themselves not as a matter of grace but as a matter of law. The Justice Department and Attorney General Merrick Garland can invoke two powerful textual authorities for this motion: the Constitution of the United States, specifically the due process clause, and the federal statute mandating judicial disqualification for questionable impartiality, 28 USC Section 455. The Constitution has come into play in several recent Supreme Court decisions striking down rulings by stubborn judges in lower courts whose political impartiality has been reasonably questioned but who threw caution to the wind to hear a case anyway. This statute requires potentially biased judges throughout the federal system to recuse themselves at the start of the process to avoid judicial unfairness and embarrassing controversies and reversals. We\u2019ll have to see if the justice department takes him up on this strategy. Meanwhile, the Trump immunity case could be among those released at 10am ET, when the supreme court issues decisions. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Right off the bat this morning, at 10am ET, the supreme court will issue opinions, potentially on some of the closely watched cases the justices have yet to rule on. Among these is Donald Trump\u2019s petition for immunity from the federal charges brought against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election, as well as a pair of cases dealing with abortion access. One concerns whether the Biden administration can require hospitals in states with strict bans on the procedure to perform the procedure in emergencies, and the other deals with a conservative effort to roll back the availability of abortion pill mifepristone. With six conservative justices and three liberal justices, the court has a pronounced rightwing tilt, but plenty of uncertainty remains, and, as alway, we do not know in advance which cases they will rule on, or how many opinions they will issue. A ruling in the Trump case would present an interesting split-screen with the scene in New York, where jurors are beginning their second day of deliberations in his business fraud trial. There\u2019s no telling when they will reach a verdict, but however they find the former president will undoubtedly send shockwaves through the 2024 election campaign. Here\u2019s what else is happening today: A group of Senate Democrats are demanding the justice department investigate oil companies and executives after the Federal Trade Commission accused a former petroleum executive of colluding to raise gas prices. Joe Biden is spending the day in his home state of Delaware, after yesterday making a push to rally Black voters by holding a rare joint rally with Kamala Harris in Philadelphia. Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman, argued in the New York Times that there is a way to force conservative supreme court justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas to recuse themselves from cases dealing with the 2020 election, amid reports of their connections to rightwing causes."

            "date": "2024-05-25T22:01:47Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has called newly graduating US military officers the \u201cguardians of American democracy\u201d at a commencement speech in New York state, where the US president, without mentioning Donald Trump by name, gave strong warnings of unprecedented threats to US freedom. Biden told the West Point military academy graduating class of 2024 that it is being called upon to tackle threats across the globe as well as preserve America\u2019s ideals at home. The president, speaking in front of about 1,000 graduating cadets at the US army training academy on Saturday, urged the newly minted officers to \u201chold fast\u201d to their military oath \u201cnot to a political party, not to a president but to the constitution of the United States of America, against all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d. In remarks that could be seen as a thinly veiled reference to the threat to democracy Biden believes Trump poses to the US as the two candidates battle for the White House in this November\u2019s election, the president said that the oath taken by the military is \u201cas important to your nation now as it ever has been\u201d. \u201cFrom the very beginning, nothing is guaranteed about democracy in America. Every generation has an obligation to defend it, protect it, preserve it \u2013 now it is your turn,\u201d said Biden, who cited the right to vote, the right to worship and the right to protest as key freedoms that require \u201cconstant vigilance\u201d. The president said that the US was founded on an idea of equality but that \u201cideas need defenders to make them real and that\u2019s what you, the class of 2024, are all about. The defenders of freedom, champions of liberty, guardians \u2013 and I mean this \u2013 guardians of American democracy. You must keep us free at this time, like none before.\u201d Trump has said he will attempt to lock up political opponents if he becomes president again, having previously, while in the White House, urged the military to crush protestors and \u201ccrack skulls\u201d in doing so. During nationwide protests in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in 2020, Trump said that he wanted soldiers to \u201cdominate the streets\u201d. Meanwhile, Biden outlined a global situation that he said had placed unprecedented challenges upon the US military, warning that the cadets are \u201cgraduating into a world like none before \u2026 There\u2019s never been a time in history when we\u2019ve asked our military to do so many many different things in so many different places around the world, all at the same time.\u201d The president reaffirmed that the US will continue \u201cstanding strong\u201d with Ukraine in the face of a \u201cbrutal tyrant\u201d in the form of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, although again reiterated no US troops will be sent to the conflict. Biden said that the Nato alliance was \u201cstronger than ever\u201d, praised the US military for its efforts in erecting a pier \u201cin record time\u201d and delivering air drops to provide aid to Palestinians suffering amid Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. This, despite severe logistical problems with using the pier to get aid to those who need it. Delivery operations that began from the pier after it was completed earlier this month were halted almost immediately after desperate people seized most of the shipment last week. Then on Saturday, heavy seas severely disrupted US vessels, the military reported. In other parts of the globe, Biden said, the US was \u201cstanding up for peace and stability\u201d regarding the threat posed by China to Taiwan. \u201cThe upshot of all of this, across vastly different regions and very different challenges, our men and women in uniform are hard at work strengthening our alliances,\u201d Biden said, adding that the military was \u201cstanding up to tyrants and safeguarding the peace and protecting freedom and openness. We are doing what only America can do, as the indispensable nation.\u201d Biden is scheduled to participate in Memorial Day services at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on Monday and D-Day ceremonies in France a week later. On Saturday, he made his first address at West Point as president, having twice addressed a graduating class of cadets when he was vice-president. The elite training academy is about 40 miles north of New York City, at a strategic spot high above a bend in the Hudson River that Biden reminded those gathered had been key to George Washington\u2019s fight and eventual victory for American independence against the British. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee to run against Biden in the 2024 election, was the last president to speak at a West Point commencement, in 2020. Reuters contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-05-18T18:34:31Z",
            "content": "Georgia\u2019s president has vetoed a \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that has split the country and appealed to the government not to overrule her over a law she said was \u201cRussian in sprit and essence\u201d. Salome Zourabichvili followed through on her stated intention to use her veto on Saturday although the governing Georgian Dream party has the votes to disregard her intervention. \u201cToday I vetoed a Russian law,\u201d she said. \u201cThis law is Russian in its essence and spirit. \u201cIt contradicts our constitution and all European standards, therefore it represents an obstacle to our European path.\u201d Under the law on transparency of foreign influence, which passed its third and final reading last Tuesday, civil society organisations and media receiving more than 20% of their revenues from abroad will be obliged to register \u201corganisations serving the interests of a foreign power\u201d. The legislation has brought hundreds of thousands of people out on to the streets of the capital Tbilisi who accuse the government of trying to smear dissenting voices as traitors. The legislation is regarded as a copy of a law introduced in Russia in 2012 and which was used as a tool for repressing those with sympathies to the west. The EU has said that the law will be an obstacle to the country\u2019s accession to the bloc while the US has warned that the legislation and the government\u2019s anti-western rhetoric is turning Georgia into an \u201cadversary\u201d and that it could pull billions in economic and military aid. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said in a statement that the veto offered Georgia\u2019s government a way out of the crisis. He said: \u201cPresident Salome Zourabichvil\u2019s veto of the transparency law offers a moment for further reflection. In its current form the law is not in line with EU values and path. \u201cI call on all politicians and leaders in Georgia to make good use of this window of opportunity and ensure Georgia stays on the European course the population supports. I continue [to] closely monitor developments in Georgia.\u201d Under the Georgian constitution, a president has two weeks to either sign and promulgate the law or send an argued alternative back to the parliament in the form of \u201cjustified remarks.\u201d The prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, has suggested he would open the law to amendments but opposition groups see that as a trap designed to take the energy out of the protests that have swelled Tbilisi\u2019s streets in the last month. Zourabichvili called a press conference on Saturday to tell reporters that she had effectively vetoed the bill through her proposed changes. \u201cThis law must be repealed,\u201d she said. A failure by parliament to vote on the president\u2019s proposals could effectively kill the bill. The constitution does not stipulate how long MPs can wait to hold a vote. Parliament can reject the president\u2019s changes and pass the initial bill if it can find 76 out of 150 possible votes, sending it back to the president within three days for signature and promulgation within five days. The governing Georgian Dream party has 90 seats. If the president does not sign it, the bill passes to the speaker of parliament for their signature. Georgia will hold a general election in October. Tina Bokuchava, leader of the parliamentary party of the main opposition, the United National Movement, said: \u201cYoung people, who have flooded the streets of our cities to protest in recent weeks, will applaud this decision, while also knowing the battle is not yet won. \u201cA severe contest now lies ahead between those who want Georgia\u2019s future to be at the heart of Europe, and those who would take us back to the darkest days of Russian rule.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-05-20T10:56:00Z",
            "content": "The hardline Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has died in a helicopter crash in foggy weather in the mountains near the border with Azerbaijan. The charred wreckage of the aircraft, which crashed on Sunday carrying Raisi, as well as the foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and six other passengers and crew, was found early on Monday after an overnight search in blizzard conditions. Fears had been growing for Raisi, a 63-year-old ultraconservative, after contact was lost with the helicopter on Sunday as it navigated fog-covered mountains in north-west Iran. The country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2013 who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran\u2019s nuclear programme \u2013 said the country\u2019s first vice-president, Mohammad Mokhber, would take over as interim president. The deputy foreign minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, was appointed as acting foreign minister. \u201cI announce five days of public mourning and offer my condolences to the dear people of Iran,\u201d Khamenei said. Mokhber, like Raisi, is seen as close to Khamenei. Under Iran\u2019s constitution, a new presidential election must be held within 50 days. Iranian state media blamed bad weather for the crash and said it was complicating rescue efforts. Raisi\u2019s convoy had included three helicopters, and the other two had \u201creached their destination safely\u201d, Tasnim news agency reported. The incident happened near Jolfa, a city on the border with Azerbaijan, about 375 miles (600km) north-west of the Iranian capital, Tehran. The president had been travelling in Iran\u2019s East Azerbaijan province. The state-run IRNA news agency broadcast footage of an Iranian Red Crescent team walking up a slope in thick fog, as well as live footage of crowds of worshippers reciting prayers in the holy shrine of Imam Reza in the city of Mashhad, Raisi\u2019s home town. More than 70 rescue teams using search dogs and drones were sent to the site, the Red Crescent said, and the chief of staff of Iran\u2019s army ordered all the resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be deployed. Raisi had been in Azerbaijan early on Sunday to inaugurate a dam with the country\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev. The dam is the third that the two nations have built on the Aras River. The visit came despite chilly relations between the two nations, including over a gun attack on Azerbaijan\u2019s embassy in Tehran in 2023, and Azerbaijan\u2019s diplomatic relations with Israel, which Iran\u2019s Shia theocracy views as its main enemy in the region. Iran owns a number of helicopters but international sanctions make it difficult to obtain parts for them. Most of its military air fleet predates the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Countries in the region sent their well-wishes and offers of support, including Iraq and Qatar, but also Saudi Arabia, which has long been a regional foe. The Saudi foreign ministry was following reports about the crash with \u201cgreat concern\u201d, the country\u2019s state news agency reported. The US president, Joe Biden, had been briefed on the crash, an American official said on condition of anonymity. The Turkish president said he was saddened to hear of the crash. \u201cI convey my best wishes to our neighbour, friend and brother Iranian people and government, and I hope to receive good news from Mr Raisi and his delegation as soon as possible,\u201d Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan said in a post on the social media platform X. The EU offered emergency satellite mapping technology to help Iran with the search, while a spokesperson for state department of the US, an adversary of Iran, said: \u201cWe are closely following reports of a possible hard landing of a helicopter in Iran carrying the Iranian president and foreign minister.\u201d The Iran-backed militant group Hamas, fighting Israeli forces in Gaza with Tehran\u2019s support, issued a statement expressing sympathy to the Iranian people for \u201cthis immense loss\u201d. Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah group and the Houthi rebels in Yemen also issued statements praising Raisi and mourning his death. Raisi was a hardliner who formerly led the country\u2019s judiciary. He was viewed as a protege of Khamenei, and some analysts had suggested that he could replace the 85-year-old leader. He won Iran\u2019s 2021 presidential election, for which the turnout was the lowest in the Islamic Republic\u2019s history. Raisi was under sanctions by the US in part over his involvement in the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 at the end of the Iran-Iraq war. Under Raisi, Iran enriched uranium at nearly weapons-grade levels and hampered international inspections. Iran has supplied arms to Russia in its war on Ukraine, and launched a substantial drone and missile attack on Israel. It continues to arm proxy groups in the Middle East, such as the Houthi rebels and Hezbollah. Mass protests in the country have raged for years. The most recent involved the death in 2022 of Mahsa Amini, a woman who had been detained for allegedly not wearing a hijab to the liking of authorities. The months-long security crackdown that followed the demonstrations killed more than 500 people and more than 22,000 were detained. Reuters contributed to this report"

            "title": "Iran: who holds power now the president is dead?",
            "date": "2024-05-20T16:53:30Z",
            "content": "The death of the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has created political turbulence in the country, with uncertainty over who might now rise to the top in the Islamic republic. While the presidency is not the most powerful position in the country \u2013 that is reserved for the supreme leader \u2013 it holds significant authority. Here are three men who hold power in Iran: Ali Khamenei, supreme leader Khamenei, aged 85, succeeded Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as Iran\u2019s supreme leader in 1989 and is a former president of Iran. As Iran\u2019s head of state he is also responsible for the Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), long regarded as a key base of his power. Khamenei is officially regarded as a marja\u2019 \u2013 or source of religious emulation under Iran\u2019s system of Shia clerical governance despite controversy over his lack of clerical standing at the time he became supreme leader. The question of who will succeed Khamenei, who has been treated for prostate cancer and has other health issues, has become more pressing in recent years as he had groomed and elevated key loyalists like Raisi, the president who died on Sunday. Mohammad Mokhber, interim president Aged 68, Mokhber, who was appointed acting president after Raisi\u2019s death, served as first vice-president. Associated with the hard-line conservative centres of power in Iran, Mokhber is regarded as close to the office of the supreme leader and the IRGC, which represent the two key intersecting focuses of power in the Iranian system of governance. Before his appointment to the vice-presidency, Mokhber served for 14 years as head of Setad, a wealthy and powerful charitable organisation set up in memory of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and under the direct control of Khamenei. Both Setad and Mokhber have been sanctioned by the US, accused of human rights violations. Mojtaba Khameini, son of Ali Khamenei Aged 54, the supreme leader\u2019s second eldest son is sometimes mentioned as a potential successor to his father. An important figure in the Office of the Supreme Leader, he is seen as a power broker and gatekeeper for his father, with his influence dictated by his proximity to Khamenei. He has been described as a fixer in some recent presidential elections and appears to be in charge of large sums of funds that saw him sanctioned by the US. The US treasury sanctions notice in 2019 described him as \u201crepresenting the supreme leader in an official capacity despite never being elected or appointed to a government position aside from work in the office of his father\u201d, and for his close connections to the IRGC\u2019s Quds Force and the powerful Basij militia."

            "date": "2024-05-23T14:12:28Z",
            "content": "The former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili was fairly convicted of abuses of power for ordering the beating of an opposition MP and pardoning four murderers, human rights judges in Strasbourg have ruled. Saakashvili, who was president of Georgia from 2004 to 2013, was said by the European court of human rights on Thursday to have failed to show he had been unfairly treated in his trials in 2018. The court found there were credible witnesses in both proceedings, and that his argument that the presidential power of clemency was unlimited \u201ccould be dangerous and encourage corruption\u201d. The judgment read: \u201cThe authorities\u2019 honest desire was to bring the applicant to justice for his wrongdoing and \u2026 in the absence of sufficient evidence to the contrary, the allegation of an ulterior motive is unsubstantiated.\u201d Two of the seven judges gave dissenting opinions but the ruling will be a blow for Saakashvili\u2019s hopes of release from jail in Georgia, where he has been detained since he returned to the country in 2021. Saakashvili remains the prime ministerial candidate for the United National Movement party that he founded and which remains today the largest opposition group in Georgia\u2019s parliament. He led the non-violent Rose revolution that brought an end two decades ago to the administration of the president Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Soviet minister of foreign affairs. By the time Saakashvili\u2019s term as president had ended in 2013, his administration was deeply unpopular, with opposition parties claiming he had become authoritarian. When the new government was elected, led by politicians from the Georgian Dream party, which continues to govern the country, it declared that investigating the wrongdoings of the past would be a priority. Saakashvili was convicted in absentia in 2018 over an attack in July 2005 on a member of parliament who was forced out of his car at a traffic light by six armed men, who beat him with their rifle butts. Saakashvili was found to have ordered the riot police to carry out the attack in reprisal for an offensive interview the MP had given to a newspaper about him and his wife. A former speaker of the Georgian parliament recalled to the court a conversation with Saakashvili after the attack in which he allegedly said: \u201cDoesn\u2019t he [the MP] deserve to be duffed up?\u201d A second key witness, the head of the riot police at the time, claimed the president had warmly thanked him at an official event for the \u201csuccessful\u201d operation against the MP. The second set of proceedings in front of the ECHR concerned Saakashvili\u2019s granting of a pardon in 2008 to four former high-ranking officers of the interior ministry who had been convicted of killing a young man for insulting some of their colleagues in a Tbilisi cafe. He was convicted of abuse of power, which was confirmed on appeal. The Georgian court found that Saakashvili had granted the pardon because he had been anxious about the damage that full disclosure of all the details could do to his political team. The judges in Strasbourg ruled that \u201cthe charges brought against [him] had been serious and well-founded, [and] that there had been a significant body of both direct and concordant circumstantial evidence against him\u201d."
