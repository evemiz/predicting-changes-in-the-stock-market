            "content": "Hello, and Happy Thursday, On the final day of what may have been its most consequential term ever, the US supreme court announced it would hear a bombshell case when it reconvenes. The case, Moore v Harper, involves a dispute over North Carolina\u2019s congressional districts. At the heart of the case is what has come to be known as the independent state legislature theory (ISL) \u2013 the idea that state legislatures cannot be checked by state supreme courts when it comes to setting rules for federal elections, even if the legislature\u2019s actions violate the state\u2019s constitution. It\u2019s an idea that three justices \u2013 William Rehnquist, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia \u2013 mused about in Bush v Gore, but has gained little traction since. The decision to hear the case immediately raised serious alarm from experts, who say the idea is anti-democratic and is antithetical to federalism and the separation of powers at the heart of American government. I spoke with Vikram Amar, the dean of the college of law at the University of Illinois, who has studied the idea extensively. We spoke about the history of the idea and the implications if the supreme court endorses it. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. What is the independent state legislature theory? It\u2019s the idea that the federal constitution essentially empowers one organ of state government over all others. And that is the elected legislature. Ordinarily, we think of federal governments versus state governments. Some powers are federal and some powers are state. But this is an idea that within the state government, the federal constitution somehow specifies which branch of state government should be calling the shots. If it\u2019s the legislature, that means in theory the governor has no role. The courts have no role. The people acting directly through direct democracy referenda and initiative, they would have no role. And perhaps most importantly, the courts have no role in enforcing the state constitution. It\u2019s the state legislature kind of liberated from all the other checks and balances that we would ordinarily find within state government. And we\u2019re talking specifically about matters of election law Federal elections. Everyone agrees the state constitutions and state courts limit the state legislature when it comes to state elections. What would the implications be if the supreme court were to endorse this idea? There\u2019s lots of different answers to that depending on how wholeheartedly the court embraces it. I\u2019m of the view that once you accept its premise, it\u2019s hard to deny its broad implications. One implication is not that a state legislature could pick whatever state of electors it wants after December in January. In other words, the whole John Eastman idea that it\u2019s always up to the state legislature to do whatever they want in picking presidential electors. That\u2019s ISL on steroids. Regardless of what you think of the word legislature, the constitution in Article II clearly, directly gives Congress and the federal government the power to specify the time that electors are chosen for presidential elections. And so Congress has specified election day. Putting aside that temporal question though, if a state legislature today were to announce that in 2024, it\u2019s going to pick the electors without regard to what the voters want \u2013 it says \u2018well we\u2019ll take into account the voters\u2019 views,\u2019 but at midnight on election day, we\u2019re gonna have a session without the governor and without anybody else and we\u2019re gonna pick who we think should be the electors of this state. That would have to be respected, even if, as it\u2019s true in some state constitutions, the state constitution explicitly says that the people shall pick presidential electors, and nobody else. Another one would be if today, before the election, a legislature announced, without input from the governor or anybody else, if there is a dispute about who actually won the election in 2024, and who was actually selected as the electors, instead of having courts decide who won, we will decide who won. And that would have to be respected, even if the state constitution says, as does for example Pennsylvania\u2019s, that all election disputes shall be resolved in courts of law. More mundanely, it would mean things like if a state constitution allows ex felons to vote, and the legislature decides that\u2019s a bad idea, then the legislature can disregard that, and we\u2019d have to respect that. Or if the voters decide that congressional districting is better done by an independent redistricting commission, as was true in Arizona, and upheld by the supreme court in 2015, and the legislature said \u2018no we want to do it ourselves,\u2019 we\u2019d have to respect that. And what would the implications be for partisan gerrymandering? To the extent that the people of the states have tried to deal with the problem of partisan gerrymandering, those efforts would be all for naught, because it would be up to the fox, namely the state legislature, to guard the henhouse. That is their own partisan instincts. Would there be any check left on state legislatures? Only the voters when they want to vote out the rascals, the bums. But again, they\u2019d be doing so in districts that are so gerrymandered that it\u2019s hard to do. If the court does endorse this theory, what kinds of things might we start seeing from legislatures? You\u2019re going to see things like we talked about, the Arizona proposal to make the legislature the court. You may see more aggressive regulation of voter eligibility and voter ID laws. There\u2019s always the federal backdrop. No one says ISL allows the state legislature to violate federal constitution or federal statutory rights. But to the extent that state constitutions go beyond federal constitutions in recognizing the right to vote. Then you\u2019re going to see state legislatures pull back on that in those states whose supreme courts have been more protective of voting rights. What are the origins of this idea? My guess is that the justices, especially Scalia, Thomas and chief justice Rehnquest, they were very skeptical of the Florida supreme court [in Bush v Gore]. They thought the Florida supreme court was up to no good. This was a textual thing, it was a hook, for them to hang their skepticism on. As is true in Sebelius, the Obamacare case, this is really a theory that is come up with after to justify a kind of instinctual result of what should be the right outcome. But here\u2019s a unifying theme between invocation of ISL in 2020 and in 2000. It always was invoked in the context of the shadow docket \u2013 where there\u2019s an emergency request in front of the court. There\u2019s not full briefing. There\u2019s no resort to scholarship. There\u2019s no time, there\u2019s no deliberation. So this is an idea, as Akhil and I say in our piece, it seems plausible on the surface, but it\u2019s preposterous when you think about it. It\u2019s going to be really hard for those guys to write an opinion. It\u2019s one thing for those guys to shoot their mouth off in a shadow docket separate writing. It\u2019s another thing to write a majority opinion that deals with all the stuff that we\u2019re writing about. Which is why I remain optimistic that there won\u2019t be five justices to embrace this theory. The one detour along the way was a 2015 case, from Arizona in which the supreme court considered an ISL argument \u2013 whether the citizens of Arizona could strip the legislature of its redistricting power through the constitutional amendment process. The court ruled 5-4 against the legislature. It flatly rejected ISL. It\u2019s not just in 2015, a majority of the court, including Justice Kennedy, repudiated ISL. Roberts who dissented himself and embraced the result in the Arizona case, three years later in the Common Cause v Rucho, the partisan gerrymandering case, where he cited approvingly to initiatives in Colorado and Michigan, that were in all respects identical to Arizona\u2019s. Indeed, he cited to a Florida state supreme court case that was remarkably similar to the North Carolina supreme court case here. You and your brother have studied this idea and you\u2019ve written about how the history shows that this understanding of the language of the constitution of elections clause is bogus. Could you walk me through a little bit through that? There are several originalist arguments that really devastate ISL. Legislature is not a term that can be understood apart from the state constitutions that create the legislature. What the ISL folks want to say is that legislature means legislature, not court, not executive branch. They stop halfway short. Legislature means a body created to represent the people. At the founding, state constitutions preceded the federal constitution. Every state constitution was based on the notion that the people have the power and they create the government, they create the state legislature, which is accountable to the people. And has only those powers and is subject to whatever limitations that the constitution sets up. The idea that the legislature can be freed of limitations, checks and balances, that were created in the very constitution that created the legislature, it\u2019s just oxymoronic. The actions of the state legislatures and the state peoples, both right before and right after the constitution, that\u2019s normally what we look at to determine the meaning of contested terms. That contradicts ISL. Indeed, ISL proponents have pointed to nobody at the founding who said legislature means \u201cISL.\u201d Not a one. The idea that the federal courts can oversee the state courts for being too creative or freeform. No, that\u2019s why we have states. If the states don\u2019t like what the state supreme court is doing, they can change. That\u2019s federalism. Not only is ISL not consistent with federalism. It turns federalism on its head. Federalism is all about allowing each state to structure its internal governmental operations however it wants. Also worth watching\u2026 The justice department announced it is suing Arizona over a new law that requires voters to prove their citizenship if they want to vote in federal elections. The supreme court\u2019s new conservative supermajority flexed its new power relentlessly this term. The justices are likely just getting started."

            "date": "2022-07-29T10:00:05Z",
            "content": "Hello, and Happy Friday, Today I wanted to highlight four really good stories I\u2019ve read over the last week that show how the movement to undermine confidence in election results is metastasizing. 1 Volunteers in Tarrant county, Texas, are manually reviewing more than 300,000 ballots from the state\u2019s 2020 Republican primary election, Votebeat reported last week. There\u2019s no evidence of fraud or that the results were inaccurate in any way, but the ballots recently became open to public inspection and the group wants to see for themselves. John Raymond, a volunteer with the group conducting the effort, Tarrant County Citizens for Election Integrity, told Votebeat the effort was just a start. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have faith in our elections, so we\u2019re just here counting, making sure that what the secretary of state\u2019s numbers say are right,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not clear, however, what exactly the group is looking for or how they\u2019re doing it. At the elections office, volunteers are going through the ballots, comparing them to data on their laptop and occasionally holding them up to the light (it\u2019s not clear what they\u2019re looking for). The elections office, which is required to comply with the group\u2019s request for public information, has had to provide space and supervision for the process. It\u2019s the kind of activity that Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who assisted Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election, is encouraging citizens around the US to take up (it\u2019s unclear if the Texas group is affiliated with her effort). There\u2019s nothing wrong or unusual about concerned citizens wanting to check the results of an election. But there\u2019s worry that shoddy methodology and misunderstandings will produce an impression that the election was stolen. That\u2019s essentially what happened in Arizona, where a months-long review of the 2020 race produced no evidence the election was stolen, but those overseeing the review said they had several more questions. Election officials later debunked every single claim they made. 2 Volunteers in Colorado are going door-to-door checking voter registrations to see whether people really voted in the last election, NPR reported last week. After the 2020 election, those who pushed some of the baseless conspiracy theories have encouraged this kind of door-to-door canvassing. Again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this on its face, but voter data is messy and it\u2019s easy to get a false impression of what it shows. It\u2019s also an activity that can easily slip into voter intimidation. The NPR story notes that canvassers asked one woman whom she voted for (even though all voters in the US are entitled to a secret ballot). 3 In Georgia, citizens are relying on a new provision in Georgia law that allows any Georgian to bring an unlimited number of voter challenges, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. So far, more than 25,550 voter registrations have been cancelled, and 1,800 people have been removed from the rolls in some of the state\u2019s most populous counties, according to a tally by Fair Fight, a voter advocacy group. There\u2019s no evidence of fraud in Georgia in 2020, and critics worry that the process is flagging eligible people on the rolls. 4 Kansas is set to have a high-stakes ballot referendum on Tuesday to remove the right to an abortion from the state\u2019s constitution. Supporters of the amendment are already objecting to the presence of absentee ballot drop boxes in Sedgwick county, home to Wichita, according to the Wichita Eagle. Critics worry that some people could use the boxes, which are under video surveillance, to cast fake votes against the amendment. They haven\u2019t offered specific evidence for those claims, instead pointing to the debunked film 2000 Mules, which makes outlandish claims about drop boxes. Trump and allies have railed against ballot drop boxes, even though there\u2019s no evidence fraudulent votes were cast using them in 2020. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen a political group point to their availability and call out the possibility of fraud before an election. Also worth watching \u2026 Amy Weirich, the Memphis prosecutor who brought charges against Pamela Moses, is in a tough re-election bid. Election day is Tuesday. Local election officials in a Michigan county that was a hotbed of conspiracy theories hosted a public demonstration and test of its voting equipment. No one showed up to watch. Some Democrats are concerned that the party is supporting election deniers in GOP primaries. Yesterday newsletter subscribers received an accidental repeat of last week\u2019s Fight to vote newsletter. We are sorry for the error."

            "date": "2022-07-04T07:30:37Z",
            "content": "In the months following the 2020 US presidential election, rightwing TV news in America was a wild west, an apparently lawless free-for-all where conspiracy theories about voting machines, ballot-stuffed suitcases and dead Venezuelan leaders were repeated to viewers around the clock. There seemed to be little consequence for peddling the most outrageous ideas on primetime. But now, unfortunately for Fox News, One America News Network (OAN), and Newsmax, it turns out that this brave, new world wasn\u2019t free from legal jurisdiction \u2013 with the three networks now facing billion-dollar lawsuits as a result of their baseless accusations. In June, Dominion Voting Systems, which provided voting machines to 28 states, was given the go-ahead to sue Fox Corp, the parent company of Fox News, in a case that could draw Rupert Murdoch and his son, Lachlan, into the spotlight. In the $1.6bn lawsuit, Dominion accuses Fox Corp, and the Murdochs specifically, of allowing Fox News to amplify false claims that the voting company had rigged the election for Joe Biden. Fox Corp had attempted to have the suit dismissed, but a Delaware judge said Dominion had shown adequate evidence for the suit to proceed. Dominion is already suing Fox News, as well as OAN and Newsmax. \u201cThese allegations support a reasonable inference that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch either knew Dominion had not manipulated the election or at least recklessly disregarded the truth when they allegedly caused Fox News to propagate its claims about Dominion,\u201d Judge Eric Davis said. Davis\u2019s ruling is not a guarantee that Fox will be found liable. But the judge made it clear that this isn\u2019t some frivolous attempt by Dominion \u2013 and media and legal experts think Fox could be in real trouble. \u201cDominion has a very strong case against Fox News \u2013 and against OAN for that matter,\u201d said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor who teaches constitutional law at Stetson University and a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute. \u201cThe reason Dominion is suing is because Fox and other rightwing news outlets repeated vicious lies that Dominion\u2019s voting machines stole the 2020 election from Trump for Biden. But all of these conspiracy theories about Dominion\u2019s machines were just pure bunk, and Fox as a news organization should have known that and not given this aspect of the big lie a megaphone. \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly bad for Fox is [that] Dominion asked them to stop and correct the record in real time, and Fox persisted in spreading misrepresentations about the voting machine company.\u201d Indeed, in his ruling, Davis noted that \u201cother newspapers under Rupert Murdoch\u2019s control, including the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, condemned President Trump\u2019s claims and urged him to concede defeat\u201d. In a statement, a Fox News spokesperson said: \u201cLimiting the ability of the press to report freely on the American election process stands in stark contrast to the liberties on which this nation was founded, and we are confident we will prevail in this case, as the first amendment is the foundation of our democracy and freedom of the press must be protected.\u201d A potential precedent in the Dominion v Fox case could be found in a recent case involving Sarah Palin, who sued the New York Times. Palin claimed the newspaper maliciously damaged her reputation by erroneously linking her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting. In February a jury sided with the Times, finding that a Times employee had not acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d against a public figure or with \u201creckless disregard\u201d for the truth \u2013 the criteria necessary to prove defamation. But the Times victory shouldn\u2019t give Fox too much hope, said Torres-Spelliscy. \u201cIn the Palin case, the New York Times quickly corrected the mistake about Palin that had been added while an article was edited,\u201d Torres-Spelliscy said. \u201cBy contrast Fox News kept up the bad behavior and repeatedly told myths about Dominion\u2019s voting machines. This is likely why judges in several of these Dominion defamation cases have not dismissed them.\u201d Dominion isn\u2019t the only company seeking damages from Fox and its contemporaries. Smartmatic, an election software company which provided voting software to precisely one county in the 2020 election but found itself subjected to claims that it was founded \u201cfor the specific purpose of fixing elections\u201d by associates of Hugo Chavez, the former president of Venezuela who died in 2013, is suing Fox Corp, Fox News and associates for $2.7bn. Still, Fox News is the most-watched and arguably most influential cable news channel in the US, and is probably too big to fail. But that isn\u2019t the case for the smaller rightwing networks OAN and Newsmax, which are also both being sued by Dominion and Smartmatic \u2013 in June, a Delaware judge refused Newsmax\u2019s motion to have the Dominion case dismissed, but did not weigh on whether Newsmax was innocent or guilty. \u201cI think OAN is going to be wiped out from the litigation costs. Forget about any judgment,\u201d said Angelo Carusone, president and chief executive of Media Matters for America, which monitors rightwing media. Carusone pointed out that OAN is already struggling to survive, after it was dropped by the DirecTV cable company \u2013 which was reportedly responsible for 90% of OAN\u2019s revenue \u2013 in April. \u201cWe\u2019ve started seeing, already, them scaling back programming, they\u2019ve been laying off staff, they\u2019ve been cutting back the number of programs. So it\u2019s pretty clear that they don\u2019t have sufficient resources to weather a protracted litigation.\u201d Newsmax, which is still carried by DirecTV, is \u201crelatively cash flush\u201d in comparison to OAN, Carusone said \u2013 enough to survive a trial, if not to pay the billions of dollars Dominion and Smartmatic are seeking. In a statement, Newsmax said it had \u201creported on allegations made by President Trump and his surrogates and at no time did we report these allegations were true. We also reported on critics of the Trump claims\u201d. It added: \u201cThe Dominion suit is an assault on a free press and endangers all press outlets if it were to prevail.\u201d OAN did not respond to a request for comment. As for Fox, the most significant thing could be if the Murdochs are subjected to discovery \u2013 where they and Fox could be forced to hand over documents potentially including communications data \u2013 as part of the legal process, Carusone said. Text messages obtained by the January 6 commission have already revealed that there was communication between Fox News hosts and White House officials regarding the insurrection \u2013 and it seems unlikely that is the only thing that was discussed. \u201cI think once you start to pull the discovery material, what you\u2019re going to find is there was a lot of communication between the Trump people both internally and externally about pushing very specific lies and narratives,\u201d Carusone said. While Fox is more financially comfortable than OAN and NewsMax, it is not invulnerable. Fox News is due to renegotiate its contracts with cable providers at the end of this year, and Carusone said cable companies could use the lawsuit to drive down prices. The Dominion and Smartmatic cases are likely to drag on for some time, and it remains to be seen how Fox News, OAN and NewsMax will react. As for the news channels\u2019 conspiratorial claims of election fraud, at least that is one thing that has already been settled. The courts, the Department of justice, election officials have investigated and dismissed the accusations, as has the US Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. \u201cThe November 3 election was the most secure in American history,\u201d the agency said in a statement in 2020. \u201cWhile we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too.\u201d William Barr, Trump\u2019s attorney general, put it in rather less sophisticated terms. The claims of election interference, Barr told the January 6 committee, were \u201cbullshit\u201d."

            "date": "2022-07-01T20:00:28Z",
            "content": "On Monday, Papua New Guineans will head to the polls to vote in the first national election in five years. A struggling economy, the impact of the pandemic and growing frustrations about failing public services are among the leading issues. The results of the election will be important not only to the country\u2019s almost 9 million people, but also for the increasingly complex geopolitical landscape in the wider Pacific region. The election process Of the 2,351 candidates running in the national election, 118 members will be elected. Members of parliament will serve a five-year term, representing each of PNG\u2019s electorates. PNG has a multi-party system with numerous political parties, in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone. Parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. Similar to other Commonwealth countries, the party or coalition with the most seats will form a government. Its leader subsequently becomes prime minister. No single party has yet won enough seats to form a government in its own right. The two most prominent parties are the Pangu party, led by the incumbent prime minister, James Marape, and the People\u2019s National Congress party (PNC), led by the former prime minister Peter O\u2019Neill. In an attempt to stop election fraud, the PNG electoral commission has scheduled polling for the whole country on a single date to limit the movement of people between provinces. Eligible voters have to be at least 18 years old. Typical turnout in the past has been chaotic \u2013 often people don\u2019t find their names on the electoral roll and there have been reports of underage voting and electoral fraud, when people vote using other people\u2019s names or more than once. Voting is due to start on Monday, with counting expected to begin immediately after polling, and results announced in mid-July. Who are the frontrunners? The two leading candidates for prime minister are Marape and O\u2019Neill. Marape was a close ally and member of the PNC when it was led by O\u2019Neill, but he abruptly resigned in 2019 as finance minister and, after a month-long tussle for power, O\u2019Neill resigned as prime minister. Marape took power in May 2019 in a parliamentary vote. He was later appointed leader of Pangu. He promised to \u201ctake back PNG\u201d and make it the \u201crichest Black Christian country\u201d in the world. While his government succeeded in introducing reforms in the country\u2019s lucrative mining and resource industries, the state of the economy has left Papua New Guineans frustrated at how it is being managed. The health system also continues to struggle with the impact of Covid-19, and there is rising unemployment. O\u2019Neill and the PNC have garnered immense support on the campaign trail. In some provinces, supporters have gone as far as burning and defacing Pangu posters that feature Marape. Experts say O\u2019Neill\u2019s popularity is due to a growing disenchantment with Marape\u2019s leadership, due to unfulfilled promises and grandstanding. What regional issues are at stake? China\u2019s growing influence has been at the forefront of geopolitical discussions in PNG. Neighbour Solomon Islands has signed a security deal with Beijing. In the past, Marape and O\u2019Neill have on many occasions said that under their leadership PNG\u2019s doors remain open to partnership opportunities. Both have often described PNG as a \u201cfriend to all and enemy to none\u201d. The country\u2019s relationships with Australia, New Zealand and the US remain amicable, and include joint security training and support. Both O\u2019Neill\u2019s and Marape\u2019s governments have welcomed Chinese investment, though no security deals were signed during Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi\u2019s trip to the country. The \u2018women\u2019s election\u2019? Women could be voted into parliament after a complete absence for the past five years, though seven women have served as MPs since independence in 1975. This time, 142 female candidates are on the ballot. PNG women battle for gender equality and against gender-based violence, and face high rates of maternal and child mortality. In the past five years terrible crimes have been committed against women, sparking nationwide outcry and women\u2019s rights marches. \u201cClearly, the absence of any women from parliament since 2017, and their near absence at the provincial level, deprives women of both a voice in the legislature but also in government at the national and critical subnational levels,\u201d said the executive director of the Institute of National Affairs, Paul Barker. \u201cIt should be added that there are also very few women at the top levels of the public service as well, in contrast to back in the 1980s when women headed several of the major institutions, as well as being public servants and ombudsman commissioners.\u201d How safe are elections in PNG? At least 30 people have been killed in election-related violence since May, and police are cracking down on illegal firearms at political rallies and gatherings. In May local media reported two foiled assassination attempts against senior electoral officials in the Highlands; two people were shot dead in Kainantu in the Eastern Highlands and many more were injured in gun battles. Early this month the Mount Hagen international airport was forcibly shut down by political supporters. This violence has been the norm during election periods. Before the 2017 election, more than 200 people died during campaigning, polling, counting and even after a candidate was declared the winner, prompting many to conclude that it was the worst election in PNG history. Away from the violence, thousands of eligible voters could not vote due to a faulty and outdated electoral roll. Official observers from the Commonwealth observer group and the Australian National University recommended that funds be given to the electoral commission to update the roll. To date, this and other recommended reforms have not been implemented. The government says Covid-19 and a lack of funding have prevented updates to the roll. Barker said intimidation and violence could deter many voters and \u201cfailure to update the roll since 2017, while the 2017 roll was also subject to many flaws, including apparent systematic manipulation, reduces the capacity of many \u2013 especially younger people \u2013 to vote\u201d. \u201cUnlike in many democracies where voter apathy reduces participation and weakens the outcome, PNG is a very proactive democracy with an almost carnival atmosphere, but also some very undemocratic processes, which severely undermine voters\u2019 capacity to engage and have their preferences reflected in the outcomes.\u201d"

It appears to be conducting a number of ballots, eliminating the candidates with the fewest votes and allowing their supporters to switch to one of the other MPs left in the race.

            "date": "2022-07-10T17:26:15Z",
            "content": "It was once the palatial colonial-era home frequented only by Sri Lanka\u2019s political elite. But by Sunday morning, Temple Trees, the formal residence of the country\u2019s prime minister, was \u201copen to the public\u201d, according to a large sign graffitied at the entrance. In the aftermath of the dramatic events of Saturday, when tens of thousands of anti-government protesters stormed the state residences of the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Temple Trees was among the political properties now defiantly occupied by ordinary Sri Lankans. Rajapaksa and Wickremesinge both promised to resign on Saturday night amid mounting political pressure. However, protesters said they would continue to occupy their homes and offices until both leaders had officially left office. The whereabouts of the president remained unknown on Sunday, and he did not formally address the people or publish a letter of resignation. By Sunday morning, Temple Trees had been converted into a museum for the Sri Lankan people and a community kitchen, serving up free hot meals. In scenes that would previously have been unthinkable, vats of dal and curry simmered on wood fires set up in the manicured garden. People from all walks of life milled freely around the marble corridors, having lunch, relaxing on the lawn and taking advantage of the well-equipped gym for a workout. The official resident, Wickremesinghe, was nowhere to be seen, having been evacuated from the property the previous day. His private residence had been alight on Saturday night after the frustrations on the streets boiled over. Soldiers and a heavy police presence remained deployed around Colombo, and many were still reeling from violent standoffs that occurred between security forces and protesters on Saturday night, in which dozens of people, including multiple journalists, were brutally beaten by police and hospitalised. Scenes at Rajapaksa\u2019s official residence, which was occupied by the public on Saturday, remained jubilant. People continued to enjoy the luxury facilities, the comfortable beds and the well-stocked kitchen, though the outdoor swimming pool, which had been filled with protesters on Saturday, had turned murky and emptied of people. Kumara, a 33-year-old government employee who was at the residence, told Reuters he was not moving until Rajapaksa stepped down. \u201cI will continue to come here and I will continue to sleep here until he does,\u201d he said. Though some damage had been done to the property, efforts were being made to keep the president\u2019s house in good condition, with people seen sweeping the floors and watering the pot plants; handwritten warnings against any attempts to loot were posted up on the wall. Bundles of cash reportedly worth LKR 15 million foundstashed at the president\u2019s house were counted and then handed over to security personnel. Families could be seen taking curious tours around the luxury house and gardens. BM Chandrawathi, a 61-year-old handkerchief seller, sauntered into a first-floor bedroom accompanied by her daughter and grandchildren. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a place like this in my life,\u201d Chandrawathi told Reuters as she reclined on a plush sofa. \u201cThey enjoyed super luxury while we suffered. We were hoodwinked. I wanted my kids and grandkids to see the luxurious lifestyles they were enjoying.\u201d In videos shared on social media, protesters could be seen jokingly playing Rajapaksa\u2019s campaign song, \u201cThe hero that works\u201d, on the polished piano in his house, and staging a mock meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at the long conference table in the president\u2019s house. Menus seized from the property also gave an insight into the culinary luxuries enjoyed by the president as two-thirds of Sri Lankans struggled to feed themselves due to the economic crisis. Lunch options recently enjoyed by the president included a roasted pumpkin soup starter followed by dishes including smoked salmon rosette, grilled lagoon prawns, marinated chicken with a demi-glace sauce, baked eggplant parmesan and hummus with pita bread. A celebratory party held by protesters who had overrun the president\u2019s administrative offices in Colombo went on well into the early hours. By Sunday morning, it was decided the secretariat building would be opened up as a public library, and its corridors began to be filled with donated books."

            "date": "2022-07-19T06:04:32Z",
            "content": "Sri Lanka\u2019s main opposition leader, Sajith Premadasa, has withdrawn from the presidential race and thrown his support behind a rival candidate, presenting a significant challenge to prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe\u2019s bid for the executive role. In an announcement made on Tuesday morning, Premadasa said that \u201cfor the greater good of my country that I love and the people I cherish, I hereby withdraw my candidacy for the position of president\u201d. Premadasa instead pledged his support for Dullas Alahapperuma, the candidate from a breakaway group of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party (SLPP). The decision to withdraw from the presidential race is believed to be driven in part by the tough political future that any president who takes on the role now faces. The new government, which is proposed to be a cross-party unity government, is likely to only last six to eight months until the country can afford to go to parliamentary elections. Presidential elections are not due till November 2024. Premadasa\u2019s support brings with it all the votes from his opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party. It significantly improves Alahapperuma\u2019s chances of beating Wickremesinghe, the prime minister and acting president who will run as the SLPP\u2019s official candidate in the secret ballot, which takes place in parliament on Wednesday. It will now be a three-way vote between Alahapperuma, Wickremesinghe and leftist leader Anura Dissanayake, who were all formally nominated by legislators in a brief parliamentary session on Tuesday morning. Both Wickremesinghe and Alahapperuma are considered controversial presidential candidates by the public, due to their close association to former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to flee the country and step down last week after mass protests. It is likely to be a tight race. Wickremesinghe has the backing of the majority of the ruling SLPP, who have the most seats in parliament. However, according to those close to Alahapperuma who spoke to the Guardian, the support of the SJB \u2013 and other opposition parties likely to follow \u2013 means they now believe they are assured of enough votes to beat Wickremesinghe. Those close to Alahapperuma said that a deal had been struck whereby Premadasa would be prime minister, and SJB MP Harsha da Silva, who is an economist, would be finance minister in a unity government, under Alahapperuma as president. Three days ago Alahapperuma promised to form \u201can actual consensual government for the first time in our history\u201d if he won the ballot. Alahapperuma, a former journalist, served as the minister of mass media in Rajapaksa\u2019s cabinet for over two years, and was part of the SLPP government that is held responsible for driving the country into its worst economic crisis since independence. Public protests against Wickremesinghe have been particularly vociferous. A six-time prime minister, he took over as a caretaker prime minister in May and was swiftly accused of propping up and protecting the Rajapaksa family, and, after the president resigned, taking on presidential duties without any legitimacy. His private residence was burned down and his prime ministerial home and offices were taken over by protesters last week demanding he step down. Wickremesinghe caused further outrage by using his powers as acting president to declare a state of emergency on Sunday night \u201cin the interests of public security\u201d. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka\u2019s economic situation continues to worsen, with a lack of fuel and cooking gas and more food shortages likely in the future. The new president would also have to oversee a government composed of usually opposing political parties, and will be ruling at a time of political turmoil for the country, with a mass protest movement \u2013 known as the aragalaya \u2013 mobilised on the streets and calling for political accountability. On Tuesday, across the commercial capital of Colombo, mass protests demanding Wickremesinge\u2019s resignation were planned by students and protest groups."

            "date": "2022-07-20T20:47:50Z",
            "content": "A bipartisan group of senators reached a deal on Wednesday to reform a federal law and prevent a future presidential candidate from overturning the will of the people and the result of a valid presidential election. The lawmakers have agreed to two bills that would reform the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which governs how electoral votes are counted after a presidential election. Citing ambiguities in the law, Donald Trump and his attorneys pushed his vice-president, Mike Pence, to disrupt the counting of electoral votes that showed he lost the 2020 election, escalating calls for the 135-year-old law to be reformed. Even before the election, experts warned the law was ambiguous and could be exploited. \u201cThrough numerous meetings and debates among our colleagues as well as conversations with a wide variety of election experts and legal scholars, we have developed legislation that establishes clear guidelines for our system of certifying and counting electoral votes for president and vice-president. We urge our colleagues in both parties to support these simple, commonsense reforms,\u201d the group of 16 senators said in a joint statement. Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the two Democrats who stymied more sweeping voting rights reform earlier this year, are among the group that developed the proposal. Republicans in the group include Maine senator Susan Collins, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and North Carolina senator Thom Tillis. The first bill is called the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, and would fix ambiguities in the existing law while clarifying when an incoming administration can access federal resources. Under current law, Congress has to consider an objection to the counting of electoral votes if just one member of each house objects. One of the proposed bills would raise that threshold, requiring the support of at least 20% of members in each house to consider an objection. The bill also creates a judicial process with expedited review, first by a three-judge panel then by the US supreme court, over certain matters related to disputed electors. In 2020, Trump and allies encouraged submitting alternative slates of electors in swing states Trump lost. The new law clarifies that only the slate of electors officially approved by the state\u2019s governor can be submitted to Congress. It also clarifies the term \u201cfailed election\u201d used in another 19th century law, saying that a state can move its presidential election only if there were \u201cextraordinary and catastrophic events\u201d. There were concerns in 2020 that ambiguities in that language could be used by state legislatures to throw out the popular vote. After Trump insisted Pence had the authority to unilaterally throw out electoral votes, the bill makes certain that the vice-president has no such authority. It makes clear that the vice-president\u2019s presence at the counting of electoral votes is solely in a ministerial role. The bill also clarifies that both presidential candidates should get access to presidential transition funds while an election result is disputed. Trump delayed giving Joe Biden access to resources to transition in the White House after the 2020 election. The Enhanced Election Security and Protection Act is the second proposal, and would increase criminal penalties against people convicted of intimidating or threatening candidates, voters and poll workers, in response to a significant uptick in threats after 2020. It increases the maximum penalty for those who make threats from one to two years in prison. The bill would require election records to be preserved, help the US Postal Service manage mail-in ballots and reauthorize for five years a commission that works with states to improve their voting practices."

            "date": "2022-07-03T06:00:07Z",
            "content": "It is not often that the election of deputy speakers to a parliament can be described as portentous. The appointment last week of vice-presidents (the equivalent of deputy speakers) of the French national assembly was almost unnoticed outside France. But it was historic, in an ominous way. Of the six vice-presidents, two were deputies of Rassemblement National (RN), the renamed far-right Front National. At the parliamentary elections two weeks ago, the RN gained 89 deputies, a historic breakthrough. Nevertheless, the RN forms only a small bloc in the 577-seat national assembly. So how did the two RN candidates receive 290 and 284 votes respectively? By persuading large numbers of mainstream deputies to vote for them, leading to rumours and accusations of secret deals between Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist bloc and the RN. Whatever the truth in that, what is undeniable is the FN/RN\u2019s success not just in gaining an electoral foothold but also in reshaping the political landscape. Many far-right themes on immigration and Islam have seeped in recent years into mainstream thinking of both left and right. It is 50 years since the Front National was formed from the fragments of postwar fascist groups, part of the attempt by the far right to reorganise itself in the wake of Nazism, Vichy and the Holocaust. The intellectual driving force behind this project was Alain de Benoist. A founder of the French Nouvelle Droite, and of the thinktank GRECE, Benoist recognised the need to abandon claims of racial superiority for ideas of cultural difference and to challenge globalism as undermining \u201cthe right to be different\u201d. It was an argument not for a more tolerant, diverse society, but for an end to immigration and for the maintenance of a white, French identity. In 1974, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the first leader of the Front National, took 0.8% of the vote in the presidential election. In 2002, he shocked France by coming second to Jacques Chirac in the race for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace and winning almost 18% of the vote in the presidential run-off. But Le Pen could never properly shake off either his rootedness in fascism or his indelible antisemitism. His daughter Marine Le Pen, taking over the reins of the party in 2011, went much further in detoxifying the FN, even to the point of expelling her father from the party in 2015. In 2018, she renamed the Front National the Rassemblement National (the National Rally). At its heart, though, remained the Benoist programme, in particular hostility to globalism, immigration and Islam. In April, Le Pen lost to Macron in the presidential elections but won 41% of the vote in the second round. The rise of the FN/RN was effected not only through the party\u2019s success in detoxifying itself but also by the willingness of mainstream politicians, on left and right, to appropriate far-right themes, aiding the normalisation of the party and its ideas. It was not the FN but the Communist party (PCF) that first brought the issue of immigration on to the political agenda. In the 1970s, communist-run councils routinely excluded non-European immigrants from municipal housing projects so as not to breach the \u201cthreshold of tolerance\u201d. The most notorious incident took place on Christmas Eve 1980. Paul Mercieca, the communist mayor of Vitry, near Paris, led a 60-strong gang in a \u201cdirect action\u201d to stop 300 immigrants from Mali being rehoused in the town, using a bulldozer to smash up their hostel. Pandering to racism could not prevent the PCF\u2019s terminal decline. But having so insidiously linked the problems of the working class to immigration and made acceptable discrimination in social policy, the Communist party cleared the ground for the Front National and allowed Le Pen to don the mantle of defender of working-class interests. The old communist heartlands around Paris and in northern France are now RN strongholds. The lessons of the PCF were not learned by more mainstream politicians, as both left or right continued to meet the challenge of the far right by accommodating to its reactionary ideas. When, in the 2012 presidential election, socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Gaullist Nicolas Sarkozy vied with each other to sound more anti-immigrant, Le Pen mocked: \u201cWe were xenophobes, antisemites, racists, national preference was a terrible shame. And all of a sudden, there is no more of that.\u201d Last year, Macron\u2019s interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, tried to outflank Le Pen in a television debate by accusing her of being \u201csoft\u201d on Islam. Darmanin claimed that acting tough was the only way to hinder the far right. In fact, studies suggest that such an approach may \u201clead to more voters defecting to the radical right\u201d. Mainstream commentators have regurgitated not just the hostility to immigration and Islam but also pernicious far-right conspiracy theories such as the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d, which claims that globalists are using immigration policy to swap Europeans for non-Europeans, and to drive white people from their \u201chomeland\u201d. A poll last year suggested that six out of 10 French people feared this was happening. It is not just in France that such themes have become popularised. \u201cEurope is committing suicide\u2026 by the end of the lifespans of most people currently alive, Europe will not be Europe and the peoples of Europe will have lost the only place in the world we had to call home.\u201d That is not Le Pen or Benoist but the associate editor of the Spectator magazine Douglas Murray in his bestselling book The Strange Death of Europe. In America, too, conservatives from Fox News presenters to Republican congressman have given legitimacy to far-right conspiracy theories. In the 1970s, Benoist argued that for the far right to flourish, reactionary ideas had to replace liberalism as the dominant cultural ethos of society. That\u2019s not what has happened. The liberal framework on race remains in place. Racism remains almost universally abhorred. But into this liberal ethos has been diffused deeply reactionary ideas. Conservatives fear the loss of whiteness. Social democrats follow the far-right playbook in immigration. Centrists vote for far-right deputies. It is not simply the success of the far right but the drip, drip of reactionary themes into mainstream thinking about which we should worry. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "content": "To borrow a metaphor used by one of the brave activists featured here, if the recent documentary Navalny concerns the speartip, this fired-up addendum is about the spearshaft: the campaigners who defied official harassment to support the Russian opposition leader and then \u2013 when his candidature was denied \u2013 protest on his behalf during the 2018 presidential elections. With little filter, Franco-Russian journalist Alexandra Dalsbaek shoves us into their street activism and canvassing and it is thoroughly depressing how regularly they encounter accusations, notably from older Russians, that they are paid-up agitators for foreign powers. Dalsbaek concentrates on Kolya and Milena, two twentysomething refuseniks leading a group trying to boost Navalny\u2019s cause and unseat Putin. One of their favoured stunts is sneaking outside a state duma or FSB headquarters holding up subversive messages to photograph for social media: \u201cPathetic. Coward. Thief.\u201d Milena \u2013 who reminds me a bit of Beanie Feldstein in Booksmart \u2013 is a particularly formidable pain in the neck, especially during one scene where she shows up as an observer at a polling station with far more knowledge of electoral procedure than the flunkies running it. There is something theatrical and vaguely futile, though, about their activities; the sense that, though they are doing the work of maintaining Navalny\u2019s presence in the public space, they are playing a sanctioned game of opposition. The authorities, making the barest gestures of due procedure and stopping just short of anything truly punitive in the case of these little fish, seem happy to play their part. Dalsbaek\u2019s engaging immersiveness doesn\u2019t really concern itself whether it is the right approach. Only during a long, draining street battle scene in which her camera falls mutely on a confusion of jackboots do we feel that more \u2013 much more \u2013 is needed to challenge this level of authoritarianism. But Putin\u2019s contempt and cynicism are on plain view, and it\u2019s good to know there are people willing to resist. \u2022 We Are Russia is available on True Story on 15 July."

            "date": "2022-07-29T10:00:05Z",
            "content": "Hello, and Happy Friday, Today I wanted to highlight four really good stories I\u2019ve read over the last week that show how the movement to undermine confidence in election results is metastasizing. 1 Volunteers in Tarrant county, Texas, are manually reviewing more than 300,000 ballots from the state\u2019s 2020 Republican primary election, Votebeat reported last week. There\u2019s no evidence of fraud or that the results were inaccurate in any way, but the ballots recently became open to public inspection and the group wants to see for themselves. John Raymond, a volunteer with the group conducting the effort, Tarrant County Citizens for Election Integrity, told Votebeat the effort was just a start. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t have faith in our elections, so we\u2019re just here counting, making sure that what the secretary of state\u2019s numbers say are right,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not clear, however, what exactly the group is looking for or how they\u2019re doing it. At the elections office, volunteers are going through the ballots, comparing them to data on their laptop and occasionally holding them up to the light (it\u2019s not clear what they\u2019re looking for). The elections office, which is required to comply with the group\u2019s request for public information, has had to provide space and supervision for the process. It\u2019s the kind of activity that Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who assisted Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election, is encouraging citizens around the US to take up (it\u2019s unclear if the Texas group is affiliated with her effort). There\u2019s nothing wrong or unusual about concerned citizens wanting to check the results of an election. But there\u2019s worry that shoddy methodology and misunderstandings will produce an impression that the election was stolen. That\u2019s essentially what happened in Arizona, where a months-long review of the 2020 race produced no evidence the election was stolen, but those overseeing the review said they had several more questions. Election officials later debunked every single claim they made. 2 Volunteers in Colorado are going door-to-door checking voter registrations to see whether people really voted in the last election, NPR reported last week. After the 2020 election, those who pushed some of the baseless conspiracy theories have encouraged this kind of door-to-door canvassing. Again, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this on its face, but voter data is messy and it\u2019s easy to get a false impression of what it shows. It\u2019s also an activity that can easily slip into voter intimidation. The NPR story notes that canvassers asked one woman whom she voted for (even though all voters in the US are entitled to a secret ballot). 3 In Georgia, citizens are relying on a new provision in Georgia law that allows any Georgian to bring an unlimited number of voter challenges, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. So far, more than 25,550 voter registrations have been cancelled, and 1,800 people have been removed from the rolls in some of the state\u2019s most populous counties, according to a tally by Fair Fight, a voter advocacy group. There\u2019s no evidence of fraud in Georgia in 2020, and critics worry that the process is flagging eligible people on the rolls. 4 Kansas is set to have a high-stakes ballot referendum on Tuesday to remove the right to an abortion from the state\u2019s constitution. Supporters of the amendment are already objecting to the presence of absentee ballot drop boxes in Sedgwick county, home to Wichita, according to the Wichita Eagle. Critics worry that some people could use the boxes, which are under video surveillance, to cast fake votes against the amendment. They haven\u2019t offered specific evidence for those claims, instead pointing to the debunked film 2000 Mules, which makes outlandish claims about drop boxes. Trump and allies have railed against ballot drop boxes, even though there\u2019s no evidence fraudulent votes were cast using them in 2020. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen a political group point to their availability and call out the possibility of fraud before an election. Also worth watching \u2026 Amy Weirich, the Memphis prosecutor who brought charges against Pamela Moses, is in a tough re-election bid. Election day is Tuesday. Local election officials in a Michigan county that was a hotbed of conspiracy theories hosted a public demonstration and test of its voting equipment. No one showed up to watch. Some Democrats are concerned that the party is supporting election deniers in GOP primaries. Yesterday newsletter subscribers received an accidental repeat of last week\u2019s Fight to vote newsletter. We are sorry for the error."

            "date": "2022-07-28T05:00:40Z",
            "content": "When Fox News called Arizona for Joe Biden on election night 2020, infuriating Donald Trump and fueling Republican election subversion attempts which continue to this day, Rupert Murdoch told Jared Kushner \u201cthe numbers are ironclad \u2013 it\u2019s not even close\u201d. Details of the Fox News owner\u2019s conversation with Trump\u2019s son-in-law and chief adviser about the call which most observers say confirmed Trump\u2019s defeat are contained in Kushner\u2019s memoir, Breaking History, which is due out next month. They also come as Murdoch-owned papers and even Fox News itself seem to turn against Trump in light of the January 6 hearings on the US Capitol attack and his attempt to overturn his election defeat. A first extract from the book, in which Kushner described being secretly treated for thyroid cancer, was reported by Maggie Haberman of the New York Times. On Wednesday another Times reporter, Kenneth Vogel, tweeted pictures of pages from Kushner\u2019s book, each emblazoned with the word \u201cconfidential\u201d. Kushner\u2019s description of the shock of the Fox News Arizona call mirrors those in numerous reports and books on Trump\u2019s 2020 defeat, his refusal to accept it and the attack on US democracy which followed. \u201cThe shocking projection brought our momentum to a screeching halt,\u201d Kushner writes. \u201cIt instantly changed the mood among our campaign\u2019s leaders, who were scrambling to understand the network\u2019s methodology.\u201d Kushner describes the Trump campaign\u2019s focus on Arizona and writes that losing there \u201cwould drastically narrow our path to victory\u201d. In Landslide, a book released last year, the author Michael Wolff reported that Murdoch gave his son Lachlan Murdoch approval for Fox News to call Arizona for Biden with \u201ca signature grunt\u201d and a barb for Trump: \u201cFuck him.\u201d Fox News denied Wolff\u2019s story. Kushner writes: \u201cI dialed Rupert Murdoch and asked why Fox News had made the Arizona call before hundreds of thousands of votes were tallied. Rupert said he would look into the issue, and minutes later he called back. \u201c\u2018Sorry Jared, there is nothing I can do,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018The Fox News data authority says the numbers are ironclad \u2013 he says it won\u2019t be close.\u2019\u201d Biden won Arizona by about 10,000 votes, a margin which increased after a partisan audit encouraged by Trump allies and commissioned by state Republicans. Key members of the Fox News decision desk left after the election. Chris Stirewalt, the politics editor, was fired. He has appeared before the January 6 committee. \u201cWe knew [Arizona] would be a consequential call because it was one of five states that really mattered,\u201d Stirewalt testified. Stirewalt also said that by the time of the Arizona call, Trump\u2019s chances of beating Biden were \u201cvery small\u201d and \u201cgetting smaller\u201d. After Arizona, he said, those chances dwindled to \u201cnone\u201d. In his book, Kushner shades close to his father-in-law\u2019s lie about electoral fraud in Biden\u2019s victory, writing: \u201c2020 was full of anomalies.\u201d The election was called for Biden on 7 November, when Pennsylvania fell into his column. He won the electoral college by 306-232, the same margin Trump called a landslide when it landed in his favour against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden won the popular vote by more than 7m. In his passage on the speech Trump gave in the early hours of 4 November, the day after election day, claiming \u201cFrankly, we did win this election\u201d, Kushner says he was called by Karl Rove, the strategist who helped George W Bush win \u201cthe closest presidential election in US history\u201d, against Al Gore in 2000. Trump claimed to have been the victim of fraud. Rove, Kushner writes, said: \u201cThe president\u2019s rhetoric is all wrong. He\u2019s going to win. Statistically, there\u2019s no way the Democrats can catch up with you now.\u201d Kushner says he responded: \u201cCall the president and tell him that.\u201d Trump later turned on Rove, who he said called him at 10.30pm on election night \u201cto congratulate me on \u2018a great win\u2019\u201d. Fox News called Arizona just before midnight. On Wednesday, Vogel also tweeted pages in which Kushner describes his work on presidential pardons. Kushner says he did not oppose a pardon for Steve Bannon, the former Trump strategist who was accused of fraud but who was a prominent White House leaker, because of the work Bannon did on Trump\u2019s winning campaign in 2016. He also writes that when Trump pardoned Alice Johnson, a Black grandmother sentenced on a minor drugs-related charge of the sort Kushner targeted in his work on sentencing reform, Trump said: \u201cLet\u2019s hope Alice doesn\u2019t go out and kill anyone!\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-20T12:30:19Z",
            "content": "The Guardian\u2019s parent company has recorded its strongest financial results since 2008, aided by more contributions from online readers and increased income from its international operations. Annual revenues at Guardian Media Group grew by 13% to \u00a3255.8m, its highest income since audiences shifted online and destroyed the traditional newspaper business. The company also produced a cash surplus for the first time in many years. The Guardian\u2019s online readers now contribute more money to the Guardian than readers of its UK print newspapers. When digital advertising and other income is taken into account, more than two-thirds of Guardian Media Group\u2019s total income now comes from its online operations. Keith Underwood, the interim chief executive, said: \u201cStrong revenue growth and our best cash performance in decades have firmly established a sustainable platform from which we can make strategic investments to grow the Guardian\u2019s global reach, impact and revenue. \u201cEconomic and market conditions will be challenging in the year ahead. However, with outstanding journalism, a trusted brand, and the financial resources to invest, we are well placed to continue our growth strategy.\u201d Unlike other British newspaper groups, the Guardian is not owned by a rich individual or a listed company that has to return profits to shareholders. Instead, its proprietor is the Scott Trust, which maintains an investment fund \u2013 now worth \u00a31.3bn \u2013 that is used to subsidise the newspaper and secure the Guardian\u2019s editorial independence. The Scott Trust has historically given Guardian Media Group access to a cash injection of up to \u00a330m a year. The latest financial accounts, which cover the 12 months to April 2022, show that Guardian Media Group performed so well it instead produced a cash surplus of \u00a36.7m. A spokesperson for Guardian Media Group said it expected to dip back into this funding next year to facilitate targeted investment in hiring more journalists in specific editorial areas, as well as investing in new technology. Next year could be tougher for the media industry, with an economic slowdown expected to hit advertising revenue. The costs of printing a daily newspaper are also increasing substantially for all publishers due to the rapidly increasingly price of paper. The Guardian\u2019s transformation to a business based on digital income is more advanced than at most other UK newspapers, which are facing ongoing decline. While the company has 120,000 print subscribers to the Guardian and the Observer, it now has more than a million digital supporters making ongoing contributions for its website and app. The increase in income means Guardian Media Group is bringing in more revenue than Telegraph Media Group. The accounts show that the Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, received a pay rise to \u00a3495,000, after an independent salary review by the Scott Trust. The former chief executive Annette Thomas, who departed last year, received a one-off payment of \u00a3795,000 to cover her notice period. The Guardian has invested heavily in its outlets in the US and Australia, with further investment anticipated in its European operations. These continue to grow rapidly and attract paying readers, with more than one-third of the company\u2019s total income coming from outside the UK. The Guardian Media Group chair, Charles Gurassa, said the results vindicated the decision made six years ago to ask for financial support from online readers, rather than follow many other news sites and put up a paywall. \u201cTheir support means the organisation can continue to invest in quality journalism, enabling broader and deeper coverage of the events that matter around the world and providing highly trusted independent news to our global audiences.\u201d"

            "title": "Tory leadership race: Kemi Badenoch eliminated as Rishi Sunak tops poll of MPs \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2022-07-19T17:17:16Z",
            "content": "Kemi Badenoch has been eliminated from the Conservative leadership race, setting up a battle between Penny Mordaunt and Liz Truss to join Rishi Sunak in the last round. Some bookmakers are now giving odds making Truss the new favourite in the contest. These are the implied odds of winning from Smarkets, the betting exchange company. Labour under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn was riven by bitter infighting, with his supporters and opponents using the issue of antisemitism within the party \u201cas a factional weapon\u201d, a long-awaited report has said. In his response to the report, published in full on his Facebook page, Corbyn says the report should trigger a debate about whether or not the Labour party is there to serve its members. He says: The appalling behaviour that Forde calls out, including the repulsive racism and sexism shown to Diane Abbott and others, should have no place in a progressive party. Toxic factionalism is far from over - nor are persistent problems of racism and sexism - and action must be taken, as Forde makes clear. Most of all, the party needs to decide what it is for and who decides that. Are we a democratic socialist party, run by members and affiliated unions, that aims for a fundamental transfer of wealth and power from the few to the many? Or are we something else? Millions of public sector workers including teachers, doctors, nurses, and police officers are to receive a below-inflation pay rises this year, raising the prospect of industrial action. The government has now published various written ministerial statements with details of pay awards. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has published details of the pay award for police officers. She says: The review body recommends a consolidated increase of \u00a31,900 to all police officer pay points for all ranks from 1 September 2022, equivalent to 5% overall. It is targeted at those on the lowest pay points to provide an uplift of up to 8.8%, and between 0.6% and 1.8% for those on the highest pay points. The government recognises that increases in the cost of living are having a significant impact on the lower paid. It is within this context and after careful consideration that we have chosen to accept this recommendation in full. As at March 2022 there are 142,526 police officers who will receive this consolidated increase. Patel has also published details of the pay awards for police and crime commissioners. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has said members of armed forces will get a 3.75% pay rise. The full details are here. Steve Barclay, the health secretary, has released full details of the award for NHS staff. (See 4.31pm.) James Cleverly, the education secretary, has released full details of the award for teachers. (See 5.16pm.) Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, says he has decided judges should get a 3% pay rise, instead of the 3.5% recommended by the senior salaries review body. And Raab says prison officers will get a pay rise of at least 4%, with more for lower paid staff. Heather Wheeler, the Cabinet Office minister, says senior civil servants should get an across the board increase of 2%, instead of the 3% recommended by the senior salaries review body. But pay band minimums will increase too. Experienced teachers in England will get a 5% pay rise for the next academic year, the government has announced after recommendations from the School Teachers\u2019 Review Body (STRB). PA Media says: Both the NASUWT and NEU teaching unions, which have threatened strikes in autumn over pay, have said the proposed increase of 5% for more experienced staff is too low. The NEU has said it will now consult its members on strike action in the autumn. NASUWT previously said it would hold a national strike ballot if the government fails to \u201cdeliver pay restoration for teachers\u201d. And Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union, previously said a 5% rise for more experienced staff would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The government announced the starting salary for teachers outside London will rise by 8.9%, with salaries reaching \u00a328,000 for the 2022/23 academic year. It said this meant it had made \u201cgood progress\u201d towards a manifesto commitment for starting salaries rising to \u00a330,000. \u201cThose in the early stages of their careers will also benefit from significant increases, ranging from 5% to 8% depending on experience,\u201d the government said. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union, said the government had been \u201cforced\u201d by members to drop a previous proposal of 3% for experienced teachers, but added it had not \u201cmoved far enough\u201d. He said a 5% increase would mean \u201cyet another huge cut\u201d to the real value of pay against inflation, and that this would mean members were consulted over strike action in autumn. \u201cWith RPI inflation at 11.7% according to the latest figures, experienced teachers would see a bigger pay cut than the one inflicted by last year\u2019s pay freeze and even the increase to starting pay is below inflation so is a real-terms pay cut,\u201d he said. The rise is equivalent to an increase of almost \u00a32,100 on the average salary of \u00a342,400 this year. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s supporters in the Labour party have welcomed the findings of the Forde report (see 2.29pm and 4.17pm), saying it vindicates claims they made at the time about how some staffers at party HQ were obstructive or hostile to the leadership. Here are some of their responses. From Len McCluskey, the former Unite general secretary From John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor From Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour organisation From Alex Nunns, the journalist and former Corbyn speechwriter Andrew Fisher, Corbyn\u2019s former head of policy, has criticised the Labour party\u2019s response to the report. And my colleague Owen Jones, who was one of Corbyn\u2019s most prominent media supporters, has posted a long Twitter thread on the report. It starts here. Police pay is going to go up by an average of 5%, with low earners getting more and high earners getting less, the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar reports. The government is starting to release details of public sector pay awards. The Department of Health and Social Care says all NHS staff will get a pay rise of at least \u00a31,400, with the lowest earners receiving up to 9.3%. Eligible dentists and doctors will receive a 4.5% pay rise, it says. DHSC says: All NHS staff under the remit of this year\u2019s pay review will receive a pay rise. Over 1 million staff under the Agenda for Change contract, including nurses, paramedics and midwives, will benefit from a pay rise of at least \u00a31,400 this year backdated to April 2022. This is on top of the 3% pay rise they received last year, despite a wider public sector pay pause. This means that the lowest earners such as porters and cleaners will see a 9.3% increase in their basic pay this year, compared to last year. The average basic pay for nurses will increase from around \u00a335,600 as of March 2022 to around \u00a337,000 and the basic pay for newly qualified nurses will increase by 5.5%, from \u00a325,655 last year to \u00a327,055. Dentists and doctors within the Doctors and Dentists\u2019 Remuneration Body (DDRB) remit this year will receive a 4.5% pay rise as the government accepts the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB) and the DDRB in full. Across the public sector, these are the highest uplifts in nearly 20 years, reflecting the vital contributions public sector workers make to the country and the cost of living pressures facing households. Back to the Tories, and the Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt campaigns are both trying to win over Kemi Badenoch\u2019s supporters. A Truss campaign spokesperson said: Kemi Badenoch has run a fantastic campaign and contributed enormously to the battle of ideas throughout this contest. Now is the time for the party to unite behind a candidate who will govern in a Conservative way and who has shown she can deliver time and again. Liz has a bold new economic agenda that will immediately tackle the cost of living crisis, boost economic growth and continue leading the global fight for freedom in Ukraine. And Mordaunt said: This afternoon colleagues once again put their trust in me and I cannot thank them enough. We are so nearly across the finish line. I am raring to go and excited to put my case to members across the country and win. I want to pay tribute to my friend Kemi Badenoch who electrified the leadership contest with her fresh thinking and bold policies. She and I both know that the old way of government isn\u2019t working as it should. Voters want change and we owe it to them to offer a bold new vision for this country. Kemi\u2019s passion for this showed and I\u2019m glad she put herself forward to be heard. The Forde report into factionalism in the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn, and specifically into a leaked report exposing anti-Corbyn staffers making racist and sexist comments, is available online in full here. Here are 10 takeaways from what it says. 1) Supporters AND opponents of Corbyn using the issue of antisemitism within the party \u201cas a factional weapon\u201d. Both \u201csides\u201d were thus \u201cweaponising the issue and failing to recognise the seriousness of antisemitism\u201d. 2) Factional warfare undermined the party\u2019s ability to function. Under Corbyn, the party was \u201cspending more time occupied by factional differences than working collaboratively to demonstrate that the party is an effective opposition\u201d. Both sides blamed one another for this inability to properly function. The report says: Both genuinely believed that the other side was trying to sabotage their work in this period \u2013 sometimes with a degree of justification, and sometimes not. On the 2017 election, Forde concludes it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that the parallel campaign run by anti-Corbyn staffers cost the party the election by, for example, funnelling support elsewhere. He says: \u201cThe two sides were trying to win in different ways.\u201d 3) There is not clear evidence that Corbyn\u2019s team or others overtly interfered in investigations about alleged antisemitism. The report finds most of the problems were created by a lack of clarity on procedures, aggravated by factionalism. 4) The report dismissed the complaint by Labour staffers that derogatory messages were \u201ccherrypicked and selectively edited\u201d in the leaked report. It says they were \u201cdeplorably factional and insensitive, and at times discriminatory, attitudes\u201d. 5) Corbyn himself declined to be interviewed for the report, though signed a joint submission to the inquiry. Forde described the Labour leader as \u201cnotably silent\u201d. 6) Forde also finds there is a \u201cvociferous faction in the party sees any issues regarding antisemitism as exaggerated by the right to embarrass the left\u201d. 7) He also finds that the leaked report itself \u2013 authored at Unite\u2019s headquarters \u2013 was \u201ca factional document with an agenda to advance, and that the quoted messages were selected pursuant to that agenda\u201d. 8) There is significant work still to be done to combat racism in the party, Forde finds. Authors of the WhatsApp messages \u201cshould have considered \u2026 the fact that Diane Abbott is a black woman, and has been vilified on that basis over several decades\u201d. 9) But Forde also finds the messages\u2019 authors \u201cwere not given a right of reply before their messages were included in the leaked report; that was a clear breach of natural justice\u201d. He says some were reported in a \u201cselective way\u201d. 10) Forde praises the changes under Keir Starmer to the disciplinary process. He says; We must commend the party for its efforts more recently to achieve a greater degree of independence in its system of regulation, with notable reforms approved at the party conference in 2021. This is from Kemi Badenoch. Candidates often enter a leadership contest not really expecting to win, but hoping to raise their profile in the party. Badenoch has achieved that more successfully than most fourth-placed candidates, and, whoever wins, she can expect a promotion in the reshuffle. Rishi Sunak is almost certain to be on the final ballot for party members, and he is more likely to be facing Liz Truss than Penny Mordaunt, these results suggest. (See 3.03pm.) But nothing is certain from these numbers \u2013 other than the fact that Kemi Badenoch, the former equalities minister, is now out of the contest. Sunak is now only one vote away from the point where he is guaranteed a slot on the final ballot. Previously 120 (just over a third of the total electorate, 357 MPs) was the point where it became mathematically impossible for both other candidates to get more votes, but, with Tobias Ellwood now banned from taking part, 119 is the benchmark. Sunak is on 118. It is almost impossible to believe he will not get there tomorrow. But he has been finding it increasingly hard to pick up votes. In the second ballot he was up 13 votes, and in the third he was up 14 votes. Today he is up just three. Mordaunt is up 10 votes on yesterday. But she was expected to do quite well with the 31 Tom Tugendhat votes released last night, but instead more of them may have gone to Truss, who is up by 15 votes. It is never quite that simple, because it\u2019s a secret ballot and the votes that change are not just those released by a candidate who has fallen out, but this does suggest Truss has momentum. And it also suggests that \u201cStop Mordaunt\u201d may be a more powerful voting incentive than \u201cStop Truss\u201d. The \u201cStop Mordaunt\u201d vote might also be a \u201cStop Sunak\u201d vote, if MPs are assuming that Truss would beat Sunak, but Sunak would beat Mordaunt. No one can be sure that this assessment is true, but Truss is a more experienced campaigner than Mordaunt, with stronger convictions. She seems to have impressed Tory members more than Mordaunt in the past week. (See 2pm.) Truss is now only six votes behind Mordaunt. But Badenoch\u2019s supporters are mostly rightwingers, and rightwingers identify with Truss but not Mordaunt. (Both started off as Cameron centrists, but Truss has done a better job of reinventing herself.) And even if the Badenoch votes break in favour of Truss rather than Mordaunt by just 60%/40% (as they may have done today), that would still be enough to allow Truss to overtake Mordaunt. Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, reads out the result. He starts: \u201cNearly there.\u201d The last ballot is tomorrow Rishi Sunak - 118 (up 3) Penny Mordaunt - 92 (up 10) Liz Truss - 86 (up 15) Kemi Badenoch - 59 (up 1) The 1922 Committee is about to announce the results of the fourth ballot for the Tory leadership. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss pulled out of a planned TV debate, leading to it being cancelled, after senior Tories took the view that the ITV debate on Sunday night was a PR disaster for the party. Quite how right they were is shown by this Labour party video, which is little more than a round-up of edited highlights from the debate. Given what is happening in the Conservative party, producing Labour party campaign adverts must be one of the easier jobs in politics at the moment. Michael Gove has just scripted another advert-in-waiting for the party only this lunchtime. (See 2.47pm.) Michael Gove, the former levelling up secretary, has said the government is failing to deliver \u201ccertain essential functions\u201d like swiftly providing driving licences and passports. Speaking at a Policy Exchange event, he said the state should \u201cdo fewer things\u201d but be \u201cstrong and effective\u201d. He said: I believe that there are certain essential functions that the state needs to do better, and which we fail to deliver at the moment. There are some core functions, giving you your passport, giving your driving licence, which is simply at the moment not functioning ... We are no longer providing people, either with the efficient delivery of services or the effective focus on what the state should do. I think that\u2019s because we have become a government and an administration that is knocked off course by powerful stories that are told by people with a mission - and our own sense of mission has not been strong enough to resist that. At the same event Lord Frost, the former Brexit minister, blamed the civil service for government failings. He said: We\u2019re always told that we have a Rolls-Royce [civil service] and the problem is that ministers don\u2019t make their will clear. Well, ministers made their will clear about coming back into the office several months ago and yet it is still not happening. So I believe there is something very fundamentally wrong in the way the civil service and the state is working. But Camilla Cavendish, who was head of David Cameron\u2019s policy unit when he was PM, criticised Frost for blaming civil servants. She said: There are people on this panel who have been in government for the past few years and under you guys this stuff has fallen apart - so why haven\u2019t you done anything about it? The government has announced that schools in England will get a 1.9% increase in per-pupil funding next year, prompting fury from teaching unions who described it as \u201ca big real-terms cut for education spending\u201d and warned of a return \u201cto the bad days of austerity.\u201d With inflation predicted to soar into double digits by the autumn, Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the government\u2019s latest funding award would end up \u201cdamaging\u201d children\u2019s education, rather than improving it. There was also criticism of a 2.1% increase in funding for free school meals which will amount to an additional \u00a310 a head. Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said: With food and energy prices spiralling, schools too are suffering from the cost-of-living crisis. Increasing free school meals funding by just \u00a310 per head a year will not stop schools from choosing between cutting quality or putting up prices for other struggling families. Boris Johnson\u2019s parting gift to schools is a slap in the face. As our teachers deal with sweltering classrooms and squeezed salaries, this Conservative government has handed mainstream schools a real terms pay cut worth almost \u00a32.5bn. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that school funding per pupil in 2024 will be at about the same level in real terms as in 2010. He said: The government has short-changed education for many years and, unfortunately, that has left the sector in a very difficult financial situation. Labour, under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, was riven with bitter factional infighting, with both supporters and opponents of Corbyn using the issue of antisemitism within the party \u201cas a factional weapon\u201d, a long-awaited report has said. My colleague Peter Walker has the story here. This is from William Wragg, a vice chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, with a picture from the room whre the Tory ballots are being counted. Voting has now closed in the Tory leadership ballot. The Telegraph\u2019s Ben Riley-Smith says an \u201cAnyone but Liz\u201d faction is wants to see Liz Truss knocked out of the contest. YouGov has released new polling from Conservative party members that suggests Rishi Sunak would lose by a large margin to all three of his remaining rivals - Kemi Badenoch, Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt - in the final ballot. The poll suggests Badenoch would beat all the others, although her margin over Truss (46% to 43%) is so close that YouGov say they are effectively tied. A week ago, when YouGov conducted a similar poll, the results suggested Mordaunt would beat all other candidates. Since then her support has been plummeting (albeit from a very high base) and the poll suggests Badenoch and Truss would both beat her - but not by much. The YouGov results are broadly similar to the findings of a ConservativeHome survey of party members released at the weekend. That also had Badenoch beating all other candidates in one to one contests. But the ConservativeHome survey had Badenoch getting a much higher level of support than YouGov did (it had her beating Truss by 61% to 31%, not 46% to 43%), and ConservativeHome also had Sunak beating Mordaunt (by 43% to 41%). The YouGov sample, with 725 members, is weighted. The ConservativeHome panel is bigger, with around 840 members, but it is self-selecting, and may be more representative of highly engaged party members. They are also readers of ConservativeHome, which has given Badenoch a lot of positive coverage. The YouGov poll and the ConservativeHome survey both suggest that opinion has shifted considerably over the last week, as members have learnt more about the candidates. The contest has several more weeks to run and so in theory we could see more big fluctuations. But many members vote as soon as they get a ballot paper, and so realistically it could be decided by early August. These are from my colleage Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defence editor, on Liz Truss\u2019s promise to raise defence spending to 3% of GDP. (See 10.11am.) Here is Boris Johnson with his leaving present from the cabinet: Churchill\u2019s six-volume history of the second world war. (See 12pm.) Given that Johnson has written a biography of Churchill, you might assume he would have had a set already. Penny Mordaunt, the international trade minister and Tory leadership candidate, has today released a plan for levelling up. She says she will double the number of apprenticeships available in the north, deliver the Northern Powerhouse Rail project and ensure that 50% of new hydrogen capacity is built in the north. She has also backed the Northern Research Group\u2019s four-point plan for the north. Jake Berry, chair of the Northern Research Group, was one of Tom Tugendhat\u2019s most prominent backers, and he has retweeted Mordaunt\u2019s tweet about the pledge, which is probably a sign that his vote is now heading her way. Today the Times quotes one unnamed Tugendhat supporter saying most of his votes could go to Mordaunt. It reports: Before the third ballot, one backer of Tugendhat said that they believed a majority of his supporters would now move to Mordaunt. Mordaunt, who was in the cabinet under Theresa May but has only held junior positions under [Boris] Johnson, is seen by some MPs to also embody the clean start offered by Tugendhat. One Tugendhat supporter said, however, that they believed the main reason many would move to Mordaunt was that they wanted to \u201ckeep Truss out of the final two\u201d. This is the full story from my colleague Helena Horton on Kemi Badenoch\u2019s declaration last night that she would be willing to delay the 2050 net zero target - having told a Tory hustings earlier that she was committed to it. (See 10.01am.) Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has won an endorsement in her campaign for the Conservative leadership from Dmytro Kuleba, her Ukrainian counterpart. Boris Johnson posed for a team photograph with his cabinet today to mark what might be their last meeting together. Voting has opened in the fourth round of the Tory leadership ballot. Boris Johnson received first-edition copies of Winston Churchill\u2019s books on the second world war as a gift from cabinet colleagues, PA Media reports. PA says: The books by Churchill, a hero of Johnson\u2019s, were presented to the prime minister by his entire cabinet, a Downing Street spokesman said. \u201cAt the conclusion of cabinet, the prime minister was presented with gifts to thank him for his service to the country, including first editions of Winston Churchill\u2019s books on the second world war,\u201d the spokesman told reporters. Penny Mordaunt\u2019s supporters do believe that No 10 has removed the whip from Tobias Ellwood to stop him voting for her in the leadership ballot (contrary to what Nadine Dorries claims - see 11.21am), Newsnight\u2019s Nicholas Watt reports. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary and Boris Johnson loyalist, has dismissed as \u201cridiculous\u201d claims that Tobias Ellwood has had the Tory whip removed to stop him voting against the Johnson candidate in the leadership contest. (See 10.08am and 10.45am.) It was a New Labour special adviser that coined the phrase about \u201ca good day to bury bad news\u201d. Today would sort of qualify \u2013 the hottest day ever, public sector pay awards being published, the Tory leadership contest at a key stage \u2013 and Labour has confirmed that today it might publish a report that is likely to be horribly embarrassing to the party. A Labour spokesperson said: Labour\u2019s general secretary, David Evans, has now received the Forde report and he will be taking it to today\u2019s national executive committee meeting with a clear recommendation that the NEC agree the publication of the report as soon as possible today. The report, from Martin Forde QC, was commissioned after the leak of an internal Labour report in 2020 purportedly showed evidence of party staff being guilty of bullying, racism and sexism. The leak, which seemed to be a hostile act aimed at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s opponents (who came out worst from the revelations), led to the party being sued for defamation and breach of privacy. My colleague Jessica Elgot has a guide to the background of the Forde report here. Tobias Ellwood has said that travel disruption meant he could not return from Moldova yesterday in time for the Commons confidence vote. (See 10.08am.) He said he was \u201cvery sorry\u201d to have the whip withdrawn, but that he would continue with his tour, where he will be having meetings about reopening Odesa port. He said: Following my meeting yesterday with the president of Moldova I was unable to secure return travel due to unprecedented disruption both here and in the UK. I am very sorry to lose the whip but will now continue my meetings in Ukraine promoting the prime minister\u2019s efforts here and specifically seeking to secure the reopening of Odesa port - so vital grain exports can recommence. Although MPs can have the whip removed for failing to obey a three-line whip, it is unusual for this sanction to be deployed against an MP who only misses a vote, and does not vote against the party, and has a reasonable excuse for being away. It is even more unusual for this to happen in relation to a vote which the party was at no risk of losing. Boris Johnson has a majority of 111 in the vote last night. But Ellwood has been one of Johnson\u2019s most vocal backbench critics and Johnson is vengeful. He once said his favourite movie scene was the end of the Godfather with its \u201cmultiple retribution killings\u201d. His decision to sack Michael Gove as levelling up secretary two weeks ago seemed to be motivated purely by score settling. The loss of the whip would be serious for Ellwood if it meant he could not stand as a Conservative candidate at the next election. But the whip is likely to be restored by the next Tory leader well before any election takes place. However, the move will stop Ellwood voting in the leadership contest today and tomorrow, and this could help Liz Truss get onto the final ballot against Rishi Sunak. Johnson blames Sunak for undermining him, and although he has not backed Truss in public, his allies are actively working to get her elected. Boris Johnson is chairing what may be the final meeting of his cabinet and - as has become his usual practice in recent weeks - he invited in a TV camera to record his opening remarks. Johnson claimed the heatwave vindicated the government\u2019s decision to push for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. He told his ministers: Who can doubt that we were right to be the first major economy to go for net zero? It may be sometimes unfashionable to say this but it is the right thing to do. In fact, the legislation making 2050 a legally binding target was passed into law in the final days of Theresa May\u2019s government, but Johnson has retained the commitment to net zero. As my colleague Fiona Harvey argues in today\u2019s First Edition briefing, Johnson is more committed to net zero than any of the candidates who might succeed him. \u201cNobody else in the higher echelons of the Conservative party gives a stuff,\u201d Fiona says. \u201cHe was the only champion green Tories had.\u201d Addressing cabinet, Johnson also suggested the experience coming out of lockdown showed why the heatwave should not be allowed to stop people working. He said: On another scorching, sweltering day I think it\u2019s very, very important that we think back to that moment that we opened up [after the lockdown] and try and balance risk with the need to keep our country, our society and our economy moving. I hope, cabinet, that you are all agreed that as far as possible we should keep schools open and keep our transport system going as far as we possibly can. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has used an interview with the Times to declare that she would raise defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030. She said: We live in an increasingly dangerous world where the threat level is higher than a decade ago, and we need a stronger deterrent to face down those threats and ensure Britain leads on the global stage. Ultimately that requires more resources. My number one priority is keeping this country safe and people can trust me to do that. Britain and the free world face a defining moment. We need a prime minister capable of leading internationally, who can also drive the economic growth we need here at home. I am the candidate best placed to do that. In a briefing about the announcement, the Truss campaign said defence spending needed to go up because of the increased threat from China and Russia. This message may appeal to some of the 31 supporters of Tom Tugendhat whose votes are up for grabs today. Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, has consistently argued that the UK has not taken the threat from China and Russia seriously enough. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the Commons defence committee, has had the Tory whip removed because he did not vote for the government in the confidence debate last night, the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman reports. Ellwood, who was one of the Tories most critical of Boris Johnson, did not have permission to be away. As Steven Swinford reports, the decision means Ellwood will not be able to vote in parliamentary leadership ballot until the whip is restored. He is a Penny Mordaunt supporter, and in a very tight race, a single vote could potentially make a difference. Kemi Badenoch can also claim to be the change candidate in another, less positive, sense. Yesterday she told a Tory climate fringe that she backed the government\u2019s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. She was the last candidate to make that commitment. But later in the day she had an apparent change of heart and told Talk TV that her commitment to the 2050 date was not absolute. Asked if she would ever consider changing the 2050 deadline, she replied: Yes, there are circumstances where I would delay it, but I think that the target itself is a bit of a red herring. The full interview is here. In a post on Twitter after last night\u2019s results were declared Kemi Badenoch claimed that Tom Tugendhat\u2019s departure from the race meant she was the only \u201cchange candidate\u201d left in the race. Penny Mordaunt would probably contest that. Badenoch, the former equalities minister, is the only candidate still in the race who has not served in cabinet. But as equalities minister she pursued an \u201canti-woke\u201d agenda popular with No 10. Mordaunt, the international trade minister, never resigned from Boris Johnson\u2019s government (unlike Badenoch). But she has never identified as an enthusiastic supporter of Johnsonism. Good morning. A week after nominations closed, and after three ballots, some of the fog around who will be our next prime minister has lifted and at least three propositions now seem reasonably well founded. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is now all but certain to be one of the two candidates on the final ballot for Conservative party members. He is now on 115 votes and once a candidate gets 120 (just over a third of the total), it is mathematically impossible for two other candidates to get more votes. Sunak is also particularly well placed to pick up many of the 31 Tom Tugendhat votes now up for grab; Sunak, like Tugendhat, presents as a mainstream pragmatist, not an ideological rightwinger. Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt are now the two strongest candidates in the contest to be the second person on the final ballot. One recent survey suggested both would beat Sunak in the final poll, but Truss more comfortably than Mordaunt. Almost certainly, Sunak\u2019s chances would be better against Mordaunt; her lack of experience means the risk of her campaign imploding under scrutiny remains high (over the last week her popularity has already fallen significantly), and Truss, unlike Mordaunt, would be guaranteed the support of the Tory right en masse. Kemi Badenoch looks likely to be eliminated this afternoon. It is not inevitable - she has defied expectations already - but she remains 13 votes behind Truss, and may struggle to get much of the Tugendhat vote. If she does fall out, her votes will be for grabs tomorrow - and would decide whether Sunak faces Truss or Mordaunt, which could in turn determine who gets elected as the next PM. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs what might be the last meeting of his cabinet. 10.30am: Officials from the CBI and the TUC are among the experts giving evidence to the Commons business committee on post-pandemic economic growth. 12pm: Voting starts in the fourth ballot for the Conservative party leadership. The ballot closes at 2pm. 12.30pm: Michael Gove, the former levelling up secretary, and Lord Frost, the former Brexit minister, take part in a discussion on the future of Conservatism at the Policy Exchange thinktank. 3pm: Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, announces the results of the latest leadership ballot. Afternoon: Pay awards for around 2.5 million public sector workers, including NHS staff and teachers, are due to be announced. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. Alternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com"

            "title": "Shinzo Abe assassination: Japanese head to polls in grief and disbelief",
            "date": "2022-07-09T13:05:35Z",
            "content": "Many Japanese voters will go to the polls on Sunday with a heavy heart, but also with a sense of quiet defiance, as they cast their ballots just two days after Shinzo Abe, the country\u2019s most influential politician of modern times, was shot dead while making a campaign speech. As the country struggled to come to terms with the first assassination of a current or former leader for almost 90 years, officials in the Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which Abe dominated for a decade, insisted his death would not derail the democratic process. \u201cWe absolutely must not tolerate violence during an election to suppress free speech,\u201d the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, told hundreds of supporters in central Japan on the eve of the upper house elections, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. This, though, will be an election like no other in recent times, taking place in the immediate aftermath of a crime that will reverberate in the public consciousness well beyond Sunday. While media pundits constructed largely benign versions of Abe\u2019s divisive political legacy, questions swirled around the circumstances leading to his death, at 67, minutes into a campaign address in front of a railway station in the western city of Nara. On Saturday, as on the previous day, Japan was playing a waiting game, craving answers but starved of information by investigators who had their suspect in custody while Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader until he resigned in 2020, was drawing his last breaths. The suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, told police that he initially planned to attack the leader of a religious group that he blamed for bankrupting his mother and ruining his family, the Kyodo news agency said, quoting investigative sources. His mother, he said, had made several donations to the group, whose name police have not revealed, adding that he had visited several locations where Abe had given campaign speeches. Yamagami, a 41-year-old resident of Nara, said he was also \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with Abe, whom he accused of promoting the group. On Saturday a black hearse carrying the body of Abe accompanied by his wife, Akie, arrived at their home in Tokyo from the hospital where staff had battled for five hours to save his life after he was shot in the back and neck at close range. Neighbours and senior party colleagues lowered their heads as the vehicle passed by. A wake will be held on Monday, with Abe\u2019s funeral to take place at a central Tokyo temple on Tuesday, attended by close family and friends, Japanese media said. There was no immediate word on any public memorial service. His death has prompted criticism of security arrangements and will almost certainly mean an end to the proximity voters enjoy to candidates at the kind of pre-election rally Abe attended on Friday. A debate about gun laws is unlikely, however. Japan already has an almost zero-tolerance approach to gun ownership, and the weapon that killed Abe is thought to have been homemade. That he was slain at the hands of a gunman has only added to the sense of disbelief. Japan \u2013 a country of 125 million \u2013 recorded just 10 gun-related criminal cases last year, according to police, resulting in one death and four injuries. Eight of those cases were related to yakuza crime syndicates. In Tokyo last year, police seized 61 guns, but there was not a single incident, injury or death connected with firearms. The assassination will not dramatically influence the outcome of Sunday\u2019s election, in which 125 of the 248 seats in the less powerful upper chamber are being contested. The LDP was expected to win more than half the seats before Abe\u2019s death, but a wave of sympathy could lift its share of the vote, according to some analysts. Less certain is how brightly Abe\u2019s torch will shine in the LDP, whose conservative wing is now emotionally, and ideologically, bereft. His death leaves a political legacy unrivalled in modern Japan, but also a vacuum at the heart of a party that has governed almost uninterrupted since Abe\u2019s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, helped found it in 1955. In the weeks before his death, Abe \u2013 then the leader of the party\u2019s biggest faction \u2013 called on the government to double defence spending, citing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as a warning that Japan\u2019s security could not be guaranteed in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. He also repeated the need for Kishida\u2019s government to revive his lifelong political ambition to revise the \u201cpacifist\u201d lines in the postwar constitution to recognise the legitimacy of the self-defence forces, as Japan refers to its military. Largely uncritical media reporting of his numerous public appearances had pundits wondering if he was considering a bid for a third term as prime minister. \u201cAlthough the rightwing of the party is the largest, it lacks an obvious successor with comparable skill, charisma and determination to carry forward its agenda,\u201d said James Brady, Japan analyst at the US advisory firm Teneo. Kishida, who has vowed to smooth the rough edges of Abe\u2019s economic policies and create a \u201cnew capitalism\u201d, could end up adopting his hawkish foreign policy mantle, Brady added. A strong election performance for the LDP, he said, \u201ccould catalyse Kishida to push for Abe\u2019s unfulfilled goal of amending Japan\u2019s constitution to allow for a stronger role for the military\u201d. On Saturday, a stream of people paid their respects at the spot where Abe fell. \u201cI\u2019m just shocked that this kind of thing happened in Nara,\u201d said Natsumi Niwa, after she and her son, age 10, had left flowers. The Japan Times, a newspaper well disposed to the Abe project, said the most appropriate response to Friday\u2019s tragedy was simply to vote. \u201cThis was an act of terrorism and there is no place for such behaviour in Japan,\u201d it said in an editorial. \u201cWe live in a democracy where disputes and differences are resolved by voting \u2026 not with violence.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-01T19:00:24Z",
            "content": "Papua New Guinea is heading to the polls on Monday and there are fears the vote could be more violent than the 2017 elections, in which more than 200 people died. Violence has plagued the lead-up to the vote. Local media reports that through May and the campaign period, there have been 28 election-related deaths, several injuries, an assassination attempt on a possible candidate, the shooting of an election official and burning of five vehicles. The election is being closely watched by regional players and more widely, including by Australia and China, after China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, visited early in June to try to salvage an economic and security deal. The two leading candidates for prime minister are incumbent James Marape and former leader Peter O\u2019Neill. Marape, who leads the ruling Pangu pati, introduced a manifesto centred on \u201cTaking back PNG and making it the richest black Christian nation\u201d on Earth when he took office in 2019. He has focused on more benefits for local residents in natural resource extraction, agriculture and small businesses. His predecessor, O\u2019Neill, the leader of the Peoples National Congress party, has policies centring on health, education and providing 500,000 jobs if he is returned. Catholic Professionals Society president Paul Harricknen said: \u201cViolence is inevitable when the stakes are high. There is so much stress and tension.\u201d The 2012 and 2017 elections were plagued with election-related violence and the 2022 elections could be much worse, he said. Problems with updating election rolls dating back to 2012 were expected to add to tensions. \u201cThis roll was not updated and the 2017 elections used it and the electoral commission did nothing since. A high number of young voters stand to miss out on voting in this elections,\u201d Harricknen said. Economics lecturer Maholopa Laveil said election-related violence and deaths were recorded after the 2007, 2012 and 2017 elections. In 2017 204 deaths were recorded \u2013 the highest number out of all the elections. \u201cGiven poor election administration to this point, we can expect the same levels of violence as seen in 2017,\u201d Laveil said. Institute of National Affairs director Paul Barker said many constituencies, including in the Highlands provinces, often remained peaceful during voting, with \u201csome atmosphere of festivity or carnival\u201d. But he said \u201cit does sometimes erupt into threats, intimidation and sometimes violence, particularly in some electorates, occasionally during the campaigning period, but more often as ballot boxes are escorted to the tally room, or during the counting and the results come in.\u201d The 2017 election was also the worst to date in terms of both electoral preparedness, as well as systematic and local manipulation of voting. This election, the commission also seems to be ill-prepared, he said. \u201cReturning officers have also been appointed late, although one of their main functions is the update of the electoral roll, and seven new constituencies have been rather randomly added, which has added to the challenges. The prevalence of a large number of weapons out there is also severely problematic, and risks minor skirmishes getting out of hand. \u201cNevertheless, there remains a strong eagerness to campaign and vote, so although a flawed democracy \u2013 PNG remains a vibrant democracy, which many other countries are not,\u201d Barker said. Assistant Commissioner of Police Dr Philip Mitna said his security forces \u201care prepared for the inevitable. We are not going into a war zone \u2013 we\u2019d like for our people to own the process. It\u2019s their democratic right to vote freely and partake in this process.\u201d Election campaigning in PNG has always been a very expensive exercise, with estimates of millions of the local currency, kinas, spent on campaign financing. \u201cWhen you consider the amount of money and resources spent and the expectations that go with it if the candidates don\u2019t win, the sponsors and supporters behind the candidates \u2013 there is so much to lose,\u201d Harricknen said. \u201cNowadays, some candidates have driven the cost up for everyone, not only for blanket advertising, but also hosting feasts and in many cases bribing the electorate with cash and other rewards, which is illegal.\u201d Many voters have also lost touch with the function of an MP as a representative in parliament, examining proposed legislation and overseeing government performance, and instead expected them to deliver goods, jobs, funeral expenses and college fees."

            "date": "2022-07-17T21:09:20Z",
            "content": "Is that it? Is what we saw on ITV\u2019s Sunday night debate really all that the \u201cworld\u2019s most successful party\u201d can stump up, in these dying days of its 12-year run in power? Not a whisper of a new idea from any of them, no fresh air. Yes, hurrah for the most diverse applicants ever, with only one token pale male, but you would have to search in vain for diverse views. Here is only the narcissism of infinitesimally small differences in style, all for tax cuts varying marginally, but not in their state-shrinking intent. That leaves only \u201ccharacter\u201d to fight over: there was the vaunting and boasting of their many qualities, but humility was not among them. None would put Boris Johnson into their cabinet, they said. This is the man they elevated and served under, whose every bad act they obediently voted for, with rebellions far too late: Kemi Badenoch jumped just after Rishi Sunak\u2019s belated leap. Only Tom Tugendhat could shake off the disgrace, as the one clean skin. But if Tugendhat is the last remnant of \u201cone-nation\u201d Toryism in what is now effectively the Brexit party, he too is a tax-cutter and state-shrinker (with cakeist high defence spending). He too is all for sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. On show was a veneer of collegiate affability, barely disguising the vitriol hurled by their campaigns in the most toxic prime ministerial contest ever. A Johnsonite blasts Rishi Sunak as a \u201crat\u201d and \u201csly assassin\u201d. Penny Mordaunt takes even heavier incoming fire over incompetence from David Frost, the incompetent who signed the EU treaty only to renege on it. Mainly she\u2019s under fire from Kemi Bandenoch\u2019s anti-woke ferocity over trans issues, a subject that is a planet away from election-winning turf. But \u201cwokeism\u201d is where many in this deranged party choose to fight. Labour has often been riven by splits, but never reaching this public toxicity. Its schisms are over profound differences in political direction, but this poison springs from a lack of substance: all personal vendettas, ambition and malice with scant serious content. Tugendhat wins Mr Nice Guy, but that may not get him far in the nasty party. Missing from the debate was much connection with what\u2019s happening out here. The temperature in much of Britain is boiling up to an unprecedented \u201cred warning\u201d, as wildfires burn around Europe, yet you would search in vain for any burning sense of alarm among any of these. No one gives it priority in their statements. For the cost of living crisis, which tops all voters\u2019 concerns, all candidates proffer tax cuts as the answer, though Sunak would delay them. None reveal that most of what\u2019s saved from income tax cuts goes to the better off, the Institute for Public Policy Research finds, and virtually none to low earners \u2013 but that\u2019s the nature of their shared Conservatism. Tepid talk of growth, opportunity and aspiration from them all comes with vacant maps. Nothing to make levelling up real. Do they have any plans, or are they just unmentionable? Only Tugendhat kept reminding the other candidates that the real opponent they face in a real election is Keir Starmer, claiming that he alone, as an indefinably more moderate voice, can take the fight to Labour. But none seems to be even in the battlefield where general elections are won. All fail to face up to the state to which their party has led the country. They seem oblivious to things falling apart. Ambulances struggle to reach people having heart attacks and stroke victims, hospitals overflow, court cases are booked up years ahead, social care collapses, and children go hungry. The candidates all champion \u201cchange\u201d, but from what to what? We are none the wiser. At the end of the debate, all of them vowed not to hold an early general election. Don\u2019t believe them. The chances are each of them would seize any hope of a new leader bounce at the ballot box, as things can only get worse over the next two years. Who would frighten Labour most? None unduly, each with different vulnerabilities, all with the same unanswered questions about future public sector cuts. Smug Sunak is weighed down by economic calamity, Truss is unspeakable, Mordaunt implausible, Tugendhat uninspiring, Badenoch off the scale on the right. Bring it on, Labour was chortling afterwards.

            "title": "Guardian Essential poll: Albanese\u2019s approval wavering as honeymoon fades",
            "date": "2022-07-11T17:30:05Z",
            "content": "A majority of voters favour a return to mask wearing to help slow transmission during the Omicron third wave, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll, which also finds Anthony Albanese\u2019s initial honeymoon with voters has moderated. The latest survey of 1,097 respondents finds more than half of Guardian Essential respondents (56%) continued to approve of the prime minister\u2019s performance (down three points since June), while 24% disapproved (up six points in a month). Albanese\u2019s approval and disapproval metrics have been volatile in recent months. To step out the recent trend, the Guardian Essential poll taken immediately before election day showed voters were evenly split between approving (42%) and disapproving (41%) of the Labor leader\u2019s performance. But the first poll taken after Labor\u2019s election victory on 21 May saw voter approval of Albanese gallop from 42% to 59%, while disapproval of his performance dropped from 41% to 18% \u2013 a positive turnaround in voter sentiment not seen since the Rudd era. While disapproval of Albanese\u2019s performance had ticked up as the prime minister settled into the top job, just under half the sample (47%) believed Australia was going in the right direction, compared with 28% who say wrong direction and 26% undecided \u2013 which is basically the same view voters held a month ago. Albanese has set a cracking pace since winning the election, embarking on a heavy program of international travel, including a visit to Ukraine, and undertaking a range of domestic actions, including returning the Nadesalingam family to Biloela, signing off on the government\u2019s minimum wage submission, dropping the prosecution against Witness K\u2019s lawyer, Bernard Collaery, for allegedly revealing spying on Timor-Leste, providing flood relief and releasing a new ministerial code of conduct. But Australians continued to do it tough, whacked by rising consumer prices, including petrol prices going over $2 a litre. The Reserve Bank last week also triggered a third interest rate hike in as many months, hitting households already struggling with the rising cost of living. Recent floods were also likely to exacerbate shortages that have increased the price of fruit and vegetables. A cold and wet winter has also seen a spike in cases of the flu and Covid. Voters were asked a series of questions in the latest survey about the ongoing management of the pandemic and about their own experiences with Covid. In early July, Australia recorded a grim milestone of 10,000 deaths from Covid since the virus emerged two and a half years ago. When respondents were asked how many deaths each year from the virus would be considered acceptable to live with, 17% of the sample said between 1,000 and 5,000 deaths a year, and only 6% said between 5,000 and 10,000 a year \u2013 the current rate. While the latest results suggested Australians remained uncomfortable with current high death rates, the Guardian Essential data suggested attitudes have shifted over time. Back in August 2021, 61% of respondents thought Australia\u2019s acceptable deaths should be less than 100 a year (only 42% of respondents say that now). A year ago, 25% of respondents thought an acceptable death rate was between 100 and 1,000 deaths (31% said that now). The new poll suggested community sensibilities about the pandemic were split. More than half the sample (55%) thought we needed to treat Covid like the flu and just get on with normal life, and just under half of respondents (47%) said they thought most people with infections recovered quickly. But there was also concern about hospitals and support for mask wearing in certain settings to lower rates of viral transmission. A majority (65%) was concerned hospitals were dealing with too many Covid patients and consequently lacked capacity for other illnesses or emergencies. And 60% of respondents believed mask wearing should return to stop the winter spread. More than half of respondents (53%) also agreed with the decision last week to extend a fourth booster shot to Australians. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation last week strongly recommended a fourth dose of Covid vaccine for people over 50 and also called for greater use of face masks, warning that more vaccine doses could only play a \u201climited\u201d role in reducing hospital admissions and case numbers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning People were also asked to share their experiences with Covid-19. Official statistics showed more than 8 million Australians have had the virus, but 68% of Guardian Essential respondents said they had not had it or did not believe they had had it. Lived experience (comprising 32% of respondents) was mixed, with 4% reporting they were currently infected and the symptoms felt like a bad cold, another 4% saying they were infected and the symptoms were significantly worse than a cold, 17% reporting having had the virus in the past with symptoms similar to a bad cold, while another 7% saying their lived experience with the virus was significantly worse than a cold. The cohort of respondents who had not yet contracted the virus were more likely to support the rollout of a fourth booster shot and the reintroduction of mask wearing. But while supporting measures to curb the spread, they were more likely to agree that Covid needed to be treated like the flu than respondents who were currently sick with the virus."

            "date": "2022-07-28T12:45:14Z",
            "content": "Majorities of American voters do not want Joe Biden or Donald Trump to run in the next presidential election in 2024, according to a new poll. More than 60% of voters and 30% of Democrats in the NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ poll said Biden should not run again. Among all voters, 57% said Trump should not run again. Among Republicans, that total was 26%. But most of those polled do not know who they would like to run instead, either. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, were the leading named contenders. Biden, 79 and the oldest president ever inaugurated, has said he intends to run for a second term. \u201cI\u2019m a great respecter of fate,\u201d he said in December. \u201cFate has intervened in my life many, many times. If I\u2019m in the health I\u2019m in now, if I\u2019m in good health, then in fact I would run again.\u201d His first term has been beset by crises, from the withdrawal from Afghanistan to the Russian war in Ukraine, and from the coronavirus pandemic to strong economic headwinds at home. The Republican assault on US elections and voting rights, led by Trump, has also played out during Biden\u2019s time in the White House. Trump has suggested he will soon announce a third presidential run, possibly as a way of avoiding potential criminal charges over his election subversion efforts and the deadly Capitol attack. Respondents in the poll were asked who they would prefer as the Democratic candidate if Biden did not run. \u201cSomeone else\u201d attracted 44.2% support but among named alternatives the vice-president, Kamala Harris, led with 16.1%. Next came Bernie Sanders, the 80-year-old socialist senator from Vermont who ran for the nomination in 2016 and 2020, with 10.7%; Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, with 8.9%; and Pete Buttigieg, the secretary of transportation, who also ran in 2020, with 7.8%. The New York progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and the governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, were also mentioned by smaller numbers of voters. On the Republican side of the ledger, \u201cSomeone else\u201d also led, with 38.1% of the vote. DeSantis, the governor of Florida, attracted 23.4% support and Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s vice-president, received 20.5%. Also attracting support were the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley; the Texas senator Ted Cruz; the Texas governor, Greg Abbott; the governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem; and the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton."

Maher al-Agal, identified by the Pentagon as one of the top five Islamic State leaders and the leader of the Islamic State in Syria, was killed in a drone strike in Jindayris in north-west Syria. \u201cHis death in Syria takes a key terrorist off the field and significantly degrades the ability of [the Islamic State] to plan, resource, and conduct their operations in the region,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt sends a powerful message to all terrorists who threaten our homeland and our interests around the world. The United States will be relentless in its efforts to bring you to justice.\u201d US Central Command said in a news release that an unidentified senior official in the Islamic State was also seriously injured in the strike that killed Agal. The Pentagon said an \u201cinitial review\u201d indicated there were no civilian casualties, though it wasn\u2019t possible to immediately confirm that information. Agal was \u201cresponsible for aggressively pursuing the development of Isis networks outside \u2026 Iraq and Syria\u201d, according to US Central Command. The Islamic State at the height of its power controlled more than 40,000 sq miles stretching from Syria to Iraq and ruled over 8 million people. While the group\u2019s territorial state collapsed in 2019, its leaders have turned to guerrilla tactics and been able to \u201cefficiently restructure themselves organizationally\u201d, according to the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a nonpartisan thinktank. The strike on Agal comes months after the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, killed himself during a raid of his hideout by American special forces. The Pentagon said Qurayshi blew himself up along with members of his family."

            "content": "China\u2019s targeting of Australian military planes was \u201caggressive and irresponsible\u201d, the United States Department of Defense says, and it \u201crepresents one of the most significant threats to peace and stability in the region\u201d. In comments released on Thursday morning, the US defense department\u2019s Ely Ratner said Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific was an attempt to challenge the rules-based order and assert greater control in the area. Ratner, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said incidents, including those aimed at Australian aircraft earlier this year, were \u201cnot isolated\u201d. \u201cOver the last five years, the number of unsafe PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] intercepts \u2026 has increased dramatically, with dozens of dangerous events in the first half of this year alone,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my view, this aggressive and irresponsible behaviour represents one of the most significant threats to peace and stability in the region today, including in the South China Sea.\u201d In May, a Chinese fighter jet forced a RAAF P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft into a \u201cdangerous manoeuvre\u201d. The Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, said the Chinese aircraft flew close to the Australian one, released flares, cut across its nose and settled in front of it. \u201cAt that moment, it then released a bundle of chaff, which contains small pieces of aluminium, some of which were ingested into the engine of the P-8 aircraft,\u201d Marles said. \u201cQuite obviously, this is very dangerous.\u201d In February, a People\u2019s Liberation Army navy warship shone a military-grade laser at an Australian surveillance aircraft. The Australian defence force said at the time there had been an increase in the use of lasers, but that specific incident was \u201cmore serious\u201d. Ratner said on Thursday if the Chinese military continued it could cause a \u201cmajor incident or accident\u201d and that the US had to \u201cdemonstrate the will and capability to properly deter [People\u2019s Republic of China] aggression\u201d. That includes building a \u201ccombat-credible forward presence\u201d in the region, and bolstering allies\u2019 capabilities, he said, particularly in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. While the US will \u201calways stand ready to prevail in conflict\u201d, its priority was deterrence, he said. \u201cWe do not seek confrontation or conflict,\u201d he said. Ratner\u2019s comments echo those from Gen Mark Milley, chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. In Sydney on Thursday, he said China\u2019s behaviour in the Pacific was \u201cmuch more confrontational\u201d now and \u201cseems to imply that they want to bully or dominate\u201d. Earlier this week, Milley said China had become \u201csignificantly more, and noticeably more, aggressive\u201d. He added to those comments in Sydney at a conference to discuss the rise of China and the stability of the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a big conference to discuss our mutual security interests and discuss national security issues that apply to all of us,\u201d Milley said, according to Associated Press. Under the new Labor government, there are hopes that relations between China and Australia are thawing. However, Beijing is very critical of the Aukus deal, and the plan for Australia, the UK and the US to share nuclear-powered submarine technology. When China recently advised Australia on how to improve relations, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Australia \u201cdoesn\u2019t respond to demands\u201d."

            "date": "2022-07-08T11:28:17Z",
            "content": "Europe is in danger of highly damaging \u201cvery, very strong conflict and strife\u201d this winter over high energy prices, and should make a short-term return to fossil fuels to head off the threat of civil unrest, the vice-president of the European Commission has warned. Frans Timmermans, the second most senior official in the EU, said the threat of unrest this winter, a deliberate outcome of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, must take precedence over the climate crisis. He said: \u201cIf our society descends into very, very strong conflict and strife because there is no energy, we\u2019re certainly not going to make our [climate] goals. We\u2019re certainly not going to get where we need to get if the lack of energy leads to strong disruption in our societies, and we need to make sure people are not in the cold in the coming winter. \u201cWe need to make sure we keep our industry, as much as possible, functioning because the one thing that could help Putin is divisions in our society.\u201d People suffering from the cold this winter because they cannot afford heating would also be disastrous for solving the climate crisis, Timmermans argued in an interview with the Guardian in Brussels. \u201cI\u2019ve been in politics long enough, over 30 years, to understand that people worry most about the immediate crisis and not about the long-term crisis And if we don\u2019t address the immediate crisis, we will certainly be off-track with the long-term crisis,\u201d he said. Timmermans said his goal was to reassure the public of the EU, by 1 November at the latest, that they would not face a crisis in heating their homes this winter. \u201cI honestly believe that if we can\u2019t give that guarantee then society is on edge, as it is everywhere because of high energy prices, inflation, food prices rising rapidly \u2013 because of this uncertainty caused by the war,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin is using all the means he has to create strife in our societies, so we have to brace ourselves for a very difficult period.\u201d Coal would have to be used, he said. \u201cIf we were just to say no more coal right now, we wouldn\u2019t be very convincing in some of our member states and we would contribute to tensions within our society getting even higher.\u201d Energy prices have soared across the world as a result of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, but Europe has been particularly badly hit. Before Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Germany \u2013 the EU\u2019s biggest economy \u2013 relied on Russia for the majority of its gas. Overall, Europe depends on Russia for about 40% of its gas. The German government has started to increase electricity production from coal-fired power stations, the dirtiest form of energy, while allowing the phaseout of nuclear power to continue as planned. Olaf Scholz, Germany\u2019s chancellor, also insisted that the G7 reverse its stance on banning overseas investment in gas projects to assist in the exploration of new fossil fuel fields in developing countries. The European parliament also voted this week to class some gas and nuclear power projects as \u201cclean\u201d energy for investment purposes, to the dismay of climate campaigners who worry the climate agenda has been lost amid fears over energy prices. Timmermans, who is in charge of the EU\u2019s green deal and leads the bloc in international climate negotiations, insisted that a short-term return to fossil fuels was compatible with limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the goal affirmed at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow last November. He also gave qualified support for the expansion of fossil fuel exploration in parts of Africa that civil society leaders have already warned would lock Africa into a high-emissions future without benefiting ordinary people. \u201cIn this global situation right now, with the huge shortage of fossil fuel, how can you say to anyone who has fossil fuels: \u2018You should not be exploiting that.\u2019\u201d he asked. \u201cHow can we not face the immediate challenge of having to find alternatives for Russian gas, and saying to others: \u2018You should not be exploiting gas.\u2019 That would be hypocritical. I can\u2019t say that.\u201d But Timmermans dampened expectations for Cop27, the next global climate summit taking place this November in Sharm el-Sheikh. At Cop26, countries failed to produce national plans on cutting emissions in line with the 1.5C limit they affirmed, and so agreed to return to the negotiating table this year with tougher plans called nationally determined contributions (NDCs). These were unlikely to be forthcoming as promised, however, given the energy and food crises and the war in Ukraine, Timmermans said. \u201cI don\u2019t see that many new NDCs on the horizon, frankly,\u201d he said, pointing to Australia, with its new government, as a rare exception. \u201cI don\u2019t have the highest expectations for this by Sharm el-Sheikh because the conference in Bonn that was just finished clearly showed that there\u2019s not much appetite in increasing NDCs, and there is a lot of frustration in the developing world about the money that was promised and is not yet fully on the table.\u201d Timmermans blamed Putin for this failure. \u201cEverything hinges on the energy transition and energy is at the heart of this. \u201cIf one of the major energy producers in the world is causing this disruption, as Russia is doing right now, obviously the rest of the world will be edgy in terms of what happens in the energy markets, and obviously that has an implication of can we make further commitments on reducing our emissions given the situation?\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-06T17:32:52Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s military has announced plans to introduce a system of permits that would prohibit men eligible for conscription from leaving the region where they are registered. The move, based on legislation from 1992, was intended to enable the country\u2019s armed forces to locate potential conscripts more easily, but it prompted an immediate backlash. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised the announcement in his nightly TV address to the nation on Tuesday, saying that the general staff should not make decisions without him. Two parliamentarians immediately filed draft legislation that would scrap the army\u2019s initiative, which they described as \u201coutdated\u201d. It remains unclear if movement permits for men will be introduced, but the army\u2019s announcement highlights the precarious position facing Ukrainian men who could be conscripted to fight at any moment. Since Zelenskiy declared martial law at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are eligible for military service and are forbidden from leaving the country. There are a few exceptions such as men with poor health, or fathers of three or more children. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight. I want to continue working,\u201d said Roman, a 31-year-old software developer in Kyiv. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t want to think negatively about it because many of my friends have been mobilised and it\u2019s not fair on them. I try not to think that if I\u2019m mobilised it 100% means I will die or be injured or see fighting.\u201d When martial law was first announced, Ukraine\u2019s authorities said conscription would occur in waves, starting with those who have previous military experience, and would reflect the army\u2019s needs, focusing on medics or people with a science background, for example. Women can also be mobilised if their professional experience is needed but they cannot be compelled and are not expected to fight. Thousands of Ukrainians have volunteered to fight or be reservists. By 6 March, about 100,000 had enlisted in the territorial defence force alone. But there are also those who worry about being sent into the frontlines, where a horrific artillery battle is raging, and between 100 and 200 Ukrainian soldiers are reportedly dying every day. For some men, the prospect of conscription \u2013 and the uncertainty of not knowing when the call might come \u2013 looms oppressively. \u201cThe worst thing about it is I don\u2019t know how [mobilisation] is happening at the moment,\u201d said Roman. \u201cWill the conscription notice come to my house or will someone just stop me in the street? Should I continue renting my apartment? Should I buy [military equipment] or not?\u201d Last month, a group of men were detained by police at Otel, a well-known Kyiv nightclub, for allegedly breaking curfew and subsequently given conscription notices by the local military administrative office. Maks Yudin, Otel\u2019s installation artist and technician, and Pavlo Derhachov, the owner of Otel, were among them. Yudin described how they had held a daytime event \u2013 allowed within the curfew rules \u2013 and were taking down the set. He said he went to open the backdoor at 11pm to find a mass of police officers waiting outside. \u201cThere were like five police officers for each person,\u201d said Yudin, who is originally from Russia but moved to Ukraine in 2019. \u201cThe police have demonised this club for a long time even though we have been a base for volunteer work since the beginning of the war.\u201d Yudin himself volunteered as an army medic at the beginning of the war but, despite having a degree in medicine and previous military experience, he was rejected because of his Russian citizenship. Otel still serves as a makeshift staging area for aid distribution. Behind the bar are shelves of goods stacked with goods for different cities near the frontlines as well as some equipment for a battalion they support. On the other side of the dancefloor, there is a crate of molotov cocktails. Police said 219 people found at the club were given conscription notices, but Yudin and Derhachov say only about 10 to 15 people there. \u201cThe kind of conscription notice they gave us is a bit like spam mail,\u201d said Derhachov. \u201cThey are designed to encourage people to sign up to fight but there is no system to follow up. Luckily there are many of those people who will react and want to fight and that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d A second type of conscription notice is delivered to an individual\u2019s house and states why the army needs him. \u201cSince the war started, I have experienced a sort of survivor\u2019s guilt syndrome because people are dying and I can\u2019t feel good,\u201d said Derhachov. \u201cI\u2019m actually glad that they closed the borders [for men] because it forces you to confront what\u2019s happening even if it\u2019s in a passive form. In one way or another, you have to participate.\u201d Derhachov said they still host occasional daytime events but not the \u201chedonistic, techno raves\u201d that Kyiv was known for before the war. \u201cEvery event has collected money for the war \u2013 the army, a specific battalion or humanitarian aid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not at the stage of total mobilisation like in WWII,\u201d Oleksandr Shulga, a former sociology academic at Ukraine\u2019s academy of sciences, who signed up to fight on the first day of the war, explained. \u201cThere are plenty of people that are willing and are preparing for being mobilised. What I worry about is that after the war there will be a divide in society between those who did and didn\u2019t fight.\u201d"

            "content": "I often liken the opening of my moth trap to Christmas morning in childhood: you have no idea what you are about to be gifted. Today, it\u2019s 17 elephant and small elephant hawkmoths, which is more than I\u2019ve ever seen before. The first is an improbable blend of the cocktail lounge and military dowdiness, with shimmering lines of pink over matt olive. If anything, the small elephant hawkmoth is more striking, with the soldier\u2019s khaki replaced by a colour somewhere between aconite yellow and burnt grass. In certain lights, as I arrange them on a sheet beneath the shade of our oak, they look like lipstick on gold. However, there is a curious reflection at work as I proceed, because I always feel \u2013 for some reason \u2013 an urge to see the adults of any insect species rather than other stage of its life. It\u2019s nagging me because I recently found the larva of a moth called the giant peacock, the largest moth in Europe, which bears exquisite pink-rimmed eyes upon its four enormous wings. Alas, I only saw the caterpillar. I say \u201calas\u201d, but it was no insignificant beast itself: a florescent lime \u201cfinger\u201d studded with yellow warts from which spired thick black bristles. Yet the desire for the adult was undiminished, and I know it\u2019s odd because many insects spend more of their lives as larvae than they do adults. The golden-ringed dragonfly can live several months in its final winged avatar but three years as a voracious pond-dwelling nymph. Stag beetles live as enormous whitish larvae for up to seven years, and some American cicadas spend 17 years underground before emerging for a brief summer of blade-grinding song and breeding. In fact, some adult moths have no mouthparts and only days in which to pass on their genes before they inevitably starve. What is perhaps most remarkable, however, about my elephant hawkmoths, is not one stage or another, but that they start as a pimple-sized eggs on our willowherb, grow by devouring the leaves into silver-eyed worms the size of my pinky and, finally, metamorphose into pink-and-khaki angels to adorn this summer\u2019s morning. \u2022 Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

            "date": "2022-07-01T21:00:53Z",
            "content": "TikTok is seeking to assuage fears over the security of American users\u2019 data on the Chinese-owned platform, after Republican senators and a regulator argued the app poses a national security risk. The concerns by lawmakers came after BuzzFeed reported last month that China-based employees of TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance were repeatedly able to access non-public data of American users. Nine Republican senators issued a letter to TikTok in response to the BuzzFeed report. And on Wednesday, a Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) urged the chief executives of Apple and Google to kick TikTok out of its app stores. Responding to the senators\u2019 concerns, TikTok told the lawmakers in a letter sent on Thursday that it is working on a final agreement with the Biden administration that would \u201cfully safeguard user data and US national security interests\u201d, according to copy of the letter seen by Reuters. Shou Zi Chew, TikTok\u2019s chief executive, wrote in the letter the company was working with US cloud computing company Oracle on \u201cnew advanced data security controls that we hope to finalize in the near future\u201d. TikTok\u2019s letter acknowledged that China-based employees \u201ccan have access to TikTok US user data\u201d but argued that access is subject to \u201crobust cybersecurity controls and authorization approval protocols overseen by our US-based security team\u201d. TikTok had announced last month it had completed migrating information on its US users to servers at Oracle but it was still using US and Singapore data centers for backup. The company said in the letter it expects \u201cto delete US users protected data from our own systems and fully pivot to Oracle cloud servers located in the US\u201d. Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, one of the lawmakers who had spoken out, said TikTok \u201cshould have come clean from the start but instead tried to shroud their work in secrecy\u201d and urged the company to testify before congress. Brendan Carr, the FCC commissioner, had argued in his letter to the Google and Apple CEOs that \u201cTikTok is not just another video app\u201d. \u201cIt harvests swaths of sensitive data that new reports show are being accessed in Beijing,\u201d he wrote. Carr\u2019s request to the tech giants was unusual given that the FCC does not have clear jurisdiction over the content of app stores. The FCC regulates the national security space usually through its authority to grant certain communications licenses to companies. TikTok is one of the world\u2019s most popular social media apps, with more than 1 billion active users globally, and counts the US as its largest market. Thursday\u2019s letter came nearly two years after a US national security panel ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok because of fears that US user data could be passed on to China\u2019s government. That order was not enforced after Joe Biden succeeded Donald Trump. The panel, however, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), is still conducting a national security review of the company, according to the letter. \u201cWe know we are among the most scrutinized platforms from a security standpoint and we aim to remove any doubt about the security of US user data,\u201d the letter said. TikTok has said in the past that employees in China have data access to US user data. In a 2020 blogpost Roland Cloutier, TikTok\u2019s chief information security officer, said: \u201cOur goal is to minimize data access across regions so that, for example, employees in the APAC region, including China, would have very minimal access to user data from the EU and US.\u201d"

            "content": "If you missed our Guardian Essential poll at the start of this week, there were two key insights. The first is Australians are in a complicated headspace about Covid. The second is Anthony Albanese\u2019s post-election honeymoon has moderated. By complicated, I mean contradictory. More than half the voters surveyed want to treat Covid like the flu and just get on with normal life. But we don\u2019t like high death rates. We also worry about pressure on hospitals. When it comes to the shelf life of honeymoons, the jury is still out. In the first poll taken after the election, voters came off the fence about Albanese, giving the prime minister an extraordinary boost in his approval rating. In the latest poll, there was a three-point dip in voter approval of the prime minister and a six-point increase in disapproval. Ebullience (or perhaps it was relief) had receded. Some necessary context: Albanese\u2019s approval remains in positive territory (56%). These two insights \u2013 Covid and its complications was back as a front of mind issue for voters, and the prospect that Labor\u2019s two-month post-election honeymoon might have maxed out \u2013 framed the political week. Most of the cabinet was overseas. Albanese and Penny Wong were in Suva, Jim Chalmers in Bali, Richard Marles and Tony Burke in the United States, Murray Watt in Indonesia. Back home Mark Butler, the health minister, found himself alone on centre stage, the designated public face of Labor\u2019s efforts to defend a cut in pandemic assistance. Ending pandemic leave was the big issue but before we unpack that, some scene setting. On 25 March, the Friday before the budget that was the springboard for the May election, the then health minister, Greg Hunt, signalled he would not be renewing the emergency declaration that underpinned Australia\u2019s extraordinary public health response to the pandemic. Hunt said because we were \u201cliving with Covid\u201d the declaration would lapse on 17 April, a week into an election campaign that Scott Morrison would lose. This was a significant leap in the direction of Covid-normal, but because of the timing, the tearing rush towards the polls, it didn\u2019t get a lot of attention. By the time Labor was sworn in, the demise of the emergency declaration meant the dismantling of some public health controls was effectively baked in. When Butler arrived as health minister, the chief medical officer pointed out some of the restrictions imposed at the height of the emergency could be unlawful in the absence of the biosecurity declaration. The CMO advised the new minister to remove vaccination requirements for incoming passengers. Because some of the state emergency declarations are lifting too, some of the arrangements in relation to aged care facilities will automatically lift, and the commonwealth will have to step up given infection rates in aged care continue to climb. Also baked in: an end to pandemic leave payments on 30 June, which is the issue which has exploded this week. Pandemic leave has blown up in the context of a significant winter outbreak, with 4,000 people currently in hospital and hundreds of people dying each week, including about 100 deaths a week in aged care facilities. On Wednesday, Butler warned that millions of Australians could be infected with Covid over the coming weeks \u2013 obviously a mind-focusing observation. At the same time as issuing this warning, Butler was the public face of ending the provision of free rapid tests for concession card holders, and winding up pandemic leave. For a government that had just won an election telling voters no one would be held back and no one left behind, this felt like cognitive dissonance to put it mildly. While we are canvassing pandemic leave, please indulge one small rave. Australian employers were given billions in taxpayer support during the pandemic \u2013 support to endure lockdowns. Given that happened, it\u2019s a pity these characters can\u2019t put their hands in their pockets and pay their casuals sick leave during a pandemic. It seems only decent. But some employers have no interest in being decent, and some lack the requisite resources, and workers with no sick leave will work if it\u2019s a choice between eating and isolating while Covid-positive. So we fall back on the basic public policy rationale. If governments need infected workers to isolate to curb exponential spread of a highly contagious and potentially lethal virus, then governments have a responsibility to fund the public health response. If we accept that\u2019s the rationale for the payment (and it has been to date), conceptually there are only two options. End the mandatory isolation period, which removes the necessity for taxpayer funded pandemic leave, or keep the rule and keep funding the leave. We are now in a period of transition, and there are important debates to be had about what level of government intervention should happen in the transit zone between pandemic and endemic. If the community becomes fatigued by endless rules, then public health strategies and the supports underpinning them become counterproductive. I\u2019m certain this conceptual thinking is going on behind the scenes, but thus far, Butler and his colleagues haven\u2019t staged that public seminar about options, they just signalled they\u2019ll end the payment at the time Morrison scheduled. The stated rationale for ending the payment has been money doesn\u2019t grow on trees. The prime driver of this decision has been budget pressure. I also think there\u2019s an unofficial mantra inside the Albanese government \u2013 if we need to do something hard (and removing benefits from needy people is certainty the working definition of hard), do it quickly. Preferably during the first six months of the government. But when we think about budget pressure, a clear irony emerges. The new government is trying to stabilise the budget not as an abstract talisman but to create room for its own priorities, which include delivering the social supports and services that voters expect Labor governments to deliver. Stabilising the budget will require a substantial mindset shift in Australia. During the pandemic, the community has grown very accustomed to high levels of public expenditure. The answer to most questions since about March 2022 has been spend to save lives and livelihoods. If Albanese and his colleagues can\u2019t reboot those expectations, funding exigencies will crowd out their agenda, leaving voters asking what was the point of changing the government. That\u2019s the risk. But ending pandemic leave, a lifeline for workers, when the pandemic persists, is not only risky in a public health sense, it also looks and sounds like a departure from core Labor values. Understanding that precise point of political vulnerability, the horizon filled with bandwagons. The Labor backbench \u2013 nervous because of a constituent backlash. The opposition roused itself from a post-election coma and argued against its own sunsetting of pandemic leave. The Greens declared Labor would be able to afford all the things forever if it dumped Morrison\u2019s fiscally reckless stage-three tax cuts, and the independents said public health imperatives must trump other considerations. The premiers, who have come in peace during the opening two months of the new regime, over the course of Friday very obviously executed a pincer movement ahead of an emergency national cabinet meeting on Monday. By Friday night, the emergency Monday meeting had been yanked forward to Saturday, and Albanese was set to propose a temporary extension for workers who needed the support. While there is a clear case to extend pandemic leave as a policy lever to suppress rampant infections during the winter, the problem the government faces is that the politics of pivoting away from emergency support won\u2019t get any easier. By extending the payment through the winter, Albanese fixes one problem, and creates a new cliff. He will likely be winding back pandemic support at the same time as having to deal with the worst of Morrison\u2019s poison pills \u2013 ending the temporary cut in fuel excise. While Butler was busy battling Covid contradictions this week, Chris Bowen was attempting to subdue a range of feelings about his draft legislation giving effect to Labor\u2019s 43% emissions reduction target \u2013 demonstrating that ending the climate wars is easier said than done. Albanese has had a successful couple of months rebooting critical relationships on the world stage \u2013 carrying out important and necessary work in the national interest, and winning plaudits for extracting Australia from the naughty corner on climate action. But things are always harder at home."

            "date": "2022-07-12T14:08:39Z",
            "content": "Chelsea are in talks over a deal to sign the Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly as Thomas Tuchel pushes to fix his side\u2019s defensive crisis before the start of the Premier League season. The departures of Andreas Christensen and Antonio R\u00fcdiger have left a huge hole in Tuchel\u2019s defence and Chelsea\u2019s head coach would like to sign at least two centre-backs. Personal terms have been agreed with Nathan Ak\u00e9, who will cost at least \u00a340m, and the spending will not stop if the Manchester City centre-back completes a return to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea, who could secure the signing of Ak\u00e9 this week, have several defensive targets. They remain interested in Sevilla\u2019s Jules Kound\u00e9 and, with Bayern Munich leading the race for Juventus\u2019s Matthijs de Ligt, Koulibaly is emerging as a viable option for Tuchel. Sources have suggested an agreement over a \u00a334m deal for the Senegal international is not far away. Koulibaly has impressed since joining Napoli in 2014 and is regarded as one of the best defenders in Serie A. The 31-year-old remains in good shape and is seen by Tuchel as a player who could slot into his defence straight away. Napoli have offered Koulibaly an extension to his contract, which expires next year, but are aware that Chelsea can offer him more money. Other names under consideration at Chelsea are Torino\u2019s Gleison Bremer and Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Presnel Kimpembe. Bremer has been heavily scouted by Chelsea but they are yet to firm up their interest in the Brazilian. Internazionale are favourites to sign the 25-year-old and a bid from Juve has not been ruled out. If Chelsea bring in two defenders that should pave the way for C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta to join Barcelona. Tuchel does not want to lose the club captain without a replacement being lined up. Bar\u00e7a, who also want Marcos Alonso, will need to pay a small fee for Azpilicueta after Chelsea triggered a one-year extension in the Spaniard\u2019s contract. Chelsea are close to confirming the signing of the England forward Raheem Sterling from Manchester City for a fee worth up to \u00a350m. Sterling was due to fly on Tuesday to Los Angeles to join Chelsea\u2019s pre-season preparations. \u00c9douard Mendy has admitted he will need time to build a relationship with any new defenders. Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper, asked how easy it is to build a relationship with a defender, said: \u201cWe just need time. It is like this every year when you change club and new players come. We just need time to learn off each other and we are starting the new season. We have players here so we work with the players who are present with us today and let\u2019s see what will happen. So yes, we were happy with Toni, with Christiansen but I think we are more than happy with the defenders who will arrive for us.\u201d The Senegal international is among 10 nominees for next week\u2019s men\u2019s African player of the year award after helping his country to their first continental title. Mendy paid tribute to Petr Cech after the former goalkeeper, who was instrumental in bringing the 30-year-old to Stamford Bridge, left his post as technical and performance adviser last month, along with Chelsea\u2019s former head of goalkeeping Christophe Lollichon. \u201cWithout Pete and Christoph, I don\u2019t think I would be at Chelsea so I will always be grateful to them and the best way to make them proud is to be the best I possibly can on the pitch, just doing my job,\u201d he said."

            "title": "Wagatha Christie: big-budget drama joins race to bring libel trial to screen",
            "date": "2022-07-31T07:22:31Z",
            "content": "A big-budget drama featuring major characters in the Wagatha Christie case is to join the slew of documentaries already in production, as the race to bring to the small screen the rancorous details of the high court battle that ended on Friday hots up. The row between two high-profile footballers\u2019 wives, which ended last week when the judge ruled in favour of Coleen Rooney, is to be turned into television serial by one of Britain\u2019s leading screenwriters. Debbie Horsfield, who adapted Poldark for the 2015-19 BBC series, is to write a drama chronicling the notorious public row between Rebekah Vardy, wife of leading Leicester goal scorer Jamie Vardy, and Coleen Rooney, wife of Wayne, the renowned former England player and, until last month, manager of Derby County. The libel claim famously centred on a trap set for Vardy by her former friend Rooney, who suspected that stories about her personal life and family were being sold to the tabloid press. Restricted access to a private Instagram account that was followed by Vardy appeared to lead directly to items carried by the Sun newspaper. Vardy, 40, claimed she was wrongly publicly identified as the culprit and sued Rooney for libel. High court judge Mrs Justice Karen Steyn ruled on Friday that Rooney\u2019s accusation had been \u201csubstantially true\u201d. Now the makers of A Very English Scandal, a drama about the Jeremy Thorpe case starring Hugh Grant and Ben Whishaw, and the more recent A Very British Scandal, starring Paul Bettany and Claire Foy as the Duke and Duchess of Argyll, have confirmed to the Observer that they are about to take on this high profile modern-day scandal. Like the previous salacious disputes the production company, Blueprint Pictures, has fictionalised, the Vardy v Rooney scrap became a cause celebre, providing a distraction for many during a turbulent summer and creating a moral debate about the rights and wrongs of an exposing libel action. Horsfield, who wrote BBC1\u2019s 2018 the hair salon saga Age Before Beauty, is working on the new TV drama for Blueprint Pictures alongside her former Poldark producer, Karen Thrussell. Likely key plot points will be the hatching of Rooney\u2019s \u201cScousetrap\u201d scheme to lure Vardy into revealing herself via Instagram, and the loss at sea of a potentially incriminating mobile phone owned by Vardy\u2019s agent, Caroline Watt, during a voyage around the coast of Scotland. Watt did not give evidence at the high court as she was judged by a forensic psychologist to be in an unfit state of mind. Rooney, 36, is reportedly making a documentary chronicling her own attempts to turn detective. She is said to have been working with Lorton Entertainment, which also made the football documentary Rooney, on a show about the legal dispute, destined for an unknown broadcast platform. Netflix is thought to be planning to screen a fly-on-the-wall documentary by Dorothy St Pictures, the filmmakers behind a recent Pamela Anderson documentary, which had cameras on Rooney during her court case this spring. In addition, Channel 4 is working on a reconstruction of the significant courtroom scenes, filmed by production company Chalkboard, using the real court transcripts. Actors will play the parts of the key adversaries and their husbands. Tom Popay, creative director at Chalkboard, has been quoted justifying the project: \u201cThe #WagathaChristie phenomenon has become one of the most talked-about moments in the history of social media. The court case that followed has captivated the entire nation but very few people actually got to see what happened inside the courtroom.\u201d The BBC is also set to broadcast a documentary, made by Curious Films, telling both sides of Rooney\u2019s attempts at Instagram sleuthing. Reportedly on the point of beginning filming, it is an investigation into the social media warfare conducted by supporters of each faction, and will include testimony from \u201cthe Vardy camp\u201d \u2013 possibly including Vardy herself. And yet another production company, Optomen Television, is working on a documentary about the explosive case, although neither of the women is thought to be involved with the research for this programme. As well as offering human conflict and high emotion, the Wagatha narrative offers a snapshot of British celebrity culture. Several moments in the court case highlighted the generational and educational chasms in wider British society. Rebekah Vardy did not know the phrase \u201cDavy Jones\u2019s locker\u201d, while her barrister appeared to be unsure about how Instagram works. Blueprint Pictures, behind the Horsfield script, is run by television executives Peter Czernin and Graham Broadbent, who met at university in Bristol. Together they have made the acclaimed and popular films In Bruges, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, alongside their television hits, earning them both Oscars and Baftas. They set up Blueprint Pictures in 2005 and are shortly to bring out The Beautiful Game, written by Frank Cottrell Boyce and directed by Thea Sharrock, as well as The Banshees of Inisherin, the latest film from Irish playwright Martin McDonagh."

            "title": "Food experts\u2019 tips on how to make the best of your budget",
            "date": "2022-07-09T11:00:05Z",
            "content": "With food prices rising at the fastest rate in more than a decade, Britons are trying to make their budget go further in the kitchen by buying cheaper frozen and tinned products and supermarket own-label. Simon Roberts, the Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, said this week that customers were watching every penny. They are also making more trips but buying less on each visit, and monitoring the price of their shopping to avoid \u201ctill shock\u201d when paying at the end. With the average annual grocery bill on course to rise by almost \u00a3400 this year, there is no magic recipe for price rises of this magnitude but there are ways to reduce costs at home. Here, professional chefs, and the people who train them, offer tips on how to cook on a budget \u2013 without cutting the quality of your food. Set a budget, plan your menu The Conservative MP Lee Anderson caused a furore when he suggested that nutritious meals could be easily cooked for 30p a time. Felicity Cloake, the Guardian food writer and the author of Red Sauce Brown Sauce, says it is technically possible to make a meal for as little as that \u2013 but only if you have the \u201cluxury of time, the cashflow to buy ingredients in bulk to get the best deal, the knowhow and equipment to do so, and those you\u2019re cooking for are so desperate that they\u2019ll eat anything\u201d. Keeping costs to within a more realistic set limit is possible, though, if you plan ahead carefully. Miguel Barclay, the author of the One Pound Meals range of recipe books, says: \u201cSit down and plan meals for the whole week. Think of those meals as being connected rather than separate, so you can use the same ingredients in more than one dish, and make a comprehensive shopping list.\u201d Then, resist any urge to impulse buy. If it\u2019s not on the list, it doesn\u2019t go in the trolley. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for improvising with this method,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t think: \u2018Oh look, that pork\u2019s on offer, I\u2019ll buy some,\u2019 because if you do that, you won\u2019t be able to stay within your budget.\u201d Don\u2019t waste anything Once you know what you\u2019ll be eating, buy ingredients in the most \u201cwhole\u201d form you can, otherwise you will be paying for the processing, even if that\u2019s just trimming off leaves or cutting into pieces. Use your meal plan to ensure nothing gets wasted. Stella West-Harling, the founder of the Independent Cookery Schools Association and the head of Feeding Devon, part of the Feeding Britain charity network, says roast chicken can make multiple meals: \u201cBoil the chicken for about 30 minutes in a large pan before you roast it,\u201d she says. \u201cAdd carrots, celery, and any other vegetables that need using up, to the water. When you drain it, you\u2019ve got chicken stock.\u201d Use the stock for soup or gravy, or freeze it for future use. Use leftovers from the roast for a pie, risotto, stir-fry or curry. Once you get down to the bones, boil it up again for more stock, combing off the last shreds of chicken. The same top-to-bottom approach should be taken with vegetables, says Holly Taylor, one of the head chefs at the Brighton restaurant, Kindling. \u201cUsing them all up means you get more value for money from the thing that you\u2019ve paid for.\u201d Broccoli stalks, Taylor says, needn\u2019t be discarded when they are delicious pickled and used as a garnish or in salads. Similarly, Taylor says, make mashed potato by baking the potatoes whole in the oven, cutting them in half and scooping out the fluffy mash, then keep the skins to make loaded potato skins for the next day. Have an Italian week When you pluck a recipe from a cookbook you may end up going out and buying everything on the ingredients list. \u201cYou might not use those ingredients again, so they\u2019ll just sit in your cupboard,\u201d says Lewis Walker, the deputy head of the Birmingham College of Food. \u201cIt\u2019s not cost effective.\u201d Planning meals around the same groups of flavours, herbs and spices means you are more likely to use up ingredients. \u201cYou might say: \u2018Right, we\u2019re going to go through an Italian phase for a little while, so I\u2019m going to use all my Italian ingredients over the next few weeks,\u2019\u201d Walker says. \u201cBy not diversifying too much you\u2019re always using what you\u2019ve got in the cupboard rather than buying in more.\u201d Make more from scratch \u201cI don\u2019t think many people realise tomato-based pasta sauces are so cheap and simple to make, or they wouldn\u2019t buy them,\u201d Cloake says. \u201cSome tins of tomatoes, maybe a clove of garlic or some soft herbs, a pinch of sugar and salt, simmered on a low flame for 30 minutes, and you\u2019ve got something much nicer. It freezes brilliantly, so make more than you need and unearth as necessary.\u201d For comparison (at the time of writing), a 400g tin of plum tomatoes costs 28p in Tesco, while a 350g jar of Loyd Grossman tomato and basil sauce costs \u00a31.90. Even when you take into account the cost of simmering on the hob (between 25p and 50p for an hour\u2019s use, according to the Centre for Sustainable Energy) and the other ingredients, it can still work out cheaper to make your own. To mop it up, homemade flatbreads and tortillas are hard to beat for value, Barclay says. \u201cI don\u2019t make my own bread but I do make tortillas. They are so quick, simple and cheap \u2013 one tortilla comes in at under 1p.\u201d A 1.5kg pack of plain flour is on offer at 45p at Morrisons \u2013 with that, plus a little oil and a pinch of salt and some water, you can make 60\u201370 tortillas. A pack of eight Old El Paso flour tortillas costs \u00a31.45. Fill your oven A considerable amount of a household\u2019s energy bill is consumed in the kitchen \u2013 with 12% coming from cooling or freezing, 4% from cooking and typically 16% from the washing machine and dishwasher, according to the Energy Saving Trust (ETS). To reduce energy use, Brian Horne, a senior insight and analytics consultant at ETS, says: \u201cLet food cool down completely before putting it in the fridge, and defrost food in the fridge because this will help to keep your appliance cool. Never leave the door open unnecessarily, and keep the temperature between 3C and 5C. Defrosting freezers regularly will maintain efficiency.\u201d If you need to replace your appliance, choose the best energy rating you can afford for longer-term savings. Induction hobs are the most energy efficient but they are not the cheapest to run. \u201cGas is cheaper than electricity, so gas hobs typically have the lowest running costs,\u201d Horne says. \u201cAnd an electric oven will have lower carbon dioxide emissions than a gas oven but it is more expensive to run.\u201d Whatever the oven type, using it efficiently is the best way to reduce costs. \u201cIn the restaurant, we have conversations in the morning about what\u2019s going in the oven, and at what time,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cBasically, working out an oven timetable.\u201d Adopting a similar approach could save time and money. \u201cAlways fill your oven,\u201d Cloake says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got it on anyway for a roast, do extra vegetables to eat throughout the week, or pop in a loaf of soda bread \u2013 super simple and minutes to put together.\u201d Unless you are making something delicate, switch off the oven 15 minutes before it\u2019s done and leave it to finish cooking in the residual heat, she adds. When reheating those dishes you made in advance, \u201ca microwave is more cost-efficient than a conventional cooker\u201d, Horne says, who adds that boiling water in a kettle is more efficient than a hob. Optimise hob use, too. \u201cI use the water I\u2019ve had on for steaming vegetables to make gravy for the Sunday roast,\u201d Walker says. \u201cAnd you can put vegetables into the water you\u2019re using to cook your pasta \u2013 just pay attention to the different cooking times they need.\u201d Kitchen essentials for budget cooks Top of the list for Taylor is a good knife. \u201cI know it\u2019s chef-y but it will help you to cut down on waste and you\u2019ll have it for life.\u201d An ice cube tray is also handy for an unused bunch of herbs, she says. \u201cParticularly if you live on your own. If you don\u2019t use a whole bunch of herbs, it will sit in your fridge rotting. You can chop them up and cram them into ice cube trays with a little bit of water to use another time.\u201d For Barclay, the handiest tool in his kitchen is a silicone spatula. \u201cI really use it for everything; cooking scrambled eggs, scraping the last bits of mashed potato from the pan. I even took it with me when I stayed in an Airbnb recently.\u201d It\u2019s a bigger-ticket item, but an air fryer, which heats and cooks more quickly than a conventional oven, is good if you frequently cook small amounts of food, such as oven chips, or fish fingers, Cloake says. A good hand blender for soups is useful, as are measuring spoons, she says. \u201cAnd the humble sieve. It does a better job of draining food than your average colander, sifts icing sugar and flour and also works as a steamer. I use mine for so much I have separate sieves for savoury and sweet things.\u201d Get organised A recent survey by the food waste charity Wrap highlighted the presence of UFOs (unidentified frozen objects) in UK freezers, with more than a third of people saying theirs is sometimes a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d, making it extremely hard to work out the contents. \u201cI also try to keep an inventory of the freezer on the door, so I remember what\u2019s in there,\u201d Cloake says. \u201cThe same goes for the fridge; clearing it out regularly is a dispiriting job but it stops you wasting food and space, and done weekly, will save you time.\u201d Walker adds that the golden rule in a restaurant kitchen is to have a \u201cfirst-in, first-out stock rotation, so whenever you receive a delivery, everything new goes to the back\u201d. Take the same approach with your fridge and store cupboard to avoid forgetting ingredients you could use up in a dish. Herbs and spices Rather than buying in jars of mixed spices, raid your spice rack to see if you already have what you need. Garam masala, for example, needs cardamom, cloves, black peppercorns, cumin, nutmeg and cinnamon. \u201cMix it as a powder, or cook it off and add oil, and it will be a bit like a Patak\u2019s paste,\u201d West-Harling says. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have all the ingredients, adapt it.\u201d Growing your own herbs can be simple. If you have outdoor space, mint is a satisfyingly simple to grow. Use fresh leaves through the summer, and dry some for mint tea in the winter months. Jane Perrone, a journalist and the presenter of the On the Ledge podcast, says: \u201cPerennial herbs such as rosemary and thyme need an awful lot of sunshine, so they don\u2019t grow well indoors. But herbs like basil, coriander and parsley, providing you can give them enough light, can be grown in your kitchen.\u201d You can raid your spice rack and plant coriander seeds straight from the jar, and if you buy a pot of basil, you can extend its life by teasing out the seedlings and replanting in compost in a larger pot."

The United States will be relentless in its efforts to bring you to justice.\u201d US Central Command said in a news release that an unidentified senior official in the Islamic State was also seriously injured in the strike that killed Agal. The Pentagon said an \u201cinitial review\u201d indicated there were no civilian casualties, though it wasn\u2019t possible to immediately confirm that information. Agal was \u201cresponsible for aggressively pursuing the development of Isis networks outside \u2026 Iraq and Syria\u201d, according to US Central Command. The Islamic State at the height of its power controlled more than 40,000 sq miles stretching from Syria to Iraq and ruled over 8 million people.

The strike on Agal comes months after the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, killed himself during a raid of his hideout by American special forces. The Pentagon said Qurayshi blew himself up along with members of his family."

In comments released on Thursday morning, the US defense department\u2019s Ely Ratner said Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific was an attempt to challenge the rules-based order and assert greater control in the area. Ratner, the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, said incidents, including those aimed at Australian aircraft earlier this year, were \u201cnot isolated\u201d. \u201cOver the last five years, the number of unsafe PLA [People\u2019s Liberation Army] intercepts \u2026 has increased dramatically, with dozens of dangerous events in the first half of this year alone,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my view, this aggressive and irresponsible behaviour represents one of the most significant threats to peace and stability in the region today, including in the South China Sea.\u201d In May, a Chinese fighter jet forced a RAAF P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft into a \u201cdangerous manoeuvre\u201d. The Australian defence minister, Richard Marles, said the Chinese aircraft flew close to the Australian one, released flares, cut across its nose and settled in front of it. \u201cAt that moment, it then released a bundle of chaff, which contains small pieces of aluminium, some of which were ingested into the engine of the P-8 aircraft,\u201d Marles said. \u201cQuite obviously, this is very dangerous.\u201d In February, a People\u2019s Liberation Army navy warship shone a military-grade laser at an Australian surveillance aircraft. The Australian defence force said at the time there had been an increase in the use of lasers, but that specific incident was \u201cmore serious\u201d. Ratner said on Thursday if the Chinese military continued it could cause a \u201cmajor incident or accident\u201d and that the US had to \u201cdemonstrate the will and capability to properly deter [People\u2019s Republic of China] aggression\u201d. That includes building a \u201ccombat-credible forward presence\u201d in the region, and bolstering allies\u2019 capabilities, he said, particularly in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. While the US will \u201calways stand ready to prevail in conflict\u201d, its priority was deterrence, he said. \u201cWe do not seek confrontation or conflict,\u201d he said. Ratner\u2019s comments echo those from Gen Mark Milley, chair of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. In Sydney on Thursday, he said China\u2019s behaviour in the Pacific was \u201cmuch more confrontational\u201d now and \u201cseems to imply that they want to bully or dominate\u201d. Earlier this week, Milley said China had become \u201csignificantly more, and noticeably more, aggressive\u201d. He added to those comments in Sydney at a conference to discuss the rise of China and the stability of the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a big conference to discuss our mutual security interests and discuss national security issues that apply to all of us,\u201d Milley said, according to Associated Press. Under the new Labor government, there are hopes that relations between China and Australia are thawing. However, Beijing is very critical of the Aukus deal, and the plan for Australia, the UK and the US to share nuclear-powered submarine technology. When China recently advised Australia on how to improve relations, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said Australia \u201cdoesn\u2019t respond to demands\u201d."

            "title": "Pearl Harbor water poisoning: US military families say they continue to fall ill",
            "date": "2022-07-02T09:30:41Z",
            "content": "Beginning in December, US army Major Amanda Feindt and her family found themselves in and out of Tripler army medical center in Honolulu. First, her husband for debilitating ocular migraines, then her four-year-old daughter, who was vomiting with severe abdominal pain, then her one-year-old for chemical burns, and later herself when she started experiencing crippling back pain that prevented her from being able to walk, among other troubling symptoms. The Feindts were only four of thousands who reportedly sickened after 19,000 gallons of jet fuel from the US navy\u2019s second world war-era underground fuel storage facility leaked into one of Oahu\u2019s main drinking water aquifers. The contamination has led to a major water crisis in the Pacific, affecting more than 93,0000 people. Many affected military families and civilians at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam say they are continuing to fall ill and that the navy has not provided accurate information on the possible toxins in their tap water and their bodies. This has led to calls for a rapid emptying of the tanks to prevent further disaster. Feindt says her case is emblematic of the difficulties families face. Back in November, Feindt, alongside many others, were told by the navy that nothing was wrong with their water, despite an advisory from the Hawaii department of health\u2019s (DOH) saying not to use the water to drink, bathe, wash dishes or brush teeth. Not wanting to question her employer, her family continued to use the water for over a week, until the navy formally announced it was suspending the use of the fuel tank facility. Test results from the DOH subsequently showed the drinking water had petroleum levels 350 times higher than what the department considers safe. Still, the navy declined to share results of testing done at her home and daughter\u2019s school, and told her, she said, that she had to file a Freedom of Information Act request to receive them. (She is yet to receive those results. The navy could not comment on this issue, a spokesperson told the Guardian.) In December, the military moved Feindt\u2019s family, and other military families, to hotels in the area, where they stayed for months. In March, after flushing efforts to clear the water lines, and sampling some of the homes for residual contamination, the military and the Hawaii health department said it was safe to go home. Returning residents have taken to Facebook to report seeing oil sheens on the water, alongside several reports of health problems such as skin rashes and chemical burns (particularly with children), neurological problems, gastrointestinal problems, fatigue and headaches, among other problems. In early June, Feindt, who paid over a thousand dollars for her family\u2019s toxicology screens with Great Plains Laboratory in Kansas, received hers, and posted some of the results for her two children in the support group. They showed a level of gasoline additives, flame retardant chemicals and petroleum. Several others received similar results. They have caused alarm. The Guardian asked an independent toxicologist, Jenifer Heath, to interpret them, but Heath said it was impossible for her to do so without other information, such as the individuals\u2019 medical histories. Physical symptoms The hydrocarbons in jet fuel have been linked to liver and stomach cancers, reproductive problems, nervous system and endocrine dysfunction, and neurological problems, said Chelsey Simoni, an epidemiological toxicologist from the HunterSeven Foundation, a non-profit group of medical professionals and military veterans, in a May letter to Armed Forces Housing Advocates. Lawyers representing families who have filed lawsuits against the navy claim the Tripler medical center has only been treating symptoms, and not running in-depth toxicology screenings or considering the possibility of long-term issues. Navy officials have said there is no evidence to suggest residents\u2019 long-term medical symptoms are related to the water distribution system, and that nobody had been hospitalized due to petroleum toxicity. \u201cI would not conjecture that families are making up their complaints,\u201d Capt Michael McGinnis, surgeon for the US Pacific Fleet and senior medical officer, told Hawaii News Now. \u201cCertainly stress can manifest in physical symptoms. That\u2019s something to consider.\u201d A navy spokesperson, Lydia Robertson, told the Guardian that \u201cwe too are concerned about long-term health effects.\u201d As a result it had set up an incident registry, and Hawaii\u2019s military medical facilities were \u201cwell aware of our contaminated water event and are prepared to evaluate any associated medical concerns\u201d. Robertson also said that, per the Hawaii health department, testing for petroleum hydrocarbons is \u201climited and not readily available\u201d. Most recently, the navy told Hawai\u2019i News Now, there were no medical encounters in the last month related to the water crisis. (Some residents disputed this on social media, and say the navy helpline is ineffective.) The navy is also undertaking a water testing program. Leaks The Red Hill underground fuel storage facility began construction just east of Pearl Harbor at the beginning of the second world war, not long before the Japanese attacked in 1941. US military presence on the islands is contentious among many Native Hawaiians, and has been since 1893, when the military aided in the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. The facility contains 20 250ft-tall tanks, with the capacity to store 250m gallons of fuel, all 100ft above the city\u2019s main aquifer. The 2021 leak was not the first. A report prepared for the navy several decades ago quoted a former employee as saying 1.3m gallons leaked during the war. And in January 2014, the navy reported to the Hawaii health department that there had been a 27,000-gallon leak, which contaminated the area groundwater and brought attention to the facility and its threat to Oahu\u2019s water sources. Not long after, the military officials agreed with federal and state agencies to upgrade the corroded systems. According to the EPA, infrastructure improvements began the day of their agreement. Even so, there was a series of smaller leaks \u2013 one of which was not reported by the navy for months to avoid bad optics. A whistleblower also informed the local health department that navy officials withheld information about the extent of corrosion at the facility and provided false testimony about its structural issues. These problems \u2013 coupled with a heavily redacted third-party assessment that says extensive repairs are needed due to heavy corrosion, cracking and fire risks \u2013 have many calling for the tanks to be defueled as quickly as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re one earthquake away from a complete lifetime, life-long, catastrophe,\u201d said Wayne Tanaka, director of the Sierra Club of Hawai\u2019i, which has been suing the navy since 2017. It is not clear how long it will take to defuel the tanks. In a 2019 analysis, the navy claimed it could safely defuel tanks within 36 hours. But a new estimate, released as the navy admitted that extensive human errors and systemic failures led to the leaks, puts completion at the end of 2024. Water protectors Throughout the crisis, Feindt, who has served in the army for 16 years, has been one of the few active military members who have been outspoken on social media and the news. She says she has suffered retaliation from her superiors and other military personnel. (Her unit, Special Operations Command Pacific, declined to comment on these allegations.) She has found support from victims of the water contamination discovered in the 1980s at Marine Camp Lajeune in North Carolina, but most significantly from Native Hawaiian activists. In December, the Oahu Water Protectors, a coalition of organizers and community members fighting for clean water, held a protest where hundreds showed up at the capitol, chanting \u201cOla i ka wai\u201d (water is life) and demanding the shutdown of Red Hill. The group has since been canvassing neighborhoods with brochures to raise awareness, waged social media campaigns, and is part of the Shut Down Red Hill Mutual Aid Collective. This primarily Hawaiian-led organization has provided military and civilian families with supplies and bottled water, and organized community meet-ups for families to talk about their struggles. On 14 June, another group of community activists, the Wai Ola Alliance, filed a lawsuit seeking to have the court declare that the navy violated the Clean Water Act, with a $60,000-a-day fine for violations that have occurred since April 2017. One of the leaders of the alliance is Mary Maxine Kahaulelio, who was one of several activists arrested in 1977 for trying to stop the US army bombing the Hawaiian island of Kaho\u2019olawe. Such efforts eventually succeeded and the land was returned to the state in 1994. It is now a cultural reserve. In recent testimony about another military training center, she brought up the significance of Pearl Harbor. \u201cPearl Harbor used to be the greatest fishpond that Hawai\u2019i had ever known. Pearl Harbor fed the ali\u2019i\u2019 [royalty], fed the commoners and it\u2019s all gone, because the military owns all our land. But you don\u2019t own me.\u201d She ended with an appeal to the military: \u201cWe love you, but aloha, go home. Go home.\u201d"

            "title": "Ukraine\u2019s military plans to limit free movement to make conscription easier",
            "date": "2022-07-06T17:32:52Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s military has announced plans to introduce a system of permits that would prohibit men eligible for conscription from leaving the region where they are registered. The move, based on legislation from 1992, was intended to enable the country\u2019s armed forces to locate potential conscripts more easily, but it prompted an immediate backlash. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised the announcement in his nightly TV address to the nation on Tuesday, saying that the general staff should not make decisions without him. Two parliamentarians immediately filed draft legislation that would scrap the army\u2019s initiative, which they described as \u201coutdated\u201d. It remains unclear if movement permits for men will be introduced, but the army\u2019s announcement highlights the precarious position facing Ukrainian men who could be conscripted to fight at any moment. Since Zelenskiy declared martial law at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 are eligible for military service and are forbidden from leaving the country. There are a few exceptions such as men with poor health, or fathers of three or more children. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight. I want to continue working,\u201d said Roman, a 31-year-old software developer in Kyiv. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t want to think negatively about it because many of my friends have been mobilised and it\u2019s not fair on them. I try not to think that if I\u2019m mobilised it 100% means I will die or be injured or see fighting.\u201d When martial law was first announced, Ukraine\u2019s authorities said conscription would occur in waves, starting with those who have previous military experience, and would reflect the army\u2019s needs, focusing on medics or people with a science background, for example. Women can also be mobilised if their professional experience is needed but they cannot be compelled and are not expected to fight. Thousands of Ukrainians have volunteered to fight or be reservists. By 6 March, about 100,000 had enlisted in the territorial defence force alone. But there are also those who worry about being sent into the frontlines, where a horrific artillery battle is raging, and between 100 and 200 Ukrainian soldiers are reportedly dying every day. For some men, the prospect of conscription \u2013 and the uncertainty of not knowing when the call might come \u2013 looms oppressively. \u201cThe worst thing about it is I don\u2019t know how [mobilisation] is happening at the moment,\u201d said Roman. \u201cWill the conscription notice come to my house or will someone just stop me in the street? Should I continue renting my apartment? Should I buy [military equipment] or not?\u201d Last month, a group of men were detained by police at Otel, a well-known Kyiv nightclub, for allegedly breaking curfew and subsequently given conscription notices by the local military administrative office. Maks Yudin, Otel\u2019s installation artist and technician, and Pavlo Derhachov, the owner of Otel, were among them. Yudin described how they had held a daytime event \u2013 allowed within the curfew rules \u2013 and were taking down the set. He said he went to open the backdoor at 11pm to find a mass of police officers waiting outside. \u201cThere were like five police officers for each person,\u201d said Yudin, who is originally from Russia but moved to Ukraine in 2019. \u201cThe police have demonised this club for a long time even though we have been a base for volunteer work since the beginning of the war.\u201d Yudin himself volunteered as an army medic at the beginning of the war but, despite having a degree in medicine and previous military experience, he was rejected because of his Russian citizenship. Otel still serves as a makeshift staging area for aid distribution. Behind the bar are shelves of goods stacked with goods for different cities near the frontlines as well as some equipment for a battalion they support. On the other side of the dancefloor, there is a crate of molotov cocktails. Police said 219 people found at the club were given conscription notices, but Yudin and Derhachov say only about 10 to 15 people there. \u201cThe kind of conscription notice they gave us is a bit like spam mail,\u201d said Derhachov. \u201cThey are designed to encourage people to sign up to fight but there is no system to follow up. Luckily there are many of those people who will react and want to fight and that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d A second type of conscription notice is delivered to an individual\u2019s house and states why the army needs him. \u201cSince the war started, I have experienced a sort of survivor\u2019s guilt syndrome because people are dying and I can\u2019t feel good,\u201d said Derhachov. \u201cI\u2019m actually glad that they closed the borders [for men] because it forces you to confront what\u2019s happening even if it\u2019s in a passive form. In one way or another, you have to participate.\u201d Derhachov said they still host occasional daytime events but not the \u201chedonistic, techno raves\u201d that Kyiv was known for before the war. \u201cEvery event has collected money for the war \u2013 the army, a specific battalion or humanitarian aid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not at the stage of total mobilisation like in WWII,\u201d Oleksandr Shulga, a former sociology academic at Ukraine\u2019s academy of sciences, who signed up to fight on the first day of the war, explained. \u201cThere are plenty of people that are willing and are preparing for being mobilised. What I worry about is that after the war there will be a divide in society between those who did and didn\u2019t fight.\u201d"

            "content": "I often liken the opening of my moth trap to Christmas morning in childhood: you have no idea what you are about to be gifted. Today, it\u2019s 17 elephant and small elephant hawkmoths, which is more than I\u2019ve ever seen before. The first is an improbable blend of the cocktail lounge and military dowdiness, with shimmering lines of pink over matt olive. If anything, the small elephant hawkmoth is more striking, with the soldier\u2019s khaki replaced by a colour somewhere between aconite yellow and burnt grass. In certain lights, as I arrange them on a sheet beneath the shade of our oak, they look like lipstick on gold. However, there is a curious reflection at work as I proceed, because I always feel \u2013 for some reason \u2013 an urge to see the adults of any insect species rather than other stage of its life. It\u2019s nagging me because I recently found the larva of a moth called the giant peacock, the largest moth in Europe, which bears exquisite pink-rimmed eyes upon its four enormous wings. Alas, I only saw the caterpillar. I say \u201calas\u201d, but it was no insignificant beast itself: a florescent lime \u201cfinger\u201d studded with yellow warts from which spired thick black bristles. Yet the desire for the adult was undiminished, and I know it\u2019s odd because many insects spend more of their lives as larvae than they do adults. The golden-ringed dragonfly can live several months in its final winged avatar but three years as a voracious pond-dwelling nymph. Stag beetles live as enormous whitish larvae for up to seven years, and some American cicadas spend 17 years underground before emerging for a brief summer of blade-grinding song and breeding. In fact, some adult moths have no mouthparts and only days in which to pass on their genes before they inevitably starve. What is perhaps most remarkable, however, about my elephant hawkmoths, is not one stage or another, but that they start as a pimple-sized eggs on our willowherb, grow by devouring the leaves into silver-eyed worms the size of my pinky and, finally, metamorphose into pink-and-khaki angels to adorn this summer\u2019s morning. \u2022 Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

            "content": "When the most senior figure in Britain\u2019s defence and security establishment warns of the increased risk of accidental nuclear war, the rest of us should pay attention. Even today, when security chiefs speak more often in public than they once did, they still ration their pronouncements. So when the UK\u2019s national security adviser, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, speaks in Washington about a breakdown in communications with Russia and China causing an enhanced risk of \u201crapid escalation to strategic conflict\u201d, as he did this week, those words should be taken very seriously indeed. The increased international danger is starkly obvious. Russia\u2019s deliberate invasion of Ukraine, its use there of hypersonic Kinzhal weapons and its threats of further escalation involving its nuclear arsenal add up to the most destabilising repertoire of state-on-state aggression in modern Europe since 1945. In Asia, China\u2019s increasingly bellicose postures over Taiwan and in the South China Sea, its intensive nuclear missile development programmes and its disdain towards arms control agreements raise the stakes much higher. Iran and North Korea, where Kim Jong-un appears to be preparing the country\u2019s first nuclear test for five years, add further to the current volatility. Sir Stephen warned that what is happening is not a return to the nuclear tensions of the cold war. In those days, he argued, Nato and the Soviet Union by and large understood one another\u2019s military doctrines of deterrence, containment and the avoidance of first nuclear weapon use. That is not the case today. Nuclear doctrine is opaque, and possibly different, in Moscow and Beijing, never mind in Pyongyang. The conditions for instability are therefore greater, either through deliberate acts or miscalculations. Although Sir Stephen did not say so, this environment could trigger a flawed and fateful western response, not just an act of aggression by one of the west\u2019s adversaries. Western faith in dialogue with hostile rivals has been massively damaged by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A similar confrontation with China over Taiwan would shatter confidence still further. But Sir Stephen is right to say that all sides must continue to look for ways of conducting dialogue. Some foundations are better than none at all. For that reason alone, it is helpful that Joe Biden and Xi Jinping were holding their first conversation in many months on Thursday. The expected start of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference in New York next week is potentially another confidence-building development in a crucial area. In spite of all the obvious difficulties, arms control remains an indispensable means of tackling the current volatility. The key role in the west will continue to be played by the United States. But Britain is not currently doing its bit. Boris Johnson prefers to grandstand as a fancy dress war leader. Liz Truss is doing a Margaret Thatcher tribute act in the hope of becoming his successor. Rishi Sunak is afraid of saying anything for fear of the Tory right. This week, though, the Commons defence committee accused the government of being \u201carrogant and unwilling to learn the lessons\u201d of its defence errors, including in Ukraine, while an Institute for Government report describes the Foreign Office as understaffed, with low morale and expertise on Russia continuing to be downgraded. Sir Stephen Lovegrove\u2019s Washington speech may be a welcome piece of strategic thinking at the heart of government. But the people who most need to get his message are the British ministers for whom he works. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

            "date": "2022-07-21T05:00:39Z",
            "content": "The traditional British garden is under threat from extreme heat, the Royal Horticultural Society has said, as it launches a survey to examine the damage from this week\u2019s heatwave. It is likely that in the future delicate flowers including roses and poppies will have to be swapped for plants such as salvias and dahlias, which are more resistant to heat. Many will have noticed their pot plants and prized garden flowers withering and wilting in the record heat, which reached 40.3C (104.5F) in Lincolnshire on Tuesday. Due to the climate crisis, temperatures such as this are likely to happen more frequently. This means people are going to have to start thinking about what and when to plant in their gardens, perhaps meaning the traditional British garden will no longer exist. The RHS is asking its thousands of members, as well as any other interested gardener, to tell them how the heatwave affected their gardens. They are asked to note the plants damaged, their previous known condition and when they were planted and last mulched, in an effort to help the RHS advise on plants to grow in future years. Heat damage usually does not set in until about a week after a hot weather event, so the horticultural charity is braced for a flood of calls next week. However, there are already reports of acers and hydrangeas suffering. The signs of heat damage include brown and crispy leaves, and plants can be saved with watering of the roots and shading if the issue is caught early enough. For many plants it will be too late, so the RHS says they should be composted and turned into mulch. Leigh Hunt, principal RHS adviser, said: \u201cThe extreme weather conditions could be a catalyst for change in what we view as a traditional British garden. For many years, gardeners have dabbled with more sun-loving, drought-tolerant plants in their gardens but the summer of 2022 and the anticipated damage it will cause to some favourites could see a more permanent move towards plants that can cope with both extreme wet and dry.\u201d Not only that, but shortly after the heatwave, it is likely that we will experience a \u201cfalse autumn\u201d, with heavy rain and lower temperatures before it gets warmer again, confusing plants and causing damage. This means that gardeners need to choose plants which can deal with both droughts and colder, wetter conditions. Hunt said: \u201cIn the coming weeks we\u2019re anticipating a false autumn \u2013 whereby heat-stressed plants lose their leaves early or turn red or brown. \u201cFor those experiencing plant losses this year we wouldn\u2019t recommend replacing like for like and instead choose plants that will cope with hotter conditions, and not need watering in this summer and withstand long wet conditions in winter. Examples include daylily Burning Daylight, eulalia Kleine Font\u00e4ne and geranium.\u201d Heat-loving plants are already enjoying boosted popularity in the UK after a run of hot summers and fears of damage to more delicate flowers. These include cannas, salvias and dahlias. Salvias are particularly popular and the most-viewed plant profile on the RHS website. Plants we may lose from the British garden include roses, which go over more quickly in the heat. Leafy salads tend to bolt and go to seed in hot weather, and flowers including field poppies and calendula also go to seed more quickly."

            "content": "The UK is sadly becoming habituated to an officially sponsored attrition of truth about nuclear power. Despite intensifying propaganda, even government data shows this military-backed technology to be, in reality, an expensive, slow, unreliable, risky and unpopular way to deliver affordable, secure, zero-carbon energy. The gap in efficacy and competitiveness between nuclear and other options is continually growing. Supporting nuclear, rather than energy efficiency, wind and solar, slows down climate action, bleeds taxpayers, forgoes jobs and forces unnecessarily large and regressive burdens on consumers. Yet firehosing scarce public resources at ailing nuclear initiatives proceeds unabated. The nuclear fuel fund announced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on Tuesday is yet another among uncounted nozzles pointed variously at research, liability, insurance, training, finance, regulation, planning, non-proliferation, security, waste management, grid codes, etc. One notable feature of this most recent example of a worsening syndrome is that in the opening lines introducing this initiative, the BEIS says: \u201cNuclear is the only form of reliable, low-carbon generation which has been deployed at scale to date.\u201d Whatever side is taken amid the complexities, the manifest falsity of this starkly unqualified statement is extraordinary. As the government\u2019s own data also shows, the costs of managing variable supply are rapidly diminishing and are already far smaller than the competitiveness gap between nuclear and renewables. Current renewable contributions to UK electricity far surpass the peak achieved by nuclear. When did it become acceptable in British public life that a supposedly democratic government should so seriously misrepresent reality in a formal policy document? In a period when stakes are unprecedentedly high for climate, economy, energy security and hard-pressed households, it is time to renew reasoned scientific and democratic debate in this field and prevent this national self-harm by unaccountable special interests.

            "date": "2022-07-20T15:40:13Z",
            "content": "The UK government has given planning consent to the \u00a320bn Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk. The decision by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, which had been repeatedly delayed, was finally announced on Wednesday and went against the advice of the independent Planning Inspectorate. French energy company EDF wants to build the 3.2 GW, two-reactor plant next to its existing site at Sizewell B, which began operating in 1995. However, the proposals have faced fierce opposition from local campaigners, who have argued against the project because of the environmental impact and the cost to energy billpayers. Campaigners now have six weeks to decide whether to appeal against the decision. Planning permission was seen as a key hurdle for the project which remains subject to a further final investment decision, expected next year. It is hoped the plant can generate enough power for six million homes. The approval process for Sizewell C has so far included four rounds of public consultation which began in 2012 and has involved more than 10,000 East Suffolk residents. The Planning Inspectorate rejected the scheme because of concerns over the plant\u2019s impact on protected species and habitats, and the long-term water supply at the site. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. However, it is understood the UK government is keen to ease CGN out amid concerns over Chinese involvement with sensitive assets. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. Boris Johnson\u2019s government put \u00a3100m of funding behind the project in January to support its development. Carly Vince, the project\u2019s chief planning officer, said: \u201cSizewell C will be good for the region, creating thousands of opportunities for local people and businesses. It will boost local biodiversity and leave a legacy Suffolk can be proud of.\u201d Julia Pyke, the director of financing for Sizewell C, said: \u201cEnergy costs will be lower with nuclear in the mix, so today\u2019s decision is good news for billpayers. The tried and tested funding arrangement we are proposing means that, by paying a small amount during construction, consumers will benefit in the long-term. \u201cSizewell C will give a big boost to jobs and skills in nuclear supply chain companies across the country. It will strengthen the UK\u2019s energy security and play a key role in our fight against climate change.\u201d Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: \u201cThe wrong decision has been made but it\u2019s not the end of our campaign to Stop Sizewell C. Not only will we be looking closely at appealing this decision, we\u2019ll continue to challenge every aspect of Sizewell C, because \u2013 whether it is the impact on consumers, the massive costs and delays, the outstanding technical questions or the environmental impacts \u2013 it remains a very bad risk.\u201d Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: \u201cThe construction of the proposed development will be damaging and it has been granted with insufficient consideration for the effects on nature as described by the government\u2019s own experts. This is a ludicrous decision for an interim government to make.\u201d Greenpeace UK\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, called the project a \u201cred herring energy solution\u201d as the UK attempts to move towards a low-carbon energy system. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the decision \u201csignificantly strengthens the pipeline of new nuclear capacity in Britain\u201d. Hinkley Point C in Somerset, also backed by EDF, has been beset by delays and cost over-runs. The French government said on Tuesday it was prepared to pay \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.5bn) to fully nationalise EDF amid concerns over its finances. Ministers in France want to keep a handle on soaring energy bills. Johnson has set a target of making investment decisions on eight new nuclear projects by the end of the decade."

            "date": "2022-07-11T21:50:07Z",
            "content": "Elon Musk broke his silence on Monday over his attempt to bail out on buying Twitter for $44bn, mocking the company before the firm hit back with a statement of its own that called his attempted termination \u201cinvalid and wrongful\u201d. Early on Monday, the world\u2019s richest man went on the social media platform he claims he is no longer trying to buy and fired off a series of tweets suggesting he is gearing up for a likely legal battle. One tweet contained a four-picture frame meme of him laughing, next to sentences reading: \u201cThey said I couldn\u2019t buy Twitter. Then they wouldn\u2019t disclose bot info. Now they want to force me to buy Twitter in court. Now they have to disclose bot info in court.\u201d Another tweet was a picture of the actor Chuck Norris sitting at a chessboard with his chin resting atop his folded hands. Musk\u2019s own reply to his tweet read \u201cChuckmate\u201d. The tweets, from Musk\u2019s verified account, served as his first comments on his legal team\u2019s disclosure on Friday that he intends to nix his takeover of Twitter, which the network first resisted but then warmed up to. Twitter announced in late April that it would sell to Musk, but on Friday, lawyers for Musk publicly filed notice that he wanted out of the agreement, arguing among other things that the platform had failed to provide promised information on fake and spam accounts \u2013 so-called bots. Yet Musk is unlikely to walk away easily. On Monday, lawyers for the company denounced his attempt to back out, saying in a letter: \u201cTwitter has breached none of its obligations under the agreement. \u201cThe purported termination is invalid for the independent reason that Mr Musk and the other Musk parties have knowingly, intentionally, willfully, and materially breached the agreement \u2026 Twitter will continue to provide information reasonably requested by Mr Musk \u2026 and to diligently take all measures required to close the transaction,\u201d the statement goes on. Musk appears destined for a lengthy fight with Twitter in court. Notably, Twitter\u2019s chairperson, Bret Taylor, said his company was ready to sue Musk in a Delaware state court to enforce the purchase deal it had struck. The agreement contained a provision that may compel Musk to go through with buying Twitter as long as he had the financing to do so, which the businessman indicated in May that he had. Bloomberg reported on Sunday that Twitter had in fact gone ahead and assembled a team of attorneys to sue Musk. Musk could also face a fine of $1bn if he pulls out of the deal, although he is trying to avoid the penalty by alleging that Twitter breached \u201cmultiple provisions\u201d of its sale agreement. His first public appearance after Friday\u2019s filing occurred when he delivered the closed-doors keynote address at Allen &amp; Co\u2019s Sun Valley conference on Saturday. Reports from Bloomberg and Reuters indicated that Musk told the crowd of tech, media and finance moguls about his thoughts on colonizing Mars and boosting Earth\u2019s birthrates \u2013 but he avoided talking about his proposed withdrawal from buying Twitter. A report from CNN late on Sunday said Musk indeed did talk about trying to terminate his agreement with Twitter, with executives of the company in attendance. But that report said Musk simply reiterated his complaints about bot accounts and echoed statements that his lawyers made in their notice Friday. Musk\u2019s tweets started less than an hour after the CNN report. The businessman\u2019s maneuvering has set off a firestorm of reactions, including from Donald Trump, who called Musk a \u201cbullshit artist\u201d and his deal to buy Twitter \u201crotten\u201d while the former president stumped for Republican political candidates in Alaska over the weekend."

            "content": "Persistence, intelligence, a fierce devotion to the facts and an easy capacity for outrage. These are the building blocks of great journalism and they are the virtues that have made Linda Villarosa one of our most important activist-journalist-authors for several decades. Her latest book, subtitled \u201cThe Hidden Toll of Racism on American Lives and on the Health of our Nation\u201d, is a culmination of her important work going back to 1986, when her story Nobody\u2019s Safe in Essence was the first article about HIV/Aids published in an ethnic magazine. That piece marked the moment Villarosa realized \u201cthat these kinds of stories would be my life\u2019s work\u201d. Americans have been benefiting from her persistence and intelligence ever since. Her new book tells a horrifying story about all the reasons Black Americans have been mistreated by doctors for centuries, beginning with the idea propagated under the transatlantic slave trade that Black men had a \u201cprimitive psychological organization\u201d that made them \u201cuniquely fitted for bondage\u201d. Dr Samuel Cartwright of New Orleans went so far as to assert that the desire to escape was itself proof of a mental illness. It has been common knowledge for centuries that Black people suffer worse health outcomes than whites in America. But American racism has been so virulent for so long, it took even Villarosa many years to reject the idea that poor choices by Black people were the main reason for their misfortune. She writes: \u201cAs recently as 2016, a survey of 22 white medical students and residents \u2026 showed that half of them endorsed at least one myth about physiological differences between Black people and white people, including that Black people\u2019s nerve endings are less sensitive than whites.\u201d When asked to imagine how much pain white or Black people experienced from getting their hands slammed in a car door, the students \u201cinsisted that Black people felt less pain, which made the providers less likely to recommend appropriate treatment\u201d. The proven facts are appalling: the racial disparity in infant mortality is \u201cactually greater in the present day than in 1850, when Black women were human chattel\u201d. African Americans aged 18 to 49 \u201care twice as likely to die from heart disease\u201d. Black infants are more than twice as likely as white babies to die before their first birthday. Like the white medical establishment, Villarosa assumed poverty had to be a key factor in these statistics. But as researchers became more sophisticated, they discovered that \u201cbabies of more educated, higher-income Black parents were still more likely to be born small compared to their white counterparts\u201d. In 1997, researchers developed nine questions to determine scientifically how much racism an individual has been subjected to, ranging from \u201cpeople act as if they think you are not smart\u201d to \u201cpeople act as if they think you are dishonest\u201d. What the data proved was that while socio-economic status and education are relevant, \u201cthe lived experience of being Black in America regardless of income and education, also affects health\u201d. One proof came from a 1997 study comparing the birth weights of children from US-born Black people with the babies of African-born Black people and US-born white people. \u201cThe infants of the immigrant women from Africa closely matched in size to the white, not the Black, US-born babies. In other words, despite the disadvantages they experienced by being brought up in poorer countries, \u201ctheir newborns were larger and more likely to be fuller term than babies born to African American women\u201d. And then, \u201cthe grandchildren of the Caribbean and African immigrant women were born smaller than their mothers had been at birth\u201d. As a super high-achiever with access to excellent health, Villarosa was shocked when she herself had a baby with below-average body weight. Some of the most depressing parts of the book are the stories about the persistence of racism at elite American institutions like Stanford University, where a talented Black pre-med female student was routinely dismissed by white classmates who assumed she was only there because of affirmative action. The same student said her four-year residency starting in 2002 was \u201ca toxic mix\u201d of racism and sexism. \u201cIf you were a woman who wasn\u2019t traditionally feminine\u201d or \u201ca person of color \u2026 the mainly older white men who ran the residency treated you horribly\u201d. And yet Villarosa remains resolutely optimistic. When part of this book was first published in a different version in the New York Times Magazine, under the title \u201cWhy America\u2019s Black Mothers and Babies Are in a Life-or-Death Crisis\u201d, in 2018, she was thrilled when the then governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, responded with a pilot program to expand Medicaid coverage for birth doulas, \u201cciting the need to target racial disparities in maternal mortality\u201d. And even when the Covid epidemic arrived as she was writing this book, confirming her essential thesis about the inequitable treatment of Black people by the American healthcare system, Villarosa remained hopeful. She writes: \u201cTogether, America\u2019s racial reckoning and a pandemic that has exposed long-standing racial health inequality have thrown an accelerant on a slow-burning fire of awareness, forcing America to grapple with issues of race and justice.\u201d Villarosa\u2019s unquenchable faith in the power of journalism makes her a worthy successor to another famous muckraker, Ida B Wells, whose fearless journalism focused a nation\u2019s attention on the horrors of lynching more than a century ago. This book uses the same kind of ferocity to attack the persistent racism that infects the healthcare system in America. Under the Skin: the Hidden Toll of Racism on American Lives and on the Health of Our Nation is published in the US by Doubleday Books"

            "title": "How US dollars put anti-abortion groups at the heart of Romanian healthcare",
            "date": "2022-07-22T06:00:04Z",
            "content": "It was the middle of summer, and the smell of ripening mirabelle plums filled the streets of Bucharest. Irina Mateescu was almost 18 and living with her grandparents. She had good grades, a boyfriend, and a late period which she was trying not think about. \u201cEventually, I couldn\u2019t ignore it any more. I saw a leaflet advertising free pregnancy tests. I didn\u2019t have the money to buy one so I went to the address,\u201d she recalls, 22 years later standing on the balcony of her new office. The test was positive; she was eight weeks pregnant. Mateescu told the staff at the centre that she wanted an abortion, legal until 14 weeks in Romania, then to finish school. Instead, she was shown Silent Scream,the widely discredited 1984 US anti-abortion film. \u201cThey said it showed what happens during an abortion. That the baby, who is already a human, gets torn into pieces,\u201d she says. She left distraught. Staff called her grandparents\u2019 phone every day to persuade Mateescu against an abortion. \u201cI started thinking that I should keep it. I tried to convince my boyfriend that it\u2019s our fault. That now we have to pay the price,\u201d says Mateescu. What she did not realise at the time was that the leaflet she was given offering support was actually advertising the services of a religious \u201cpregnancy crisis centre\u201d. Pregnancy crisis centres (PCCs) first appeared in the US in the 1960s and gained popularity after the Roe v Wade ruling. They promised counselling to women with unplanned pregnancies \u2013 as an alternative to abortion. However, they have been criticised for not advertising their religious affiliation or stating their anti-abortion stance, leading to them being mistaken for abortion clinics. The medical information provided by PCCs has often been found to be counter to medical consensus. \u201cThey try to discourage and prevent you from getting an abortion, either by shaming or by misinformation,\u201d says Andrada Cilibiu from Centrul Filia, a women\u2019s rights organisation. \u201cThe information they provide usually doesn\u2019t have a medical basis. Instead they use fear.\u201d In Romania, the centres first appeared in the late 1990s, many founded by evangelicals from the US, with a mission to save \u201cthe unborn\u201d in the former communist dictatorship. At the time, they faced an uphill battle. Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s blanket abortion ban \u2013 which resulted in the death of at least 10,000 women \u2013 and the scandal of mistreated orphans were fresh in Romanian memory. Abortion was legalised soon after Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s execution in 1989. Until 2003, the rate of abortions exceeded the rate of births, in part because education in family planning remained poor in many parts of the country after the decades-long ban, and the medical infrastructure to deliver contraceptives had to be built from scratch. But after 30 years, public hospitals are increasingly refusing to perform abortions on request, and the anti-choice movement is gaining influence. A recent investigation by Romanian media showed that in 11 out of 42 counties in Romania, no public hospital performed abortions last year. In a further four counties, fewer than four abortions were performed in public hospitals. Cilibiu has collected data from 136 public hospitals as part of Centrul Fillia\u2019s own research. She says that 70 cited religious or ethical concerns in their official responses as reasons for refusing abortion provision. \u201cThey quote the Bible, saying that doctors do not go to school to kill babies but to save lives,\u201d she says. \u201cThey also explained the procedures they offer to convince women to keep the pregnancy.\u201d These included anti-abortion counselling Anti-abortion messaging has penetrated Romania\u2019s public healthcare system, says Mateescu, who defied pressure 22 years ago, obtained an abortion and today is a qualified midwife and reproductive rights advocate. \u201cOlder doctors pressure younger colleagues to limit abortion access,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to \u2018make waves\u2019, but there is a religious aspect as well. They say they don\u2019t want to go against God.\u201d \u201cI asked a hospital in [the eastern city of] Ia\u0219i where their family planning office is,\u201d Mateescu says. \u201cI was told it was at the church in the courtyard [in Romania many hospitals have Eastern Orthodox churches attached to them]. In the church, it said: \u2018family planning and pregnancy crisis centre\u2019; everyone was sent there to speak to the priest.\u201d None of the public hospitals in Ia\u0219i have performed abortion since 2021 according to latest data. \u201cIn the 1990s, most of the population was pro-choice due to the national trauma of the abortion ban. This is starting to change,\u201d says Alexandra Columban from Actedo, an NGO based in Transylvania. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s collective amnesia, but also the lobbying of religious organisations, national and American.\u201d Transylvania, a region in the north-west of the country, is home to the largest evangelical communities in Romania. In some smaller cities, PCCs have embedded themselves in multiple branches of public services, creating a barrier to abortion access. Among 22 PCCS identified in Transylvania by the Guardian, at least 14 were receiving funds from US charities Oradea, a city on the Hungarian border, is home to an evangelical university and two PCCs, financed by Americans. It is also the capital of Bihor county, which ranks fifth in the country in terms of the number of teen mothers. Many public services in the city hold contracts with Centrul Puls, a local PCC established in 2003 by a Christian charity based in Pennsylvania, US. The centre, accredited by the Romanian government as a social services provider, delivered \u201ccounselling\u201d to women seeking abortion at the city hospital \u2013 the last public facility in Bihor still performing abortions \u2013 until 2020. The city\u2019s social services continue to refer women with unplanned pregnancies to the centre. Puls also delivers abstinence-only \u201cpurity programmes\u201d in technical colleges in Oradea. \u201cWe offer real information about abortion,\u201d says Miorika Cristea from Florida, who established Precious Little Feet, Oradea\u2019s first PCC, in 2001. She believes that doctors who offer abortions are motivated by financial gain and withhold information from patients. The women who turn to Cristea\u2019s centre are taken for a free ultrasound. \u201cIt\u2019s to show them what they will do if they have an abortion,\u201d says Lidia Dan, a worker at the centre. \u201cAfter they hear the heartbeat, they get emotional, they cry.\u201d This approach was adopted by US states such as Kentucky, which required patients to listen to the foetal heartbeat and watch an ultrasound before an abortion. Dan hopes that one day such law will be introduced in Romania. \u201cI was called by God,\u201d says Cristea, who emigrated from Yugoslavia to the US in 1984 and subsequently began following Baptist teaching. \u201cDuring prayer, God gave me a vision of heaven, and everywhere there were children running towards me saying \u2018also me\u2019 in Romanian. Later I realised these will be the children saved from abortion.\u201d In 2000, she pursued training at a PCC in Florida, aiming to bring the model to Romania. \u201cThe concept of pregnancy crisis centres in Romania was very new at the time,\u201d she says. Today, Precious Little Feet is well established in local communities in two Transylvanian cities, Oradea and Deva. \u201cWe have a long list of people we collaborate with,\u201d says Cristea. \u201cDoctors in the medical field, adoption agencies, foster carers, social workers.\u201d \u201cRecently, social services in Deva reached out to us to develop an educational programme aimed at teenagers \u2013 that\u2019s a big thing,\u201d Cristea says. She hopes that abortion will end in Romania during her lifetime. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sure God has people who will continue fighting for life. I am not alone.\u201d There is a direct link between the American and Romanian anti-abortion movements, says Daniela Draghici, a reproductive rights advocate. \u201cPro-choice groups have no chance to compete with these evangelical organisations that get money and technical assistance from the US,\u201d she says. Draghici had a \u201ckitchen-table abortion\u201d during Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s regime. \u201cI almost died. It was in the late 70s, I was a student,\u201d she says. \u201cI was taken to a house in the countryside. An old woman was boiling metal instruments on the stove. It smelled like medical alcohol. I got up on the table and she put a rag in my mouth \u2013 I\u2019ll never forget that \u2013 so the neighbours would not hear me,\u201d Draghici recalls. \u201cThere was no anaesthesia.\u201d But the abortion was incomplete, Draghici realised a few days later. \u201cThis time someone else put me in touch with a doctor, a male gynaecologist, who was part of an underground network,\u201d she says. \u201cHe saved my life on another kitchen table.\u201d Draghici worries that the horrors of the abortion ban, when thousands of women died as a result of the kinds of procedure she underwent, are fading. \u201cThere is no national memory. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s taught in schools,\u201d she says. \u201cThe memory is just here, in my head.\u201d Today, Mateescu is determined to push back against the changing tide. She launched a website that offers information written by doctors about abortion and contraception. \u201cWe want to give access to fact-based information,\u201d she says. She also trains healthcare professionals. \u201cWe work with their emotions and values and we say \u2018OK, this should not interfere with your work\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want to empower them to advocate for women, not judge them. My aim is to see this training implemented at national level.\u201d Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly: \u00b0 This article was supported by www.dela0.ro"

            "date": "2022-07-01T19:00:24Z",
            "content": "Like a law of nature, each political crisis in the United States precipitates a wave of Americans desperate to emigrate to New Zealand. Disenchanted liberals flood internet forums with inquiries, flock to expat social media groups, and drive immigration websites to the brink of crashing. \u201cAre you happy living in New Zealand? I\u2019m a 27-year-old man. I want to settle down in Canada or New Zealand. NZ is like a peaceful paradise in the corner of the world,\u201d reads one wistful inquiry. \u201cTrying to convince my friends that we should all move to New Zealand and live in Hobbit houses,\u201d a social media user said \u2013 one of hundreds to tweet the phrase as the supreme court announced its decision to remove American women\u2019s right to abortion \u201cSo: we all moving to New Zealand? Hobbits? Sheep? Access to basic human rights?\u201d tweets another. \u201cThe \u2018I want to move to New Zealand\u2019 time of the news cycle,\u201d says a third. The phenomenon has become regular to the point of predictability. In the days after Trump\u2019s election, visits to the country\u2019s immigration website rose almost 2,500%, and immigrant numbers from the US spiked 65% a year later. After the supreme court decision, American visits to immigration sites quadrupled to 77,000, local social media expat groups fended off a wave of applicants, and local health recruiting agencies reported a spike of enquiries from US medical staff. For most, \u201cI\u2019m moving to New Zealand\u201d remains an expression of frustration, rather than a life plan. But what of those who follow through? Many of those Americans who absconded after Trump\u2019s election have now spent several years in the country \u2013 and life in a liberal paradise, it seems, is not without tribulations of its own. \u2018I was not prepared for life without Amazon Prime\u2019 \u201cProbably the main thing I was surprised at is just how hard it is to find good Mexican food,\u201d says Hawaiian creative director Chad Kukahiko. In a Facebook group for American expats that Kukahiko helps run, \u201cthat is like topic number one,\u201d he says, with desperate members circulating a shared spreadsheet of passable restaurants. \u201cI was not prepared for life without Amazon Prime,\u201d laughs Madeline Nash, a Texan who made the move with her family in 2018. \u201cWhich is a total first world problem, but just the approach to goods and consumerism here \u2026 It didn\u2019t really dawn on me that not everything was readily available at all times.\u201d Both count themselves among the wave that made the move after Trump came to power. \u201cWe joked that the night of the 2016 election, we were some of the people who crashed immigration New Zealand\u2019s website \u2013 except we actually went through with it,\u201d Nash says. For Kukahiko, the 2016 elections of Donald Trump left him feeling disgusted \u2013 and concerned that the country was on a bleak trajectory towards conflict. \u201cFor me it was visceral,\u201d he says. \u201cI was so shocked when 60-plus million people voted for this.\u201d He was impressed by New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern, he says, who \u2013 particularly after the Christchurch mosque shootings \u2013 seemed like the antithesis of Trump. He and his wife weighed up Norway, but the warmer weather of Aotearoa sealed the deal. For the Nash family, the decision to leave the US came when their son turned five, and began school tours. \u201cWe went to our local primary school, and they spent 20 minutes of the 60 minute tour on their active shooter protocol. My husband and I just looked at each other. We were like: there\u2019s got to be a better way to do this.\u201d That November, the Nash family put in paperwork for New Zealand visas. \u201cSight unseen,\u201d Nash says. \u201cWe had actually never been here before\u201d. \u2018We can\u2019t ever imagine going back\u2019 For some immigrants, New Zealand\u2019s own social problems can come as something of a surprise. On online discussion boards, expats note some of the downsides: a housing crisis, low wages, painful petrol prices, and a dearth of high-quality dill pickles. \u201cThe housing issues were something that we were aware of \u2013 but did not really sink in until we started looking for our first rental,\u201d Nash says. \u201cThere were some houses that we went into that I felt like I needed a hazmat suit to be at.\u201d \u201cI was surprised that there were gangs,\u201d says Kukahiko. \u201cBut then I met a bunch of them and I was surprised that they were so friendly and normal.\u201d For the most part, however, the country has lived up to their hopes. The Nash family initially promised themselves they\u2019d give it a two year trial period. \u201cWhen two years came and went we were like \u2013 we can\u2019t imagine ever going back,\u201d Nash says. Even the sting of losing same-day delivery has mellowed out into an appreciation, she says for \u201ca much less stressful, \u2018Keeping Up with the Joneses\u2019 lifestyle\u201d. Most of the bugbears are dwarfed by more consequential differences: free healthcare, gun control, a safer place for children. \u201cWe had our baby and at no stage along the way was anyone giving me a $10,000 bill,\u201d Kukahiko says. \u201cI still get emotional thinking about it.\u201d \u201cThen the lack of guns everywhere. The fact that he\u2019s not going to have to learn nursery rhymes \u2026 in the US, friends\u2019 kids are having to learn little nursery rhymes that have mnemonics that remind them what to do in case of an active shooter,\u201d he says. \u201cNo way in hell is my kid going to do that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect. I know it\u2019s not perfect. I know it\u2019s not,\u201d says Kukahiko. \u201cBut I hear the things my friends here complain about and I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh honey. That\u2019s adorable.\u2019\u201d"

            "content": "People with depression are \u201cstagnating\u201d in the UK healthcare system, according to research that suggests many wait years to be diagnosed and then often receive suboptimal treatment. The research, led by scientists at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King\u2019s College London, aimed to assess how real-world care for depression compared with best practice and painted a bleak picture that sees huge numbers go undiagnosed and those with very serious illness are not referred on for specialist care quickly enough. The paper concluded that \u201csubstantial and concerning\u201d gaps in the provision of care meant that, for some, illness persists longer than it should. \u201cThe effective treatment of depression is one of the country\u2019s biggest health challenges that we face right now,\u201d said Prof Allan Young, of King\u2019s College and a senior author of the paper. \u201cHigh rates of missed diagnosis mean that vast swaths of the population cannot get the help that they need, while a lack of follow-ups and access to more specialist care often means that those experiencing severe depression are stuck stagnating on a pathway that is not treating them as effectively as it should.\u201d The study set out to identify gaps in treatment of depression across Europe, with a focus on six individual countries, including the UK, by reviewing evidence from academic papers, databases and from experts in the field. The research suggested that only half of the approximately 30 million people in Europe living with depression are diagnosed. In the UK, researchers found evidence of an eight-year average wait between a person showing initial symptoms and them first contacting a health professional, with some studies finding rates of untreated depression as high as 77%. In the UK, antidepressants and psychological therapies are both offered as first-line treatments and have been shown to be roughly equally effective. Evidence suggests that people often benefit most when they get both treatments simultaneously. However, the latest work suggests that people are given medication at about twice the rate of psychological treatment such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). It is known that about one in five people will not respond to first-line treatments, but the study found a referral rate to secondary care of as low as 5%-6% in some studies. This, the authors said, suggests many may be \u201cstagnating\u201d in primary care, not getting better, but not getting more specialist help either. The idea that mental health services are extremely stretched is not new, but Dr Rebecca Strawbridge, of King\u2019s and first author, said \u201cit was pretty much across the board worse than we expected\u201d. The paper, published in the journal European Psychiatry, includes recommendations for how services could be improved for those with depression, including longer appointments with a GP, to ensure that people can be properly diagnosed, increasing treatment provision so that the \u201cright\u201d treatment is available to each patient and better follow-up so doctors know how patients have responded. But the authors note: \u201cWe cannot serve those with depression better without additional funded resources and capacity.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-21T11:51:58Z",
            "content": "Ministers will have a year to prepare before cross-examination at the UK\u2019s Covid-19 public inquiry, its chair, Heather Hallett, announced, as she opened what is likely be one of the broadest statutory investigations in the country\u2019s history. The first cross-examinations of the government response to the pandemic, including decisions on lockdowns, maintaining public confidence and handling of scientific advice, will begin in summer 2023, three and a half years after the arrival of coronavirus, which has claimed more than 200,000 lives in the UK. Hearings on the UK\u2019s preparedness will start in late spring 2023, as Lady Hallett said she wanted to move as \u201cspeedily as possible so lessons are learned before another pandemic strikes\u201d. Boris Johnson had been repeatedly criticised by campaigners for the bereaved and Labour for delaying the launch of the inquiry. Hallett said it would scrutinise the \u201cperformance and effectiveness\u201d of central government decision-making and its messaging \u2013 topics likely to expose current and former ministers. The inquiry has powers to compel the production of evidence and appearances of witnesses. Johnson\u2019s official spokesperson said the PM planned to cooperate with the inquiry. \u201cIt was the prime minister who established the inquiry and signed off on the terms of reference,\u201d he said. To make the \u201cdemanding\u201d terms of reference more digestible, Hallett will break the inquiry into modules, with teams investigating and commissioning research on different issues. Hearings will run sequentially, suggesting proceedings could take a number of years. At least eight other modules are likely to follow, but will not be announced until next year. These include: vaccines, therapeutics and anti-viral treatment; the care sector; government procurement and personal protective equipment; testing and tracing; government business and financial responses; health inequalities and the impact of Covid-19; education, children and young persons; and the impact of Covid-19 on public services and other sectors. Hallett, a retired court of appeal judge and a crossbench peer, said people and organisations would have to apply to be core participants for each module. Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, said: \u201cToday was an emotional day for those of us who have lost loved ones and it meant a lot to hear Baroness Hallett recognise the \u2018devastating nature of bereavement\u2019 and the pain we have been through. Hopefully this will be reflected by not making bereaved families go through the stressful and draining process of applying to be core participants in every single module.\u201d Hallett also announced the public would be able to take part through a \u201clistening exercise\u201d, to begin later this year, which would gather the experiences of people most affected and \u201cfrom those whose voices are not always heard\u201d. The responses will be analysed to highlight key themes, but individual accounts will not be investigated, to prevent an already sprawling inquiry from getting out of control. Hallett said she would \u201cneed to be ruthless\u201d and it would be impossible to call every witness, adding that the inquiry must focus on the key issues. But she emphasised that inequalities would be \u201cat the forefront\u201d of the investigation. \u201cThose who have suffered the most want to know if anything could have been done to prevent or reduce their suffering, and that is why this inquiry has been established,\u201d she said. Hearings will take place in different parts of the UK, including in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Hallett said her aim was to be \u201cthorough and efficient, rigorous and fair\u201d. When it came to gathering evidence she would speak out against \u201cpeople or organisations who stand in the way\u201d. Lawyers have already asked the government for assurances it would not block the release of key information amid fears that doing so could expose it to claims for damages from families who lost loved ones. Elkan Abrahamson, head of major inquests and inquiries at Broudie Jackson Canter, who represents bereaved families, said: \u201cIt is of fundamental importance that we have access to all relevant documents and that the government offers full disclosure to the inquiry. The bereaved would regard anything less than full disclosure as a coverup.\u201d"

            "content": "Families bereaved by Covid insisted Boris Johnson must still face justice at the public inquiry into the pandemic as they voiced concern that his resignation would see him make a fortune from writing and speeches while they remained scarred by grief. Johnson\u2019s departure was greeted by relief by people who lost loved ones to the virus over the last two and half years, but the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents more than 4,000 affected families, said: \u201cJohnson will always be the man that wanted to \u2018let the bodies pile high\u2019 while our loved ones desperately fought for their lives and that partied whilst we had to say goodbye to our loved ones over a screen.\u201d The prime minister was responsible for a delayed start to the statutory public inquiry into the UK\u2019s handling of the pandemic, which was only formally opened last week despite his earlier pledge in parliament to start in spring 2022. \u201cThe Covid inquiry has only just been given the go ahead \u2013 two and a half years late,\u201d said Lindsay Jackson, who lost her mother Sylvia Jackson to Covid on 17 April 2020. \u201cI want to see people held to account \u2013 including Johnson \u2013 for the callous disregard he showed to my mum and the other souls who lost their lives.\u201d \u201cThis is a man who has presided over the deaths of 200,000 people, broken the laws he made, lied repeatedly to us, trashed our international reputation and has brought politics and politicians into disrepute,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s very little more that he could have done wrong. But he\u2019s just losing his job. He\u2019ll lick his wounds, blame everyone else and then make his millions. That\u2019s not justice.\u201d Leshie Chandrapala, who lost her father Ranjith Chandrapala, a London bus driver who worked without PPE, in May 2020, said she was disappointed that Johnson\u2019s handling of the pandemic was not among the reasons for his departure. \u201cWe need Boris Johnson to go immediately so that the business of serious government can resume, including the public inquiry into the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cHe absolutely must not be allowed to stay until autumn as a caretaker PM.\u201d She added: \u201cHe got so many things wrong during the pandemic, so I absolutely want to see him held to account at the public inquiry. I am putting my faith in Baroness Hallett and her team to uncover the truth of Boris Johnson\u2019s actions.\u201d The inquiry has started gathering evidence and is expected to be divided into several strands, many of which will examine decision-making in Downing Street. Hearings are not expected to begin until 2023. In recent days Johnson allies have repeated his assertion that he \u201cgot the big calls right\u201d on the pandemic, often citing the successful vaccination programme. But Lobby Akinnola, who lost his father Olufemi, a care worker, in April 2020, said: \u201cWhile Johnson will move on to a life of writing newspaper columns and being paid eyewatering amounts to give after dinner speeches, there will be no moving on for the families like mine that have been ripped apart by his actions. Although his reign will shortly be coming to an end, his devastating impact on families like mine will not. \u201cWe can only hope that the Covid inquiry will bring some closure for us, teaching us the lessons that will save lives in the future and meaning that no one will be able to repeat Johnson\u2019s terrible mistakes and get away with it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-16T10:25:43Z",
            "content": "The Australian Medical Association has welcomed the federal government\u2019s backflip on emergency Covid payments, and says they should stay in place as long as necessary. \u201cThey should never have been removed,\u201d president Omar Khorshid said. Covid patients will have access to the payments until the end of September, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, announced on Saturday. Albanese was under pressure over the decision to end the $750 payment for those who do not have access to sick leave, and reversed that decision after Saturday\u2019s snap national cabinet meeting. He said the initial decision to end the payments was the former government\u2019s and that circumstances had changed. A new Covid wave had begun, and would peak in August, he said, adding that the government had responded to health advice and would ensure vulnerable people were looked after. \u201cI want to make sure that people aren\u2019t left behind, that vulnerable people are looked after and that no one is faced with the unenviable choice of not being able to isolate properly without losing an income,\u201d he said. The payment will be available from Wednesday until 30 September, with the costs covered 50-50 with the states. \u201cWe need these supports to be in place as long as they\u2019re necessary to support Australians doing the right thing,\u201d Khorshid said. \u201cThey supported the most vulnerable of our workers from being able to do the right thing, to keep off work for a full week after a positive diagnosis for Covid to help protect their co-workers and other people in a workplace from contracting the disease. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the support in place to do that, how can you expect people to could the right thing?\u201d Khorshid also welcomed the announcement that telehealth appointments will be available to people who may need access to antiviral drugs until the end of October, but said the move didn\u2019t go far enough. The government announced in June that a range of telehealth services would no longer be provided. \u201cThe reality is that many Australians who don\u2019t have access to video calls do need to access their doctor, whether they be a specialist or a dental practitioner, by telehealth and as of 1 July, around 70 item numbers were cut from Medicare that allowed access to telehealth and none of those have been reinstated,\u201d Khorshid said. The AMA president also said that if reintroducing mask mandates became necessary, such a move should be supported by state and territory leaders as well as the federal government, and that while other countries have shortened the Covid isolation period to five days, the evidence showed people were still infectious for up to seven days. Concession card holders will no longer be automatically eligible for 10 free RATs through the existing scheme, but Albanese said there were other federal and state schemes in place to provide free tests to the vulnerable. Albanese arrived back in the country on Friday from the Pacific Islands Forum and called a snap meeting with state and territory leaders for Saturday morning. The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, briefed the PM on Friday, then spoke at the national cabinet meeting. He briefed leaders on the new Covid variants, the impact on the health system and hospitals, and the increased number of people receiving their fourth shot, and antiviral treatments. Albanese said national cabinet would continue to meet every two to three weeks as the winter surge hits. \u201cAll of the premiers and chief ministers as well as the commonwealth understand that we need to get the health outcomes right in order to protect people\u2019s health and also to protect our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get the health outcomes right, you protect jobs and protect the economy. We are all committed to that. The really positive thing as well today is [we are] working towards a much more consistent national approach.\u201d Albanese said there was \u201cincreased access\u201d to rapid antigen tests. \u201cStates and territories are making sure that they are available as well as the commonwealth through various measures that we have,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of the first ministers also agreed that jurisdictions will utilise existing rapid antigen test stocks funded through these arrangements.\u201d Albanese and his ministers had argued that the payments and distribution of free RATs were always going to be discontinued after being implemented by the former Coalition government, and that the $1tn budget debt meant the spending could not continue indefinitely. The health minister, Mark Butler, argued during the week that emergency payments had to be reconsidered as the pandemic entered the \u201cnext phase\u201d. But as the latest Covid surge began and Butler warned that millions of people would be infected, health experts, state leaders, unions and others demanded that the measures should be kept in place. Albanese said they would reverse the decision \u201cinherited from the former government\u201d. Albanese also urged people to get their booster shots, and to talk to their doctors about accessing antivirals. He said the current Covid surge would peak in August, and that mask wearing in crowded indoor areas was highly encouraged. People should continue to get tested, practise \u201cgood respiratory hygiene\u201d and work from home where appropriate, he said. \u201cThese measures are important. We will get through this.\u201d Albanese had come under fire for suggesting sick people should just work from home, a measure that is not available to many employees. He then announced the national cabinet would meet on Monday to consider pandemic support, but on Friday brought the meeting forward to Saturday. Acting opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said the Albanese\u2019s reinstatement of the Covid payments was welcome, but that it took \u201cuniversal criticism\u201d for the prime minister act. \u201cHe owes an apology to every single Australian who has recently tested positive for Covid-19, needed his government\u2019s support, and didn\u2019t get it,\u201d she said. The payments will be backdated to 1 July. Shadow health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, accused Albanese of being \u201cout of touch\u201d, and said he was forced to restore the payments by the state leaders, health experts and \u201cour most vulnerable Australians\u201d. Prof Brendan Crabb, from the Burnet Institute, earlier called on the government to endorse a \u201clow Covid\u201d strategy, to keep numbers down to protect the vulnerable, and everyone else. He told Channel Seven that there had been a mindset that \u201clots of Covid is OK\u201d, and that had proved to be a \u201cflawed strategy\u201d."

            "date": "2022-07-10T06:00:27Z",
            "content": "When Susan Sullivan died from Covid-19, her parents\u2019 world fell quiet. She would no longer burst into her dad\u2019s room at dawn to say: \u201cMorning, chief! Sun\u2019s shining!\u201d And when songs would play by Abba, Queen or Kylie, she was no longer there to blast out the words. But as John and Ida Sullivan battled the pain of losing their eldest, they were comforted by doctors\u2019 assurance that they had done all they could. It was not until more than a year later, when they received her medical records, that the family made a crushing discovery. These suggested that, despite Susan being in good health and responding well to initial treatments, doctors at Barnet hospital had concluded she wouldn\u2019t pull through. When Susan was first admitted on 27 March 2020, a doctor had written in her treatment plan: \u201cITU (Intensive therapy unit) review if not improving\u201d, indicating he believed she might benefit from a higher level of care. But as her oxygen levels fell and her condition deteriorated, the 56-year-old was not admitted to the intensive unit. Instead she died in her bed on the ward without access to potentially life-saving treatment others received. In the hospital records, seen by the Observer, the reason Susan was excluded is spelled out: \u201cITU declined in view of Down\u2019s syndrome and cardiac comorbidities.\u201d A treatment plan stating she was not to be resuscitated also cites her disability. For John, 79, a retired builder, that realisation was \u201clike Susan dying all over again\u201d. \u201cThe reality is that doctors gave her a bed to die in because she had Down\u2019s syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me it couldn\u2019t be clearer: they didn\u2019t even try.\u201d Susan is one of thousands of disabled people in Britain killed by Covid-19. Last year, a report by the Learning Disabilities Mortality Review Programme found that almost half those who died from Covid-19 did not receive good enough treatment, including problems accessing care. Of those who died from Covid-19, 81% had a do-not-resuscitate decision, compared with 72% of those who died from other causes. The Covid public inquiry will examine triage processes used in the NHS and allegations that, amid pressures on staffing, beds and PPE, access to intensive care in some areas was rationed. The government and NHS deny that ever happened, but testimony from families such as Susan\u2019s suggest otherwise. Elkan Abrahamson, the human rights lawyer representing Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, which knows of many similar cases, said: \u201cOur concern is that some disabled people were written off.\u201d For Susan\u2019s parents it is the fear that medics made a snap judgment because of her disability that plays most on their minds. Her records say her disability and \u201ccardiac comorbidities\u201d \u2013 a pacemaker that had been implanted for a heart valve condition diagnosed at 16 \u2013 meant CPR was \u201cunlikely to be successful\u201d. But Susan\u2019s family, from Edgware, say she had \u201cno physical problems\u201d and the pacemaker was preventive. By itself it would not rule out resuscitation and, they say, it shouldn\u2019t have excluded her from care for Covid. For years John and Ida backed Susan when others didn\u2019t. At her birth they were told she would never walk or talk. But with their encouragement she learned to do both, and later to dance, sing and swim, going on to compete in the Special Olympics. \u201cWe decided: we\u2019re going to ignore what they\u2019ve told us and treat her as normal,\u201d John said. Before contracting the virus, she was as active as ever. But by the end of March 2020, at the height of the first wave, her spark began to dim. Susan\u2019s symptoms \u2013 a cough, headache and tiredness \u2013 had initially been mild. But on 26 March, she began suffering stomach pains. \u201cShe was saying: \u2018Mummy mummy mummy, my tummy hurts\u2019,\u201d Ida said. At 4.50am on 27 March, they dialled 999. What followed was a \u201cnightmare\u201d. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) was overwhelmed, with 187 calls in the hour Susan\u2019s family called 999 \u2013 three times the usual volume. The family say they were told the ambulance was diverted twice. In all, it took more than seven hours to come. \u201cAll Susan kept saying was: \u2018Where are they? I\u2019m waiting, Chief.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how many times I said to her: \u2018They won\u2019t be long, darling\u2019,\u201d John said. When the paramedics arrived at lunchtime, they gave Susan oxygen and rushed her to hospital. Ida accompanied her daughter but was told she couldn\u2019t stay. In the five minutes she was allowed, she says a doctor asked if Susan had anything in place for resuscitation. \u201cI said: \u2018No, it\u2019s never come up. And if she needed it, we would want you to\u2019,\u201d Ida, 77, said. After Ida left, Susan deteriorated. The next day, the hospital called to say she kept removing her oxygen mask. \u201cPatient desaturates to 82% without mask, however if held then oxygen improves,\u201d her notes say. Susan\u2019s family repeatedly asked if a relative could sit with her to hold the mask but were told it wasn\u2019t possible. In a frantic phone call, Ida tried to soothe Susan. \u201cI said to her: \u2018It\u2019s Mummy, sweetie. Please keep your mask on, it\u2019ll help you get better.\u2019 And she just said: \u2018Mummy, Mummy, I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 The next phone call was to say she was critical.\u201d At 3.10pm on 28 March, Susan died. Her brother Clifford, who had been allowed into the hospital in her final moments, was by her side. John and Ida were unable to attend her funeral due to government restrictions so they paid tribute to Susan at home, joined by neighbours who stood on their doorsteps to sing and share memories. Today, Ida still cannot face going into Susan\u2019s bedroom and John, who has late-stage neuroendocrine cancer, is reduced to tears when describing the impact of Susan\u2019s loss. As well as grief, Susan\u2019s family feel anger. They believe the hospital\u2019s refusal to let a relative stay amounts to a failure to make \u201creasonable adjustments\u201d \u2013 which are legally required to ensure health services are accessible for disabled people \u2013 and that the decision to deny her ICU was because of her disability. \u201cHad that adjustment been made, and had she been given access to intensive care, there\u2019s a chance she could have survived,\u201d John said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t given a fair crack. That will haunt us until the day we die.\u201d In a statement, the LAS apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d for the delays and said it was experiencing \u201cunprecedented levels of demand\u201d. \u201cAll triaging decisions were based entirely on clinical need,\u201d David Macklin, deputy chief medical officer, said. Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust said it took the concerns raised \u201cvery seriously\u201d and offered its \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to Susan\u2019s family, whom it invited to make a formal complaint. John and Ida hope the public inquiry leads to answers about decisions made behind hospital doors, but they don\u2019t blame the doctors and nurses. Instead they want the government held to account \u2013 for its decision making around pandemic preparation, management of NHS resources, and treatment of disabled people since austerity measures began in 2010. \u201cWhen Boris Johnson says: \u2018We put our arms around everybody\u2019, that wasn\u2019t the case with disabled people,\u201d John said. \u201cThey never put their arms around my Susan.\u201d"

But unlike previous years, governments have largely resisted bringing in mask mandates or restrictions on hospitality and other public venues, leaving people to navigate the pandemic without strict rules. To get a picture of how the country is living, we spoke to six Australians about pandemic burnout and which regulations they are still following. Leanne, 46, Vic Leanne has had three doses of the vaccine and caught the virus once. At this stage, she is not letting the pandemic stop her from doing anything. \u201cI\u2019m not being cautious about contracting Covid. I don\u2019t see it as being as serious as the health organisations are making it out to be,\u201d Leanne says. She was recently a passenger onboard the P&amp;O Pacific Explorer, which had a Covid outbreak, but she says as the virus is everywhere, she does not want it to stop her \u201cenjoying getting out and about\u201d. \u201cMy family have done most of our travelling during Covid. I enjoy having something to look forward to and haven\u2019t been concerned about contracting Covid,\u201d she says. \u201cCrowds don\u2019t faze me, I think the public naturally space themselves out now which is a good thing.\u201d As she works in disability, Leanne wears a mask at her job, and thinks during winter, they should be worn out of the house in public to help bring cases down. She says she is \u201cabsolutely\u201d sick of Covid but wants to continue travelling and making memories with her family. \u201cAll in all, I will continue to travel as much as I can, providing I can get the time off work, will continue to cruise \u2013 I have another four cruises booked and am researching a further cruise.\u201d Karen Sorensen, 63 and Ken McLeod, 74, retired, NSW Karen and Ken are both cautious \u2013 they follow the rules, wear masks, avoid crowds and when eating out, they do it in off-peak times. \u201cWe both follow rules. We\u2019re vulnerable ourselves \u2013 I\u2019m in my 70s, our friends are in that age group,\u201d Ken says. Ken says he was concerned about the lack of mask-wearing, disappointed to see more people in Sydney weren\u2019t putting them on in crowds and annoyed at the government for not mandating them. \u201cWe\u2019re a little disappointed in government responses. At the beginning of the pandemic, all governments says they would follow the chief health officers\u2019 advice, and they are not doing it.\u201d He is also concerned about the daily death toll from Covid. \u201cIf that happened in a plane crash there would be heads rolling, a royal commission, grandstanding in parliament. There\u2019s a Covid fatigue.\u201d Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Karen\u2019s parents haven\u2019t left the house since November last year, as her father is in palliative care. \u201cI think the perspective has changed. People think I\u2019ve had my immunisations, or I\u2019ve had Covid, if I catch it again I catch it again, without thinking about the people who still need protection,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t really understand if you\u2019ve got an elderly relative or an immunocompromised, you\u2019re still as frightened as you were in the beginning.\u201d Elly Bruin, 32, barista, Melbourne Bruin has stopped reading the news as it makes her too anxious. The barista wears a mask in crowded places, on public transport and indoors \u2013 but tries not to think about Covid. \u201cIt is just that feeling of Covid fatigue; it\u2019s another year of it happening,\u201d she says. \u201cI tend to stay at home a lot, but that reflects my pre-pandemic life. I\u2019m doing the things of wearing a mask on public transport and being respectful in that setting but I think I am just living my life as normal. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t stopped me from doing anything. I have booked a bunch of tickets to the film festival in August and I am going away, so there\u2019s this part of me that worries I will get Covid.\u201d Professor Mike Toole, epidemiologist, 75, Melbourne Toole describes his lifestyle as like he is living in 2020. \u201cI\u2019d say, it\u2019s not much different from during lockdowns,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difference is about once a month I go to the local pub and I sit out in the courtyard. I wear a mask when I got to buy a drink.\u201d Apart from the pub, Toole does not eat out and wears a mask when he goes shopping. \u201cThe local supermarket has a smaller butcher \u2013 today I peeked in the windows there was no one there so I didn\u2019t wear a mask in, but at the supermarket I did.\u201d Toole has been overseas twice this year but says with the current wave he would not go to an airport. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most dangerous places to be: no windows, people standing in line, not everyone wearing a mask.\u201d He says there needs to be clear messaging for politicians: masks need to be worn by everyone and if people can, they should get their fourth jab. \u201cI think there\u2019s just a lot of confusion at the moment. We\u2019re getting different messages from the CHO, from politicians. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to change the level of fatigue. We need leadership, clarity.\u201d Mia* 27, nurse, Melbourne Mia, who asked not to use her real name as nurses are not allowed to speak to the media, says they feel guilty if they even go to a gig. \u201cI am being really mindful, not doing a lot of social stuff; I find the social stuff I do comes with guilt,\u201d Mia says. For them, avoiding Covid also means looking after their patients and keeping their colleagues safe. \u201cWe are getting more and more Covid patients in the hospital every day. It takes such a toll.\u201d Mia says if they are hanging out with mates, they would discuss mask-wearing first, and if it is a bigger event they would do a rapid antigen test beforehand. \u201cA lot of people I know have gotten Covid in the past few weeks,\u201d Mia says. \u201cPeople are getting reinfections. So we\u2019re definitely being mindful of it. \u201cI don\u2019t love talking about it all the time; when you work in it, it gets exhausting.\u201d Being on the frontline in 2020 was different. There were countless articles about health care workers, and heaps of appreciation \u2013 but now, Mia says it\u2019s lonely. \u201cIt feels really isolating, because everyone wants to get on with their lives,\u201d they say."

            "title": "Pushing Buttons: Is it game over for gaming\u2019s pandemic boom?",
            "date": "2022-07-12T11:02:07Z",
            "content": "During the pandemic, video games have had an unprecedented boom while pretty much every other cultural sector \u2013 from music and nightlife to theatre and cinema \u2013 have tanked. With everyone stuck inside looking for ways to alleviate their boredom and socialise safety, it is no wonder that the global games market grew from $150bn in 2019 to $180bn in 2020 (\u00a3). Millions of people bought consoles (the Nintendo Switch especially saw a huge surge); and some of us who already had consoles felt like a shiny new PlayStation 5, say, might alleviate the pandemic blues for a while. Every facet of gaming, from mobile to consoles, Twitch viewership to concurrent Steam player numbers, was given a boost. It\u2019s also hardly surprising, then, that the games industry is now facing a contraction. Growth continued throughout 2021, up to around $190bn, but is now predicted by market analysts to decline by a few billion. The games industry\u2019s revenue is expected to start climbing again from 2023, however, past its pandemic peak. I see this as a natural correction. People are playing less, and spending less, for a variety of reasons \u2013 from increases in the cost of living to gaming fatigue after many months spent mostly indoors. I\u2019ve been playing significantly less myself this year, now that I can do other things that I enjoy again, like live music and, y\u2019know, hugging my friends. (I have fond memories of the birthday parties and summer gatherings that we had in Animal Crossing, but they can feel a bit like a melancholy dream.) Games are often considered to be recession-proof, but the industry is not impervious to macroeconomic turmoil. Some ebb and flow is natural, even if it spooks those investors who are hoping to make a quick buck out of a fad, whether that\u2019s esports, virtual and augmented reality, free-to-play mobile games or the latest venture capital money pit, blockchain gaming. The rest of us needn\u2019t worry: constant massive growth is demanded, because \u2026 capitalism, but it\u2019s unsustainable. The number of gamers in the world keeps going up, as smartphones, PCs and consoles become available to more of the world\u2019s population \u2013 but that will stop, eventually. And when things level out, whenever that is \u2013 and it\u2019s probably still a decade or more in the future \u2013 it will not be such a bad thing. The money that video games make is, for me, one of the least interesting things about them. And one day, I hope that what seems like every mainstream TV or radio report about video games doesn\u2019t begin by pointing out that they generate more cash than movies. It is interesting, though, to look at where the money is in gaming. The console market \u2013 PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox \u2013 has remained pretty stable for well over a decade. It\u2019s mobile gaming that has really driven the industry\u2019s expansion since about 2010, as smartphones have proliferated. Arcades, meanwhile, once generated $40bn in revenue and now generate zip. Handheld games were once a huge slice of the market, but have mostly vanished since Nintendo folded its home consoles and handheld consoles together in the form of the Switch. Analysts are now looking at subscriptions and cloud gaming as the next big shift, having seen how streaming tech has transformed TV and music. How people play games has changed enormously in the 50 years since Pong ushered in the era of video games \u2013 but it is clear that people pretty much always want to play them, even \u2013 or perhaps especially \u2013 when times are hard. What to play Developer superstar Yu Suzuki \u2013 of Space Harrier, OutRun and Shenmue fame in the 1980s and 90s \u2013 has released a game on Apple Arcade: Air Twister. It\u2019s an arcade shooter that feels like Lylat Wars, Panzer Dragoon or Rez, the mid-2000s-style Space Harrier sequel that never was. I\u2019m not recommending this unreservedly \u2013 it is strange to get the hang of \u2013 but it\u2019s an interesting curio for anyone who loved the Sega arcade era, and the prog-rock soundtrack is irresistibly bombastic. Available on: Apple Arcade (iPhone, iPad) Estimated play time: 2+ hours What to read E3 is coming back next year \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be run by ReedPop, the business that handles PAX and Comic-Con, and owns the games websites Eurogamer and Rock Paper Shotgun. My overall read on this: good news. The ESA, which owns and runs E3, has a history of \u2026 variable competency, having once accidentally doxxed most of its attendees, and having the show in the hands of a company that regularly runs such mega-events is promising. Given that the big players (Sony, Nintendo, Xbox) have shown little interest in E3 for some time \u2013 and even less in European games show Gamescom despite its 350,000-plus attendees \u2013 it might not matter who\u2019s in charge. In bizarre Elden Ring news this week, Namco Bandai has sent a real sword to a player who\u2019s famous for helping people through one of the game\u2019s most fearsome bosses, and also, someone has completed it on a piano. The latter story particularly tickles me. I co-wrote a book about Dark Souls a while back (I know, I never mention it), and one of my favourite chapters to write was the one about the people who do completely unnecessary and highly impressive things like playing it with Guitar Hero controllers, or without ever levelling up, or entirely naked (the character, not the player). I love how humans can\u2019t seem to help themselves when it comes to inventing bizarre ways to play already-difficult video games. Activision-Blizzard\u2019s employees are protesting again, this time for better protections for their civil liberties in the face of the terrifying rollback of rights in the US, including to abortion access and gender-affirming healthcare. Popular Minecraft YouTuber Technoblade sadly died recently \u2013 he was only 23, and his father put up a heartbreaking final video on his channel. Minecraft developer Mojang has come up with an in-game tribute to him. PlayStation 5\u2019s next blockbuster God of War: Ragnarok is going to be released on 9 November. Well, at least that\u2019s one big game to look forward to before 2023. Question block Today\u2019s question comes from Creg: Is the Xbox Series S worth the money? Before I get into this: can we all take a moment to marvel at how deranged the Xbox range\u2019s nomenclature has become? We\u2019ve got the Xbox One, the Xbox Series X, the Xbox Series S, the Xbox One X, all of which are different. It is impressively confusing. Anyway! In a word: yes, it\u2019s worth it. With GamePass, which gives you every Xbox game you\u2019d ever want to play for \u00a310.99 a month, the Xbox Series S is really good value. Its big brother, the Xbox Series X, is really only necessary if you have a screen that can properly take advantage of 4K games. You mentioned in your email to me that you\u2019re not fussed about that, and that you don\u2019t mind downloading or streaming games instead of buying them on disc. You\u2019ll run out of space on the Series S hard drive pretty quickly, but as Microsoft\u2019s cloud-streaming tech gets better and better, I reckon that won\u2019t be such an issue. Send me more questions everyone! Even if they\u2019re silly. In fact, especially if they\u2019re silly."

            "date": "2022-07-15T01:17:07Z",
            "content": "Anthony Albanese has continued to dig in against calls to extend pandemic leave payments, while his ministers have argued states should take up the slack from the federal government. But Albanese is facing a chorus of calls from both the states, and within his own party, to extend the payments. On Friday, the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said that he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d push for the payments to be reinstated at Monday\u2019s national cabinet meeting. Albanese was due to leave the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji on Friday, flying back into a storm of controversy, with unions, many states and some Labor MPs calling to extend pandemic payments to help casual workers self-isolate and prevent the spread of Covid. Albanese has agreed to a request from the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, for a national cabinet meeting which will be held on Monday, with pandemic leave and the end to free federal rapid antigen tests for concession card-holders key agenda items. On Friday, the prime minister opened the door to possible changes by noting \u201cwe\u2019ll give consideration to all of these issues\u201d, but repeated his defence that Labor \u201cinherited these decisions\u201d along with $1tn of debt. \u201cThere was enormous waste there in the budget; had, for example, the government not given literally tens of billions of dollars to companies that were increasing their profits, there would have been more space in the budget to make the decisions that we would want to make,\u201d Albanese told reporters in Fiji. Albanese argued that \u201ca range of companies who are good employers are providing those systems [of leave]\u201d. \u201cThe idea that no one is getting any sick leave at the moment, it\u2019s just not the case,\u201d he said. Albanese also suggested that \u201cgood employers are recognising that people are continuing to work from home whilst they have Covid and are receiving, therefore, payments through that\u201d. While Perrottet acknowledged the budget pressures from continued pandemic measures \u2013 he indicated his government was open to splitting the cost 50-50 with the commonwealth \u2013 he said it was \u201cunfair\u201d not to continue the payments for casual workers while isolation requirements remained in place. \u201cI\u2019m very open to doing everything we can at the state level to support our people through this next phase of the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is unfair that [that when] the state imposes public health orders on people to restrict their liberty and their capacity to work for the government to not provide financial support.\u201d The health minister, Mark Butler, told Radio National the public \u201cwants the country to move to a new phase in confronting this pandemic\u201d. Butler said that \u201cinevitably\u201d after the government withdrew \u201cmandates around people\u2019s behaviour\u201d it had to reconsider \u201cvery large emergency payments\u201d. Pandemic leave support payments were not included in the chief medical officer\u2019s advice about limiting the spread of Covid, he said. On Wednesday Butler said \u201cmillions\u201d of Australians would contract Covid in coming weeks. Already there are 4,000 people in hospital and several hundred deaths every week. On Friday the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, said the commonwealth wanted \u201cto work with all the state and territory leaders to ensure that we can provide all the available support to Australian workers and businesses who are doing it tough\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and solve the issues that are pressing upon Australian workers and businesses, but we\u2019ve got some real economic realities facing us,\u201d he told ABC News Breakfast. Jones said Albanese would be \u201clooking for solutions\u201d and noted that many of the states and territories calling for pandemic leave payments to be extended \u201chave actually got less debt and healthier balance sheets and healthier budgets \u2013 some of them are approaching a surplus, something that the Commonwealth won\u2019t be doing any time in the next couple of years\u201d. Some states and territories have moved to plug the gap created by the commonwealth ending its free rapid antigen test scheme for concession card holders from 31 July. New South Wales has extended access to free rapid tests to 31 October. The Tasmanian premier, Jeremy Rockliff, and Labor opposition leader in NSW, Chris Minns, have joined unions in calling for the pandemic leave payment to be extended. On Thursday, Labor MPs Mike Freelander and Michelle Ananda-Rajah, both doctors, called for the payments to be extended. On Friday the shadow health minister, Anne Ruston, defended the Coalition\u2019s decision to put an expiry date on temporary supports, by arguing the Morrison government had responded to conditions at the time but was always guided by health advice. \u201cWhat we\u2019re questioning is the timing of the removal of these Covid supports as we\u2019re just heading into what the medical experts are saying is a very dangerous wave,\u201d she told Radio National. Ruston called on the government to explain \u201cwhy it\u2019s a good idea now to remove these supports\u201d at the same time as it was warning of more infections. \u201cIs the decision being made by the government based on the health advice?\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-24T06:15:02Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s biggest care home chains saw their profit margins jump by 18% on average during the pandemic, new research shows, while the highest paid director\u2019s salary surged to \u00a32.3m. Amid a social care staffing crisis, and warnings from medical leaders that the system is \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and in need of urgent reform, analysis seen by the Observer lays bare the financial successes of major providers caring for elderly and disabled people. The research \u2013 by the Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity at Surrey University and Trinava Consulting with the trade union Unison \u2013 found that six of the 10 biggest adult social care providers for whom data was available saw their underlying profit margins widen between 2019 and 2020, the first year of the pandemic. The biggest rise was at Runwood Homes, where the underlying profit margin widened by 37% in 2020, and which reported a profit before tax of \u00a325.4m, up from \u00a315m the year before, according to the research. A quarter of its homes are rated as requiring improvement by the Care Quality Commission. The highest margin \u2013 41.7% \u2013 was at Avery Healthcare, up from 39.8% in 2019 and 32.5% in 2015. The company, which runs 56 care homes in the UK, was recently acquired by the Reuben Brothers, named as Britain\u2019s second richest family with an estimated fortune of \u00a321.5bn, in the company\u2019s first investment in the senior care sector. A press release in March said the deal \u2013 a joint venture with US real estate investment trust Welltower Inc \u2013 was expected to \u201cgenerate significant future growth opportunities\u201d. The findings will fuel concerns about profiteering by private providers despite the pressures of Covid, and come amid reports of cost-cutting at some chains, and continued low pay for many staff. Vivek Kotecha, public policy consultant and director of Trinava, which carried out the analysis, said: \u201cDuring the pandemic there was a sense of national solidarity and sacrifice that was needed. I think people will be surprised to see that some companies actually appear to have done really well out of the pandemic.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat it shows is that these businesses have high expectations for maintaining profitability, and workers and residents are feeling the brunt of this pressure.\u201d As well as widening profit margins, some providers also increased pay for their top executives during the pandemic, despite Covid pressures and the staffing crisis in social care, according to the research. Runwood\u2019s multimillionaire owner Gordon Sanders received an extra \u00a32m in dividends in 2020, taking \u00a33m that year compared with \u00a31m in 2019. The company accepted \u00a32m in taxpayer-funded furlough pay and Covid grants over the same period, according to Companies House records. The highest-paid director across the providers, at Barchester Healthcare, was paid \u00a32.27m in 2020 \u2013 up from \u00a32.02m in 2019 and \u00a3699,000 in 2015. Posts for care workers at Barchester, which is owned by Jersey-based Grove Limited, were last week being advertised for \u00a39.90 an hour, just above minimum wage. The findings come amid warnings that the social care sector is in crisis. The British Medical Association warned in June of a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d and said years of chronic underfunding, severe staffing shortages and a growing elderly population meant that many in the future, particularly the most deprived, would not get the care they need. \u201cThis situation has been exacerbated by the pandemic, and government proposals to shape the future of social care have fallen significantly short of what is needed,\u201d it said. Last month, a report by Unison highlighted the growing role of private equity in the sector, finding that more than one in nine (12%) care beds in the UK were now in the hands of investment firms. It also revealed cost-cutting at several unnamed firms, including allegations of food and cleaning products being replaced with cheaper substitutes and residents\u2019 meals being reduced from three to two a day. Christina McAnea, the Unison general secretary, said: \u201cThe sector is on its knees, staff are leaving in their droves and those who rely on care are getting a raw deal. Yet many care home owners continue to see their financial fortunes soar amid this crisis. Root-and-branch reform is needed now with profiteering removed from social care.\u201d Avery Healthcare and Runwood Homes declined to comment. Barchester Healthcare said that it was investing in care homes and that staff received regular pay rises and loyalty bonuses. \u201cIn the six years from 2015 to 2020 inclusive, we invested a total of some \u00a356m in capital expenditure on property and improvements of our services, to ensure that residents are living and staff are working in the best possible conditions,\u201d it said. It added that the \u00a32.3m figure given in company accounts for the highest paid director included a \u201cnon-recurring payment related to a long-term incentive plan\u201d, and not just salary."

Rare orcas spotted for first time in Victorian waters A rare type of orca has been spotted for the first time in Victorian waters, according to the ABC. About 15 Type C orcas cavorted around a whale-watching boat off the Gippsland coast. Apparently they usually hang out closer to Antarctica, are smaller than other types, and they \u201chave a very distinctive and dramatically slanted eye patch\u201d. And these killer whales eat fish, not mammals. Climate change is the \u201csingle greatest threat\u201d to the wellbeing and security of the Pacific Islands, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has told a G20 meeting in Indonesia. AAP reports that Chalmers made a special mention of Australia\u2019s Pacific neighbours in an address to global finance ministers. G20 finance ministers and central bank governors have gathered at a summit in Bali, where Chalmers described ambitious action on climate as a generational imperative. An upgraded electricity grid supporting more renewable energy and \u201cpredictable\u201d framework for industry to decarbonise will help Australia meet its 2030 emissions reduction target of 43% below 2005 levels, Chalmers said: We\u2019re also working with our Pacific partners, recognising that climate change is the single greatest threat to their wellbeing and their security. We want to be part of a more vibrant, sustainable finance agenda in our region which reflects the different needs and opportunities for individual countries and for the region at large. The comments follow a Pacific Islands Forum summit in which leaders declared a climate emergency. While the newly elected Australian government\u2019s stronger position on climate was welcomed, some leaders in the region have publicly pushed for greater action. \u201cAustralia\u2019s new climate pledge is a step-up that Fiji has long sought \u2013 but out of the duty I owe every young person in the Pacific, I have urged @AlboMP to go further for our family\u2019s shared future by aligning Australia\u2019s commitment to the 1.5-degree target,\u201d Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, tweeted on Wednesday. Chalmers also used the speech to acknowledge the former Liberal finance minister Mathias Cormann, who is now the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. He said: A key priority for the new Australian government is introducing clear and globally-aligned climate reporting requirements for large businesses and financial institutions. I look forward to joining with a big group of countries represented here who are developing stronger requirements for disclosure of climate risks and opportunities. GPs, like the Australian Medical Association, are calling for more telehealth consultations to be made available: Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 77 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 1,104 In hospital: 156 (with 4 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 38 Cases: 11,082 In hospital: 2,024 (with 66 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 1 Cases: 424 In hospital: 61 (with 2 person in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 22 Cases: 5,795 In hospital: 921 (with 14 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 3,863 In hospital: 287 (with 9 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 2 Cases: 1,662 In hospital: 138 (with 5 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 8 Cases: 9,982 In hospital: 802 (with 34 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 6,473 In hospital: 351 (with 17 people in ICU) The chimpanzees at Monarto Safari Park in South Australia have come down with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

The zookeepers were already wearing PPE when working with the chimps, because they (both the chimps and the humans) are susceptible to Covid. Cheers, Natasha May! Especially for the feel-good story. I\u2019m still coming down after this one from earlier in the week: Thanks to everyone following along today, I am handing you back to the wonderful Tory Shepherd who will be with you into the evening! With rising cases, Guardian Australia has updated its Covid-19 data tracker. You can check out the latest figures on daily new Covid-19 cases, as well as stats, charts and live state by state data, as well as numbers on the vaccine rollout and fourth dose booster vaccination rates here: There were 1,662 new cases in the last reporting period, and five people are in intensive care. Small Fry Rock, a children\u2019s concert with a difference If you\u2019re looking for a feel-good read to brighten up this wintry Saturday afternoon, Katie Cunningham has this story about Small Fry Rock, a children\u2019s concert with a difference. It also features the most adorable images from Guardian Australia\u2019s picture editor, Carly Earl. There were 1,104 new cases in the last reporting period, and four people are in intensive care. The Pacific Islands Forum has met for the first time in three years since the Covid pandemic. Guardian Australia\u2019s Pacific editor, Kate Lyons, was in Suva covering the event and brings you this report looking back on the week\u2019s forum. She writes that while leaders presented a picture of harmony, more vexing topics like Australia\u2019s fossil fuel ambitions and China were kicked down the road. The acting opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has continued the Coalition\u2019s criticisms of the government\u2019s handling of pandemic support on the ABC. Ley says: Far too slow and Anthony Albanese today has refused to acknowledge his error. Now we were calling last Sunday for these payments to be reconsidered and it\u2019s now almost a week later ... a flip dragged kicking and screaming to an emergency rushed payment of national cabinet. Of course we welcome the reinstatement of the payments, but this is two weeks after they stopped. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has said that timetable was set in place by the Morrison government and he was simply adhering to what was inherited, but Ley denies the Coalition has any responsibility for the timing of the way the payments have been provided. That\u2019s just another ridiculous excuse from the prime minister. He had the health data. His health minister stood up days ago and said millions of people were going to get Covid. He had the briefings and the information. We\u2019re not sitting at the National Security Committee table. We\u2019re not getting those briefings. He knew, as those payments were concluding, exactly what the health situation was turning into with new waves of Covid. Ley highlights her concern for \u201cthe largely female casualised workforce ... helping our cities, our towns, our health system, our aged care run, helping our restaurants, our retail\u201d. And knowing that they\u2019re on some the lowest wages and, like many of us, they can\u2019t choose to work from home, so putting them in this impossible position is unacceptable and Anthony Albanese needs to apologise to every casual worker who suffered stress as a result of this flip-flopping. AMA says investment in pandemic management is a good investment The government announced pandemic leave payments would be reinstated until the end of September. Khorshid says \u201cwe need these supports to be in place as long as they\u2019re necessary to support Australians doing the right thing\u201d. Whether it will still be necessary at the end of September is a bridge we\u2019ll have to cross at the time. The payments should never have been removed and I think this government is learning new lessons as it gets its feet under the desk \u2013 how important it is to stay in touch with the community, with the experts and others in the community that are giving them advice, and not just to listen to bean-counters and bureaucrats that see any expenditure on health as a waste. What he know, as doctors on the ground and as workers in a healthcare system, is that investment in healthcare and investment in pandemic management is a positive investment for Australia\u2019s health and it will be good investment in time. And that\u2019s one of the key lessons of the pandemic that we must not forget. The Australian Medical Association president, Dr Omar Khorshid, is responding to the national cabinet meeting from Perth. The government announced that telehealth appointments would be available to people who may need access to antiviral drugs until the end of October. Khorshid says that shows \u201cthe government is listening to community concerns and the very deep concern of the medical profession\u201d. However, he says \u201cthe changes on telehealth do not go far enough\u201d. The reality is that many Australians who don\u2019t have access to video calls do need to access their doctor, whether they be a specialist or a dental practitioner, by telehealth, and as of 1 July around 70 item numbers were cut from Medicare that allowed access to telephone telehealth and none of those have been reinstated. The decision to reinstate an item for discussions around antivirals is an important step and it will help Australians access the critically important antiviral medication quickly so they can get that at their pharmacy, get that medication and get it into them as fast as possible following a positive test result, and that\u2019s a good step and it\u2019s an acknowledgement by government that the previous decision was incorrect. But we need to go further and make sure that pandemic settings for telehealth remain. Annastacia Palaszczuk has spoken after today\u2019s meeting of national cabinet. The Queensland premier says she welcomes the isolation payment extension and says Queenslanders are now encouraged to wear masks indoors. Palaszczuk says: You are strongly encouraged to wear your masks indoors. I\u2019ll be wearing my mask indoors and I\u2019m encouraging people to do that as well. Secondly, I strongly endorse the prime minister\u2019s announcement about the joint pandemic leave. This is really important. We know this is impacting on our workforce as well. In terms of if you are in the vulnerable category, you should think about whether or not you go into your workplace, but we are being advised by wearing a mask it is safe to go into work. The other thing we\u2019ll be doing too is making sure we\u2019ve got extra RAT tests going out to schools, making them more available to people as well. I\u2019m strongly encouraging when school goes back on Monday for children to be wearing masks in schools as well as teachers, except where you, of course, can socially distance. Unions welcome government decision on pandemic leave payment Sally McManus, the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), has just fronted the media to respond to the government\u2019s decision to reinstate Covid disaster payments for people isolating. McManus says: The union movement really welcomes the prime minister reinstating paid pandemic leave disaster payments. They\u2019re absolutely essential to support people to isolate if they\u2019re infectious, if they\u2019ve got Covid. It\u2019s great he\u2019s come back into the country and didn\u2019t muck around and that\u2019s he\u2019s got the states together and he\u2019s got this job done. What we\u2019ve got to do at the moment is put in place everything that\u2019s necessary to stop our hospitals being overwhelmed. That\u2019s critically important, about keeping all of us safe. McManus said the decision was important not only for casuals but also workers who might have run out of sick leave. If you have a situation where there\u2019s a big group of workers who don\u2019t get paid leave \u2013 that\u2019s obviously casuals and people on ABNs, but also a lot of people that have run out of paid sick leave, especially if they\u2019ve got kids. If they have to make a choice between their bills and going to work, unfortunately, some will go to work or just won\u2019t get tested. So this is a really essential part of our defences as a country. It\u2019s about supporting everyone. We really welcome that the prime minister is backing workers to keep everyone safe at this time. Flood clean-up continues in NSW Natasha May back with you! The immediate flood emergency in NSW may be over but there is still a long road ahead for communities cleaning up the devastation left behind. The NSW Rural Fire Service has shared this video of clean-up efforts. If you\u2019re wondering where and when you can apply for the payments: Some very muscular military music and manoeuvres here from the Rim of the Pacific (Rimpac) war games: ACTU says extending Covid payments is \u2018right and very welcome decision\u2019 The unions, though, have called the restoration of the payments a \u201cright and very welcome decision\u201d. The Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, says many workers would have been left without employer sick leave: [Prime minister Anthony] Albanese has made the right decision to protect workers and businesses by restoring pandemic leave disaster payments. The previous Morrison government never should have set the finish date in the middle of winter. Bringing back pandemic leave disaster payments is very welcome and means that workers will no longer have to decide between isolating with the virus and putting food on the table for their families. Opposition calls pandemic leave decision an \u2018embarrassing backflip\u2019 Unsurprisingly, the opposition has taken the opportunity to have a crack at Anthony Albanese\u2019s reinstatement of paid pandemic leave. The shadow health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called it an \u201cembarrassing backflip\u201d: Acoss welcomes pandemic leave and crisis payments and looks forward to further cooperation Asked by the ABC what measures could be further introduced Edwina MacDonald, the acting CEO of the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), said: The key thing we saw is the start of the pandemic, we had the coronavirus supplement and increased income support that brought it [the jobseeker payment] above the poverty line. We know that the impact of that payment meant that poverty was half of what it would have been for the winter ... That was overnight and a massive impact on ending poverty. We can do it \u2013 these are policy choices we can make. And we know when the payment was pulled away people were thrust back into poverty \u2013 and we see poverty levels rising. The increased income is really fundamental. MacDonald says there is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a feeling that the new government is responsive to further change and praised the government for including temporary visa holders in the new supports. Certainly [we] would have liked to hear this announcement earlier, but the prime minister and the government has listened and have made this announcement today. There\u2019s another thing I wanted to comment on in terms of the announcement and that is that the federal government is now also including temporary visa holders in the payments and paying for 50% of that \u2013 previously covered by state and territory governments. I think that is really worth noting, that this is something temporary visa holders, who miss out on all social safety nets that we have in Australia, this is something we need to be looking at as well. Tory Shepherd here for a bit, coming to you from Kaurna land in South Australia. Speaking of the middle bottom bit, here are today\u2019s Covid numbers. Sadly another three deaths have been recorded. There are 287 people in hospital, nine in intensive care: Crossbenchers welcome restoration of pandemic leave payment Members of the crossbench are welcoming the government\u2019s restoration of pandemic leave payment. Among them, the new Greens member for Brisbane, Stephen Bates, who continued to work another three shifts in his retail job following his electoral victory. Bates has previously highlighted that retail and hospitality workers are overwhelmingly employed casually and therefore disproportionately disadvantaged by the scrapping of the payments. There were 6,473 new cases in the last reporting period, and 17 people are in intensive care. Health authorities noted that the three deaths date back to 8 July. Acoss welcomes pandemic support but urges long-term solutions to inequality Edwina MacDonald, the acting CEO of the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), has told the ABC she welcomes the announcements from the national cabinet meeting of additional payments for Australians who are struggling. A few things we have heard that are really great \u2013 we heard about the extension of the pandemic leave disaster payments, the crisis payment, the availability of rapid antigen tests \u2013 and all those things are really needed at the moment. However, MacDonald says that while the new short-term pandemic supports are welcome, long-term solutions to issues of inequality are still needed. The pandemic is showing some inadequacies with our income support system and what is possible ... when we are not in a pandemic time because these kinds of pressures continue. The prime minister is open to taking the health advice and looking at what is needed, really committed to making sure no one is left behind. That is really encouraging to hear that. But we know that we do need a longer term solution as well. After days of pressure to extend paid pandemic leave, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has reversed the government\u2019s plan to end the emergency measure. The $750 payment will now continue until 30 September, with the costs covered 50-50 with the states. Telehealth appointments will also be available to people who may need access to antiviral drugs until the end of October. Concession card holders will no longer be automatically eligible for 10 free RATs through the existing scheme, but Albanese said there were other federal and state schemes in place to provide free tests to the vulnerable. Albanese arrived back in the country yesterday from the Pacific Islands Forum and called a snap meeting with state and territory leaders for this morning. The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, briefed the PM on Friday, then spoke at the national cabinet meeting. Albanese said national cabinet would continue to meet every two to three weeks as the winter surge hits. \u201cAll of the premiers and chief ministers as well as the commonwealth understand that we need to get the health outcomes right in order to protect people\u2019s health and also to protect our economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get the health outcomes right, you protect jobs and protect the economy. We are all committed to that. The really positive thing as well today is [we are] working towards a much more consistent national approach.\u201d Albanese said there was \u201cincreased access\u201d to RATs. \u201cStates and territories are making sure that they are available as well as the commonwealth through various measures that we have,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of the first ministers also agreed that jurisdictions will utilise existing rapid antigen test stocks funded through these arrangements.\u201d Albanese and his ministers had argued that the payments and distribution of free RATs were always going to be discontinued after being implemented by the former Coalition government, and that the $1tn budget debt meant the spending could not continue indefinitely. The health minister, Mark Butler, argued during the week that emergency payments had to be reconsidered as the pandemic entered the \u201cnext phase\u201d. But as the latest Covid surge began and Butler warned that millions of people would be infected, health experts, state leaders, unions and others demanded that the measures should be kept in place. Albanese said they would reverse the decision \u201cinherited from the former government\u201d. I want to make sure that people aren\u2019t left behind, that vulnerable people are looked after and that no one is faced with the unenviable choice of not being able to isolate properly without losing an income. Albanese also urged people to get their booster shots, and to talk to their doctors about accessing antivirals. On Friday, the Australian Medical Association national president, Omar Khorshid, said people should be supported to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and isolate when they were sick. Generally the government has extended the measures we continue to need because the pandemic is still here and affecting us. Albanese had come under fire for suggesting sick people should just work from home, a measure that is not available to many employees. He then announced the national cabinet would meet on Monday to consider pandemic support, but on Friday brought the meeting forward to today. Albanese says pandemic payment extension to cost $780m by end of September Albanese says the extension of payments is estimated to cost \u201cjust under $800m\u201d by the end of September 30: Around about $780m to be shared 50-50 between the commonwealth and the states and territories. They will be available from Wednesday morning if people want to apply, they can apply online, or people who can\u2019t claim online will be able to claim by calling 180 22 66. Because it is a new financial year, a number of people have sick leave entitlements that have expired and are ready to go as well. In addition to that, a number of businesses have adjusted to the way that they deal with these issues. It may well be that the cost is less. PM notes increased access to RATs but no change for concession card holders Albanese says there is increased access to supplies of rapid antigen tests, but the state of free rapid antigen tests for concession card holders appears to be unchanged. Also noting the increased access to supplies of rapid antigen tests because the commonwealth has already picked up the tab of the cost of all the rapid antigen tests. And states and territories are making sure that they are available as well as the commonwealth through various measures that we have. All of the first ministers also agreed that jurisdictions will utilise existing rapid antigen test stocks funded through these arrangements. Albanese says indoor mask wearing to be part of health messaging Albanese says indoor mask wearing recommendations will be part of consistent health messaging between the commonwealth and states and territories: The jurisdictions and the commonwealth also agreed to provide that consistent health messaging out of there to encourage Australians to follow the recommendations that were provided by Prof Kelly. These include wearing masks indoors where appropriate, where people are mixing and can\u2019t have social distancing, then that makes sense for that to be highly encouraged. Also getting tested, practising good respiratory hygiene and where it is, where people are contacts or where it is appropriate, for people to work from home. These measures are important. PM announces new temporary telehealth consultation item A new temporary telehealth consultation will also be available, Albanese says: The commonwealth is also agreeing to create a new temporary telehealth item so GPs can spend longer with their patients to assess the suitability for oral Covid-19 antivirals. [Health minister] Mark Butler with the Royal Australian GPs and the AMA yesterday worked through these proposals. We want to make sure that antivirals can be administered where appropriate and in order to do that this temporary telehealth facility is appropriate, it is appropriate it be established. Albanese has also announced the reinstatement of crisis payment national health emergency payments: In addition to that, the government will also reinstate the crisis payment national health emergency payments until the 30th of September. This will ensure that those affected by Covid-19 isolation requirements ... who are in severe financial hardship continue to receive support during the winter period. Albanese confirms pandemic leave payment to be reinstated Albanese has confirmed the reinstatement of pandemic leave disaster payments to the end of September: In recognition of the risks that are associated with the more infectious new variants, we have agreed to reinstate the pandemic leave disaster payment to September 30 of this year. I want to make sure that people aren\u2019t left behind, that vulnerable people are looked after and that no one is faced with the unenviable choice of not being able to isolate properly without losing an income and without being put in a situation that is difficult. Going forward, the states and territories have agreed that this payment will be covered 50-50 \u2013 a shared cost with the states and territories. Previously, the states and territories picked up the bill for temporary visa holders \u2013 they will also be shared 50-50. And they picked up the bill for business support \u2013 that was in place and is no longer being provided. This is a fair way. Going forward, all of the states and territories as well as the commonwealth understand that emergency payments are just that. They can\u2019t continue forever, given the physical constraints that are on governments at all levels, but that this is an appropriate measure going forward. Albanese says national cabinet to meet every two to three weeks Albanese has announced a more consistent national approach with the commonwealth to meet with states and territories every two to three weeks. The really positive thing as well today is working towards a much more consistent national approach. That was agreed and indeed, over the coming period up until at least the end of September, the commonwealth will meet with the states and territories in the national cabinet approach every two to three weeks to make sure we are hearing the updated reports from AHPPC [the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee] and to respond, as need be, to make sure our approaches are consistent so people can be clear about the messages which are out there. Albanese has started his press conference following the national cabinet meeting saying there have been \u201cseveral new measures\u201d agreed upon. He says there is good news of strong uptake in the number of people who have received their fourth Covid-19 vaccine, which became available at the beginning of last week. First, we heard from the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, who provided an update of the pandemic, including the new variants and their potential impact and the impact that was having on hospital capacity and the broader health system in Australia. What was very positive was his report about the substantial increase in the number of people receiving their fourth shot, some 400,000 people in recent days. Also the increased use of antivirals. These two measures are absolutely critical. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking following the emergency meeting of the national cabinet to discuss the worrying surge in Covid cases. The snap meeting was originally to take place on Monday but was brought forward to this morning after Albanese was briefed yesterday by the chief health officer, Paul Kelly, and health department secretary, Brendan Murphy. If you missed our Guardian Essential poll at the start of this week, there were two key insights. The first is Australians are in a complicated headspace about Covid. The second is Anthony Albanese\u2019s post-election honeymoon has moderated. By complicated, I mean contradictory. More than half the voters surveyed want to treat Covid like the flu and just get on with normal life. But we don\u2019t like high death rates. We also worry about pressure on hospitals. There were 424 new cases in the last reporting period, and two people are in intensive care. Memorable day for Australian golfers at St Andrews Min Woo Lee has wowed the St Andrews galleries once again to give himself a shot at British Open glory with a dazzling second round at the home of golf, AAP reports. The West Australian excitement machine almost holed out for a rare albatross on Friday en route to a three-under-par 69 to join his celebrated countrymen Cameron Smith and Adam Scott in contention for the Claret Jug. Little more than a month after his older sister Minjee won the Women\u2019s US Open in North Carolina, Lee is making an audacious bid to land a major championship of his own. Gas giant Chevron falls further behind on carbon capture targets for Gorgon gasfield Gas giant Chevron has fallen even further behind on targets to capture and store CO2 at its mega gas project in Western Australian, but has refused to say by how much. The company also confirmed on Friday it had bought and surrendered 5.23m tonnes of CO2 offsets to make up for the failure to meet its 2021 target at its CCS project at the offshore Gorgon gasfield in Western Australia. There were 5,795 new cases in the last reporting period, and 14 people are in intensive care. Prime minister Anthony Albanese to speak at 11.45am Stay tuned for Anthony Albanese\u2019s press conference following the emergency national cabinet meeting will be coming up just before midday today. I\u2019ll bring you the announcements from that presser with Albanese expected to announce that pandemic leave payments for casuals will be reinstated. Widespread frost in NSW this morning The BoM confirming what many of us in NSW and Canberra felt this morning, it\u2019s another cold one but dry conditions in store for the rest of the day. Alcohol bans in Northern Territory lift at midnight tonight The federal Stronger Futures law, which bans alcohol in remote Northern Territory communities, lifts at midnight tonight. The rules affecting Aboriginal communities have been in place for fifteen years. Chansey Paech, the Northern Territory\u2019s attorney general, told the ABC that the end of blanket alcohol bans marks the end of a racist intervention-era law. We have been working across the board, across the Northern Territory with remote Territorians around making sure that they have the information at hand to make a decision of whether they will opt in to remain dry or whether, when those restrictions fall away, they will be able to have alcohol brought into those communities. Damaging winds expected in Victoria A severe weather warning has been issued for Victoria with winds up to 100km/hour predicted over alpine regions from this afternoon. Stay safe Victoria, and possibly cancel any tennis court bookings you had if you\u2019re in the winds path. Almond-geddon avoided thanks to new rules allowing bee movement in NSW and Victoria The varroa mite has not only been a threat to bees in NSW but also the agricultural industries who rely on the mass movement beehives to pollinate their crops. The timing of the outbreak has been particularly bad for the almond industry who require bees to pollinate the national crop in August every year in what is the largest movement of livestock in the country. The NSW government has this morning announced a new plan to allow the movement of beehives for pollination and honey production. Commercial beekeepers will be able to apply for movement permits on Wednesday next week, as long as they are outside of zones impacted by the varroa mite. This news comes after Victorian authorities announced yesterday that they are also introducing a permit system opening Victoria up to interstate beekeepers. Agriculture Victoria will issue permits to Victorian, Queensland and South Australian beekeepers allowing them to enter the Sunraysia region, requiring them to inspect their hives before arriving at Victorian almond orchards. The Victorian authorities yesterday said that bees, hives, equipment and bee products from New South Wales were still prohibited from entering Victoria. You can read more about the varroa mite\u2019s threat to the almond blossom event here: There were 9,982 new cases in the last reporting period, and 34 people are in intensive care. Reinstating pandemic payments is the \u2018right decision\u2019, Steggall says Independent MP Zali Steggall appeared on Channel Nine\u2019s Today Show supporting the move to see casual workers paid while infected with Covid-19, which is expected to be reinstated when the national cabinet meets today. Steggall highlighted that the decision will help businesses struggling with staff shortages. I know it was scheduled to finish but I think in the context of rising numbers, and we are in the peak of winter, I think it would be the right decision to reverse that and maintain those payments. We have to be aware that our businesses are really struggling with staff shortages so they just can\u2019t afford to have people coming in sick and making the rest of their workforce more sick. But also obviously cost of living is really impacting families so casual workers need to be able to isolate and still put food on the table. There were 11,082 new cases in the last reporting period, and 66 people are in intensive care. While owning a home remains beyond reach for millions of Australians, those who manage to crack the market may increasingly be getting in over their heads, AAP reports. More than a third (37%) end up exceeding their budget, according to Finder\u2019s latest First Home Buyer Report. The comparison site\u2019s survey of more than a thousand first-time buyers \u2013 372 of whom had already completed their purchase \u2013 found 8% paid more than $100,000 over budget and another 8% went at least $50,000 over. Only 20% of those who took part in the research managed to buy for less than what they believed they could afford. Part of the reason for the blowouts was to do with underquoted property prices, Finder money expert Sarah Megginson says. Underquoting is where a property is listed at a price lower than what it\u2019s worth to bait buyers. It\u2019s illegal but it does happen, particularly in the case of auctions, where underquoted prices can attract more buyers and lead to a bidding war. \u2018We need a response right now\u2019: expert on tackling latest Covid wave Paul Griffin, an infectious diseases physician at the University of Queensland, was on the ABC earlier this morning. He says bringing the national cabinet meeting forward two days is a reflection of how urgent the situation with this third wave of Covid-19 is, and discusses what he would like to see come out of the meeting. I think bringing forward that meeting is a really welcome change and should certainly signify the significance of this wave. We do need a response right now. We need to make sure we get the vaccine in people\u2019s arms and also do other things to curtail the spread, like facilitating mask-wearing and those sorts of things. Hopefully we will get a good response from that today. I think we need to do as much as we can to facilitate the right response with pandemic payments. We don\u2019t want finances to be a barrier to people doing the right thing to protect themselves and those people around them. Facilitating things like telehealth with GPs \u2013 there has been challenges around funding there \u2013 and doing more to bring back mask-wearing and subsidising rapid antigen test and that mask wearing is easy to do that. Here\u2019s the message that came out from the prime minister Anthony Albanese yesterday that Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Paul Kelly would provide an emergency briefing to national cabinet this morning. The snap meeting was originally called for Monday. Albanese says proposals discussed will aim to \u201censure the vulnerable are protected\u201d. If you want to read more about what to expect from the meeting Guardian\u2019s political editor, Katherine Murphy, and Josh Butler have this report: But of course the Covid-19 news is not so good this Saturday morning. Australia\u2019s Covid hospitalisations are reaching record levels in several states as a new wave of infections sweeps the country. Hospitals are struggling under the load and experts say most states and territories are likely still several weeks away from their peak hospitalisation rates of this wave. The national cabinet will hold an emergency meeting this morning after the prime minister Anthony Albanese brought it forward two days following a briefing from Paul Kelly, the chief medical officer, yesterday. Albanese will propose that Canberra and the states extend the pandemic leave payments after he faced mounting pressures, including from the backbenchers and state leaders within his own party, earlier this week. Payments for casual workers who have to isolate due to Covid but do not have sick leave ended this month, but are expected to be reinstated.

Novavax is also expected to finish its quality testing \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d before the doses are provided.

The move comes after the Biden administration announced on Monday that it had secured 3.2m doses of the Novavax vaccine through an agreement with the Maryland-based company, US Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Defense. Novavax\u2019s protein-based vaccine, given in doses spread three weeks apart, will be made available for free to states, jurisdictions, federal pharmacy partners, and federally qualified health centers, according to a statement by the company. In June, the FDA voted to recommend that the agency grant an emergency use authorization for the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine for individuals aged 18 and over. The company\u2019s vaccine approval from the FDA was delayed for weeks amid a review of Novavax\u2019s manufacturing process. The authorization for the vaccine was approved as the emergence of another fast-spreading Omicron variant has become dominant among new coronavirus cases. In the UK, healthcare professionals are calling for the return of infection control measures as cases of the new subvariant emerge."

            "content": "Health authorities are underestimating the scale of the response required to stop monkeypox becoming endemic in the UK, sexual health campaigners have warned, as a new vaccination drive is launched. The Terrence Higgins Trust urged the NHS and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to urgently pump cash into the system to pay more healthcare workers to administer vaccines. It also wants the number of doses ordered to be doubled to protect against a virus that has infected at least 2,208 people in the UK, according to the latest official figures. Monkeypox is usually mild and is spread by close contact with an infected person or animal, but the risk of severe disease is higher in children, pregnant women and people who are immunosuppressed. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV has estimated that at least 125,000 people will need vaccines, including gay men living with HIV, sex workers, and staff in sexual health clinics and saunas. A double dose of the smallpox vaccine is needed. Last week the NHS announced that it had procured at least 100,000 more doses. It is asking people to wait until asked to come forward for a vaccine, and is prioritising gay and bisexual men, and men who have sex with men who exhibit high-risk behaviour. Campaigners want more walk-in clinics amid \u201cimpatience\u201d among people at risk. \u201cThere needs to be a [monkeypox] tsar charged with stopping this becoming endemic,\u201d said Richard Angell, the campaigns director at the Terrence Higgins Trust. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept that it gets into the system like chlamydia.\u201d In a letter to the health secretary, Steve Barclay, on Saturday, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: \u201cI am concerned you are not acting with the urgency required, and that the response so far has lacked coordination from DHSC and NHS England,\u201d he said. Labour said the vaccination programme was already diverting resources away from sexual health services\u2019 delivery of core services including anti-HIV therapies and long-term contraceptions. \u201cYour department has committed to achieve an 80% reduction in new HIV infections in England by 2025,\u201d Streeting said. \u201cIt would be a scandal if progress towards achieving this were to be put in jeopardy.\u201d A government spokesperson said the UKHSA was monitoring vaccine demand and would be able to quickly procure more doses as required. \u201cThe NHS is already contacting those eligible for the vaccine and are urging people to take up the offer as soon as they\u2019re contacted,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have provided more than \u00a33.4bn to local authorities through the public health grant, enabling them to invest in essential frontline services including sexual health services.\u201d On Saturday, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, declared the multi-country outbreak of monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern. The body\u2019s international health regulations emergency committee did not reach a consensus on whether the outbreak warranted the declaration, but Ghebreyesus said it was justified because the virus had \u201cspread around the world rapidly through new modes of transmission about which we understand too little\u201d. He said the risk of monkeypox was \u201cmoderate\u201d globally and \u201chigh\u201d in Europe and that there was \u201ca clear risk of further international spread\u201d. The UKHSA said last week that transmission continues to occur primarily within interconnected sexual networks. \u201cThe most recent data suggests that the growth of the outbreak may have slowed,\u201d it said. \u201cThis means that we continue to identify new infections, but at a more stable rate.\u201d In a statement on Friday, Steve Russell, the NHS director of vaccinations, said: \u201cThe NHS is now scaling up its plans to get people vaccinated, particularly in London \u2026 Thousands more people will be invited very shortly, with the number of clinics expanded too \u2026 We are asking people to wait to be contacted and to come forward at the earliest opportunity possible when invited to get vaccinated.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-27T18:00:25Z",
            "content": "Scientists have made a \u201cpromising\u201d advance towards developing a universal coronavirus vaccine to tackle Covid-19 and the common cold. Researchers at the Francis Crick Institute in London have discovered that a specific area of the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 the virus that causes Covid-19 \u2013 is a good target for a pan-coronavirus jab that could offer protection against all the Covid-19 variants and common colds. Developing a vaccine that protects against a number of different coronaviruses is a huge challenge, they said, because this family of viruses have many key differences, frequently mutate and generally induce incomplete protection against reinfection. That is why people can repeatedly catch common colds, and why it is possible to be infected multiple times with different variants of Sars-CoV-2. A universal coronavirus vaccine would need to trigger antibodies that recognise and neutralise a range of coronaviruses, scientists said, stopping the virus from entering hosts cells and replicating. In the new study, the researchers investigated whether antibodies targeting the \u201cS2 subunit\u201d of Sars-CoV-2\u2019s spike protein also neutralise other coronaviruses. The researchers found that after vaccinating mice with Sars-CoV-2 S2, the mice created antibodies able to neutralise a number of other animal and human coronaviruses. They included the common cold coronavirus HCoV-OC43, the original strain of Sars-CoV-2, the D614G mutant that dominated in the first wave, Alpha, Beta, Delta, the original Omicron and two bat coronaviruses. The findings are published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. \u201cThe S2 area of the spike protein is a promising target for a potential pan-coronavirus vaccine because this area is much more similar across different coronaviruses than the S1 area,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-first author, Kevin Ng, of the Francis Crick Institute. \u201cIt is less subject to mutations, and so a vaccine targeted at this area should be more robust.\u201d Until now, the S2 area of the spike protein had been overlooked as a potential basis for vaccination, the researchers said. George Kassiotis, corresponding author and principal group leader at the Francis Crick Institute, said: \u201cThe expectation for a vaccine that targets the S2 area is that it could offer some protection against all current, as well as future, coronaviruses. \u201cThis differs from vaccines that target the more variable S1 area which, while effective against the matching variant they are designed against, are less able to target other variants or a broad range of coronaviruses. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research still to do as we continue to test S2 antibodies against different coronaviruses and look for the most appropriate route to design and test a potential vaccine.\u201d The researchers will continue their work studying the potential of a pan-coronavirus that targets the S2 area of the spike protein and how it could be integrated with currently licensed vaccines. Nikhil Faulkner, a co-first author, also of the Francis Crick Institute, said: \u201cWhile a potential S2 vaccine would not stop people being infected, the idea is it would prime their immune system to respond to a future coronavirus infection. \u201cThis would hopefully provide enough protection to survive an initial infection during which they could develop further immunity specific to that particular virus.\u201d Prof Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King\u2019s College London, who was not involved in the study, said a universal coronavirus vaccine \u201ccould solve the problem of endless new waves of disease caused by variants with reduced vaccine sensitivity\u201d."

            "content": "The international target to vaccinate 70% of the world\u2019s population against Covid by mid-2022 was missed because poorer countries were at the \u201cback of the queue\u201d when vaccines were rolled out, say campaigners. The latest figures from Our World in Data show huge inequalities in vaccination rates around the world, with just one in seven people in low-income countries fully vaccinated. By comparison, nearly three in four people in high-income nations have been vaccinated for around a year. Activists are calling for a renewed push to increase vaccine take-up globally to slow the spread of the virus and prevent future variants. Their call comes as the World Health Organization said this week that Covid infections in Europe tripled and hospitalisations doubled in the past six weeks, with deaths totalling 3,000 a week. \u201cUnless we achieve equitable action in addressing this pandemic, it will always remain with us in the world,\u201d said Kavengo Matundu, Africa coordinator for Global Call to Action Against Poverty (GCAP), who has been working with frontline groups on the Covid response. \u201cIt has shown that it is capable of mutating into anything, and can become something more dangerous than the original.\u201d As the first vaccines were rolled out across the world in 2020, low-income countries had to wait months to receive doses through the Covax vaccine-sharing system or from other donors. Wealthy countries had bought the lion\u2019s share of available vaccines. When they did arrive, vaccine doses were sometimes close to their expiry date, or insufficient to meet the demands of health centres. This, said Maaza Seyoum, Global South convenor of the People\u2019s Vaccine Alliance, left people frustrated and reluctant to return to vaccination centres. The emergence of new variants \u2013 particularly the Delta wave, which led to high death rates in some countries \u2013 helped convince some that the vaccines did not work. \u201cAs much as there\u2019s all this naive and hopeful talk, when push comes to shove, we cannot count on rich countries to do the right thing,\u201d said Seyoum. \u201cThe poorest countries in the world have ended up at the back of the queue, creating the sense that some lives matter more than others.\u201d She added: \u201cThe pandemic, and the economic issues that have come with it \u2013 some of the data we\u2019ve seen shows that 100 million more people have been pushed into poverty by this pandemic \u2013 make it difficult when you\u2019re asking people in that environment to take out a huge amount of time from their money making to stand in line for a vaccine. \u201cWe have to imagine what we would feel like if we were trying to access a service that we were told was delayed over and over.\u201d According to Our World in Data figures, as of 10 July only 15.8% of people in low-income countries were fully vaccinated, compared with 55% in lower-middle income countries, 73.5% in high-income countries and 78.7% in upper-middle income countries. Africa has the lowest number of vaccinated people. Excluding Eritrea and North Korea, which have yet to start vaccination programmes, seven of the 10 countries with the world\u2019s lowest rates of full-vaccination are in Africa. The other three countries are Papua New Guinea, Haiti and Yemen. The UK\u2019s booster vaccination rate is already far higher than these countries\u2019 standard vaccination rates. Seyoum said that Covax was \u201ca beautiful idea built out of solidarity\u201d, but had failed \u201cbecause of greed and poor planning\u201d. The latest data from the Duke Global Health Innovation Center, which covers the period up to 9 June, shows that Canada, Australia and the UK have bought enough vaccine doses to vaccinate their populations several times over: 11.1, 9.9 and 7.6 doses per person, respectively. In contrast, South Africa was able to buy the equivalent of 0.5 doses per person. The African Union\u2019s purchase of 330m doses of Moderna and Janssen vaccines equated to just 0.2 doses a person across the bloc. The AU and Covax have turned down opportunities to buy doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has a short shelf-life, and Moderna, which should be kept in very cold temperatures. Neither are suitable for countries without decent transport and cold chain infrastructure. Covax said the \u201cad hoc\u201d delivery of vaccines last year made it difficult for poorer countries to plan their vaccine rollouts. With more vaccines now available, it called for deliveries to match the timings required for lower-income countries to plan their immunisation campaigns. Dr Fifa Rahman, a civil society representative on the WHO Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator, said more people from low-income countries should be included in discussions on vaccine rollout. She said the rollout was \u201calmost negligently late, because you\u2019ve got a bunch of New Yorkers in a room making decisions about Africa.\u201d The Vaccine Delivery Partnership \u2013 an inter-agency organisation to accelerate vaccination coverage \u2013 was, she added, \u201cdoing a great job, but it was extremely late\u201d. Seyoum said: \u201cRich countries keep thinking that if they just protect themselves, they\u2019re going to get out of the pandemic, but that is, on a public health front, completely ridiculous. It sounds trite, but as the head of WHO said last year: none of us is safe until we\u2019re all safe.\u201d Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter \u2013 a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:"

            "date": "2022-07-19T17:42:17Z",
            "content": "Public health officials have ordered 100,000 more doses of vaccine to help curb the spread of monkeypox as the number of UK cases rose to more than 2,000 in the months-long outbreak. According to figures released by the Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on Tuesday, confirmed cases have risen to 2,137 in the UK, with 2,050 recorded in England. The majority of infections are in London and among men who have sex with men. Despite the continued growth in cases, health officials have revised their guidance for close contacts of confirmed monkeypox cases, no longer requiring them to isolate at home if they do not have symptoms of the disease. The decision was made in light of new data that showed only a small number of close contacts of confirmed cases have gone on to develop monkeypox, and a lack of evidence for transmission beyond intimate or sexual contact, the UKHSA said. Further doses of the Imvanex smallpox vaccine, which is effective against monkeypox, are due to arrive from the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic, this month, and more are expected by September. The NHS is contacting people eligible for the vaccine, including men who are more likely to catch the virus. \u201cWe have now passed over 2,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the UK, and the outbreak continues to grow,\u201d said Dr Merav Kliner, a deputy incident director at the UKHSA. \u201cBased on the growing evidence of how the monkeypox virus is being passed on in this outbreak, close contacts will no longer have to isolate for 21 days unless they develop symptoms.\u201d While the advice was changing, Kliner said, monkeypox remains a \u201cserious public health challenge\u201d and she urged contacts of confirmed cases to \u201ctake a break from any activities or events involving skin-to-skin contact, including sex, hugging and kissing, to reduce the risk of the virus being passed on unknowingly\u201d. She urged people to stay alert to the symptoms of monkeypox and call a sexual health clinic if they become unwell. Early symptoms of monkeypox include a high temperature, headache, muscle aches and swollen glands. A rash or blisters usually appear, which can then spread around the body. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said: \u201cAlthough most cases of monkeypox in the current outbreak are mild, severe illness can occur in some people, so it is important we use the available vaccine to reach groups where transmission is occurring.\u201d \u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 20 July 2022. An earlier version stated incorrectly that confirmed cases are no longer required to isolate."

            "date": "2022-07-19T14:56:09Z",
            "content": "With temperatures in the UK breaking records on Tuesday, what is the impact of heatwaves on mental health? Are heatwaves a concern for mental health? \u201cIn recent years there\u2019s been an increasingly large body of research showing us that heatwaves worsen outcomes for those with underlying psychiatric illnesses,\u201d says Dr Laurence Wainwright, a departmental lecturer at the Smith school and the precision psychiatry lab at the University of Oxford. \u201cRates of suicides go up, levels of mortality go up, for those with existing conditions symptoms can be worsened,\u201d he adds, noting that for people with conditions such as bipolar disorder, extreme heat can trigger manic phases. Prof Tahseen Jafry, the director of the Mary Robinson Centre for Climate Justice at Glasgow Caledonian University, says: \u201cWith increased temperature rises, there is evidence to show that there [are] more frequent visits to hospitals for mental health, mental illnesses and behavioural and mood disorders.\u201d One study from the UK, published in 2007, found a 3.8% increase in suicide rates for every 1C rise in average temperature above 18C. Researchers have also found that higher temperatures are associated with an increase in aggression and violence \u2013 possibly due to the impact on various hormones \u2013 and can affect cognitive function, leaving people feeling fuzzy-headed.. Why does the heat affect mental health? It is likely there are several factors at play. Among them, Wainwright notes, is that many people have interrupted sleep during heatwaves. \u201cWhat the evidence shows us very, very clearly is that poor-quality sleep and/or shorter sleep duration can worsen outcomes in those, say, with major depressive disorder,\u201d he says. \u201cA couple of nights of broken sleep can be a trigger for the onset of their depressive phase.\u201d He adds that the heat can worsen some side-effects of psychiatric medication or in some cases make the medication less effective. What\u2019s more, some medications affect the body\u2019s ability to thermoregulate or otherwise impair individuals\u2019 ability to take appropriate measures. \u201cThe antipsychotics which we use in schizophrenia and bipolar, they can actually have an impact on people\u2019s perception of thirst,\u201d says Wainwright. \u201cThe body has a very good way of telling us when we\u2019re thirsty, [but] when we\u2019re taking these medications, that can be impacted \u2013 and during a heatwave that obviously poses problems for heat-related illnesses.\u201d People may experience indirect effects such as raised concerns over issues such as food insecurity or migration. Jafry says: \u201cThose things can then affect people\u2019s mental health and wellbeing because it\u2019s about how do we cope with, and adapt to, these changing circumstances.\u201d Eco-anxiety can also take a toll, she says, noting that many young people experience stress regarding climate change. \u201c[The term is] used to describe an anxious state about what\u2019s happening immediately, but also about our future and how we\u2019re going to deal with that,\u201d Jafry says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that we are likely to see more of.\u201d What can we do? As well as taking steps to keep cool and hydrated, Wainwright advises keeping medications out of the sun and remembering to take them, avoiding alcohol, taking steps to sleep well, and practising self-compassion, such as not criticising oneself for being less productive than usual. He also recommends that people with mental health conditions speak to medical professionals if they notice a worsening in their symptoms, or issues related to their medication. Wainwright adds that among other steps, health policy must be reoriented as understanding of the relationship between heat and mental health improves, and public education is needed around this relationship. Jafry calls for dedicated mental health support, for example through trained community nurses, to help deal with the impact of heatwaves and other extreme events. Wainwright says: \u201cHeatwaves, and the effects they have on our mental health, are important reminders that the best thing we can do to help ourselves and future generations is to act on climate change.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "School-based mindfulness training does not appear to boost wellbeing or improve the mental health of teenagers, according to research that found many pupils were bored by the course and did not practise it at home. At a time when concern is mounting about poor mental heath among children and young people in the UK, researchers wanted to find out whether a universal mindfulness intervention in secondary schools might help build resilience and have a positive impact on pupil wellbeing. Mindfulness has become a popular meditation technique aimed at focusing the mind on the present moment, and involves learning how to pay attention and manage feelings and behaviour, to improve resilience in the face of external stressors. While it has been found to help with the symptoms of depression and anxiety in some studies, researchers from the My Resilience in Adolescence (Myriad) trial found the broad school-based mindfulness offer was no more effective than what schools were already doing to support student mental health with social-emotional learning. The research was based on a cluster of five studies, carried out over eight years by about 100 researchers working with 28,000 teenagers and 650 teachers in 100 schools. It typically involved teachers learning mindfulness themselves, followed by training in how to deliver it to their students in 10 lessons of 30-50 minutes. While evidence for the effectiveness of this approach among pupils was \u201cweak\u201d, researchers found it had a positive impact on the teachers involved, reducing burn-out, and also on the general school climate or culture, though these positive effects were relatively short-lived. The study, from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Exeter, King\u2019s College London, University College London and Pennsylvania State in the US, was published in the Evidence-Based Mental Health journal. Prof Mark Williams, the found director of the Oxford Mindfulness Centre and co-investigator at the University of Oxford, said the findings confirmed the huge burden of mental health challenges that young people face, and the urgent need to find a way to help. \u201cThey also show that the idea of mindfulness doesn\u2019t help \u2013 it\u2019s the practice that matters.\u201d Those students that did engage improved, he said, but most did not. \u201cOn average they only practised once over 10 weeks of the course. And that\u2019s like going to the gym once and hoping you\u2019ll get fit. But why didn\u2019t they practise? Well, because many of them found it boring.\u201d He went on: \u201cIf today\u2019s young people are to be enthused enough to practise mindfulness, then updating training to suit different needs and giving them a say in the approach they prefer are the vital next steps.\u201d Dr Elaine Lockhart, the chair of the child and adolescent faculty of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which co-owns Evidence-Based Mental Health, said children and young people were suffering after the pandemic. \u201cMindfulness can be helpful in managing emotions, but it won\u2019t be enough for those children and young people who need support with their mental wellbeing, especially in the aftermath of the pandemic. \u201cThey will need a full range of services to meet their mental health needs, and getting help early is absolutely key in preventing mental health problems from developing or escalating in adulthood.\u201d Dr Dan O\u2019Hare, a co vice-chair of the division of educational and child psychology at the British Psychological Society, added: \u201cThe findings from this study certainly suggest there is a need to consider whether the mental health support we are providing to teenagers within schools is fit for purpose. \u201cWhile mindfulness sessions can be hugely beneficial, it\u2019s important to understand that it isn\u2019t a surface level intervention, and how children and teenagers respond to it will be affected by the context in which it\u2019s being taught and the school environment.\u201d"

Presenter Mike Graham claimed on his show, The Independent Republic of Mike Graham, last month that the charity was claiming to fund mental health support while actually paying migrants\u2019 legal fees. Mind complained over the claims, which it has said were \u201cplain wrong\u201d, and pointed out that it was never approached for comment by the new channel. In an on-air apology, broadcast just after 12.30pm on Friday, talkTV admitted wrongdoing during the show in which it said it \u201cquestioned why various organisations, including Mind, were providing funding to a charity called Migrants Organise\u201d. It added: \u201cMind has pointed out to us that the funds it gave to Migrants Organise were given for specific work to support mental health and not for legal fees of illegal immigrants. It says it\u2019s transparent about the work it does and details of the projects it funds are on its website. \u201cWe didn\u2019t offer Mind an opportunity to respond at the time and are happy to do so now. We are sorry for any confusion caused by the discussion on the show.\u201d It comes after the Guardian recently reported that in its first two months the rightwing channel, fronted by Piers Morgan, has been struggling to attract audiences, despite tens of millions of pounds of investment. Such is concern that Murdoch himself is understood to have taken an active interest. After the original comments were broadcast on 10 June, Mind said it had received messages of \u201cnegativity\u201d about its mental health support for refugees and asylum seekers. It added: \u201cWe do, and we\u2019re really proud of that. We\u2019re here for everyone. And that includes refugees and asylum seekers in England &amp; Wales, who have often experienced unimaginable trauma.\u201d After Friday\u2019s apology, Mind said it only found out about the claims after it was approached by supporters directly because they were not approached for a right of reply from the channel. \u201cWhat talkTV got wrong wasn\u2019t that we work with refugees, but how we do it. Our work is around supporting mental health. We shout about this from the rooftops,\u201d it said in a statement. Highlighting the media\u2019s power to influence views on mental health, it said it was important for Mind to challenge the false claims. \u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to approach talkTV direct and ask for a correction. As a charity our reputation matters, the importance of the work we do to support mental health even more so. The media [have] immense power. So often the media [are] a force for good,\u201d it added. \u201cAt Mind we know that as well as anyone, having seen how the media, across the political spectrum, [have] helped changed our national conversation around mental health. But when the media [get] things wrong, as we all do, as a charity it is important we also challenge this. So we did. Today, we are grateful to talkTV that it took the difficult decision to apologise on air.\u201d Talktv did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. An Ofcom spokesperson said the apology was not the result of an investigation by the communications regulator."

In total, over seven million teacher days have been lost to stress and mental health issues in the past five years. They showed a steady increase, highlighting the pressures that the pandemic put on teaching staff. Some areas appeared to be more heavily affected. Kent saw 91,679 teaching days lost in 2021-22, more than anywhere else in the country. Hampshire saw the number of days taken off for mental health rise to 28,945 in 2021-22, up a third from the year before. Munira Wilson, Liberal Democrat education spokesperson who uncovered the figures, said she feared there was a growing mental health epidemic among teachers. \u201cFar too many teachers are facing burnout from unsustainable workloads and relentless pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cParents will be rightly worried about the terrible knock-on impact this could have on the education and well-being of our children. \u201cThe new education secretary must set out a clear plan to reverse the years of damage to the mental health and well-being of teachers, and to help recruit and retain the staff we need. The Covid inquiry must also look into the impact the government\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic had on the mental health of teachers and other frontline workers.\u201d This comes with teaching leaders warning that working pressures, combined with a below-inflation pay rise offer, will intensify a crisis in teacher retention. Most have been offered a 5% pay rise next year \u2013 higher than the original 3% offer, but well below the 9.1% rate of inflation. Starting salaries will rise by 8.9%. Unions have said they will consult their members on possible industrial action in the autumn as a result of the offer. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the 5% increase offered to most teachers would be \u201ca total real-terms cut of nearly 12% since 2010\u201d. Schools will have to fund the increases out of existing budgets. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said stress and poor mental health had become \u201ca really significant problem\u201d. She said: \u201cThe biggest problem is workload and this is often cited, alongside pay, as one of the main reasons we have a very high staff turnover rate in education, with 40% of teachers leaving within 10 years of qualifying. \u201cDuring the pandemic, schools and staff had to take on a great deal of additional work. All of this will have left many staff feeling burnt out and we are also hearing that some have come out of the pandemic with a view to reappraising their work/life balance and quitting teaching. This is of huge concern because the situation with teacher shortages is already pretty desperate and it seems likely to get even worse.\u201d Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cThe government is failing to address the issues of unacceptable workload, supersized classrooms, punitive accountability measures, stress and pay needed to ensure teaching is a profession that is both attractive to graduates and which keeps experienced teachers in post.\u201d A Whitehall official said the forthcoming Covid inquiry included a pledge to examine the impact on the nation\u2019s mental health. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe are incredibly grateful for the continued efforts of teachers and school leaders in supporting pupils, especially over the pandemic. We are taking action to support teachers to stay in the profession and thrive. This includes increasing pay and launching the Education Staff Wellbeing Charter, which commits to reducing unnecessary teacher workload, championing flexible working and improving access to wellbeing resources.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-05T10:56:41Z",
            "content": "The UK is not doing enough to provide mental health support to thousands of Hongkongers who have fled China\u2019s increasingly authoritarian grip, according to advocacy groups and those politically displaced. Following China\u2019s introduction of a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong and swift clampdown on dissent, tens of thousands of residents with British national (overseas) (BNO) passports and their dependants were granted the right to live and work in the UK in 2021. However, those who have left say not enough support is being provided once they arrive in the UK. After participating in Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, Seffyr applied for a BNO visa as soon as the scheme launched. Almost a year later, he still fears being targeted under China\u2019s national security law. He is awaiting a post-traumatic stress disorder assessment (PTSD) with the NHS and has been told there will be a two-year waiting period for treatment due to the backlog from the pandemic. People often presume that those arriving in the UK from Hong Kong are prosperous and have not been traumatised by their experiences, said Seffyr, whose name has been changed. \u201cThis is not the true story, and nobody\u2019s really caring or thinking about it.\u201d The current scheme is available only to BNO passport holders born before 1997. However, the government plans to expand the scheme in October to cover Hongkongers aged between 18 and 24, who were at the heart of civilian protests. Sam Goodman, the director of policy and advocacy at the human rights NGO Hong Kong Watch, said that because Hongkongers were treated as an economic class, rather than frontline human rights defenders with complicated mental health needs, the government did not feel obliged to offer mental health services. \u201cIt\u2019s within the government\u2019s own interest to ensure that people have the right mental health support, so that they can actually get jobs, can settle down in the UK, and contribute and integrate,\u201d said Goodman. \u201cAt the moment that\u2019s sort of being overlooked.\u201d In February, the government allocated funding for 47 national and local projects to help resettle Hongkongers. But Goodman says their complex needs are not likely to be met by a small amount of government grant funding. According to a survey in May of new arrivals from Hong Kong, conducted by civil society group Hongkongers in Britain and a University of Cambridge researcher, the majority of 658 respondents felt that living in the UK had improved their mental health overall. However, 25.8% reported symptoms of anxiety and 23.8% reported symptoms of PTSD. Simon Cheng, a former British consulate employee and founder of Hongkongers in Britain, said the true figures were probably higher due to the stigma surrounding the discussion of mental health. He said more needed to be done by the government to help new arrivals from Hong Kong settle into life in the UK and to recover from their experiences. \u201c[In] the NHS there\u2019s now still a lack of Cantonese-speaking personnel, especially psychologists and mental health support, who not only can speak in Cantonese but they could be sympathetic or even show basic understanding of what happened in Hong Kong,\u201d said Cheng. There were 19,500 BNO visa applications in the first quarter of this year, according to government figures, of which 18,563 were made from outside the UK. In total there have been more than 120,000 applications since the immigration route opened in January last year. However, not everyone has the luxury of accessing a BNO visa. Krobus, a university student at King\u2019s College London, has been forced to seek asylum in the UK following her frontline involvement in the 2019 protests, as she is not eligible for the BNO government scheme. Since arriving in August, the 23-year-old has struggled with anxiety, depression and PTSD and faces long NHS waiting lists to get help. \u201cAs I see those people with BNOs walking in London, I sometimes feel really angry,\u201d said Krobus, whose name has been changed. \u201cHow on earth can you enjoy your new life here and I had to seek asylum and I don\u2019t even have enough money to live and I could probably be going homeless soon.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it had supported tens of thousands of BNO holders settling in the UK through the new immigration route and a welcome programme. \u201cThe programme includes targeted English-language provision and has funded 47 organisations to deliver national and regional projects for BNOs, including projects to support their emotional wellbeing and mental health needs,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe government is amending the BNO route to allow adult children of BNO status holders who are currently unable to apply independently to do so.\u201d \u2022 In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

            "title": "Dashboard of decline: seven charts that explain Britain\u2019s economic crisis",
            "date": "2022-07-02T15:03:07Z",
            "content": "The UK is sliding towards a recession. Only six months ago, a strong recovery was expected, but the impact of the pandemic, the slow return to pre-Covid work patterns and soaring inflation driven by the Ukraine invasion have depressed the economy. Last week the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, warned that Britons are likely to suffer a deeper and longer downturn than other major industrialised nations. He also said inflation would be more severe and persistent. Unique to the British experience is Brexit, which has imposed extra costs and restrictions on exporters to the EU and limited the supply of skilled labour. And after 10 years of austerity, publicly funded organisations entered the pandemic in a weak position and are now in an even worse state as they grapple with the rocketing cost of living and a shortage of workers. But these are not the only reasons why the situation in the UK is so particularly bad. These charts illustrate the many overlapping issues that are holding the country back: Labour shortages Millions of people in the top two-thirds of the earnings ladder saved money during the pandemic \u2013 because opportunities for spending on travel, eating out and shopping were severely curtailed. With about \u00a3260bn in bank deposit accounts, it was reasonable to expect the recovery to see an explosion of demand. When restrictions eased, employers put out a call for workers to meet that increased demand in restaurants, shops and more. However, many self-employed and older people who stopped working during the pandemic have stayed on the sidelines \u2013 unwilling to apply for jobs, or unable to because of illness. The latest jobs figures, for the three months to April, show vacancies hitting a fresh high of 1.3m, and unemployment at a 40-year low. According to the Institute for Employment Studies (IES), there are now about a million fewer people in the labour force than before the pandemic. Three-quarters of this can be explained by older people and those with long-term health conditions quitting the jobs market; the rest can be blamed on the lack of EU workers post-Brexit. Pay levels are not helping draw people back to the workplace. When adjusted for inflation, pay fell by 4.5% in the year to April, the biggest fall since comparable records began in 2001. Tony Wilson, head of the IES, says: \u201cThe labour market continues to see a toxic combination of falling real-terms pay, high worklessness and labour shortages.\u201d Meanwhile the government has switched off its pandemic-related apprenticeship schemes, leaving only the much-maligned apprenticeship levy, which many employers say is bureaucratic and costly. Brexit hit to trade There is little doubt, 18 months after the UK quit the single market and customs union, that Britain\u2019s trade has suffered significant and sustained damage. A report by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) and the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank found the \u201cdesire to pursue a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit had resulted in a major increase in trade barriers and trade costs in goods and services, as well as new restrictions on migration flows\u201d. In a review covering the years since the referendum vote in 2016, it said the areas that voted most heavily to leave the EU had been the worst affected, mostly since the post-exit trade agreement came into effect in January 2021. \u201cIt caused a major shock to UK-EU trade, with a sudden and persistent 25% fall in UK imports from the EU, relative to the rest of the world,\u201d the report said, adding that costs have risen in some sectors. \u201cIt is estimated that there has been a 6% increase in food prices due to Brexit, over the two years to the end of 2021.\u201d And while exports have not gone down, exporters have failed to benefit from the resurgence in global trade seen over the past year. A separate study by the London School of Economics found that Brexit had \u201cmore broadly reduced how open and competitive Britain\u2019s economy is, which will reduce productivity and wages in the decade ahead\u201d. Since 2019, Britain has suffered an eight-percentage-point fall in trade openness \u2013 the sum of its exports and imports as a share of GDP. France, which has a similar trade profile to the UK, has experienced a far smaller fall \u2013 two percentage points \u2013 over the same period. \u201cThis decline is not explained by changes in the pattern of global trade during the pandemic,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe UK also lost market share across three of its largest non-EU goods import markets in 2021: the US, Canada and Japan.\u201d Productivity and investment The UK\u2019s productivity has lagged behind that of Europe, the US and Japan for decades. Measured by the value produced each hour by a worker, British productivity is estimated to be about 20% lower than that of France and Germany and 30% lower than the US. Official data estimates that UK business investment is now 9.1% down on pre-pandemic levels after a 0.5% fall in the first three months of 2022. The situation was made much worse by Brexit, according to a Bank of England study last year, which found the leave decision \u201chas lowered the level of investment by almost 25% in 2020-21\u201d. The Bank said the impact \u201chas built gradually over the past five years, and at least up until the start of the Covid pandemic it can largely explain why there was no growth in investment since the EU referendum\u201d. Most of the fall was blamed on Brexit-related uncertainty, which is likely to persist as the government wrangles over the Northern Ireland protocol and many unresolved disputes over border checks. Broken supply chains The British economy is one of the most open in the developed world. Trade accounts for about a third of national income, and 50% of the UK\u2019s food is imported. So the havoc wrought on global supply chains by the pandemic and by Covid lockdowns in factories in east Asia has hit the country hard. Since autumn 2020, the ONS has tracked shoppers\u2019 opinions on the availability and choice of items in supermarkets and shops. The figures show a drop last autumn as pre-Christmas supplies of everything from toys to turkeys dwindled. Even when a final product was made in the UK, the majority of its components were in most cases imported, and suffered long supply delays. Poultry, for example, relies heavily on imported feed, but last year\u2019s supply problems were also the result of seasonal worker shortages brought on by Brexit. Since then most people tell pollsters they are happy with the range of goods in the shops; it is prices they struggle to cope with. Away from the supermarkets, businesses and consumers report plenty of shortages, such as four- to six-month waits for imports of construction materials as global demand for stone, concrete and wood soars. Vladimir Putin\u2019s war has also severely affected certain commodities. Cooking oil has been badly hit because of the key role sunflower fields in both Ukraine and Russia play in supplying the world market. Cultural deficit The government said it wanted to fund a renaissance of arts and cultural activities in the north and west of England as part of its levelling-up agenda. As we emerged from the third lockdown, culture secretary Nadine Dorries proposed slicing 15% off the Arts Council budget for London-based organisations in favour of those in areas designated for levelling up. She was immediately accused of \u201clevelling down\u201d by Labour and leading arts figures, with the National Theatre pointing out that it is a touring company and such productions would be hit. Funding for the arts and culture at local authority level has been characterised by across-the-board cuts. Spending is down by more than 30% since a peak in 2009 and there is no sign of an uplift any time soon. Having been a growth area since 2009, museums lost millions of visitors during the pandemic. In 2018-19, with entrance charges waived at many venues \u2013 except for special exhibitions \u2013 visitor numbers had soared, but now they are almost half previous levels. The sector\u2019s leaders say cuts to transport timetables, both buses and trains, and chaos in the airline industry are deterring domestic and foreign visitors, and delaying recovery by months, if not years. Science funding cuts In March the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) agency \u2013 which controls science funding in Britain \u2013 told universities its budget for international development projects had been cut from \u00a3245m to \u00a3125m. Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said slicing the budget in half undermined the chancellor\u2019s pledge to make the UK a \u201cscientific superpower\u201d. Academics are frustrated that \u00a3250m of funding from the European Horizon programme, a research behemoth that has funded some of the latest medical and science breakthroughs, has foundered on a row over the Northern Ireland protocol. Without access to Horizon research, the UK is heading into the second division, science experts have warned. In Rishi Sunak\u2019s defence, he has committed to the UK to spending 2.4% of GDP on research and development, up from 1.74% last year. France already spends 2.2% of GDP, the US 3.1% and Germany 3.2%. The chancellor initially wanted to achieve this by 2025, but got cold feet and pushed the date back to 2027. There have been steady rises over 30 years, but the plan includes an increase from \u00a39bn of public money in 2017 to \u00a322bn in five years, which looks like a big ask. Like so many aspects of government spending at the moment, the plans are backloaded and need huge increases in the latter years to reach the target. UK v G7 growth The poor health of the UK economy was disguised to a large extent during the pandemic by public spending on health and Covid-related recovery programmes. Now that much of this is being withdrawn, the country\u2019s growth rate will rely much more on the private sector. The International Monetary Fund says the UK will sink to the bottom of the G7 league next year, in part because public spending is being cut back severely. Growth will drop to 1.2%, lower than the expected growth rates in France, Germany, the US, Italy, Japan and Canada. Accountancy trade body the ICAEW says it is fairer to consider average growth since 2020, and by that measure the UK jumps ahead of Italy and Japan. However, both those countries have declining populations and do not need the same level of national income growth to improve individual living standards."

            "date": "2022-07-15T12:34:12Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s economic growth has slowed sharply in the second quarter of the year, official data showed on Friday, highlighting the colossal toll from widespread Covid lockdowns and casting doubt over whether its pre-ordained growth target can be met. Output contracted by 2.6% between April and June compared with the previous quarter, the statistics bureau said, prompting many economists to revise their predictions for the world\u2019s second biggest economy. On an annual basis the economy grew 0.4% in the second quarter, the worst since the pandemic-hit first months of 2020, but even that was worse than the consensus forecast by economists of 1%. The consultancy Capital Economics said the real figure was probably \u201ceven weaker than meets the eye\u201d and suggested that the Chinese government \u2013 accustomed to trumpeting growth well above that achieved by western countries \u2013 could be trying to disguise the economy\u2019s sluggishness. \u201cEven with some massaging of the figures, it\u2019s hard to see how the government\u2019s target of \u2018around 5.5%\u2019 growth this year can be attained. That would take a huge acceleration in the second half of this year, which is unlikely,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist, in a note on Friday. While noting some strong signs of recovery in retail sales for example, Evans-Pritchard said growth was \u201clikely to remain relatively weak over the coming quarters\u201d. \u201cWe expect the official GDP figures to eke out growth of 3%-4% this year but think the reality on the ground will be closer to zero growth across the year as a whole,\u201d he said. The signs were mounting that the economy was slowing. This week\u2019s figures showed that imports for the second quarter grew by just 0.1%, called \u201cstaggeringly\u201d low by one economist considering that prices for key imported commodities such as oil and food have rocketed since April. A more significant sign lies in the latest unemployment data, economists said. The statistics bureau reported on Friday that youth unemployment has risen to 19.3%, a trend accelerated by the full or partial lockdowns imposed in major centres across China in March and April, including the commercial capital, Shanghai. \u201cFor China, it\u2019s a societal issue,\u201d said Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, the Hong Kong-based chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis bank. \u201cA lot of people will ask now: where is my future? It kind of breaks their \u2018China dream\u2019. This is a key problem now.\u201d Serena, a 26-year-old English teacher in the southern city of Zhuhai, has finally found a job this month after two years of searching. \u201cFor the last two years, I have been struggling. It was highly competitive and extremely difficult if you want to teach in public schools,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cAnd the pay turned out not to be as it was promised.\u201d Given China\u2019s insistence on zero Covid and the recent discovery of the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant BA.5, many analysts do not expect a rapid economic recovery. In addition, the country\u2019s property market is in a deep slump, and the global outlook is darkening. The slowdown comes after China\u2019s biggest city, Shanghai, was sealed off for two months as it battled a Covid-19 resurgence, tangling supply chains and forcing factories to halt operations. Beijing has dug its heels in on a zero-Covid policy of stamping out virus clusters as they emerge with snap lockdowns and long quarantines, but this has battered businesses and kept consumers jittery. \u201cDomestically, the impact of the epidemic is lingering,\u201d the statistics bureau said in a statement on Friday, noting shrinking demand and disrupted supplies. \u201cThe risk of stagflation in the world economy is rising,\u201d the statement said, noting that external uncertainties were growing. The data comes after mounting challenges in China\u2019s key real estate sector, which by some estimates accounts for a quarter of gross domestic product, with weak home sales in recent months. A growing number of homebuyers are also refusing to pay their mortgages over worries their homes will not be built on time. This week, a documentary about how hundreds of homebuyers in the central Chinese city of Xi\u2019an have had to live in unfinished apartments struck a chord with many Chinese homebuyers. Although there are signs that China\u2019s economy has started to recover since Shanghai eased lockdown restrictions in June, analysts expect that pressure on consumption will probably persist. The news piles pressure on the Communist party\u2019s leadership, which is gearing up for its 20th congress, when President Xi Jinping is expected to be handed another five-year term.

            "title": "Mortgage strikes threaten China\u2019s economic and political stability",
            "date": "2022-07-19T05:00:32Z",
            "content": "The alarm bells are ringing louder. Last week, hundreds of depositors gathered in front of the Zhengzhou branch of the People\u2019s Bank of China in the provincial capital of Henan, demanding their frozen life savings held in rural banks. A day later, tens of thousands of homeowners threatened to stop paying mortgages on scores of unfinished housing projects they had purchased. All of this happened in a week where the officials reported lacklustre second-quarter economic performance. China\u2019s economy is facing a dangerous cocktail of stalling growth, high unemployment, spreading mortgage payment strikes and continued Covid shutdowns that threaten to explode with serious social and political consequences. The worsening meltdown in the country\u2019s debt-laden property market is at the heart of the problem as the toxic $300bn (\u00a3250bn) debt pile unleashed by last year\u2019s collapse of the giant developer Evergrande slowly infects the whole economy. The initial official response to the bank demonstration was to call in squads of plain-clothed enforcers to use violence to break it up. Authorities have since claimed the bank has been taken over by \u201ccriminal gangs\u201d and have promised to start allowing access to money. When it emerged last week that homebuyers across the country were banding together to refuse payments on mortgages on homes left unfinished by debt-distressed developers, it was the another sign that the faith of ordinary Chinese people in the property market and wider banking industry is beginning to dissolve. \u201cWhy do I have to pay mortgage when the property I bought has yet to be finished?\u201d said one angry social media user after watching a viral documentary about how hundreds of homebuyers in central Chinese city of Xi\u2019an have to live in unfinished apartments. Under pressure, Beijing\u2019s regulators vowed last Thursday to help local governments finish property projects on time. By Monday, the government was reportedly coming up with measures to allow homeowners to temporarily halt mortgage payments on unfinished property projects without affecting their credit scores. This is a precarious moment for China\u2019s ruling Communist party in the run-up to its 20th party congress later this year, because it signals falling confidence in a year that was supposed to prioritise stability, said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics, a macroeconomic consultancy in London. \u201cHomebuyers\u2019 refusal to pay mortgages on unfinished properties across cities in China and the mass protests in Henan by bank depositors demanding their savings back and condemning government corruption are another manifestation of the huge challenges Beijing faces at present,\u201d she said. A broken economic model For years, property has been a key driver of China\u2019s inexorable growth, with prices rising steadily for decades and offering a seemingly one-way bet to guarantee income growth for the new middle class. China\u2019s property market accounts for an estimated 30% of its economy. However, that relentless expansion can no longer be taken for granted, as Friday\u2019s weak GDP numbers showed. Repeated lockdowns of major cities to contain the Omicron coronavirus variant have taken a heavy toll. Lanzhou, a city of almost 4 million in north-west China, became the latest when it announced a weeklong lockdown on Wednesday, while the threat of further paralysis hangs over megacities such as Shanghai. The government in Beijing has responded in recent weeks by laying out plans for another massive splurge on infrastructure projects worth up to $70bn, an injection of spending that may keep central committee\u2019s prized headline growth figures ticking over. Many economists and China observers now agree, however, that Beijing\u2019s borrow-and-build economic model is broken and that more infrastructure is the road to ruin rather than one to a sustainable future. For many years now, Beijing has tried to pivot to more consumer spending and innovation to drive a new era of growth rather than more steel-and-concrete white elephants. That, again, has proven challenging. The crisis besetting the property industry is the perfect illustration of the problem. The government has pulled every lever it can to contain the slow collapse of Evergrande, which began last year when the company admitted that \u201cchanging market conditions\u201d meant it could no longer make repayments on its debt mountain. The story has somewhat faded from view behind a morass of restructuring and absorption of troubled parts of the empire by state-owned companies, but even Beijing\u2019s all-powerful bureaucrats cannot stop the poison spreading, as several key developments showed last week. First, the mortgage rebellion shows that householders have become desperate as they see unfinished homes bought off-plan falling in value while developers struggle to stay afloat. Figures from the research firm China Real Estate Information Corporation suggest that the mortgage strikes are affecting at least 100 residential property projects in 50 cities. In a research note, Capital Economics said the strikes reflected anxiety about whether homes will be completed \u201cas well as some discontent about declines in new home prices, which have left many buyers sitting on paper losses\u201d. It estimated that construction has been halted on about 13m apartments during the past year, indicating that some 4tn yuan of debt ($600bn) \u2013 or about 10% of the total \u2013 could be snarled up in the crisis. Second, home sales are still in the doldrums and show little sign of recovery amid Covid lockdowns, rising unemployment and uncertainty about the delivery of completed homes. Sales fell at a slower rate in May than in previous months but are starting from a low base, having plunged to their worst level since 2006. From January to May, property sales were down 23.6% on the same period the year before. Third, there is trouble brewing in the financial markets, where investors are fearful that there are more corporate busts to come. The concerns sent the value of bonds sold by property companies falling sharply last week, along with property shares on the Chinese stock market. One troubled firm, Shimao, this month missed a payment on a $1bn bond, blaming \u201csignificant changes to the macro environment of the property sector\u201d. Country Garden, the biggest developer of all, saw a bond due for redemption in 2024 fall to less than 50 cents on the dollar, according to data from Bloomberg. Even the mighty Shanghai-based Greenland, which owns prestige schemes all over the world, including Pacific Park in Brooklyn and the Spire in London\u2019s Canary Wharf, has been dragged into the mess. Last month it was downgraded to \u201cselective default\u201d by the rating agency S&amp;P Global, after it extended the maturity of its $500m bonds by one year. Questions are now being asked about whether the country\u2019s opaque banking system will be able to withstand the impact of bad debts on such a massive scale \u2013 especially as outrage grows among the population. Loss of confidence The protests are another sign of the loss of confidence in the system that has created a huge amount of wealth in China but which now looks increasingly precarious. Many experts think the banking system will absorb the losses with help from the central government, but the rapidly worsening balance sheets of local governments, whose sale of land parcels to developers was the starter motor for the country\u2019s stratospheric growth, are yet another area of concern. Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank in Shanghai, said policymakers in Beijing were now facing a \u201chuge dilemma\u201d in solving the homebuyer crisis. \u201c80% of China\u2019s residential housing was built with prepaid schemes. So even if the central bank would like to salvage the sector, it\u2019d be impossible to do so without lowering mortgage rates. \u201cThey will also need to find ways to lessen property companies\u2019 debt pressures without loosening the official \u2018three red-lines\u2019, a strict policy aimed at constraining property developers\u2019 debt. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d Although the indebtedness varies from region to region, the crisis is serious enough for the rating agency S&amp;P to warn that municipal China faces a \u201cshowdown\u201d as falling revenue from land sales and the massive cost of Covid lockdowns \u2013 local governments are expected to pick up the tab for mass testing \u2013 come home to roost. \u201cWe calculate that 10% to 30% of local and regional governments will run up against prudential thresholds on fiscal risk by end 2022,\u201d the analysts said, meaning that they might not be able to repay their debts and could be placed in special measures by central government."

            "content": "1. Why does inflation happen and what can be done about it? Vicky Pryce Chief economic adviser at the Centre for Economics and Business Research and co-author with Andy Ross and Peter Urwin of It\u2019s the Economy, Stupid: Economics for Voters (Biteback) Inflation is an increase in the price of goods and services in an economy. High inflation means, effectively, that people can buy less with their money. This can happen for a number of reasons: a run on a country\u2019s currency that increases prices of imported goods; a large stimulus to the economy when the system is already at or near full capacity; a strongly unionised labour force exercising its bargaining power; a sudden shortage of labour (following Brexit, for example) or international cost-push factors outside an individual country\u2019s direct control. The latter happened at the time of the two oil crises of the 1970s, and it\u2019s happening again now. Central banks aim to keep inflation low and steady. When it gets too high, there are various measures they can take, including raising interest rates, reducing money supply, raising taxes to contain spending or implementing a prices policy to keep certain prices at least under control. The French, for example, have forced their energy companies to keep electricity price increases to households to no more than 4% this year, which has kept inflation lower in France than in other European countries. The problem now is that demand-pull inflation, which we experienced when Covid restrictions were lifted and the economy surged, has turned into cost-push inflation, determined not by wage growth but by the war in Ukraine, which has sent energy and food prices soaring. No central bank by itself can do much about this, except through lowering growth and possibly bringing about a recession \u2013 or even depression. To go deeper For a great historical perspective on inflation read The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath: The Past and Future of American Affluence by Robert J Samuelson (Random House). 2. Why do interest rates matter? Edward Chancellor Economic historian and author of The Price of Time: The Real Story of Interest (Allen Lane) Most economists regard the interest rate solely as a policy lever to be used for controlling inflation. Thus, when inflation falls below the central bank\u2019s target, which in most developed countries is set at 2%, interest rates come down and stay down. Low rates encourage individuals, companies and countries to borrow, and to spend, boosting economic growth. This is what happened over the past decade. But when inflation climbs above the target level, as it has done in recent months, rates are hiked, incentivising saving, rather than spending or borrowing. In theory, as demand for goods falls, so do prices, bringing down inflation. After the global financial crisis of 2008, central bankers conducted an unprecedented experiment with zero and, in some places, negative interest rates. They successfully prevented a repeat of the Great Depression, when a bout of deflation \u2013 a sharp decline in the level of consumer prices \u2013 destroyed the US banking system. But among the unintended consequences of this monetary experiment have been a surge in global debt, a proliferation of speculative bubbles, weak household savings and much wasteful investment, accompanied by stagnant economic growth. Now interest rates are rising and people are finding out that they are less wealthy than they believed they were. Companies and governments are having to pay more to service their debts. Emerging markets that borrowed too much have started to default. The German central banker Hjalmar Schacht got it right when he said in 1927: \u201cDon\u2019t give me a low rate. Give me a true rate, and then I shall know how to keep my house in order.\u201d To go deeper A History of Interest Rates by Sidney Homer and Richard Sylla is a classic account of lending practices over the course of four millennia. 3. What is the role of the war in Ukraine? Gillian Tett US editor-at-large at the Financial Times, and author of Anthro-Vision: How Anthropology Can Explain Business and Life (Cornerstone) Even before war erupted in Ukraine, western central banks and economic policymakers were caught between a rock and a hard place. Growth seemed likely to slow down, after a post-Covid rebound. But consumer prices were surging on the back of supply chain bottlenecks. The latter created pressure for central banks to raise interest rates, but the former suggested they should wait. The war in Ukraine has made the policy dilemma far nastier. On the one hand it has sparked sharp increases in energy prices and other commodities, pushing inflation above 8% in America, and 6% in Europe. That increased pressure on central banks to raise rates. At the same time, business and consumer confidence is crumbling in western economies. In short, we face a phenomenon we have not seen for almost 50 years: stagflation, or inflation amid recession, in combination. Since the financial crisis in 2008, regulators have tried to strengthen the financial system. But many financiers have tried to avoid the new controls by moving funds into less regulated, non-bank corners of finance, such as hedge funds, loan vehicles or the so-called \u201cprivate\u201d markets, away from public platforms. This has left regulators looking like a plumber in a house where the pipes have been reconfigured, not knowing exactly what will happen to the water pressure until it is turned on. To go deeper If you want to understand what is really driving the global economic system today, and all the half-hidden financial flows that knit countries together, read Adam Tooze\u2019s Substack. 4. What can the Bank of England do to help? Rupal Patel and Jack Meaning Economists at the Bank of England and authors of Can\u2019t We Just Print More Money? Economics in Ten Simple Questions (Cornerstone) The Bank of England\u2019s role is to ensure that, over time, prices rise as predictably as possible at a rate that is not too fast and not too slow. Specifically, we are tasked with keeping price growth at 2% a year. We have a committee of rate setters whose job it is to make sure this happens and who are democratically accountable to parliament. At times when prices are going up too fast, meaning that the money in people\u2019s pockets is losing its value too quickly, the Bank\u2019s role is to slow that process and bring inflation back down. To do this it can increase interest rates and slow, or reverse, the rate of money creation (known as quantitative tightening). Ultimately this acts to reduce how much people spend and, subsequently, cools price rises. The trick is to do this just enough to bring price growth (inflation) back down to where we want it, but not so far that it risks prices growing too slowly or falling. That is the narrow tightrope that the Bank\u2019s rate setters are navigating. The decision to cool the economy in this way is not without consequence. It can impact economic growth and people\u2019s jobs. However, the alternative, a world in which price rises accelerate and become undesirably high on a permanent basis, is much worse over the longer run, particularly for some of the most vulnerable in society. That is why the Bank of England\u2019s clearly defined, independent role is so important.

What could / should the government be doing? Mariana Mazzucato Professor at University College London and author of Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism (Allen Lane) The UK economy is plagued by lagging productivity, stagnant wages and low economic growth, all of which are now compounded by the cost of living crisis. It is energy prices and corporate profits, not wages, that are driving the current inflationary pressures: corporate profits in the UK have increased by 34% since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, 90% of those increases made by the top 25 multinationals. To address both the current inflation and the longer-term problems, we need to restructure the UK\u2019s overly financialised economy. By simply adding more loans to the system \u2013 for example help to buy \u2013 the government has made the ratio of private debt to disposable income rebound to what it was at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis. The current business model is wedded to short-term profits, which has meant that many companies are not investing their profits back into the system but extracting them through practices such as share buybacks, which boost share prices and stock options for executives. To tackle inflation, the UK government has implemented an energy profits levy, a 25% windfall tax on the profits of UK energy firms for the next 12 months. This is a step in the right direction, but it must go further. Government loans, grants and bailouts should be made only on the condition that profits are reinvested, and that they foster a green transition. To go deeper The Code of Capital by Katharina Pistor shows that so many of the dysfunctionalities of modern day capitalism have their roots in corporate law and how intellectual property rights are governed. The Ezra Klein Show podcast navigates the world of economics and politics through an incisive, entertaining lens. 6. Will the crisis eventually bring down house prices? Josh Ryan-Collins Associate professor in economics and finance at UCL and author of Why Can\u2019t You Afford a Home? (Polity Press) The latest figures show UK house prices rising at the fastest rate for 18 years. However, this could well be a temporary phenomenon. Many middle- and higher-income households still have significant savings built up from the Covid-19 period, and buyers may be rushing to lock in still-attractive mortgage interest rates before expected rate rises by the Bank of England. Within a few months, these factors could have played out and falls in disposable income \u2013 driven especially by the increase in price caps on energy bills, due in October \u2013 will be substantially reducing first-time buyers\u2019 ability to save for a deposit. This, coupled with higher rates, will reduce the appetite for taking on big mortgages for both prospective and existing homeowners seeking to trade up. Rising rates should, in theory, make property less attractive as a financial asset; although housing can also be viewed as a good hedge against inflation. However, a gradual fall in property prices looks more likely than a bust at this point. Employment is at historic highs and the labour market remains very tight. Wages look more likely to increase than fall, in the medium-term at least. Besides, if the housing market does start to look shaky, you can bet (your house) on the government intervening to prop up demand. To go deeper Whose Housing Crisis? Assets and Homes in a Changing Economy by Nick Gallent (Policy Press, 2019) clearly and correctly identifies the key challenge for housing affordability in the UK: the irresolvable paradox of treating housing both as a financial asset and a place to live. 7. How can we increase productivity? Do we all need to work harder? Diane Coyle Bennett professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge and a director of the Productivity Institute The UK fares poorly on productivity compared with some similar economies. At its broadest, productivity is how effectively an organisation (a business or government agency) or a country turns the resources it has into useful outputs. It has nothing to do with how hardworking or lazy people are; it grows when workers have better equipment and software to work with. Productivity has varied greatly between eras, growing fastest in the mid-20th century but flatlining since the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 the slowdown being most pronounced in some of the UK\u2019s best-performing industries, such as pharmaceuticals, finance and software. Productivity trends are driven by waves of technological innovation but also by national context: does pure research get converted into commercial revenues? Is there adequate national infrastructure, or training for technical skills? Can startups thrive? Can investors rely on stable government policies? The answer to such questions in the UK is often no, hence the disappointing comparison with other rich economies. This matters, because productivity is the measure of whether living standards are improving. It gives the economy extra output with no need for additional labour, material or capital. Bringing inflation down will be harder here than in countries that are more productive, because we will have to do more to squeeze growth in order to rein in inflation. To go deeper For all you ever wanted to know about productivity, try the Productivity Puzzles podcast \u2013 the first episode is about why productivity matters. 8. Would the British people be better off if we had stayed in the EU? Will Hutton Writes for the Observer and is author with Andrew Adonis of Saving Britain: How We Must Change to Prosper in Europe (Abacus) If you measure \u201cbetter off\u201d in terms of pounds, shillings and pence there is no question that everyone is the poorer for Brexit. There is no branch of economic activity that has not been damaged to some extent by the new intense trade frictions with our largest market. British exports of goods and services to the EU are now subject to scrutiny of their content, standards and probity that did not exist as EU members. Many imports have been similarly damaged. Investment by British and foreign companies has decreased as a result. Consequently, everyone\u2019s wages and salaries are lower than they would otherwise have been \u2013 a loss made more acute by the higher inflation rate. Only pensioners reliant on the state pension and inflation-proofed private pensions are no worse off \u2013 one reason, many pollsters think, that so many older people are Brexit supporters. The trade and investment losses will continue for many years, and the economic scarring will be permanent. But for true Leavers, \u201c better off\u201d should be defined more broadly. Britain has won the precious gift of \u201csovereignty\u201d and control of its borders, ending the untrammelled free movement of EU citizens into the UK. However, Britain needs a larger workforce to support its current level of output, so immigrants are arriving from the rest of the world. Unless you believe the psychic benefit of \u201csovereignty\u201d trumps poverty, Brexit has made Britain poorer. To go deeper Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain by Fintan O\u2019Toole is a clear-eyed, devastating account of the delusions of Brexit \u2013 and the self-delusions of its architects. 9. We are the fifth largest economy in the world. Why are so many people poor? John McDonnell MP Former shadow chancellor and editor of Economics for the Many (Verso) There are 14.5 million people in poverty in Britain, including 4.3 million children. Two-thirds of those children are in a household where someone is in work. If you are in work, even if your company is booming, you have little say over whether you will benefit from its profits. If your landlord increases your rent or threatens eviction, or if your mortgage company fails to pass on interest rate cuts, you are largely powerless. The prices of the basic goods you need to live on are set by a small group of multinational companies that between them carve up the market and set the prices to profiteer. So it\u2019s a statement of the obvious that poverty is caused by the combination of low incomes and high living costs faced by many British people. But what brought this about? Since the late 1970s, neoliberalism has dominated government policymaking in Britain. This is a school of economic thought that sees markets as the optimum means to organise an economy. Its adherents believe that if you cut taxes for the rich and corporations, wealth will automatically \u201ctrickle down\u201d from the top. But we\u2019ve seen over the course of the past decades that this is not the case. The profits of big business and executive pay have soared, while the proceeds of that wealth have not been shared, because trade union rights have been undermined, producing low wage, insecure employment. To go deeper Rewriting the Rules of the European Economy by the Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz is excellently succinct, and explodes many of the myths about neoliberalism. 10. Could there be any environmental benefits to an economic slowdown? Chaitanya Kumar Head of environment and green transition at the New Economics Foundation Slowdowns or recessions are brought on by a drop in output in an economy, which more often than not tends to result in a drop in carbon pollution. However, such benefits are small and short lived, and they can go on to trigger a counterproductive rise in pollution. Take the Covid-induced global recession as an example. In 2020, global emissions fell by 6.4%. Scientists have told us that to have the faintest chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, we would need to cut carbon emissions by 7.6% per year for the next decade. And since 2020, consumption has rebounded and emissions have jumped to their highest recorded levels. But perhaps the biggest danger in the long term is the tendency of policymakers to cut public spending in recessions. This has generally meant savage cuts to the green investments that we desperately need. In the UK, the 2008 financial crash triggered austerity and the slashing of what David Cameron infamously referred to as \u201cgreen crap\u201d. More recently the government has ignored calls for public investment in dealing with the growing food poverty crisis, choosing instead to abandon its much-trumpeted commitment to raising environmental standards in farming and reducing meat consumption. Ultimately, no nation has fully decoupled economic growth from carbon emissions, and this is the challenge we urgently need to solve. Recessions are undoubtedly opportunities to accelerate new economic thinking. But we shouldn\u2019t comfort ourselves that they are a way to protect the environment. To go deeper This Changes Everything by Naomi Klein shows why we cannot tackle climate change without fixing our broken economies first."

            "date": "2022-07-21T12:37:02Z",
            "content": "On Thursday morning, 45 years to the day since he was first elected to parliament, Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as the eighth president of Sri Lanka, replacing the ousted and exiled Gotabaya Rajapaksa. His path to executive power \u2013 the office Wickremesinghe has clamoured after for so many years \u2013 was extraordinary. As a searing editorial in Sri Lanka\u2019s Daily FT newspaper put it on Thursday morning: \u201cWickremesinghe has no popular mandate and he has won the presidency by proxy.\u201d Many believe Wickremesinghe\u2019s election, far from stabilising Sri Lanka after the toppling of Rajapaksa, will instead create ongoing turmoil and unrest. For a country grappling with the worst economic crisis since the great depression, the consequences could be severe. Those in the Aragalaya protest movement, formerly fixated on the Rajapaksas, have vehemently turned their attention to the resignation of Wickremesinghe, once again uniting a movement that is otherwise riddled with competing political and social agendas. Wickremesinghe is widely seen by protesters as the epitome of the political establishment they have vocally rejected. He stands accused of manipulating the political system to his advantage, and taking on the role of president with no public support, no legitimacy and no mandate. \u201cWe will have to throw him out,\u201d said one protester, Anura Goonarata, on Wednesday. \u201cSometimes you have to shed blood to see change happen.\u201d Yet the crisis goes deeper than Wickremesinghe. For months, an unprecedented number of Sri Lankans have been protesting on the streets calling for political change and an end to the undemocratic system of executive presidency, and made their dislike of Wickremesinghe clear. The decision of elected lawmakers to vote him in as president regardless has widely been seen as evidence that parliament is working in direct opposition to the will and voice of the people. \u201cThe legitimacy of not just the president and the prime minister, but the parliament itself has been lost,\u201d said Ahilan Kadirgamar, a political economist and senior lecturer at the University of Jaffna. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that the ability for the protest movement to work with this parliament has become very difficult, so we are now looking at a more confrontational scenario.\u201d It was just two years ago that Wickremesinghe was facing the most humiliating defeat of his political career. After five years as prime minister, his reputation was in tatters and his party, the once-powerful United National party, had fallen apart. It won less than 3% of the vote in the 2020 parliamentary elections and not a single candidate won their seat for MP. It was only because of Sri Lanka\u2019s system of proportional representation that Wickremesinghe could re-enter parliament through a national list, making him the sole UNP lawmaker. But it is not for nothing that Wickremesinghe is known as \u201cthe fox\u201d and the \u201cking of comebacks\u201d: in recent days the rallying protest cry on the streets has been against \u201cDeal Ranil\u201d, a reference to decades of sly political manoeuvring. It was thanks to an opaque backdoor deal with President Rajapaksa \u2013 who desperately needed an ally to come in to help prop up his regime, in the face of a collapsing government and mass protests \u2013 that Wickremesinghe became prime minister in May. By default, he was then made president after Rajapaksa resigned, and then became eligible to be a presidential nominee. Wickremesinghe, however, has seemed untroubled by his lack of political mandate. After becoming prime minister in May, he directly compared himself to the former British prime minister Winston Churchill who \u201conly had four members backing him in 1939. How did he become prime minister? Because of the crisis. I have done the same.\u201d Instead it was Rajapaksa\u2019s party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party (SLPP), that used its majority in parliament to elect Wickremesinghe as president in Wednesday\u2019s secret ballot. Many view it as the latest in a long history of alleged Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe collusion. Wickremesinghe\u2019s close friendship with Mahinda Rajapaksa is well known. In 2015, when Wickremesinghe became prime minister, his promises to investigate corruption allegations into the Rajapaksa family came to nothing. Wickremesinghe is now seen to be entirely dependent on the SLPP \u2013 and by default the Rajapaksas who still have considerable influence over the party \u2013 given that he is a president without a single MP from his own party and no other base of support in parliament. Notably, Mahinda Rajapaksa sat in the front row of Wickremesinghe\u2019s swearing-in ceremony on Thursday. His outraged response, hours after his election, at the suggestion by reporters he has a close relationship with the Rajapaksas \u2013 \u201cHow am I an old friend of the Rajapaksas? When did I know the Rajapaksas? I\u2019ve been opposing them all this time\u201d \u2013 therefore rang very hollow to many. There are few in Sri Lanka who believe Wickremesinghe will be the man to finally hold the Rajapaksas to account after all these years, either over corruption or Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s accusations of war crimes during the civil war, as the public are demanding. Wickremesinghe\u2019s weak political position as president may have other concerning consequences. In recent days he has made overtures to the military, in an apparent attempt to strengthen his support, leading to worries that he could open the door to an increasing prominence of the military in politics. He was quick to declare a state of emergency after he became president, which came with even more draconian police powers than when it was declared under Rajapaksa. He has also sought to cast protesters as groups infiltrated by \u201cfascists\u201d and \u201cextremists\u201d who have broken the law, in what many see as a precursor to an impending violent crackdown on the movement. But in the face of what Kadirgamar described as Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cgreat revolt\u201d, he saw it as highly unlikely that Wickremesinghe would make it to the end of the presidential term in November 2024, as protests are set to resume with increased vigour in the next few months. Yet the pressing worry remains that any continued political turmoil will hinder any chance of tackling the economic crisis, which is swiftly becoming a humanitarian crisis. While Wickremesinghe has promised a deal with the International Monetary Fund is near conclusion, and currency swaps with foreign countries are in the works, Sri Lanka will require more than outside foreign assistance to get it back on the path to recovery. \u201cRanil has zero credibility with the people,\u201d said Kadirgamar. \u201cTherefore he cannot provide the strong leadership that is needed to get Sri Lanka out of this crisis.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-06T17:16:44Z",
            "content": "Investors in the British pharmaceuticals giant GSK have voted to approve a demerger of its consumer brands into a new company, Haleon, firing the starting gun on the largest London stock market listing in a decade. Shares in Haleon are scheduled to start trading on Monday 18 July, after investors in GSK \u2013 previously GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 voted to approve the demerger. The FTSE 100 company won 99.8% of the votes cast at a general meeting on Wednesday at a hotel by London\u2019s Heathrow airport. Haleon, whose portfolio of brands will include Sensodyne toothpaste and Advil and Panadol painkillers, is expected to seek a valuation of as much as \u00a345bn. The approval paves the way for a listing which will be used to gauge the financial strength of the City of London after Brexit, with the formation of a company all but certain to join its current owner on the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares. The last stock market listing on a similar scale was mining and commodity company Glencore\u2019s entry at a \u00a338bn market value in 2011. London looks set to lose out to New York for the planned return to public markets of Arm, the Cambridge chip designer owned by Japan\u2019s Softbank. The UK government has lobbied hard for Arm to have a secondary listing in London, amid concerns it could lose out on another large UK-based flotation. The London Stock Exchange has been described as in \u201csecular decline\u201d, with a fall in the number of listed companies from more than 4,400 in the early 1960s to fewer than 1,200 today. Morrison\u2019s supermarket exited the exchange last year, the biggest in a wave of private equity takeovers triggered when share prices fell during the pandemic. Haleon will employ 23,000 employees across 100 countries. Its operations made revenues of \u00a39.5bn and profits of \u00a31.6bn in 2021, according to its prospectus for the share offer. Haleon \u2013 whose name references \u201chale\u201d, a synonym for healthy, and \u201cleon\u201d, which contains the Latin for \u201clion\u201d \u2013 has nine multinational brands, also including Voltaren pain relief and Centrum supplements, which account for nearly 60% of revenues. Sir Dave Lewis, the former chief executive of Tesco, has been designated as the non-executive chair of the company. Brian McNamara, a former Procter &amp; Gamble and Novartis executive, will continue to lead the company, having led it as a division of GSK since 2016. Bankers, lawyers and advisers will rake in as much as \u00a3117m in transaction costs related to the demerger, according to the prospectus. GSK board members, including chief executive Emma Walmsley, faced a mixed reception at the meeting. One individual shareholder called for a round of applause for carrying out the demerger, but others questioned the logic of the deal and whether it was a mistake to turn down a \u00a350bn offer at the end of last year from Unilever, another FTSE 100 consumer goods company. Analysts at Credit Suisse have since ascribed Haleon an equity valuation of \u00a333bn, while other analysts value it at up to \u00a340bn, plus a debt pile worth more than \u00a310bn after paying dividends worth \u00a37bn to GSK and \u00a33bn to Pfizer. GSK had argued Unilever\u2019s bid undervalued the company \u2013 although that was before the prospect of rising interest rates hit global stock market indices, and the energy price shock threatened to cause recessions across the world. \u201cI think it is really a disservice to the shareholders to have to suffer such a consequence,\u201d said one shareholder. However, Sir Jonathan Symonds, GSK\u2019s chair, said Haleon had a \u201cvery competitive growth profile\u201d and that its sales would prove resilient in the context of rising inflation in many economies around the world. Haleon\u2019s products, which are sold over-the-counter without prescription, will provide a \u201cvery quick and good way that consumers can get access to medicines\u201d, he said. \u201cWe stand here poised with two very attractive companies with the opportunity to grow,\u201d Symonds said, referring to GSK and Haleon. After the demerger is complete, GSK shareholders will own 54.5% of Haleon, while GSK will still own about 6% and control a further 7.5%. GSK\u2019s pharma rival Pfizer will initially own nearly a third of the company, which was formed in 2019 as a joint venture, albeit with the US company owning a minority. Pfizer has said it will gradually sell down its stake after the listing."

Shares tumbled in London and across Europe as a jump in natural gas prices intensified the strain on the European economy. The single currency fell by 1.5% to $1.025 against the US dollar, the lowest since late 2002. The pound dropped below the $1.20 mark to a two-year low of $1.19, the weakest point against the dollar since March 2020.

Mining stocks, oil producers and airlines were among the big fallers in London, where the FTSE 100 share index dropped by 2.8%, or 207 points, to 7025. North Sea oil producer Harbour Energy slumped 9.6%, while Shell fell 8.5% and Anglo American and Glencore both lost 8%. Germany\u2019s DAX index lost 3%, and France\u2019s CAC fell 2.8%. Investors are anxious that rate hikes by central banks desperate to tackle soaring inflation will push economies into recession. Further disruption to Russian energy supplies would also trigger a European downturn, analysts have warned. \u201cEveryone is looking for peak inflation, but we\u2019re probably at the point where it\u2019s at its most dangerous as it becomes sticky,\u201d Neil Wilson of Markets.com said. \u201cHigh and sticky inflation is the worst combination since it means expectations have been unanchored. This will only push the Federal Reserve and other central banks to inflict more pain.\u201d A jump in natural gas prices on Tuesday, after strike action forced Norway\u2019s Equinor to shut three oil and gas fields, added to concerns over the economic outlook. \u201cThe panic crept back in on Tuesday as a fresh surge in natural gas prices upset the uneasy calm,\u201d said Raffi Boyadjian, the lead investment analyst at XM. \u201cFears that the energy crisis in Europe is about to get a whole lot worse sank the euro, which plummeted to the lowest since late 2002, crashing below the $1.03 level. Aside from the threat of Russia cutting off gas supplies to Germany and other European importers, a strike at several gas fields in Norway is fuelling the supply concerns,\u201d Boyadjian added. A survey of purchasing managers showed that business growth across the eurozone has slowed to a 16-month low, as manufacturing output fell and the cost of living crisis hit spending on services. Stocks fell in New York as traders returned to their desks after the Independence Day break. The S&amp;P 500 index dropped 2% in early trading, having already slumped by 20% in the first half of this year. The yield, or interest rate, on UK, US and eurozone government bonds also tumbled on Tuesday, as concerns about economic growth hit risk appetite and increased demand for safer assets."

(Ever since my own teen years, I have been waiting for an interviewer to ask John if he ever saw an opponent\u2019s ball called out when it was obviously in, and was tempted to scream with perfectionist rage against his own interests.) McEnroe is an engaging raconteur: funny and disarming about his excessive drug use \u2013 specifically cocaine \u2013 under the influence of Dionysiac sensualist and Studio 54-habitu\u00e9 Vitas Gerulaitis back in the good old days of the wooden racket and the disco glitter ball. It surely exacerbated his alarming temper. \u201cPeople today use performance-enhancing drugs,\u201d says McEnroe. \u201cWe used performance-detracting drugs.\u201d And as for drugs not being good for you, McEnroe cheerfully says: \u201cThey were good so you can appreciate your life a little more \u2026\u201d McEnroe can still summon a snarl when he remembers being told off by the grumpy Wimbledon authorities for not showing up to the champions\u2019 dinner and doing the traditional dance with ladies\u2019 champ Martina Navratilova: \u201cBig fucking deal!\u201d But the awful truth is that the good times were when he was on the way up, culminating in the mythic encounters with Bj\u00f6rn Borg. Being and staying at the top was lonely and stressed; McEnroe\u2019s invincibility inevitably cracked as the 80s wore on, and the road back down was unpleasant, complicated by his disintegrating marriage to Tatum O\u2019Neal and his complex relationship with his father-slash-manager John McEnroe (who is shown reprimanding an interviewer for calling him \u201cJohn McEnroe Sr\u201d \u2013 he is just \u201cJohn McEnroe\u201d, he says; his son is \u201cJohn McEnroe Jr\u201d). John had to fire his dad as his manager because, he said, he wanted a real relationship with him. Doubtless that\u2019s true for the most part, although I wonder if a part of both men knew that he was firing his dad because he thought a professional manager could reverse his slump. I would have liked to hear more about McEnroe\u2019s participation in seniors\u2019 tournaments and his tremendous commentating career for the BBC. And I wondered if anyone was going to compare him with that other celebrity bad boy New Yorker and uber-winner with a formidable dad: Donald Trump. And what about his legacy? Did he normalise aggressive behaviour in tennis? It doesn\u2019t look like it; perhaps the group dynamic is that there is only ever room for one superbrat, and now it seems to be Nick Kyrgios. The film shows McEnroe pacing the night-time streets of New York: it\u2019s as good a metaphor as any for his restless personality. \u2022 McEnroe is released on 15 July in cinemas."

            "date": "2022-07-29T20:00:06Z",
            "content": "Four years ago Julie Lawson set up a business in Port Douglas, north Queensland, offering property owners who wanted to rent their house out on Airbnb a guest \u201cmeet-and-greet\u201d service. She started with four properties and expected it to stay small-scale \u2013 a semi-retirement plan. But after discovering a strong demand for her services, Bees Knees Holiday Rental and Property Services quickly expanded. Even throughout the closed-borders period of the pandemic, the number of places Lawson managed doubled. Partly because a \u201clot of properties were bought by southerners, which we\u2019ve taken on for them\u201d, she says. Today Bees Knees manages nearly 40 Airbnb properties in the Port Douglas area, and Lawson offers everything an absent Airbnb landlord can\u2019t \u2013 from property maintenance to passing on travel tips to guests. She employs an assistant and contracts out work to local cleaners, a linen hire company, an electrician, an air-conditioning servicer, a plumber, and two maintenance workers. She places regular orders for tea, coffee and other household products. \u201cWe try and keep everything local,\u201d she says. But now she\u2019s struggling to find staff who can afford to live close enough to help look after the properties. Airbnb arrived in Australia in 2012, and, since then, millions of international and domestic travellers have booked stays through the platform. It has brought with it a series of profound shifts; from a new willingness to do business with strangers over the internet and sleep in someone else\u2019s bed, to giving anyone the ability to live like a local in someone else\u2019s town. But it has also raised questions about the benefits of booming short-term accommodation, when locals have nowhere to live. The rise of \u201cmicro entrepreneurs\u201d, like Lawson, is one outcome of this decade\u2019s meteoric rise of digital platforms including Uber, Airtasker and Airbnb \u2013 known as the sharing economy \u2013 according to Dr Thomas Sigler, an economic and urban geographer from the University of Queensland. \u201cI think a lot of people vilify Airbnb and similar companies and think of them as exploitative \u2026 but there\u2019s also the idea that it does empower people,\u201d he says. Hundreds of thousands of Australian property owners have earned money on the platform. Research by Sigler and his colleagues at UQ shows that between 2016 and 2019, nearly 350,000 properties were listed at least once, with an average growth in listings of 2.43% a month. But the closed borders of the pandemic, Sigler says, slashed listings. Last year Prof Sara Dolnicar, a UQ tourism researcher, forecast that \u201ccoronavirus had disrupted the disrupter\u201d \u2013 that property investors would put their properties on the long-term market \u201cand never return to Airbnb\u201d. Now, she says: \u201cI was wrong. Where money can be made, everybody is flocking back into the short-term market.\u201d Airbnb has fundamentally changed how and where we travel. We make the bookings ourselves, rely on guest reviews instead of hotel star ratings, and collect keys not for a single room with a mini bar, but an entire house with bedrooms, a kitchen, even a lightly stocked pantry. According to Nicole Gurran, a professor of urban and regional planning at University of Sydney, the company\u2019s \u201cphenomenal marketing campaign\u201d has transformed the \u201cgeography\u201d of tourism. While once we looked for accommodation in well-established tourist zones, now the market is almost infinite. \u201cIt means any home in an attractive destination can be transformed into tourist accommodation overnight, as opposed to the time and the cost and the regulatory approvals that traditional tourism accommodation like hotels have faced,\u201d Gurran says. Residential neighbourhoods and villages are now accessible destinations \u2013 with the promise of a more \u201cauthentic\u201d travel experience. \u201cWith the idea that you go to a tourist destination and live where the locals live, I dare say Airbnb has sold us a product we didn\u2019t know we were looking for,\u201d says Gurran, whose (pre-pandemic) research demonstrated the extraordinary inroads Airbnb has made into popular destinations. For example, in Byron Bay, 17.6% of the entire housing stock is listed on Airbnb \u2013 equivalent to nearly half the town\u2019s rental accommodation. \u201cThe irony is that locals can now barely live in many of those places,\u201d she says. From couch surfing to management companies Airbnb has moved a long way from its original premise of the airbed in a spare room. (It was founded in 2008, after two flatmates in San Francisco rented out an air mattress on their living-room floor.) \u201cWhat people fell in love with initially was very close to couch surfing,\u201d Dolnicar says. \u201cIt was very personal, it was very connected, it was very local. Now that is not the case. Now it is just another accommodation provider.\u201d Sigler\u2019s analysis of Australian data shows that listings of entire homes has grown at a faster rate than shared accommodation, suggesting that it\u2019s becoming more \u201cprofessionalised\u201d and that \u201cincreasingly, management companies rather than individuals are leasing properties full-time\u201d. By definition, however, \u2018entire home listings\u2019 does not necessarily mean a property is leased year-round on Airbnb, and can include self-contained sections of larger properties. New research, as yet unpublished, by Sigler and his colleagues into the difference in rental return on short-term versus long-term rentals in Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast shows why Airbnb is an attractive option for landlords; short-term rentals attract a relatively higher premium, one that increases when a property is larger and close to a city centre or beach. Gurran says according to data from the independent data scraping service Inside Airbnb, the proportion of homes listed on Airbnb that are permanently reserved for holiday accommodation \u2013 as opposed to being hosted accommodation, in a home someone usually lives in \u2013 is more than a third. Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb manager for Australia and New Zealand, notes that the majority of properties are not listed year-round but rather on \u201can ad-hoc basis to help meet [hosts\u2019] mortgage repayments, pay bills or save for their retirement\u201d. Trish Burt, who runs Neighbours not Strangers, a lobby group that opposes short-term letting in residential areas, says she is in contact with people from all over Australia who face \u201ca living hell\u201d residing alongside holiday rentals: \u201cYou have no idea who is in your building, you have people mingling in corridors, you have people coming home drunk trying to get into your apartment, and you have people forced out of their living arrangements all together.\u201d According to Gurran, attempts to regulate the rise of Airbnb are widespread: \u201cYou look at New York, San Francisco, Dublin, Byron, Mornington \u2026 they have all had similar issues in terms of it consuming local housing stock and disturbing local residents \u2026 but all these jurisdictions have been forced into separate legal battles.\u201d These are not legal battles that Airbnb always needs to fight, as they are frequently waged by property owners. In one case, the Gold Coast council was sued by a company that owned 70 properties after the council tried to increase rates on holiday lets. Right across Australia, though, driven primarily by local councils faced with growing housing insecurity and complaints from locals, attempts are under way to regulate short-term rentals. Brisbane city council has increased rates on these properties, and Broome shire council is requiring them to register with local authorities. The New South Wales government has introduced a state planning policy that overrides local planning controls. It mandates a code of conduct and fire safety, and, in greater Sydney, limits unhosted listings to 180 days a year. Everywhere else in the state has no limits on the length of time a property can be rented out as an Airbnb, unless an exemption is granted. Byron Bay is negotiating for a 90-day cap. Burt says the NSW regulation will not address the primary issue of housing supply, and that the system prioritises investors over those who need a home: \u201cThe system has been flipped on its head.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s snuck into all the residential areas\u2019 In Port Douglas, where tourists are returning in droves, Lawson is having to put a cap on the amount of business she can take on. \u201cWe can\u2019t get cleaners, because they\u2019ve got nowhere to live,\u201d she says. For the guests she does host, she has to warn them to book in early to local restaurants \u2013 many of which are operating on reduced hours, because the dire lack of permanent housing in the region means they can\u2019t get staff. \u2018It\u2019s disastrous \u2013 it really is,\u2019 says the mayor, Michael Kerr, of the housing situation in Douglas shire. The rental vacancy rate is now 0.4%, the lowest it\u2019s been in more than 15 years, and local businesses are not able to take full advantage of the return of the tourist trade. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a really difficult place where we just don\u2019t have the accommodation for staff any more.\u201d Kerr, like many in the shire, places part of the blame on Airbnb. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of tourism areas within our planning scheme where Airbnb is absolutely welcome. Yeah, there\u2019s no issue there at all. But it\u2019s snuck into all the residential areas as well, which has become a real problem. These houses were built with the intention of housing employees.\u201d Experts agree that the reasons for the severe housing-supply shortage being experienced across Australia are complex \u2013 differing from region to region \u2013 and Airbnb is just one factor. But according to Gurran, the experience of Covid has starkly illustrated the impact of short-term rentals. Closed borders meant the demand for short-term accommodation evaporated and housing stock returned to the long-term rental market. Now that borders are open and stock is flooding back to the short-term market, rental vacancy rates in many areas are plunging. A study by the University of Sydney into the impact of short-term rentals in Tasmania found that in Hobart, 47% of Airbnb short-term rental properties had a long-term rental market history. It found the removal of just 195 houses from the private rental market can move the rental vacancy rate from 2% to a perilous 1%. In regional areas, especially those impacted by shocks like bushfires that destroyed housing stock, it is even more acute. In Eurobodalla, on the south coast of NSW, where hundreds of homes were destroyed over the summer of 2019-20 and the rental vacancy rate is now at 1%, the mayor has written to about 8,000 holiday home owners in the shire asking them to rent their houses out long-term to combat a housing crisis he called \u201ca social disaster of epic proportions\u201d. In that market, says Gurran, \u201canything taken out for tourism is going to bite\u201d. Airbnb\u2019s Wheeldon says housing affordability is \u201ca complex issue with a range of contributing factors such as population movements, the supply of new homes, the ratio of public housing, interest rates and broader economic conditions\u201d. And \u201cshort-term rentals generally comprise a tiny proportion of the overall property market \u2026 and also play an incredibly important role in growing Australia\u2019s economy and creating jobs\u201d. Sigler agrees that Airbnb is not the sole cause of the housing crunch. But crunch or no, he says it will continue, in part because many people simply like using it. \u201cIt\u2019s like Uber and taxis, right?\u201d he says. \u201cTaxi drivers don\u2019t like Uber but I think taxi drivers have realised that Uber is the future. So you can tax Ubers through the nose but people aren\u2019t going to go back to taxis. They don\u2019t want to have to call someone and talk to somebody to get a dispatcher \u2026 it\u2019s the exact same analogy with Airbnb. \u201cIt\u2019s not going away.\u201d"

            "content": "Turkey\u2019s official inflation rate increased to almost 80% last month \u2013 the highest in 24 years \u2013 as President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s unconventional economic policies continued to drive up the cost of living. The growth in annual prices rose from 73.5% in May to 78.6% in June, according to the Turkish statistics agency. However, opposition parties and economists said recent hikes in oil and gas prices meant the real rate of inflation was almost double the official figure. The minister of treasury and finance, Nureddin Nebati, has attempted to head off criticism of the government\u2019s handling of the economy, saying last week that consumer prices would start dropping by the end of the year. \u201cI promise to you and to the president, we will see a drop in inflation starting in December,\u201d Nebati said. His comments came after the government announced its second increase in the minimum wage in six months, raising pay by 30%. The increase lifted the monthly salary of about 40% of the workforce from $254 (\u00a3209) to $328. Erdo\u011fan has claimed that Turkey\u2019s problem is not inflation. \u201cWe do not have an inflation problem. We have a cost of living problem,\u201d he said last month. Economists said Turkey\u2019s official data disguised a more disturbing trend of rising prices that had shown no sign of abating. A monthly report release by Turkey\u2019s ENAG group of independent economists showed consumer prices had risen by 175% in June compared with a year earlier. ENAG said prices had risen by 71.4% since the start of 2022. The Istanbul chamber of commerce said inflation in Turkey\u2018s largest city had reached an annual rate of 94%. \u201cNo one actually believes official Turkish data any more,\u201d said Timothy Ash, an economist at BlueBay Asset Management. \u201cThere is no expectation of anything like a credible policy response.\u201d The growing dispute over the veracity of Turkey\u2019s official data is expected to be a difficult political issue for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government ahead of next year\u2019s general election, which is widely viewed as the toughest of his two-decade rule. Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the leader of the main opposition party, accused the state statistics agency of \u201clying\u201d, urging it in a tweet to \u201cstop committing crimes for the benefit of President Erdo\u011fan.\u201d A survey published by the Metropol polling agency on Friday showed 69% of respondents believed the unofficial ENAG figure and just 24% the one reported by the government. Turkey was hit hard by the fallout from the European debt crisis in 2012 and the threat of higher interest rates by the US Federal Reserve in 2013. Its currency tumble ever since. In 2013 the lira was worth 36p, compared with 4.9p on Monday. To arrest the decline, in 2018 Erdo\u011fan embarked on what he called a \u201cnew economic model\u201d, which meant setting aside rising inflation and cutting interest rates to boost economic growth. This was done against the advice of his central bank chief and caused the lira to plunge to a record low, pushing up costs in a country that is dependent on imported materials, especially energy. Inflation, which officially stood at 15% at the beginning of 2021, has now reached its highest level since a currency meltdown during the 1998 debt crisis that helped bring Erdo\u011fan to power. Three central bank bosses have been fired by the president since 2018. The Turkish lira has plummeted 20% this year alone."

            "date": "2022-07-27T14:35:57Z",
            "content": "Families are spending an average of \u00a389 more a month on energy, food and fuel than they were before the pandemic, Lloyds Banking Group said in a financial update, as it laid bare the impact of surging inflation on everyday customers. Lloyds\u2019 chief executive, Charlie Nunn, said about 20% of the bank\u2019s customers had had to adapt their spending \u201csignificantly\u201d to rising prices, forcing them to refrain from purchases such as white goods and computers. He added that customers had cancelled or blocked 2.2m subscriptions services such as Netflix since the summer of 2021, while about 1% of Lloyds customers were \u201creally struggling to make ends meet\u201d. UK households are being squeezed by soaring inflation, which hit a 40-year high of 9.4% last month. The figures came as Lloyds revealed it had struggled to boost profits in the second quarter, amid fears that rising prices could make it harder for borrowers to keep up with loan and mortgage payments long-term. The country\u2019s largest mortgage lender, which is considered a bellwether for the British economy, took a \u00a3200m charge between April and June as it put aside more money to protect the bank from potential defaults. That compares with the \u00a3374m it released during the same period last year. However, Nunn said the worst-off customers would not have borrowed money from the bank, and so would not be at risk of defaulting. He added that hundreds of staff were being trained to help struggling families manage their finances, while the bank stressed that the number of customers in arrears remained at \u201clow levels\u201d. The charge linked to potential defaults mostly offset an increase in income from loans and mortgages related to a jump in interest rates. Pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of June were in line with the same period last year at just over \u00a32bn, exceeding analyst estimates of \u00a31.6bn. UK banks have largely benefited from nine consecutive months of interest rate rises by the Bank of England, where policymakers have been trying to get soaring inflation under control. Rising rates are usually good news for bank finances, since banks are able to charge borrowers more for loans and mortgages, which in turn increases their net interest margin \u2013 a key measure of profitability and growth. Lloyds\u2019 net interest margin \u2013 the difference between what it earns from loans and pays for deposits \u2013 rose to 2.87% in the second quarter compared with 2.5% last year. However, Nunn said mortgage lending \u2013 which grew \u00a32.2bn over the quarter \u2013 was likely to slow over the coming months. \u201cWe are predicting a slowdown in mortgage growth and also a slowdown in house prices, but \u2026 we are also thinking we can continue to grow our lending [by] single digits in the next 12-18 months,\u201d he said. Lloyds\u2019 second-quarter figures came amid an economic slowdown, with the bank predicting little or no growth in gross domestic product over the rest of the year, and a 0.5% increase in 2023. That forecast will partly be affected by inflation peaking at 10-11%, before declining in the latter half of next year. Lloyds executives said they were still encouraged by forecasts for unemployment, which were expected to stay steady at just under 4%, while interest rates were expected to peak at about 2.25%. \u201cIt is a very different shock that we\u2019re experiencing, relative to the last 25 years in the UK history. But there\u2019s a lot to learn from some of those previous shocks that the economy has been through,\u201d Nunn said. He said it was worth considering how emerging economies had dealt with similar economic situations in recent years. \u201cI take a lot of personal experience from those experiences in places like Mexico, India, parts of other parts of Asia, where we saw really significant inflation, but employment rates [are] high. There\u2019s quite a lot to be learned from that.\u201d"

Instead of the 4.25% growth in 2021-22 as estimated by Treasury before the election, GDP growth will come in at 3.75%. Similar half-point reductions will apply to the current financial year, with the growth forecast now trimmed to 3% from 3.5%, and next financial year, when GDP will expand by 2% rather than the 2.5% forecast under the former government just months ago. Australia\u2019s inflation rate will accelerate further to \u201cnorth of 7%\u201d, Chalmers told ABC\u2019s RN Breakfast on Thursday morning. That\u2019s potentially higher than the 7% peak indicated for late this year by Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, and quicker than the 6.1% annual rate reported for the June quarter. Chalmers also told RN that it remained the government\u2019s \u201cexpectation\u201d that workers would start to see wage increases faster than the inflation rate during this term of parliament. Slowing GDP growth, though, would result in a \u201cmodest increase\u201d in the unemployment rate that now sits at a 48-year low of 3.5%.

Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, an IMF economist, said the world was \u201con the edge of a global recession\u201d. Growth in the two biggest economies was particularly marked down. The US, where interest rates were raised by 75 basis points for a second month in a row by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, may already have entered a technical recession as assessed by two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, the IMF said. The pace of rate rises is the fastest since the 1980s. For China, by far Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner, growth may slump to 3.3% in 2022. That\u2019s the lowest in more than four decades excluding the initial Covid-sparked drop in 2020, the IMF said. \u201cA sustained slowdown in China would have strong global spillovers, whose nature will depend on the balance of both supply and demand factors,\u201d it said. \u201c[F]urther tightening of supply bottlenecks could cause higher consumer goods prices worldwide, but lower demand might ease commodity pressures and intermediate goods inflation.\u201d After the June quarter consumer price index came in at 6.1% \u2013 the highest in 21 years \u2013 Chalmers told journalists inflation would \u201cget worse before it gets better, but it will get better\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chalmers\u2019 speech to parliament will also outline details of how slowing growth affected the new budget he plans to release in October. \u201cAustralia is outperforming much of the world, but that doesn\u2019t make it easier to pay the bills at home,\u201d he will say. \u201cOur high inflation is primarily but not exclusively global. It will subside but not overnight. \u201cWe have it within us to stare down these threats, steer our way through this difficult period, and seize the opportunities of this new age.\u201d Chalmers made it clear he was open to wage increases even if they contributed to further price rises. \u201cInflation is high and in the near term will get higher \u2013 but the primary cause of this is not higher wages \u2013 nowhere near it,\u201d he will say. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an inflation problem because workers are earning too much.\u201d The new treasurer will also use his statement to lay some of the blame for Australia\u2019s predicament on the Coalition. \u201cAustralians are paying a hefty price for a wasted decade,\u201d the speech says. \u201cThey know their new government didn\u2019t make this mess, but we take responsibility for cleaning it up.\u201d However, Chalmers has doused expectations that wage rises will soon reach the pace of price increases. \u201cThe idea that we would be forecasting wages growth that keeps up with that, I think would not be credible in the near-term,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday."

            "title": "Benefit deductions should be stopped until inflation falls, say MPs ",
            "date": "2022-07-26T23:01:02Z",
            "content": "Ministers\u2019 policy of clawing back hundreds of pounds a year from benefits has been criticised by MPs, who say it has tipped low-income families into destitution. About 2.4 million households \u2013 nearly half of all claimants on universal credit \u2013 have on average \u00a362 docked each month to repay benefit advances, tax credit overpayments and debts owed to landlords and utility companies. With energy and food prices soaring and benefit levels pegged way below inflation, the deductions often leave struggling households without enough money to afford food or pay their bills, forcing some claimants to turn to food banks to survive. The Commons cross-party work and pensions select committee urged ministers to give households extra \u201cbreathing space\u201d by suspending all benefit deductions until inflation dropped to a manageable level or benefits were increased to accurately reflect living costs. Stephen Timms, Labour chair of the committee, said: \u201cDeductions by [the] DWP from benefits are contributing to the hardship, and the government should give those struggling some much-needed breathing space by following its own advice to other creditors and pausing repayments until the threat of inflation recedes.\u201d The committee noted that while the government has urged creditors to accept reduced monthly repayments from households battling the cost of living crisis, it \u201cisn\u2019t following its own advice\u201d when it comes to deductions levied as a result of government policy rather than individuals\u2019 behaviour. The bulk of benefit deductions are for advance payments made to new universal credit claimants, introduced to help tide them over the built-in five-week wait for a first payment. They are interest-free but must be repaid from future benefit payments. Although the committee broadly welcomed the government\u2019s cost of living support package, it said the highest rate of inflation seen in the UK for 40 years \u2013 predicted to hit 11% in October \u2013 had exposed longstanding problems with the adequacy of the social security system. The benefits uprating mechanism, which set benefit increases in April using inflation estimates from the previous September, had effectively caused a real-terms fall in income for low-income families and was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, the MPs\u2019 report said. Timms said: \u201cA properly functioning social security safety net should be agile enough to respond to worsening economic conditions, but the high levels of inflation have laid bare the dysfunctional nature of parts of the system \u2013 not least that any increase in benefits is already seven months out of date when it takes effect.\u201d Ministers should review whether the standard levels of benefits, including disability benefits, are adequate, the report said. Cuts introduced from 2010 meant that UK social security spending would be about \u00a334bn lower next year than it was in 2010, the committee noted. It called for an urgent review of the benefit cap, which has been frozen at the same level since 2016, despite a statutory requirement to do so every five years. The committee noted that capped families did not even receive the 3.1% below-inflation benefits increase. A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise people are worried about the impact of rising prices, that\u2019s why we are providing \u00a337bn of additional cost of living support. This includes \u00a31,200 in direct payments for 8 million low-income households, most of whom received an initial \u00a3326 earlier this month. \u201cAs part of our support package, we have also frozen energy deductions on universal credit, meaning any new request from energy suppliers for bills to be paid directly from benefits, or for an existing payment to rise, is denied unless the claimant also requests it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-19T08:21:57Z",
            "content": "British workers\u2019 living standards dropped in May at a record rate after pay rises failed to keep pace with inflation. Earnings growth increased across the private and public sector by 4.3% in the three months to May excluding bonuses, the Office for National Statistics said, but that left pay down by 2.8% year on year \u2013 a record fall. Labour blamed the Conservative government for the fall in real wages, saying it \u201cleft people more exposed to inflation and the cost of living crisis\u201d. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said candidates in the Tory party leadership election should be mindful that \u201cUK workers are suffering the worst pay squeeze in modern history\u201d. She added: \u201cThe priority for the country must be to get wages rising across the economy \u2013 not tax cuts.\u201d Public sector workers fared much worse than those in the private sector, where pay growth was nearly five times faster. Average pay growth including bonuses for the private sector was 7.2% in the three months from March to May, while for the public sector it was 1.5%, leaving an average of 6.2%. The government is expected to announce pay awards for 2.5 million public sector workers on Tuesday, with reports that it will offer average pay increases of 5%. That would be well below the 9.1% rate of inflation, which is likely to rise above 11% in the autumn, according to the Bank of England. Strong bonus payments in some sectors gave a boost to the figures, the ONS said, with pay in the financial and professional services and construction sectors growing by 8.2% and 8.1%, respectively. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said it was \u201cstaggering\u201d that the top 1% of earners \u2013 those with pay packets above \u00a3170,000 \u2013 had secured an 11% pay rise. The ONS said the 4.3% increase in pay without bonuses marked a 2.8% fall in earnings against its preferred measure of inflation \u2013 the consumer prices index including housing (CPIH). Against the standard CPI measure of inflation, used by the Treasury and Bank of England, the drop in real pay over the three months to May was 3.7%, the TUC said. There was better news from figures showing that the number of people in employment jumped in May. More than 290,000 workers joined the labour market, about 120,000 more than forecast by City analysts. Meanwhile, unemployment remained steady at 3.8% and employers pushed up the level of vacancies to a fresh high. However, employers failed to attract many of the workers who quit the labour market during the pandemic, leaving the employment rate of 75.9% below pre-pandemic levels. Business groups complained that firms struggled to recruit staff, causing delays to orders and a loss of income. Jane Gratton, a senior official at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe labour market remains incredibly tight, in many cases affecting firms\u2019 ability to maintain normal operations. Although these figures show the employment rate has risen, it is having no noticeable impact on the overall number of job vacancies.\u201d She added that an acute shortage of workers was \u201cchoking off any hope of a recovery for many firms, as inflation, supply chain disruption and energy costs also add to their headaches\u201d. Matthew Percival of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said: \u201cPersistent labour and skills shortages are hitting growth and business investment, exacerbating the cost-of-living crisis. Boosting business confidence to accelerate growth should be front of mind for the current and next government.\u201d Bank of England officials are expected to raise interest rates when they meet next month, despite warnings of an impending recession and pay increases falling short of inflation. Analysts said the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) would focus on the tightness of the labour market after a much larger than expected increase in employment and how this could translate into higher pay rises as the year progresses. Many of the MPC\u2019s nine members fear that without higher interest rates to slow the economy, workers will drive wages towards the current 9.1% level of inflation, adding to business costs and pushing prices higher next year. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cMost indicators suggest that the labour market remains tight by historical standards. But there\u2019s still little evidence to suggest that tightness is being reflected in stronger pay growth. Regular pay growth was only a little more than half the pace of inflation over that period.\u201d The ONS head of labour market and household statistics, David Freeman, said: \u201cThe prospect of inflation moving higher in the autumn means that the MPC is likely to continue raising interest rates at its next few meetings. \u201cBut market pricing implying that bank rate will reach 2.75% by end-2022 looks overstated given the data continue to offer little evidence to validate the MPC\u2019s concerns about the risk of second round effects of inflation via higher wage growth.\u201d The Department for Work and Pensions minister Julie Marson highlighted data showing that 2 million more women had joined the labour market since 2010. She said the government was also targeting the over-50s who have left the labour market with support to encourage them back to work. There are about 1 million fewer workers in the economy than was forecast before the pandemic and it is understood from surveys that many of them are people over the age of 50 who suffered ill-health or took early retirement. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re keeping up our support to get people at any age or career stage into work, including a new multimillion-pound offer to help the over-50s get into and remain in employment,\u201d she said."

            "content": "The International Monetary Fund has said the global economy could soon be teetering on the brink of recession amid evidence that the world\u2019s three biggest economies are all stalling and inflation is higher than previously forecast. In a downbeat update to its April world economic outlook (WEO), the IMF cut its growth forecasts in 2022 and 2023 \u2013 and raised the prospect of a more pronounced slowdown. It said problems in the US, China and the eurozone had resulted in global output falling in the second quarter of this year \u2013 the first contraction since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThe outlook has darkened significantly since April,\u201d said the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. \u201cThe world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one.\u201d The Washington-based IMF said it now expected the global economy to grow by 3.2% in 2022 \u2013 a 0.4-point reduction since April. The slowdown is predicted to continue next year, when growth is now forecast to be 2.9% \u2013 0.7 points lower than had been pencilled in three months ago. The UK is forecast to grow by 3.2% in 2022 and by just 0.5% in 2023 \u2013 cuts of 0.5 and 0.7 points. The IMF expects the UK to slow down markedly in the second half of this year and to be the weakest of the G7 economies in 2023. \u201cThe global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,\u201d Gourinchas said. \u201cHigher than expected inflation, especially in the United States and major European economies, is triggering a tightening of global financial conditions. China\u2019s slowdown has been worse than anticipated amid Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns, and there have been further negative spillovers from the war in Ukraine.\u201d The IMF said that by the fourth quarter of 2022 it was forecasting global inflation of 8.3%, up from its April estimate of 6.9%. It identified the UK \u2013 where inflation is now on course to be 2.7 points higher at 10.5% \u2013 and the eurozone (up 2.9 points to 7.3%) as places where cost of living pressures had particularly intensified. A breakdown of the revised WEO forecasts showed growth downgrades in 2022 of 0.8 points in the US, 0.9 points in Germany and 1.1 points for China. In 2023, all the world\u2019s major economies apart from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia \u2013 both oil exporting countries \u2013 are now expected to grow more slowly. Only Japan and Canada of the group of major industrial nations are forecast to grow by more than 1% next year, with the IMF predicting expansion of 1% in the US and France, 0.8% in Germany and 0.7% in Italy. Gourinchas said there were a number of downside risks to the global economy that could result in an even weaker performance. These included: A sudden stop of European gas flows from Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine. Stubbornly high inflation. A debt crisis triggered by tighter global financial conditions. Further Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in China. Social unrest triggered by rising food and energy prices. Trade wars and geopolitical fragmentation. \u201cIn a plausible alternative scenario where some of these risks materialise, including a full shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, inflation will rise and global growth decelerate further to about 2.6% this year and 2% next year \u2013 a pace that growth has fallen below just five times since 1970,\u201d Gourinchas said. \u201cUnder this scenario, both the United States and the euro area experience near zero growth next year, with negative knock-on effects for the rest of the world.\u201d The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor said combatting inflation should be the top priority for policymakers, and he supported recent central bank decisions to raise interest rates. \u201cTighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship. Central banks that have started tightening should stay the course until inflation is tamed,\u201d he said. Governments could cushion the impact of the slowdown on the most vulnerable through targeted support, Gourinchas said, but the help should be paid for by higher taxes or lower public spending to ensure the job of central banks was not made harder."

            "content": "Rising worries about a European recession hit stock markets on Tuesday as the euro slumped to a two-decade low and the pound fell to its lowest since the start of the pandemic. Shares tumbled in London and across Europe as a jump in natural gas prices intensified the strain on the European economy. The single currency fell by 1.5% to $1.025 against the US dollar, the lowest since late 2002. The pound dropped below the $1.20 mark to a two-year low of $1.19, the weakest point against the dollar since March 2020. Oil also tumbled to its lowest since mid-May as recession fears mounted, with Brent crude falling by more than 9% to below $103 a barrel, and US crude dropping through the $100-a-barrel mark. Mining stocks, oil producers and airlines were among the big fallers in London, where the FTSE 100 share index dropped by 2.8%, or 207 points, to 7025. North Sea oil producer Harbour Energy slumped 9.6%, while Shell fell 8.5% and Anglo American and Glencore both lost 8%. Germany\u2019s DAX index lost 3%, and France\u2019s CAC fell 2.8%. Investors are anxious that rate hikes by central banks desperate to tackle soaring inflation will push economies into recession. Further disruption to Russian energy supplies would also trigger a European downturn, analysts have warned. \u201cEveryone is looking for peak inflation, but we\u2019re probably at the point where it\u2019s at its most dangerous as it becomes sticky,\u201d Neil Wilson of Markets.com said. \u201cHigh and sticky inflation is the worst combination since it means expectations have been unanchored. This will only push the Federal Reserve and other central banks to inflict more pain.\u201d A jump in natural gas prices on Tuesday, after strike action forced Norway\u2019s Equinor to shut three oil and gas fields, added to concerns over the economic outlook. \u201cThe panic crept back in on Tuesday as a fresh surge in natural gas prices upset the uneasy calm,\u201d said Raffi Boyadjian, the lead investment analyst at XM. \u201cFears that the energy crisis in Europe is about to get a whole lot worse sank the euro, which plummeted to the lowest since late 2002, crashing below the $1.03 level. Aside from the threat of Russia cutting off gas supplies to Germany and other European importers, a strike at several gas fields in Norway is fuelling the supply concerns,\u201d Boyadjian added. A survey of purchasing managers showed that business growth across the eurozone has slowed to a 16-month low, as manufacturing output fell and the cost of living crisis hit spending on services. Stocks fell in New York as traders returned to their desks after the Independence Day break. The S&amp;P 500 index dropped 2% in early trading, having already slumped by 20% in the first half of this year. The yield, or interest rate, on UK, US and eurozone government bonds also tumbled on Tuesday, as concerns about economic growth hit risk appetite and increased demand for safer assets."

            "date": "2022-07-28T21:14:16Z",
            "content": "Prices are rising in the US at the fastest rate in four decades. The Fed raised interest rates again. And new data showed the American economy shrank for a second consecutive quarter, intensifying fears of a recession and handing Republicans a potent line of attack just months before the midterm elections. For embattled Joe Biden, Thursday\u2019s gross domestic product figures were the latest in a string of worrying economic developments clouding his presidency this week. The news came as Democrats celebrated a breakthrough on the president\u2019s long-stalled economic agenda after Senator Joe Manchin announced his support for a version of the plan in a shock reversal for the West Virginia holdout. With control of Congress in the balance, Republicans seized on the turn of events to accuse Democrats of deepening economic disarray with their spending plans. Widespread pessimism about the state of the economy has shaped up to be Biden\u2019s biggest political vulnerability, weighing down his approval ratings and threatening Democrats\u2019 chances in November. Moments after the Bureau of Economic Analysis published the highly anticipated GDP report on Thursday morning, Republicans declared the economy well into the throes of \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s recession\u201d and blamed Democrats\u2019 policy initiatives for making life costlier for Americans. \u201cBiden and Democrats are responsible for our shrinking economy, and they\u2019re only trying to make it worse,\u201d said Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee. GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, fell by an annual rate of 0.09%, following a 1.6% annual decline in the first three months of the year, according to the commerce department. The numbers recorded two consecutive quarters of declining economic output, a common \u2013 but not official \u2013 definition of recession. On Thursday, Biden dismissed fears that the US was in a recession, arguing that the economy was \u201con the right path\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of chatter today on Wall Street and among pundits about whether we are in a recession,\u201d Biden said on Thursday afternoon. \u201cBut if you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment, we see signs of economic progress in the second quarter as well.\u201d In anticipation of the report, the White House has sought to convince Americans that two quarters of economic decline does not necessarily mean the US is in recession, particularly because unemployment remains low, job growth robust and household savings elevated. Biden stressed those sources of strength in the economy during an earlier appearance on Thursday, concluding: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a recession to me.\u201d The president also urged Congress to move quickly to pass his economic agenda that the White House argues will help ease the financial burden on American households by lowering the costs of healthcare and prescription drugs. Biden did pause to take a victory lap on Thursday, interrupting his meeting with the CEOs of five US businesses to announce that the House had enough votes to pass a sprawling bipartisan package designed to strengthen American manufacturing and increase the US\u2019s competitiveness against China. The bill, which next goes to his desk for signatures, will \u201cmake cars cheaper, appliances cheaper, and computers cheaper\u201d, Biden said in a statement. \u201cIt will lower the costs of every day goods.\u201d But Republicans said the Democrats\u2019 climate, healthcare and tax plan, formerly known as \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d and recast as the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d, would only cause further financial hardship, especially after they passed a $1.9tn coronavirus relief package last year. \u201cThe definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results,\u201d the Republican congressman Vern Gale Buchanan of Florida wrote on Twitter. \u201cYet here we are now entering a recession and Democrats are trying to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on Green New Deal priorities and raise taxes on America\u2019s job creators.\u201d Soaring inflation \u2013 now running at 40-year highs \u2013 led the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to increase interest rates in an effort to bring down prices, the second such increase in just over a month. Labelling the downturn a recession may be more politically charged than economically precise. Recessions are officially declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private research group, and usually only after the decline is over. \u201cBottom Line,\u201d Diane Swonk, chief economist for KPMG, said on Twitter, \u201cWe are not in a recession \u2013 yet. But the current environment is [not] healthy. The cure will be painful but is necessary to avoid an even worse outcome. Rock &amp; hard spot. Scars likely. Hard.\u201d The treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said the US economy is in a state of transition, from a period of fast-paced growth to a period of more sustainable growth. Recession, she explained, is generally viewed as a \u201cbroad-based weakening of our economy\u201d that includes \u201csubstantial job losses and mass layoffs, businesses shutting down, private sector activities slowing considerably\u201d. \u201cThat is not what we are seeing right now,\u201d she said. Yet even without an official determination of whether the US is in a recession, polling has found that most Americans believe it is: something likely to cause Democrats pain at the ballot box in November\u2019s crucial elections. According to a recent CNN poll, 64% of Americans \u201cfeel\u201d the economy is in recession, including 56% of Democrats and 63% of independents. The same survey found that four in 10 view the economy as \u201cvery poor\u201d, an 11-point rise since the spring. Biden defended his administration\u2019s actions, arguing that the economic stimulus plan was \u201cthe reason why we still had teachers in school, kids going to school, the reason why we had cops on the beat, the reason we had essential workers,\u201d during the depths of the pandemic. But he admitted that the \u201cvast majority of Americans have no idea what the recovery plan did\u201d. Now, with their congressional majorities hanging in the balance, Democrats must persuade voters to trust their economic leadership as they rush to pass Biden\u2019s economic agenda, which they vow will help, not hurt American pocketbooks. Manchin, who just weeks ago appeared to walk away from his party\u2019s economic plans over concerns that it would worsen inflation, said his newfound support for the measure was based on assurances that it would not. Explaining his decision, Manchin told reporters: \u201cThis is truly going to be around inflation reduction.\u201d"

            "content": "The US economy shrank again in the last three months, unofficially signaling the start of a recession. The commerce department announced Thursday that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of the price of goods and services \u2013 decreased at an annualized rate of 0.9% in the second quarter after falling at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first three months. The bad news will be a major blow for the Biden administration as it prepares for a tough midterm election season. White House officials have tried to tamp down talk of a recession, arguing that many parts of the economy remain strong. The growth rate stands in marked contrast to the robust 6.9% annual increase in GDP recorded in the final quarter of 2021 when the economy roared back from Covid shutdowns. The fast pace of growth contributed to soaring inflation \u2013 now running at 40-year highs \u2013 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to sharply increase interest rates in order to bring down prices. The changing economic environment was reflected in the GDP report. Consumer spending \u2013 the largest driver of the economy \u2013 slowed over the quarter but remained positive, rising 1% on an annual basis. Residential fixed investment, or home construction, dropped 14% on an annual basis and slowing business inventories, goods produced but not yet sold by businesses, dragged down the GDP number. Two quarters of negative GDP growth are widely regarded as a signal that the economy has gone into recession. But the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end. While the GDP figures will play into the NBER\u2019s final verdict, it also looks at a wider range of economic factors, including the jobs market, and is unlikely to give its decision soon. \u201cThe 0.9% annualized fall in GDP in the second quarter is disappointing but doesn\u2019t mean the economy is in recession,\u201d said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThat said, the details show that higher rates and surging inflation are weighing on underlying demand, and we expect only a muted rebound in economic growth over the second half of the year.\u201d In the meantime, pressure remains on the Biden administration. Surveys of consumer confidence are falling as recession fears grow and Joe Biden\u2019s overall and economic approval poll numbers are at the lowest levels of his presidency. In a statement, Biden said it was \u201cno surprise that the economy is slowing down as the Federal Reserve acts to bring down inflation. But even as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure.\u201d Republicans countered that the report shows \u201cDemocrats\u2019 reckless economic policies are destroying our economy\u201d. The latest GDP figures came a day after the Fed announced another three-quarter of a percentage point increase in its benchmark interest rates as it fights to tame inflation. Prices rose at an annual rate of 9.1% in the year to June, driven up by soaring costs for fuel, food and shelter. While parts of the US economy remain strong \u2013 most notably the jobs market \u2013 the Covid pandemic continues to play havoc with global supplies and the war in Ukraine has pushed up energy prices. The confusing economic outlook has triggered sell-offs in stock markets around the world and led some economists to predict a recession is coming. Nearly 70% of leading academic economists polled by the Financial Times last month predicted the US economy will tip into a recession next year. Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that he did not believe the US was now in a recession. But he said the Fed was prepared to keep raising rates in order to bring prices back down and that it was inevitable that such a move would slow the economy and affect the job market. \u201cPrice stability is what makes the whole economy work,\u201d said Powell."

            "date": "2022-07-14T03:29:49Z",
            "content": "The outlook for the global economy has \u201cdarkened significantly\u201d in recent months, the head of the IMF has warned, and the world faces an increasing risk of recession in the next 12 months. The commodity price shock from the war in Ukraine had exacerbated the cost-of-living crisis for hundreds of millions of people, Kristalina Georgieva said on Wednesday, and it was \u201conly getting worse\u201d. Inflation was also higher than expected, she said in a blogpost that came on the same day as the latest figures showed that prices in the US rose at a 40-year high of 9.1% in June. Economists and investors now think the US Federal Reserve could hike interest rates by a historic 1% when its board meets in two weeks\u2019 time. The Bank of Canada shocked markets on Wednesday by raising its base rate by a full percentage point, while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand increased its benchmark rate by 0.5% this week, as did the Bank of Korea. Singapore\u2019s central bank also tightened its monetary policy on Thursday. Along with another expected move higher by the Fed, this keeps heaping pressure on other central banks to follow suit to bring inflation under control. With supply bottlenecks and repeated Covid lockdowns in China also crimping the world\u2019s patchy pandemic recovery, Georgieva said the G20 finance ministers and central bankers gathering in Bali \u201cface a global economic outlook that has darkened significantly\u201d. \u201cThe outlook remains extremely uncertain. Think of how further disruption in the natural gas supply to Europe could plunge many economies into recession and trigger a global energy crisis,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is just one of the factors that could worsen an already difficult situation. \u201cIt is going to be a tough 2022 \u2013 and possibly an even tougher 2023, with increased risk of recession.\u201d The IMF would be downgrading its growth forecasts for global growth for both 2022 and 2023 later this month, she said, having warned in April that its forecast of 3.6% was likely to be revised downwards. The European Commission was expected to cut its eurozone GDP forecast for 2023 to 1.4% from 2.3% on Thursday, according to Bloomberg, citing a leaked draft from the EU executive in Brussels. Inflation in the single currency area is expected to average 7.6% this year before falling to 4% next year, the document said. The European Central Bank is under pressure to raise interest rates to combat inflation and protect the euro, which this week slumped to parity with the US dollar for the first time in two decades. Georgieva said raising rates to combat inflation was one of three key policies needed to combat the threat to the world economy along with reducing government debt and more global cooperation. But raising rates is a high-risk strategy for many countries amid increasing alarm in the UK, for example, that the Bank of England\u2019s aggressive rate hikes will plunge the country into recession. EU countries also face the same dilemma at a time when it faces a potentially crippling energy crisis this coming winter if, as expected, Russia turns off the supply of natural gas over the bloc\u2019s opposition to the Kremlin\u2019s war against Ukraine."

            "date": "2022-07-10T11:10:33Z",
            "content": "Soledad Jarqu\u00edn has an answer for all those who like to suggest the murder of her daughter was just a piece of horrifically bad luck. \u201cWhenever people say to me that my daughter was in the wrong place at the wrong time, I say that what\u2019s actually wrong here is the Mexican politics that has allowed crime to grow and threaten young people\u2019s lives,\u201d she says. In the early evening of 2 June 2018, Jarqu\u00edn\u2019s 27-year-old daughter, Mar\u00eda del Sol Cruz Jarqu\u00edn, was shot dead alongside a local political candidate, Pamela Ter\u00e1n, and Ter\u00e1n\u2019s driver, Adelfo Guerra, in the town of Juchit\u00e1n de Zaragoza in Oaxaca. Four years on, Jarqu\u00edn, an award-winning journalist, still has no idea exactly what happened that night. She knows that her daughter, a photojournalist and videographer who worked as head of press for the Oaxaca state government\u2019s department of indigenous affairs, should not have been sent to cover a political campaign. She knows that her daughter felt she had little choice in the matter, given the scarcity of jobs. She knows that the trio were killed with high-powered weapons, and she knows that the evidence points towards the politically motivated targeting of Ter\u00e1n. But answers are proving as elusive as justice. \u201cAbsolutely nothing has happened since the murder: there\u2019s been no clarity about what happened and no justice,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were two arrests but the investigation was partly closed last November because there was a change of prosecutor.\u201d When Jarqu\u00edn managed to get a look at the file, she discovered that key expert reports \u2013 on ballistics, phone records and geotracking \u2013 were missing and that one of the apparent witnesses to the crime had never existed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no access to justice and that\u2019s why we decided that we needed to seek justice from international organisations,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s basically been a farce and they\u2019ve made us waste four years.\u201d Jarqu\u00edn, who has received death threats in Mexico for daring to demand justice, has spent the past three weeks touring Belgium, France, Germany, Spain and Switzerland explaining what happened to her daughter and what is happening to other women in her homeland, where there are between 10 and 11 femicides each day. Towards the end of June, the journalist travelled to Geneva to file a complaint with the independent international experts who sit on the United Nations committee on the elimination of discrimination against women. It was the first time that a femicide case from Oaxaca had been filed with the committee. \u201cWe came on this tour to draw attention to what\u2019s happening in Mexico and to talk about it as much as possible,\u201d says Jarqu\u00edn. \u201cThe violence is getting worse and women are suffering most of all. It\u2019s not acceptable that 11 women are murdered each day, and it\u2019s even more unacceptable that these crimes go unpunished. An estimated 97% of cases go unpunished \u2013 that shows the scale of the problem we face as Mexican women as a result of a sexist and patriarchal system where women\u2019s lives aren\u2019t worth a thing.\u201d And all that, she adds, has been hugely exacerbated by the presence of organised crime across Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a few states now \u2013 like Michoac\u00e1n or Tamaulipas or the other states that are well known for it \u2013 organised crime is all over the country.\u201d Jarqu\u00edn, who is being supported in her efforts by the feminist civil society group Consorcio Oaxaca and by the World Organisation Against Torture, hopes the Geneva complaint will help her secure justice for her daughter, and encourage others to do the same. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I can at the moment with the tools I have but I have no doubt that a lot of other Mexican mothers will follow and will seek the international justice that they\u2019ve systematically been denied at home in Mexico.\u201d As the Consorcio Oaxaca points out, the murder of Mar\u00eda del Sol \u2013 and the authorities response to it \u2013 is all too familiar. \u201cThis is a symbolic case because it embodies all the different kinds of violence that women suffer be it femicides or revictimisation,\u201d says a spokeswoman. \u201cWomen suffer violence for being Indigenous or for demanding justice. The impunity we\u2019ve seen in this case typifies the corruption and cover-ups that we see in Mexico.\u201d While she is demanding action from politicians, police officers and the judiciary, Jarqu\u00edn acknowledges the media also has an important part to play in tackling Mexico\u2019s femicide crisis. \u201cSomebody asked me recently how it felt to go from being the person who wrote the articles about violence against women to being the one who\u2019s being interviewed. I said it had made me reflect a lot on the way we do our jobs.\u201d By talking about \u201cyet another murdered woman\u201d, says Jarqu\u00edn, journalists tend to dull people\u2019s awareness of what is happening and to normalise the atrocities. \u201cVery often, we don\u2019t listen and we don\u2019t see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. \u201cHow does a family put itself back together after something like this? What do the grandmothers have to do when their daughters become victims and leave children behind? How do you get on with life? There are so many points of view that need to be considered and told when it comes to women\u2019s stories. It shouldn\u2019t be about making them into victims or criminalising them all over again.\u201d One of the most painful things about Mar\u00eda del Sol\u2019s murder was that her own professional kit \u2013 her computer, camera and videocamera \u2013 was taken from her hotel room hours after she was killed. With them, the family was robbed of another part of her. \u201cThey stole a lot of her artistic work as a photographer and now we\u2019ve lost that forever,\u201d says Jarqu\u00edn. \u201cWe\u2019ve put on exhibitions of some of her photographs as a way of paying tribute to the photographer who died in this very cowardly attack.\u201d Mar\u00eda del Sol\u2019s love of photography, says her mother, was obvious even when she was a little girl. Another of her defining traits was a hatred of injustice. \u201cI always say that if I\u2019d been the one who\u2019d been murdered, the person demanding justice in my name would be her,\u201d says Jarqu\u00edn. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have let the impunity continue.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-21T18:31:05Z",
            "content": "Ukraine has said it wants to establish a one-off international tribunal to try Russia\u2019s top regime members for the act of aggression, which could see it issuing an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin. Andriy Smyrnov, Ukraine\u2019s deputy head of the presidential administration, said on Thursday that Ukraine believed trying Russia separately for the act of aggression, with international participation, would speed up its quest to hold the Russian president and his inner circle accountable. The act of aggression \u2013 accepted by UN members as an international crime \u2013 cannot be tried by the international criminal court due to lack of jurisdiction, but is considered the gravest international crime because of its subsequent consequences. On Thursday, three people were killed and 23 injured by two Russian attacks in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, according to the Kharkiv regional prosecutor\u2019s office. Smyrnov said the act of aggression, for which Ukraine would initiate additional proceedings, was easy to prove, whereas the type of cases that the ICC could try in relation to Ukraine \u2013 war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity \u2013 would take years. \u201cThe fact that [Russia] invaded Ukraine with their army is a fact accepted by our international partners,\u201d said Smyrnov. \u201cWe hope to have the indictment within three months.\u201d Smirnov said a judgment made by an international tribunal would still go some way towards justice for Ukraine even without the accused in custody. \u201cAlready to have an indictment and to have an arrest warrant for Putin, for [Russia\u2019s defence minister Sergei] Shoigu \u2026 will be a big step forward in getting justice,\u201d said Anton Korynevych, ambassador-at-large for Ukraine, who is leading talks with international partners on the matter. \u201cThey will be claimed and labelled as potential criminals by an international and legitimate tribunal.\u201d \u201cThen, whenever they [travel] to a state which recognises the tribunal, problems for them might arise,\u201d said Korynevych. \u201cOf course, we would be more than happy to see Shoigu in custody, and not only him but all the other guys who made the decision back then, not only in 2022, but in 2014 also,\u201d said Korynevych, who added that in their view, sentencing at the ad hoc tribunal would follow ICC norms. Korynevych, who named The Hague as the potential host city for the tribunal, said he wanted as many international partners to participate as possible in order to legitimise any decision and widen the potential for accountability. \u201cThe idea is for it to be open and as international as possible,\u201d he said. Korynevych said several of Ukraine\u2019s international partners had agreed to establish the tribunal. He said, however, that it was too early and too sensitive to name the countries that had agreed. \u201cYes, Ukrainians will be involved, it will be necessary to have a Ukrainian prosecutor, but we hope the judges will be international,\u201d said Korynevych. Anya Neistat, legal director of the Docket initiative at the Clooney Foundation for Justice, speaking to the Guardian in May, stressed the importance of Ukraine following procedures meticulously so as to avoid the perception of victor\u2019s justice. This week, Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, dismissed Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. In Zelenskiy\u2019s nightly address to the nation, he said Venediktova and the head of Ukraine\u2019s intelligence service, Ivan Bakanov, had collaborators in their departments. A source in the presidential administration claimed Venediktova\u2019s actions had damaged Ukraine\u2019s reputation and stymied efforts to release Ukrainian prisoners of war after a Russian soldier was sentenced to life imprisonment after a six-day war crimes trial in May. \u201cOur colleagues in Germany wrote to me asking: \u2018Is it possible for a court to listen to all the evidence and to question all the witnesses and reach a judgment in five days?\u2019\u201d said the source, claiming the trial had also seriously hampered efforts to exchange Ukrainian prisoners of war with Russia . Kremlin representatives had subsequently threatened to try all \u201c2,500 Ukrainian prisoners of war who came out of Azovstal, in our own tribunal, before returning the question of a prisoner exchange in three year\u2019s time\u201d, the source claimed. In an interview with CNN, Venediktova said she would not criticise Zelenskiy\u2019s decision, but believed she was dismissed because of realpolitik and because \u201cit may be time to have a prosecutor with other views\u201d."

            "date": "2022-07-10T06:00:28Z",
            "content": "Clarence Thomas knows the loneliness of the long distance runner \u2013 and the rewards. In 1980, with five months\u2019 training, he ran the Marine Corps Marathon in an impressive three hours and 11 minutes. He saw it as a metaphor for his life, he wrote later in his memoir. The marathon is certainly apt for Thomas\u2019s three decades on the US supreme court. For the lion\u2019s share of that time he was a fringe figure with extremist views. But then the court\u2019s centre of gravity moved his way: Thomas is now the senior member of a group of rightwing justices with the votes to control it. In the court\u2019s most recent term, the conservative majority handed down sweeping rulings on abortion, climate, guns and religion that look set to reshape America. Although it is colloquially known as the \u201cRoberts court\u201d after Chief Justice John Roberts, some now perceive a \u201cThomas court\u201d that will continue to turn back the clock. \u201cBy virtue of the fact that Clarence Thomas has been on the supreme court as long as he has, he has slowly gained much more influence and has now become the dominant ideological leader of the conservatives,\u201d said Edward Fallone, an associate professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \u201cHe is certainly more confident and more muscular now that he has allies on his side but he has been strikingly consistent over the decades. He simply waited for the rest of the conservative world to catch up to him.\u201d Thomas is the longest-serving sitting member of America\u2019s highest court and, in 2028, would overtake William Douglas as the longest-serving ever. The recent retirement of Stephen Breyer meant that Thomas, 74, became the oldest sitting justice. But the swearing in of Breyer\u2019s successor, Ketanji Brown Jackson, meant that Thomas is no longer its sole African American \u2013 a status that has proved hugely divisive in light of his deeply conservative views. Born in Savannah, Georgia, in the racially segregated south, Thomas grew up in the nearby town of Pinpoint, where he has recalled that homes were little more than shacks. He learned Geechee, a Creole language spoken by the descendants of slaves, before standard English, which he has said made him self-conscious about speaking and more of a listener. Thomas, who was was abandoned by his father as a young child, attributes his success to his grandfather, a believer in tough love who sent him to a Catholic school and encouraged his work ethic. After graduating from the College of the Holy Cross, then Yale Law School, Thomas worked as assistant attorney general in Missouri. His \u201cpulled up by his own bootstraps\u201d story influenced his ardent opposition to affirmative action, a stance that caught the eye of the Republican party, which Thomas joined soon after Ronald Reagan was elected president. In 1982 he became chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a government agency responsible for enforcing federal laws against discrimination. In an interview with the Washington Post, he complained that civil rights leaders \u201cbitch, bitch, bitch, moan and whine\u201d. President George HW Bush nominated Thomas to fill the supreme court seat vacated by Thurgood Marshall, a civil rights titan. At a bruising 1991 confirmation hearing chaired by Senator Joe Biden, Thomas was accused of sexual harassment by former employee Anita Hill \u2013 charges he denied and branded as \u201chi-tech lynching\u201d. Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, said: \u201cClarence Thomas\u2019s legacy is complicated. When he was nominated to the court in \u201991, it was actually met with support in the African American community. \u201cWhen Anita Hill made her sexual harassment allegations during the confirmation hearings, he still enjoyed the support of African Americans, although Black women who were highly conscious of their gender identity were less likely to support him.\u201d She added: \u201cPeople were happy to see that Thurgood Marshall\u2019s seat was going to be filled by a Black man and there are ways that, in his personal life, Justice Thomas has been highly supportive of Blacks in the legal profession, particularly Black lawyers who have the potential to be judges. We\u2019ve seen that type of personal advocacy and mentoring in his background.\u201d But on the court, Thomas was an outlier. A self-described introvert, he chose not to ask questions during arguments for years-long stretches. And with rightwing views that put him well outside the mainstream, he often wrote solo dissents, quietly assembling his own parallel matrix of legal opinions. Fallone, the Marquette associate professor, observed: \u201cIf you feel that you are on the fringe of a multi-person body, you can do one of two things. You can attempt to join coalitions and perhaps compromise and move a little bit towards the centre or you can stay consistent and be content on the fringe and bide your time until the whole body makeup changes. Clarence Thomas chose the latter route.\u201d Everything changed with the election of Donald Trump as US president and the appointment of justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. This meant conservatives enjoyed a 6-3 majority and could afford to lose the vote of Roberts in pressing their rightwing agenda. Thomas began finding his voice both figuratively and literally. When the court began hearing arguments by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic and changed the arguments\u2019 format so justices asked questions one by one, he joined in. He has continued asking questions since the justices returned to their courtroom last autumn. Thomas, not Roberts, stamped his authority on the just completed term. He wrote an opinion that the constitution protects an individual\u2019s right to carry a handgun in public. His marathon 30-year effort to overturn Roe v Wade, the ruling that protected abortion rights nationwide, ended in victory despite widespread public opposition. Even then, however, Thomas was not satisfied as he urged his fellow justices to revisit precedents acknowledging rights to same-sex marriage, gay sex and contraception. Amid national outrage, thousands of people signed a petition saying he should no longer be allowed to teach a class at George Washington University\u2019s law school, but the university nixed the idea. Some activists warned that Thomas has become a tool of Trump\u2019s authoritarian \u201cMake America great again\u201d (Maga) movement. Using the phrase \u201cthe Thomas court\u201d, the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said in a statement: \u201cThe bottom line is that Clarence Thomas is working with other ultra-Maga activists to build a legal framework for the dissolution of rights and freedoms based on his ideology, not the constitution.\u201d Yet just as Thomas reaches the zenith of his influence, a political scandal could yet tear him down. The justice and his wife, the conservative activist Virginia Thomas, are under scrutiny over their actions following Trump\u2019s defeat in the 2020 election. Virginia Thomas exchanged messages with the then White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, encouraging him to work to overturn Biden\u2019s victory and urged Republican legislators in Arizona to choose their own slate of electors. The congressional panel investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol has asked her for an interview. Critics argue that Clarence Thomas should have recused himself from a case involving the committee\u2019s access to presidential documents and lawsuits challenging the election results. Democrats in Congress wrote in a letter that his participation is \u201cexceedingly difficult to reconcile with federal ethics requirements\u201d. Gillespie of Emory University believes that if Clarence Thomas is directly linked to a conspiracy, it would be grounds for impeachment. \u201cBut if he is not directly implicated in anything that Ginni Thomas herself is involved in, the larger question is going to be, does he have public confidence enough that he can stay in that position? \u201cHis initial reaction will likely be to double down and say that this has nothing to do with him and that he can continue to do his job. The question would be, would people who are close to him agree with that assessment and would they be in a position of influence to convince him that the optics aren\u2019t on his side and that perhaps he should step down?\u201d Thomas\u2019s many defenders on the right contend that his wife\u2019s political activism is being unfairly targeted. Curt Levey, president of the advocacy group the Committee for Justice, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think ultimately it\u2019s going to be a problem for him and the court. Certainly the left is going to use it to attack him but they\u2019ve been attacking him pretty much since he\u2019s been on the court. \u201cThe original attack was that he wasn\u2019t very bright and that he was just doing whatever [late justice Antonin] Scalia told him to do. And they\u2019ve been attacking Ginni for a long time.\u201d Levey added: \u201cI have total confidence that the left will continue to try to cause problems about it because they particularly dislike Thomas \u2013 they just cannot stomach the idea of a conservative Black man \u2013 and they love to focus on January 6. Trump hasn\u2019t been president for a year and a half and they\u2019re still obsessed with it, long beyond when I thought they would move on.\u201d The \u201cThomas court\u201d looks set to continue moving fast and breaking things. Among the cases it has taken up for its next term are a Republican-backed appeal from North Carolina that could give state legislatures more power over federal elections, as well as two that could spell the end of college and university policies considering race in admissions to achieve more student diversity. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, commented: \u201cClarence Thomas has always been a mystery to many people. He has a long history on the court and life experiences that are different from many but strongly held views. He\u2019s articulated them and so he\u2019s ascendant right now. It will take some time before the court\u2019s composition changes and before he is less influential.\u201d"

            "title": "Justice finally arrives for Bernard Collaery but damage already done | Christopher Knaus",
            "date": "2022-07-07T07:13:21Z",
            "content": "On the last day of summer, 2013, lawyer Bernard Collaery sat down to pen a missive to a client known only as Witness K. The client, a veteran of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, had spent years stewing over his involvement in an Australian mission to bug the offices of Timor-Leste during 2004 negotiations to carve up crucial oil and gas resources. He had sought out Collaery to help him correct an enduring wrong, one that had betrayed an impoverished ally to benefit Australia and a collection of corporations seeking to exploit the Timor Sea reserves for billions of dollars. Collaery\u2019s letter burned with the same sense of injustice held by his client. He told Witness K he had been \u201can instrument\u201d in Australia\u2019s \u201cgross hypocrisy and unfairness\u201d of pretending to help developing nations while robbing them of natural resource revenue to the benefit of oil and gas companies. \u201cYou are still burning with resentment, you are still seeking justice,\u201d Collaery wrote. But justice has long proved elusive in this sordid affair. In their efforts to help Timor-Leste, Collaery and Witness K found themselves the target of a prosecution that has hovered over their heads since 2013, when Collaery\u2019s office was raided and Witness K\u2019s passport was seized. The ensuing years have seen their lives shattered, millions in taxpayers\u2019 dollars wasted, and ongoing harm to relations with one of our closest neighbours in the Indo-Pacific. On Thursday \u2013 for Collaery, at least \u2013 it finally ended. More than four years since the charges against Collaery were first revealed, the country\u2019s new attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, announced he had directed commonwealth prosecutors to drop the case, saying he had \u201cdetermined this prosecution should end\u201d. The announcement drew immediate praise from Collaery\u2019s legal team, who described it as a \u201cprincipled stance\u201d against a political prosecution that had \u201cno discernible public interest or national benefit to the commonwealth\u201d. The truth is, on many levels, the damage has already been done. The case has consumed Collaery since his offices were raided in 2013. It has now all but destroyed his legal practice. For Witness K, who pleaded guilty years ago, at least three psychiatrists gave evidence that the case had been debilitating for his mental health, compounding the post-traumatic stress disorder he developed after his service in Vietnam. But it\u2019s not just the individuals involved in these protracted proceedings who have suffered. The prosecutions have been the cause of continued frustration for Timor-Leste, whose leaders repeatedly urged Australia to drop its prosecution of the men. \u201cOne thing is to spy, engage in bugging and other activities when facing unfriendly, hostile and sworn enemy powers like North Korea,\u201d the Timor-Leste president, Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, told the Guardian earlier this year. \u201cAnother is when the government of a supposedly benevolent, free and open society like Australia, engages in espionage activities on behalf of oil companies and using the cover of Australia\u2019s supposedly altruistic foreign aid program.\u201d Dreyfus\u2019s announcement will go a long way in healing relations with Timor-Leste. But there\u2019s another, more insidious impact of the prosecutions that isn\u2019t so easily fixed. In pursuing Collaery and Witness K so vigorously, and after so much time had passed, the government sent a clear message to anyone who has seen injustice or misconduct. Speak out and we will make you pay. It will take much more \u2013 including long overdue reforms of whistleblower protections and secrecy offences \u2013 to remedy that lasting sore."

But that wasn\u2019t how the intervention was taken by all parties. Others heard something rather different: tired arguments against end-to-end encryption, dressed up in new clothes but disguising the same attack on privacy rights with the same excuse that\u2019s always wheeled out by law enforcement. From our story: Tech companies should move ahead with controversial technology that scans for child abuse imagery on users\u2019 phones, the technical heads of GCHQ and the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre have said. So-called \u201cclient-side scanning\u201d would involve service providers such as Facebook or Apple building software that monitors communications for suspicious activity without needing to share the contents of messages with a centralised server. Ian Levy, the NCSC\u2019s technical director, and Crispin Robinson, the technical director of cryptanalysis \u2013 codebreaking \u2013 at GCHQ, said the technology could protect children and privacy at the same time. \u201cWe\u2019ve found no reason why client-side scanning techniques cannot be implemented safely in many of the situations one will encounter\u201d they wrote in a new discussion paper . You may remember the debate around client-side scanning from a year ago. To quote myself: Apple is taking a major step into the unknown. That\u2019s because its version of this approach will, for the first time from any major platform, scan photos on the users\u2019 hardware, rather than waiting for them to be uploaded to the company\u2019s servers. By normalising on-device scanning for CSAM [child sexual abuse material], critics worry, Apple has taken a dangerous step. From here, they argue, it is simply a matter of degree for our digital life to be surveilled, online and off. It is a small step in one direction to expand scanning beyond CSAM; it is a small step in another to expand it beyond simple photo libraries; it is a small step in yet another to expand beyond perfect matches of known images. So why is the intervention from Levy and Robinson important? To me, it\u2019s a sincere attempt to address the concerns of these critics, to lay out the advantages of client-side scanning in tackling specific categories of threat \u2013 and to propose meaningful solutions to common fears. The devil is in the details To take one example from the 70-page paper: the pair try to tackle the fear that lists of photos that are scanned for CSAM could expand beyond known CSAM to include, say, images with a political character. In plainer language, what would stop China demanding that Apple include the famous pictures of Tank Man in its scanning apparatus, and forcing the company to flag any iPhones containing that picture as potentially criminal? Robinson and Levy suggest a system that would do just that. They propose that the list of images be assembled by child protection groups around the world \u2013 organisations like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the US, or Britain\u2019s Internet Watch Foundation (IWF). Each of those groups already maintains a database of \u201cknown\u201d CSAM, which they cooperate to keep as comprehensive as possible, and the scanning database can be made only of those images in all the groups\u2019 lists. They can then publish a hash, a cryptographic signature, of that database when they hand it over to tech companies, who can show the same hash when it is loaded on to your phone. Even if China were able to force its domestic child protection group to include Tank Man in its list, it would be unable to do the same for the IWF, so the image wouldn\u2019t make it onto devices; and if it forced Apple to load a different database for China, then the hash would change accordingly, and users would know that the system was no longer trustworthy. The point is not that the proposed solution is the best possible way to solve the problem, Levy and Robinson write, but to demonstrate that \u201cdetails matter\u201d: \u201cDiscussing the subject in generalities, using ambiguous language or hyperbole will almost certainly lead to the wrong outcome.\u201d The fear and fury is genuine In a way, this is a powerful rhetorical move. Insisting that the conversation focus on the details is an insistence that people who dismiss client-side scanning on principle are wrong to do so: if you believe that privacy of private communications is and should be an inviolable right, then Levy and Robinson are effectively arguing that you be cut out of the conversation in favour of more moderate people who are willing to discuss trade-offs. But it is frustrating that much of the response has been the same generalities that accompanied Apple\u2019s announcement a year ago. Technology news site the Register, for instance, published a furious editorial saying: \u201cThe same argument has been used many times before, usually against one of the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse: terrorists, drug dealers, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and organized crime.\u201d I\u2019ve spent enough time talking to people who work in child protection to know that the fear and fury about the harm caused by some of the world\u2019s largest companies is genuine, regardless of whether you think it is correctly targeted. I don\u2019t claim to know Levy and Robinson\u2019s motivations, but this paper represents an effort to create conversation, rather than continue with a shouting match between two irreconcilable sides of an argument. It deserves to be treated as such. It\u2019s not \u2018yourscraft\u2019 Minecraft is big. You might have heard of it. So when the game makes a moderation decision, it\u2019s a bit more important than when Bungie decided to nerf scout rifles in Destiny 2. Particularly when the moderation decision is this: Minecraft will not allow non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be used on the popular gaming platform, with the company describing them as antithetical to Minecraft\u2019s \u201cvalues of creative inclusion and playing together\u201d. Minecraft represented an attractive potential market for NFTs, with a user base \u2013 estimated at more than 141 million by August 2021 \u2013 already engaged in sharing unique digital items developed for the game. But the Microsoft-owned development studio behind Minecraft, Mojang, has put an end to speculation NFTs could be allowed in the game. In a blog post on Wednesday, the developers said blockchain technology was not permitted, stating it was antithetical to Minecraft\u2019s values. Minecraft\u2019s incredible success is thanks to its extendability. As well as the built-in creative aspects of the game \u2013 often described as the 21st century\u2019s answer to Lego \u2013 users can modify it in ways large and small, producing new experiences. That flexibility proved tempting for NFT creators, who settled on the idea of creating new features in Minecraft and selling them as digital assets. In theory, it\u2019s the perfect NFT opportunity: a digital-native creation, with a use-case that is actually achievable, and a demonstrably viable market. Startups flocked to the field: NFT Worlds sells pre-generated Minecraft landscapes, on which people would be able to build experiences and resell them for profit; Gridcraft operates a Minecraft server with its own crypto-based economy. Or they did. Now, it seems, NFTs have become such a toxic phenomenon that even passive acceptance is too much for a company like Mojang. If you want to make it in this world, you have to go it alone.

            "date": "2022-07-20T20:47:50Z",
            "content": "A bipartisan group of senators reached a deal on Wednesday to reform a federal law and prevent a future presidential candidate from overturning the will of the people and the result of a valid presidential election. The lawmakers have agreed to two bills that would reform the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which governs how electoral votes are counted after a presidential election. Citing ambiguities in the law, Donald Trump and his attorneys pushed his vice-president, Mike Pence, to disrupt the counting of electoral votes that showed he lost the 2020 election, escalating calls for the 135-year-old law to be reformed. Even before the election, experts warned the law was ambiguous and could be exploited. \u201cThrough numerous meetings and debates among our colleagues as well as conversations with a wide variety of election experts and legal scholars, we have developed legislation that establishes clear guidelines for our system of certifying and counting electoral votes for president and vice-president. We urge our colleagues in both parties to support these simple, commonsense reforms,\u201d the group of 16 senators said in a joint statement. Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the two Democrats who stymied more sweeping voting rights reform earlier this year, are among the group that developed the proposal. Republicans in the group include Maine senator Susan Collins, South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and North Carolina senator Thom Tillis. The first bill is called the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, and would fix ambiguities in the existing law while clarifying when an incoming administration can access federal resources. Under current law, Congress has to consider an objection to the counting of electoral votes if just one member of each house objects. One of the proposed bills would raise that threshold, requiring the support of at least 20% of members in each house to consider an objection. The bill also creates a judicial process with expedited review, first by a three-judge panel then by the US supreme court, over certain matters related to disputed electors. In 2020, Trump and allies encouraged submitting alternative slates of electors in swing states Trump lost. The new law clarifies that only the slate of electors officially approved by the state\u2019s governor can be submitted to Congress. It also clarifies the term \u201cfailed election\u201d used in another 19th century law, saying that a state can move its presidential election only if there were \u201cextraordinary and catastrophic events\u201d. There were concerns in 2020 that ambiguities in that language could be used by state legislatures to throw out the popular vote. After Trump insisted Pence had the authority to unilaterally throw out electoral votes, the bill makes certain that the vice-president has no such authority. It makes clear that the vice-president\u2019s presence at the counting of electoral votes is solely in a ministerial role. The bill also clarifies that both presidential candidates should get access to presidential transition funds while an election result is disputed. Trump delayed giving Joe Biden access to resources to transition in the White House after the 2020 election. The Enhanced Election Security and Protection Act is the second proposal, and would increase criminal penalties against people convicted of intimidating or threatening candidates, voters and poll workers, in response to a significant uptick in threats after 2020. It increases the maximum penalty for those who make threats from one to two years in prison. The bill would require election records to be preserved, help the US Postal Service manage mail-in ballots and reauthorize for five years a commission that works with states to improve their voting practices."

            "date": "2022-07-14T15:37:25Z",
            "content": "Proposals to reform gambling laws have been postponed for a fourth time amid turmoil at top of the Conservative party, sparking outrage from campaigners who warned the delay would cost lives. Advisers to Boris Johnson concluded that a white paper, which was scheduled to go ahead next week, could not be published until a new leader of the Conservative party was elected to replace him as prime minister. The latest of a series of delays comes amid a tussle between different Tory party factions over the content of the plans, multiple Whitehall sources said. Pro-reform MPs, led by Iain Duncan Smith, had sought to persuade Boris Johnson that tough curbs could burnish his legacy and were hopeful of success after the white paper was scheduled for next Tuesday on Downing Street\u2019s announcement \u201cgrid\u201d. But senior adviser David Canzini is understood to have told Johnson that he could not publish it as it would require legislation from his successor. MPs voiced concern earlier this week that advisers with past ties to the gambling industry, including Canzini, might obstruct or dilute proposed reforms, such as affordability checks or a mandatory levy to fund addiction services. On Wednesday ministers dropped plans to push through an online safety bill next week on similar grounds, leading to allegations of a vacuum at the heart of government. It is the fourth time that the gambling white paper, the culmination of a review announced in 2019, has been shelved. The delay means proposals will not be published until a new Tory leader is elected in September, at the earliest, and is a blow to those pushing for tougher reforms. A spokesperson for Gambling With Lives, a charity set up by parents whose children took their own lives after a gambling addiction, voiced dismay at the latest postponement. \u201cTens of thousands more people will be harmed and some will die as a result of this inexcusable delay. \u201c[Ministers] spent two years assessing evidence to develop a white paper, which we hear has been stopped by a single unelected official with links to the gambling industry. The next PM be warned \u2013 bereaved families will be knocking down the door and demanding rapid reform when they take office in September.\u201d Duncan Smith, who has previously said he is ready to \u201cgo to war\u201d with the government to secure tougher reforms, said he was \u201cvery sorry\u201d that the white paper would be delayed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but I\u2019d have accepted it because it\u2019s an advance on where we\u2019ve been,\u201d he said. Duncan Smith is backing Liz Truss to lead the Conservative party. He said she was \u201ckeen to do something\u201d on gambling, but \u201cI don\u2019t know about Rishi [Sunak]\u201d \u2013 referring to the former chancellor and leadership race frontrunner. \u201cThe Treasury has pushed back on any of these changes so far and I\u2019ve not talked to the others, who haven\u2019t expressed a strong view,\u201d Duncan Smith added. He said that whoever became prime minister would \u201cfind me sitting on the couch in their study until they do it\u201d. The Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group of MPs examining gambling harm, said: \u201cThis was a golden opportunity for the PM to bow out having at least done one good thing during his time in office. \u201cBut it seems like those who influence his thinking are far more interested in protecting the online gambling industry than they are in fulfilling a commitment in the Tory 2019 manifesto.\u201d \u201cThis is a low, senseless and cruel blow for campaigners of reform.\u201d The gambling white paper falls under the auspices of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Damian Collins is the minister in charge of both technology and gambling at the department, after the departure of Chris Philp, a former Johnson loyalist who oversaw the white paper but was among the ministers whose resignation helped force the prime minister to stand down. His resignation letter urged Johnson to publish the white paper in its \u201cfull and undiluted\u201d form."

            "date": "2022-07-20T23:30:32Z",
            "content": "Labor will not allow its desire for \u201cconsensus\u201d at the jobs summit to be \u201can excuse for inaction\u201d, Tony Burke has said, warning reforms to boost pay and job security will proceed even over employers\u2019 objections. The workplace relations minister told Guardian Australia he intends to \u201cbring as many measures as possible from Labor\u2019s secure jobs better pay policy in a single bill later in the year\u201d after the September summit. The comments indicate that job security as an objective of the Fair Work Act, a new test for casual work, limits on fixed-term contracts, criminalisation of wage theft, and making superannuation a workplace right could be before the parliament by year\u2019s end. In the first week of parliament, Burke will introduce a bill legislating paid family and domestic violence leave, promising to remove one \u201cobstacle from those in an intolerable situation\u201d. \u201cWhen someone is in a family and domestic violence situation, there are always many hurdles to getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want one of those hurdles to be that you\u2019ll lose your job, that you\u2019ll be poor.\u201d The timing of the second industrial relations bill would be \u201cinformed by whatever information we get out of the jobs summit\u201d, to be held on 1 and 2 September, he said. Asked if Labor would seek consensus, as unions and the Business Council achieved in their proposal to speed up approval of workplace pay deals, or forge on in the face of employer objections by stripping them of the power to seek the early end of such pay deals, Burke replied \u201cwherever there is consensus, I\u2019ll grab it\u201d. \u201cBut if there\u2019s areas where we don\u2019t get consensus, I won\u2019t use that as an excuse for inaction \u2026 I\u2019m certainly willing to act in the absence of consensus.\u201d Labor had also committed to criminalise wage theft, a reform the Coalition ditched from its omnibus bill in March 2021, caving to employer demands. Burke said he had \u201calways believed you shouldn\u2019t have a situation where if the employee steals from the employer it\u2019s a crime, but if it happens the other way everyone just says \u2018just pay the money back\u2019\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One reform likely to be omitted from the bill was the \u201csame job same pay\u201d pledge for the labour hire industry. Burke said the reform was \u201ccomplex because we know the behaviour we want to stop\u201d \u2013 labour hire being used to undercut pay and conditions \u2013 but \u201cwhat we don\u2019t know at the start is all the different business models that are out there\u201d. \u201cLabour hire has a completely legitimate role dealing with surges [in demand], or dealing with specialised workforces.\u201d Burke said that reform would \u201ctake longer\u201d to avoid \u201cunintended or perverse outcomes\u201d to ensure that only labour hire used to undercut pay deals was targeted. The jobs summit comes as Australia has achieved near full employment, with unemployment down to 3.5% and many sectors experiencing workforce shortages. Burke said Australia\u2019s IR system needed \u201ca better pathway to security of employment\u201d for workers who needed \u201csecurity of income\u201d. \u201cWhen casual jobs were predominantly people who were doing work for extra money, like I was for example when I had a casual job as a student \u2026 the lack of job security wasn\u2019t really a problem. \u201cIncreasingly now people in insecure work are trying to support families or their own household. \u201cThe business argument for casual work or insecure work as \u2018flexibility\u2019 just doesn\u2019t stack up: your rent isn\u2019t flexible, your mortgage, groceries, supporting children isn\u2019t flexible.\u201d Burke, who is also responsible for employment services, said he was \u201clooking closely\u201d at the controversial ParentsNext education program. He noted that giving jobseekers a \u201cclean slate\u201d with no penalties during the shift to the Workforce Australia model gave an opportunity to examine the merits of programs that fulfil mutual obligation requirements. Burke said he had \u201csome\u201d flexibility, although Labor\u2019s options were constrained by the Morrison government signing $7bn of contracts with jobs services providers before leaving office. \u201cThe objective needs to be how do you help people find their way back to employment \u2013 it cannot be how to provide profits for providers. \u201cSome of the providers, from what I\u2019ve seen, really do an excellent job, but there\u2019s no doubt people\u2019s experience is mixed.\u201d Burke said Labor had committed to be \u201cmodel employer\u201d, which would include providing an offer of secure employment to contractors in its call centres."

            "date": "2022-07-06T17:30:26Z",
            "content": "Aged care in Australia needs \u201curgent reform as quickly as possible\u201d alongside an overhaul of the funding model to ensure the sector remains financially viable, the new minister for aged care, Anika Wells, says. Describing the current situation for the sector as a \u201ccrisis\u201d, Wells said the federal government was already supporting a number of providers to remain open given the current pressures on the system, where the majority of providers are operating at a loss. \u201cIt is worse than we thought. Every rock I turn over, it is worse than we thought and I think that is the experience across the board,\u201d Wells told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe sector is in crisis. It is an absolute mess that we have inherited. It was in crisis before Covid hit, and Covid has exacerbated all of those conditions, particularly workforce. \u201cThe sector has drifted for nine years under the previous government \u2013 their reform was sluggish and opaque, and clearly the prime minister, Scott Morrison, chose not to act and risk upsetting anyone when leadership was needed.\u201d Wells, who has taken on the portfolio at a time when providers are warning of unprecedented pressure in the system compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, is clear-eyed about the challenges ahead for the sector, acknowledging there is a debate to be had about how it is funded over the long term. While indicating the government would not budge on lifting the indexation rate for aged care provider payments, which is set well below inflation at 1.7% for 2022-23, Wells said legislation for a new pricing model would be introduced as soon as possible for the new system to come into effect from October. She also said that she had begun looking at the forecast funding shortfall for aged care as the population ages, with the royal commission into aged care finding that government spending on aged care will increase by 4% a year over the next decade. \u201cI have had meetings with my colleagues already about how we are going to do this, because the long-term sustainability of the sector is at stake here,\u201d Wells said. \u201cAnd in just the month I have had the job, it has become very apparent to me that my greatest task is going to be managing the immediate short-term risks, and assistance with Covid, and keeping the election commitments that we made to the Australian people \u2026 against some very broad existential questions,\u201d she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cQuestions like how the boomers are going to age, and if the boomers are going to age at home, how are we going to reform support at home to make sure it is financially sustainable? \u201cWe know that we have got three or four years before the boomers need to access aged care, so we have only got a short amount of time to do this properly. \u201cIt is a great example of the dilemma we have, which is urgent reform as quickly as possible, against the backdrop of the very sustainability of the sector.\u201d While Wells would not be drawn on the possibility of the government considering a new aged care levy \u2013 a key recommendation of the royal commission \u2013 it is understood the government is considering changes to the co-payment system for aged care which is means-tested to determine contributions. She said that she had been struck by an observation in the royal commission\u2019s report that \u201cover the last several decades, successive Australian governments have brought a level of ambivalence, timidity and detachment to their approach to aged care\u201d. \u201cI am many things, but I am not detached,\u201d Wells said. And timid? \u201cI\u2019m a Queenslander. Let\u2019s not shy away from this, this is a big piece of work, it is not a one-term project, it has drifted for decades and it is going to take more than one term [of government] because these are big existential questions. \u201cIn order to make sure the sector is financially sustainable, in order to deliver the reforms the royal commission recommended \u2026 I am open to all options.\u201d Before the election, Labor committed to a five-point plan for aged care that included registered nurses on site 24/7 by July next year, more carers, better pay for workers, greater financial transparency and instituting new nutrition standards. Wells said that she was confident that the commitment for having more nurses on site could be met by next July, but said increasing the care workforce remained a challenge. \u201cEveryone wants to talk to me about workforce \u2026 the fact the borders closed, we didn\u2019t have people coming in from overseas, a lot of people returned to their home country and a lot of these people were the aged care workforce, and a lot of aged care workers are burnt out.\u201d She said she was in talks with the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, about how changes to the visa system could help bring in the workers Australia needed, but said it was only \u201cone piece of the puzzle\u201d. \u201cWe have to get people back into the workforce who have left the workforce; we have nurses working part-time hours who would gladly take on more hours if the money was there to make it justifiable.\u201d She also confirmed that the government would be supporting a pay rise for aged care workers in a case brought to the Fair Work Commission by the Health Services Union for a 25% increase, but would not be specifying a figure. \u201cWe are supportive of a pay rise, but traditionally the government does not put a number on its submission, and we won\u2019t be putting a number on this submission.\u201d Wells said that the government had agreed to fund the outcome of the FWC ruling, which is estimated to cost about $4bn annually if the 25% claim is successful."

            "content": "The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew has secured a multimillion-pound investment to help commercialise its research into climate change-resistant crops, zero-carbon fertiliser and plant- and cell-based meat and dairy products. Greensphere Capital, a sustainability-focused fund, is aiming to invest up to \u00a3100m in the work carried out by Kew, a research institution and the UK\u2019s largest botanic garden, as well as other organisations, to commercialise and scale-up study into managing risks around the climate crisis and biodiversity loss. The funding is designed to increase research into some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges, including how to feed a growing global population amid rising temperatures and increasing extreme weather events. Alongside sustainable agriculture, the investment will help pay for extra researchers to look into botanical and fungal sciences, restoration of habitats, agriculture and forestry, with the ultimate goal of turning some projects into companies. Greensphere \u2013 which was founded in 2011 and was the first fund manager to the government\u2019s Green Investment Bank \u2013 is investing through its climate incubator, Gaia Sciences Innovation (GSI). Based at a 320-acre site in southwest London, Kew is home to a collection of almost 17,000 species of plants collected from all over the world during its more than 260-year history, as well its living collections in its gardens at Kew and Wakehurst in Sussex. The organisation is also home to the Millennium Seed Bank, an underground collection intended to conserve for the future over 2.4bn seeds from around the world including nearly all of the UK\u2019s native plant species. Kew believes the tie-up with Greensphere will allow it to leverage its collections, particularly when freed from the shorter-term funding cycles commonly found with two- to three-year grants for academic research projects. A non-departmental public body, Kew receives about a third of its funding from the government through the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), but said it does not have \u201cwhat\u2019s termed an intellectual property budget\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity to increase the impact of the work we\u2019re doing on biodiversity,\u201d said Prof Monique Simmonds, deputy director of science at Kew. However, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re commercialising Kew.\u201d \u201cOur expertise on collections, collated over 260 years, gives us a springboard by which we can provide information. Where plants were found in the past, that might not be found now, giving us an indication of what can happen with climate change,\u201d said Simmonds. \u201cHow can we work, not just academically to publish papers about it, but how can we help on the ground, with people, to be able to get money possibly going to those communities, to assist them realise the value of their plants.\u201d Greensphere\u2019s investment will initially be used to hire about 20 new researchers, with the goal of developing up to 10 companies. The money will also help to increase the laboratory space dedicated to this kind of work, which GSI believes will strengthen the role of the UK as a scientific and entrepreneurial hub. The investment firm found that many ventures it could have invested in, which look to tackle biodiversity loss or the changing climate, were not based on scientific evidence, which first prompted discussions with Kew. \u201cIf we were going to invest in natural capital at any scale, it would be dishonest to do it without proper science. A little bit like building a road with no civil engineers,\u201d said Divya Seshamani, managing partner of Greensphere Capital. \u201cWe found the science was a lot less developed than it could be. There weren\u2019t ready companies, but there were clear solutions. We thought this could do with some funding, some commercial structure, to try to get the science into companies, and it would benefit Kew, giving it an extra revenue stream.\u201d Kew currently has over 350 scientific staff working on projects with partners in more than 100 countries worldwide, including a permanent base in Madagascar, considered a critical location for biodiversity loss. Kew has previously only created one spin-out from its research, a company called Polypharmakos \u2013 formed in 2016 to discover and develop new antimicrobial agents from natural products \u2013 created with the University of Cambridge, through a \u00a3500,000 investment from the university. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 July 2022. Kew receives about one-third of its funding from the government, not \u201cnearly half\u201d as an earlier version said; and, when combined with its site in Wakehurst, Sussex, is the UK\u2019s largest botanic gardens, not merely \u201cone of the largest\u201d."

            "date": "2022-07-14T21:09:25Z",
            "content": "Pacific leaders have welcomed Australia\u2019s \u201crenewed commitment\u201d on climate change and interest in co-hosting a United Nations climate summit with Pacific nations, as Anthony Albanese heralds a successful reset of relationships in the region. At the close of the Pacific Islands Forum in Suva on Thursday, leaders emerged on time and smiling from their daylong leaders\u2019 retreat, before cutting a cake with a ceremonial sword and posing for a selfie when Albanese pulled out his phone. The retreat was the final and most important event of the forum, the most significant diplomatic meeting in the region. This is the first time that Pacific leaders have been able to meet in person since they gathered in Tuvalu in 2019. A source present during the retreat said that it was \u201cthe most cordial and friendly PIF I have ever attended\u201d and that discussions among leaders \u201cnever felt even slightly confrontational\u201d. This was in contrast to the 2019 meeting, at which the retreat lasted nearly 12 hours, broke down twice and reduced one Pacific leader to tears, over Australia\u2019s attempts to water down language on climate change. Albanese drew a comparison with the last forum, which occurred when Scott Morrison was prime minister, and said this year\u2019s event represented a \u201csuccess\u201d for Australia. \u201cI note that previously this meeting would have still been going for many hours, and I\u2019m told that one of the reasons for that is the changed position of Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the communique we dealt with that pretty expeditiously today \u2026 That represents a success.\u201d Climate change was central in the communique, with leaders reiterating that it \u201cremains the single greatest existential threat facing the Blue Pacific\u201d and declaring a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d. Australia was also singled out in the document, as Pacific leaders said they \u201cwelcomed and fully supported Australia\u2019s renewed commitment to the Forum\u2019s climate change priorities [and] also welcomed the interest from Australia to host a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 Conference of Parties in partnership with Pacific Island countries.\u201d One thing that was absent from the communique was any reference to coal power. Pacific countries have asserted for years that any chance of keeping global heating to below 1.5C meant a rapid transition away from coal power and no new coal projects. After the retreat, Albanese was asked what justification he would offer to Pacific nations for keeping new coal and gas projects on the table, which he refused to answer, saying it was hypothetical given it was not something that Pacific countries had raised with him. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI was not asked about that,\u201d he said. \u201cNot one person today raised such questions in the meeting, nor was it raised in any of the meetings I held.\u201d Fiji\u2019s prime minister Frank Bainimarama told journalists that his country\u2019s \u201cask\u201d of Australia was to end its \u201cfossil fuel addiction, including coal\u201d. \u201cThroughout every meeting and discussion I\u2019ve held this week, I have been clear and consistent in our asks for more ambitious climate commitments. We simply cannot settle for anything less than the survival of every Pacific Island country,\u201d he said. \u201cMost urgently, it requires that we end our fossil fuel addiction, including coal. That is our ask of Australia. That is our ask of New Zealand, the USA, India, the European Union, China and every other high-emitting country\u201d. Albanese also defended his government\u2019s target of reducing greenhouse emissions by 43%, which one former Pacific leader has condemned as \u201cfar from adequate\u201d. \u201cThe truth is that we went to the election campaign with an ambitious but achievable target of 43% by 2030, with a fully costed plan,\u201d said Albanese. \u201cAnd if you ask someone, \u2018do you want a higher number?\u2019 in absence of how you get there, then of course people who care about climate change would want action to be as soon as possible. But what you\u2019ve got to do is to have a real plan with a real timetable.\u201d Dr Wesley Morgan, senior researcher at the Climate Council, and Pacific climate diplomacy expert, said that while Pacific leaders had welcomed new ambition from Australia on climate action, \u201cthe elephant in this communique is that even with improved targets, Australia is still not aligned with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees\u201d. \u201cAs a member of the Pacific family \u2013 that also happens to be its biggest polluter \u2013 Australia should be doing more. That means deeper cuts to emissions this decade, and an end to both approving and funding new fossil fuel projects.\u201d Bainimarama also discussed the issue of Kiribati\u2019s withdrawal from the Pacific Islands Forum, which has hung over the event, revealing he had spoken to Kiribati president Taneti Maamau on the phone during the retreat. Bainimarama said he had committed to work with Kiribati to find a resolution to the impasse and that the forum would \u201cspare no efforts in this regard\u201d."

            "content": "When it comes to the climate, each generation represents a different stage of grief. In the 1960s, we ignored signs of climate change and steamed ahead with big energy. In the 1970s and 1980s, anger began to mount. Some scientists, like physicist Carl Sagan, raised red flags around a changing climate, while others, like the head of the UK Met Office John Mason, tried to debunk \u201calarmist US views\u201d. Meanwhile, fossil fuel companies began investing in PR campaigns to amplify doubt about the climate crisis, a trend that continued well into the 1990s. The 2000s saw the depression stage of grief. The science was undeniable and while many began to take action, the climate dread set in \u2013 something psychologists say is a big obstacle to taking action. Enter Gen-Z. If you\u2019ve spent much time on eco TikTok, you\u2019ll know that they\u2019re extraordinarily good at shaking off the climate dread and spreading climate optimism \u2013 perhaps it is the acceptance stage of grief. We spoke with a few of them to find out more. Caulin Donaldson, 26, has been picking up trash from Florida\u2019s beaches every day for more than 700 days Trash Caulin (real name Caulin Donaldson) grew up in Tampa Bay, Florida, and has always loved the ocean. But the way some people behaved made him angry. \u201cPeople would come up to me and they\u2019re like, \u2018this is my favorite beach in the world\u2019, and then I would watch them leave all their trash right in the sand.\u201d \u201cI was really mad about it. So I went to my first ever beach cleanup and the dude was like, \u2018bro, all of us are mad, but you\u2019ve got to fight this with positivity.\u2019 I tried it and it did work \u2013 I was getting more reciprocation from the positive messages.\u201d Donaldson hasn\u2019t looked back since and somehow makes picking up trash incredibly joyful. His 1.4m TikTok followers love watching his playful love of the planet, and high-energy personality. Many of them have been inspired to pick up trash in their local areas: \u201cPeople are like, \u2018my kid loves watching you every day and now he\u2019s out picking up trash\u2019. I just got a comment saying \u2018I was waiting for my friend\u2019s track meet to end and I was really bored, so I just started picking up trash. I never would have thought to do that if I didn\u2019t watch your videos.\u2019 \u201d An \u201canti-echo chamber\u201d is how Caulin describes TikTok. \u201cThis is why TikTok has literally changed environmental activism,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way the algorithm works is I can have 10 followers and go \u2018hey guys, let\u2019s recycle today\u2019, and TikTok will put me in front of people who aren\u2019t searching me and don\u2019t know who I am\u201d. Climate activism is huge on the social media site \u2013 the hashtags #climatechange and #eco have 2.4bn and 1.6bn views respectively. Franziska Trautmann, 24, turns glass into sand to save Louisiana\u2019s eroding coastlines \u201cThis is our planet too, and we don\u2019t have time to wait for these old people to make decisions. We\u2019re just doing it ourselves,\u201d says Franziska Trautmann, AKA \u201cthat sand girl\u201d on TikTok. While sharing a bottle of wine with her friend Max Steitz in 2020, the 24-year-old reflected on the fact that her state, Louisiana, had no glass recycling facility. Her wine bottle was going to end up in landfill. \u201cI wanted to work towards being a part of the solution instead of continuing to be a part of the problem,\u201d she said. The US recycles only about a quarter of its glass. This pales in comparison with countries in Europe, which recycle between 60% and 80% of their glass. Trautmann and Steitz founded Glass Half Full, Louisiana\u2019s only glass recycling facility. The glass is turned into sand and used to restore the state\u2019s eroding coastline. Louisiana loses an American football field\u2019s worth of land every hour due to coastal erosion. While studying at Tulane University in 2019, and with no money and growing student debt, the pair crowdfunded their first machine and began collecting bottles in the back garden of a frat house. They have diverted more than 2.2m pounds of glass from landfill since then, and have a huge recycling facility warehouse. On TikTok, Trautmann answers questions from her audience with humility, without a hint of patronizing. Sand is the most exploited resource after water, and Trautmann regularly reminds her 260k TikTok followers that we\u2019re in a global sand shortage. \u201cYou might be thinking: \u2018what about the Sahara desert?\u2019 Well, the sand we need for concrete and coastal restoration needs to be coarse and a bit angular, and desert sand is far too fine and rounded,\u201d she says in one of her videos. Glass Half Full caught the attention of the television host Mike Rowe. After filming what they thought was a documentary, Trautmann and Steitz were surprised with a $32,000 cheque on his show Returning the Favor. This allowed them to level up and buy a huge pulverizing machine. Glass Half Full was awarded a National Science Foundation grant alongside scientists at Tulane University. Together with the scientists, Trautmann and Steitz have been conducting experiments with the glass sand looking for contaminants, and seeing how it works with native plants and marine wildlife. The results were so positive that the group just laid 15 tonnes of glass sand on the coast, and worked with the Pointe-au-Chien tribe to restore part of their land. \u201cMy message to people is always to take my story as something that you can also do. So we saw an issue in our community, and instead of continuing to wait for someone else to solve it, we decided to just go for it. We didn\u2019t have any money, any recycling knowledge, we didn\u2019t know about glass and sand issues. We learned everything along the way. If you see a problem that you want to solve, just go for it.\u201d Zahra Biabani, 23, wants to displace the fast-fashion industry by founding the world\u2019s first sustainable clothing rental company She is just out of college and writing a book on the power of climate optimism, while also launching the world\u2019s first sustainable fashion rental marketplace. She creates regular TikTok videos educating her audience on environmental issues. Oh, and she just did a TED Talk. Zahra Biabani really makes you reflect on what\u2019s possible to do as a 23-year-old. The environmentalist from Houston, Texas, is about to launch In The Loop, her mission to make sustainable and ethical brands more accessible to young people. Through research, she found that the main barriers for young people in renting clothes were cost, size exclusivity, and the lack of styles that people want to wear. Biabani is bringing together a marketplace of eco-friendly brands with stringent entry requirements. \u201cWe make sure they pay a living wage, that 50% or more of their garments are made with intentionally sourced fabrics, and we also make sure that they offer public five- and 10-year sustainability goals,\u201d she says. For one-time renters, each piece of clothing is 75% cheaper to rent on her site than the retail price. You get the items for three and a half weeks, return them using the included returns label on the reusable shipping bags, and then In The Loop does the cleaning, restocking, and ships out the next month\u2019s cycle. And this is all done from Biabani\u2019s parents\u2019 garage. When Biabani learned that 56% of Gen Zers believe humanity is doomed, she started posting weekly positive climate news stories, which were met with a lot of gratitude. Climate optimism, Biabani says, isn\u2019t about discrediting the trove of science and evidence that the climate crisis threatens our future on Earth \u2013 it\u2019s a way to cultivate hope so people continue fighting. \u201cWe\u2019re not able to make change if we don\u2019t believe change is possible. So climate optimism is just a framework for unlocking the full potentiality of climate solutions that we desperately need.\u201d Thomas Lawrence, 23, is building a sustainable marketplace to take on Amazon \u201cI think it\u2019s time for Congress to be lobbied the other way. I\u2019m not a blind optimist, but we also have to accept the world as it is. Money makes the world go round. I\u2019m not saying I want it to be that way. But that\u2019s the way it is,\u201d says Thomas Lawrence, the founder of Good People Inc. \u201cIf big oil, big meat and whatever else are going to lobby Congress in the US with their millions to keep their pockets heavy and to keep the world they want it to be, then why can\u2019t we do the same thing? It\u2019s time there was a bit more influence for the right side of history,\u201d he says. The 23-year-old entrepreneur is building a corporation that \u201conly does good for the people and the planet.\u201d Good People Inc wants to take on Amazon and give people an ethical, value-driven alternative. \u201cThey [Amazon] created a market that they\u2019re now the only player in, and that\u2019s the reason that lots of people can\u2019t give up Amazon. The definition of a monopoly is that consumers don\u2019t have another choice.\u201d Good People Inc is already providing more than 200 products to people in the UK and is growing each day; the US site has also just launched. The company was born from a frustration with the way marketing tricks us. \u201cI hate all these brands that make people spend their hard earned money by making you feel inadequate, or like you need something when you don\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cA big problem for consumers isn\u2019t always that they can\u2019t get their stuff, the issue is that they desire the stuff in the first place.\u201d In order to sell products on the marketplace, retailers have to pass a number of regulations that Lawrence has put in place, including zero waste packaging, no plastic use, transparency about the provenance of ingredients, and how staff are treated. What is it about Gen-Z that is resulting in so much direct action and optimism? \u201cI think that my generation and millennials are starting to realize they have to take the matter into their own hands, rather than waiting on the people that are currently in charge to help.\u201d If all goes to plan, Good People Inc will end up as a co-op, owned by those who work there, and will have the capital and power to take on corporations in their own playground."

            "date": "2022-07-22T20:00:20Z",
            "content": "The Albanese government will face internal pressure to include climate change in its promised revamp of national conservation laws, with the Labor Environment Action Network (Lean) saying greenhouse gas emissions must be considered when development proposals are assessed. The warning from the grassroots of the ALP follows the release of the latest state of the environment report, which found Australia\u2019s natural heritage was in poor and deteriorating health due to the combined impact of climate change, habitat destruction for development and logging, invasive species, pollution and mining. Environment minister Tanya Plibersek described the report as a \u201cshocking document\u201d that showed \u201caccelerating environmental destruction\u201d. She promised to introduce new environment laws next year, preceded by a draft proposal for a national environment protection agency later this year. Plibersek did not rule out including a \u201cclimate trigger\u201d in the new legislation that would require a development\u2019s emissions to be considered when it was assessed, but signalled the government would probably follow a blueprint set out by the former competition watchdog Graeme Samuel in a 2020 review of the act. Samuel argued climate impacts could be addressed in other ways. But Felicity Wade, Lean\u2019s national co-convener, told Guardian Australia environmentally motivated Labor party members expected the government to go further and deliver what she called Samuel \u201cplus\u201d. \u201cSamuel\u2019s report is very good but it was written in the political context in which he wrote it,\u201d Wade said in an interview with the Australian Politics podcast. \u201cWe need to think about climate change. Climate change isn\u2019t in the current laws, and it needs to be.\u201d Wade said things might have been different if the carbon price scheme legislated by the Gillard government had not been repealed by Tony Abbott, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have that any more so we have to put climate into how we do approvals and how we look after the place\u201d. She said Samuel\u2019s failure to recommend a climate trigger wasn\u2019t \u201can intellectually defensible position\u201d and given the \u201cvery, very grim\u201d nature of the state of the environment report, Labor would need to marry climate risk and environmental regulation in this term of government. \u201cI don\u2019t think [that] is avoidable. There will be a big debate about how pointy that climate consideration is, of course, but it has to be done,\u201d she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said the government should emulate the Hawke government \u2013 which significantly lifted recognition of the environment, including by protecting the Franklin River, the Daintree, Kakadu and Antarctica \u2013 with \u201cbig picture thinking\u201d. Wade said part of that needed to address the pace of land-clearing, which scientists say is pushing species towards extinction. The number of documented threatened species jumped 8% over the five years covered by the state of the environment report, and is expected to increase substantially again as the toll of the catastrophic summer bushfires of 2019-20 becomes clearer. The report said 7.7m hectares of land used by threatened species, an area larger than Tasmania, was cleared of vegetation or substantially degraded between 2000 and 2017. Nearly all of it \u2013 93% \u2013 was for developments or logging that were not referred to the federal minister for consideration under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Native forest logging is exempt from national environment laws under regional forestry agreements between the states and Canberra. \u201cUntil we can get under control the fact that we still see our native vegetation as something to be logged, burned and shipped off we will continue to see the disintegration of our native animals,\u201d Wade said. Wade called for the creation of an independent environment commission, in addition to an Environment Protection Authority, to generate new ideas and solutions. \u201cThe department does a lot of great things, but it does not innovate and it does not drive new ideas and it does not tell the truth to the public. The state of the environment report \u2026 is a once-in-five year opportunity to do that, but we should entrench that capacity for building a better environmental approach,\u201d she said. \u201cUnless we do serious reform, [unless] it\u2019s root and branch, we will continue to lose.\u201d She also backed the need for a serious review of carbon markets, including to ensure biodiversity was protected. The new climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has commissioned a review of the carbon credit system to be headed by the former chief scientist, Prof Ian Chubb. \u201cThe market is a key tool in what is a bigger policy challenge, which is how are we going to build a carbon sink at scale that also acts as a biodiversity arc,\u201d Wade said. \u201cWe have to wrestle the markets into that public policy task, not the other way around.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-20T22:31:32Z",
            "content": "A key environment group has endorsed calls from the Greens and crossbenchers for the Albanese government to add a ratchet mechanism to boost the 43% target over time as negotiations over Labor\u2019s climate bill move into the endgame. The public intervention by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) comes as the Greens on Wednesday formally resolved to negotiate with Labor over its climate bill, but dug in behind the ratchet mechanism as one of their key demands. Anthony Albanese has confirmed the climate bill, which enshrines emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050, will be introduced when the 47th parliament opens next week, although there is speculation among stakeholders the legislation may go to a Senate committee rather than be voted on in the opening fortnight. As well as climate, the government will introduce a legislative package overhauling the aged care sector, imposing a requirement for nurses to be in residential aged care facilities as well as changing administration and management fees for home care. Separate legislation will be introduced to enshrine domestic violence leave and another bill will create the new statutory authority, Jobs and Skills Australia. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said after a party room meeting on Wednesday that it was his \u201cpreference\u201d to pass Labor\u2019s climate bill, but that the government must be prepared to negotiate on a range of fronts. The ACF has encouraged the Greens to pass Labor\u2019s climate bill as a downpayment on ending Australia\u2019s decade-long climate wars. But the ACF says the government needs to add a ratchet mechanism to the draft legislation it has circulated to the Greens and the crossbench. \u201cThe legislation needs to include a review and ratchet mechanism for the emissions reduction target so Australia\u2019s climate ambition increases in line with the most up-to-date science,\u201d the ACF\u2019s chief executive , Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe bill needs to be clear that when Australia ratchets up our target as part of our obligations under the Paris agreement, it automatically updates our target in this legislation and becomes law,\u201d she said. O\u2019Shanassy said another issue would be ensuring the Climate Change Authority was properly resourced to review progress under the targets \u2013 which is one element of Labor\u2019s policy. As well as resourcing, there would need to be personnel change to ensure the advisory body was \u201cstacked with climate scientists, not fossil fuel representatives\u201d. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Australia understands the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, wants to get the legislation passed in the first parliamentary fortnight rather than see a vote delayed by a Senate committee process. Bowen has briefed the Greens and the crossbench, and has not ruled out adding a ratchet mechanism to the legislation. The minister has signalled the government will consider amendments as long as they broadly align with Labor\u2019s electoral mandate. Labor has the numbers to pass the legislation in the House of Representatives. But the Greens could sink the bill in the Senate because Peter Dutton has signalled the Liberal party will oppose Labor\u2019s legislation. While Labor does not need crossbench votes in the lower house, independents have also outlined a list of measures they want included as part of a beefed-up climate change bill, including a \u201cDutton insurance\u201d policy that would make it more difficult for future governments to shy away from climate action. There is significant crossover between the wishlist of the Greens and the independents. Crossbench demands include language in the bill specifying that the 43% target is a floor not a ceiling, including a ratchet mechanism to boost emissions reduction targets in the future, and the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee that would oversee appointments to the Climate Change Authority. O\u2019Shanassy said all sides needed to give ground to ensure the new parliament passed \u201ca climate bill enshrined in law so that Australia can never go backwards, only forward when it comes to slashing emissions\u201d. In a statement ahead of the opening of the new parliament next Tuesday, the prime minister said his objective for the opening week was \u201cto bring Australians together to create a better future\u201d. \u201cCleaning up 10 years of mess and mistakes will take more than 10 weeks, but these are important first steps towards fixing aged care, protecting vulnerable Australians, addressing the challenges in our economy and working with our friends and allies to confront the challenges and opportunities from our changing climate,\u201d Albanese said."

            "content": "This is a moving and disturbing story (\u2018Every year it gets worse\u2019: on the frontline of the climate crisis in Bangladesh, 5 July) \u2013 a wake-up call to all of us about the direct environmental and indirect social and political consequences of our (the developed world\u2019s) dependency on fossil fuels. One of the world\u2019s poorest countries, with a population of around 160 million, cannot be held responsible for the CO2 emissions that are the cause of the disastrous climate change impacts it is experiencing. Bangladesh accounts for only 0.3% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions, so not much room for cuts there. During a visit to Bangladesh in 2004, I witnessed another impact of climate crisis \u2013 flash floods from increased melt in the Himalayas that engulfed the rice crop in the Sunamganj district only a week or two before the harvest. During a boat journey to assess the effect on schools and families in Sulla, it appeared that fishers were hard at work \u2013 but no, they were salvaging their rice crop from beneath the flood water. The \u201crotten rice\u201d harvest provided only about 20% of the potential yield. This happened before the disastrous monsoon floods that year. If the climate crisis is not addressed urgently, it will lead to massive environmental migration \u2013 or do we wish to be accused of \u201cclimatic genocide\u201d?

            "date": "2022-07-12T17:30:04Z",
            "content": "The climate crisis often gets blamed on market failure, but government failure plays a pretty big role as well. Not only do Australian governments spend more than $11.6bn a year subsidising fossil fuels, at the same time the federal government spends billions paying some landholders to grow more trees, state governments perversely continue to subsidise the logging of native forests. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what people mean by the circular economy. While successive governments have spent billions subsidising research into carbon capture and storage (CCS), the really inconvenient truth is the most effective CCS technology is the humble tree. It\u2019s low cost, low risk and ready to roll. Trees quite literally suck carbon dioxide out of the air and store it safely in their trunks and their roots. And as if that\u2019s not a cool invention, trees throw in water filtration and native species habitat \u201cservices\u201d for free. If Elon Musk had invented the tree, he\u2019d be a trillionaire by now. But despite all the talk of doing everything we can to tackle the climate crisis, in reality our state governments are still spending our money to subsidise the logging of native forests. Last year alone Victorian taxpayers spent $18m propping up state-owned logging operations. Those subsidies are expected to balloon out to $192m in total by 2030. According to the publicly owned VicForest\u2019s own business plan for 2015-16: \u201cTimber harvesting operations in the East Gippsland Forest Management Area have not been profitable for VicForests for many years.\u201d Tasmania and NSW forestry receive similarly eye-watering subsidies. Most of the trees from native forests logging get turned into woodchips to make paper. But while there are lots of substitutes for native forest woodchips, there is no substitute for our remaining native forest habitats which are literally the only places on earth that countless species can live. And those same forests are the only places on earth that can filter and purify the water that runs into the dams that provide most of our drinking water. The former and current federal governments have committed up to $4.5bn to encourage some farmers to \u201cavoid deforestation\u201d and \u201cinduce regeneration\u201d of trees on their land. But while preventing further land clearing and encouraging better land management is a great idea, there is strong evidence that there\u2019s a lot fewer new trees in the landscape than some farmers and the government are claiming. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Western New South Wales, for example, where around $300m has been committed to paying farmers to \u201cavoid deforestation\u201d, the rate of land clearing has actually increased! One farmer who receives millions from the federal government for his efforts explained the apparent paradox when he admitted to the ABC that he was using the money from \u201cavoiding deforestation\u201d on one of his paddocks to clear more trees on a neighbouring block. But while there is so much doubt about the integrity of the Morrison government\u2019s so-called Emission Reduction Fund that the new climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has announced a six-month inquiry, there is absolutely no doubt that when chainsaws bring down 45-metre trees in poor native forests that enormous amounts of greenhouse gasses are released back into the atmosphere. Australia isn\u2019t investing in its best carbon capture technologies; it is literally destroying them. Even if we didn\u2019t want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the idea that the federal government would pay some people to protect trees while the state governments pay others to destroy them would be absurd. But when all of the state governments concerned claim to be committed to achieving net zero by 2050, the whole situation is simply farcical. The commonwealth\u2019s emission reduction fund was dreamed up by Tony Abbott\u2019s government, criticised by Malcolm Turnbull, but maintained for now by Labor due to the political toxicity of introducing a simple carbon price. But while the entire premise of the ERF is that market forces have a significant role to play in tackling global heating, supporting government subsidies to keep our native forest logging industry going is the antithesis of believing in the role of market forces. But of course, Australia\u2019s native forests are not just the best carbon sinks around. For example, the Victorian highlands purify more than $310m worth of drinking water, provide the only habitat in the world suitable for bush stone-curlews, bandicoots, spotted-tailed quolls, regent honeyeaters, greater gliders and over third of Victoria\u2019s plant species. And, of course, have priceless importance for Indigenous heritage and culture. The economics of tackling the climate crisis aren\u2019t complicated, we simply need to do less of the things that increase emissions and more of the things that reduce them. While a carbon tax is obviously a good idea, in the meantime we need to scrap the subsidies that encourage native forest logging and extracting even more fossil fuels. These aren\u2019t the only things we need to do to make our planet safe, but no government can pretend to be serious about achieving net zero emissions without them.

            "date": "2022-07-29T13:08:03Z",
            "content": "Ireland has committed to a 25% cut in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by 2030 after a bitter political battle between farmers, business groups and environmentalists. The coalition government on Thursday announced binding sectoral targets to slash overall carbon emissions by 51% by 2030, a daunting challenge for a country that has consistently missed climate goals, making it per capita one of the world highest emitters. Eamon Ryan, the environment minister and Irish Green party leader, called the announcement \u201chugely significant\u201d. The most contested sector was agriculture. It causes about 37% of Ireland\u2019s emissions but farm groups lobbied hard for special treatment, citing its traditional role in society and food security. The 25% target was a compromise between farmers who hoped for 22% and environmentalists and representatives of other sectors who wanted agriculture to cut emissions by 30%. The agriculture cuts will be incentivised and voluntary, rather than mandated, but cattle farmers will face pressure to cull cattle. Tim Cullinan, the leader of the Irish Farmers\u2019 Association (IFA), said the target was about the survival of the government rather than survival of rural Ireland. \u201cThis is a potentially devastating blow for Irish farming and the rural economy,\u201d he said. The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association called the deal a \u201csellout\u201d that would make many farms unviable. However, other sectors face higher targets, partly to compensate for agriculture\u2019s dispensation. Transport must reduce emissions by 50%, commercial and public buildings by 40% and industry by 35%. Business groups accused the government \u2013 which includes many rural members of parliament from the Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael parties \u2013 of buckling to the agriculture lobby. \u201cFarming accounts for 1% of our national income. Even in regional areas its job creation effect is marginal. Farming is, however, an outsized part of our CO2 emissions,\u201d said Shane Conneely, of the business organisation Chambers Ireland. Ois\u00edn Coghlan, the director of Friends of the Earth Ireland, said agriculture should have faced higher targets but that the priority now was transformative action. \u201cThe time for talking is finally over, it\u2019s time for a relentless focus now on delivery, delivery, delivery.\u201d Irish authorities admit they are climate laggards. Instead of emissions falling last year they rose 4.7%, exceeding pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Ireland also missed its legally binding commitment to cut emissions by 20% by 2020 and has struggled to curb peat cutting. Sceptics doubt whether efforts to entice more people to use public transport, put 1m electric cars on the road and retrofit homes will reach the required scale. Even if all sectors reach their targets, Ireland will be shy of the 51% reduction that is mandated by law. Twenty-six million tonnes of carbon reductions are \u201cunallocated\u201d pending further studies of land use. Authorities hope technological advances will help plug the gap."

            "date": "2022-07-03T23:01:27Z",
            "content": "Amazon is launching a fleet of e-cargo bikes and a team of on-foot delivery staff to replace thousands of van deliveries on London\u2019s roads. The online retailer is opening its first \u201cmicromobility\u201d hub in Hackney, east London, which \u2013 along with an existing fleet of electric vehicles \u2013 will contribute to 5m deliveries a year across about a 10th of the capital\u2019s ultra low emission zone postcode districts. The bikes will be operated by a variety of partner businesses, not directly by Amazon, it is understood. Amazon plans more such delivery hubs around the UK this year as part of its efforts to cut its carbon emissions. The company was named as the partner for a cargo bike and on-foot delivery hub in the City of London\u2019s London Wall car park in 2020, but that project has yet to come to fruition. John Boumphrey, the UK country manager of Amazon, said: \u201cAmazon is driving towards a global net-zero carbon future. One way we\u2019re doing that is through the transformation of our transportation networks. Our new e-cargo bikes, walkers and growing electric vehicle delivery fleet will help us make more zero emission customer deliveries than ever before across London and the UK in the coming months.\u201d Cllr Mete Coban, Hackney council cabinet member for environment and transport, welcomed the plan. \u201cTackling transport emissions is key if we\u2019re to reach net zero. We\u2019re really pleased to have worked with Amazon to support them to take traditional vans off the streets and replace them with e-cargo bikes. This will help to reduce emissions and improve air quality for people in Hackney and beyond,\u201d Coban said. Amazon\u2019s move comes as window cleaners, milk and beer deliverers, plumbers and DJs all get on their bikes as the result of UK government incentives, new infrastructure and promises to reduce the carbon footprint of businesses. About 2,000 cargo bikes were sold in the UK for commercial use in 2020, according to the Bicycle Association, and a similar number were sold for use by families and individuals. That number is expected to have soared last year. Specialist delivery services, such as Pedal Me and Velocious, have expanded rapidly during the pandemic with one service, Zedify, setting up 10 mini-hubs on brownfield sites outside cities to make thousands of zero emission deliveries into each city every day. Boumphrey said Amazon would also install more than 30,000 solar panels on its facilities in Manchester, Coalville, Haydock Green, Wakefield, Bristol and Milton Keynes by the end of this year. The company has confirmed 18 solar projects at its existing UK sites this year and plans to more than double the number of projects by 2024. These projects come alongside addition to a windfarm on Scotland\u2019s Kintyre peninsula and a further four planned including at Kennoxhead in South Lanarkshire."

            "content": "The largest US cryptomining companies have the capacity to use as much electricity as nearly every home in Houston, Texas; energy use that is contributing to rising utility bills, according to an investigation by Democratic lawmakers. Cryptomining is a highly energy intensive process involving the use of specialized computers running constantly to solve complex math problems in order to create new virtual coins. Energy use in the industry is greater than that of entire countries. The US has become the center of cryptomining after it was banned in China. More than a third of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, comes from the US, Senator Elizabeth Warren and five other Democrats reported in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cThe results of our investigation \u2026 are disturbing \u2026 revealing that cryptominers are large energy users that account for a significant \u2013 and rapidly growing \u2013 amount of carbon emissions,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIt is imperative that your agencies work together to address the lack of information about cryptomining\u2019s energy use and environmental impacts.\u201d The congressional Democrats have asked the EPA and the Department of Energy to require cryptominers to disclose emissions and energy use, noting that regulators know little about the full environmental impact of the industry. The lawmakers solicited information from seven of the largest US cryptomining companies, including Stronghold, Greenidge, Bit Digital, Bitfury, Riot, BitDeer and Marathon, about their energy sources and consumption and the climate impacts of their operations. The data revealed that the industry is using a substantial amount of electricity, ramping up production and creating significant carbon emissions at a time when the US needs to drastically reduce emissions to combat the climate crisis. Emissions data from three companies, Bit Digital, Greenidge and Stronghold, indicated their operations create 1.6m tons of CO2 annually, an amount produced by nearly 360,000 cars. Their environmental impact is significant despite industry claims about clean energy use and climate commitments, the lawmakers wrote. \u201cBitcoin miners are using huge quantities of electricity that could be used for other priority end uses that contribute to our electrification and climate goals, such as replacing home furnaces with heat pumps,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe current energy use of cryptomining is resulting in large amounts of carbon emissions and other adverse air quality impacts, as well as impacts to the electric grid.\u201d The power demands of the industry are also coming at a cost to consumers, the letter states, citing a study that found cryptomining operations in upstate New York led to a rise in electric bills by roughly $165m for small businesses and $79m for individuals. In Texas, which has become a cryptomining hub, the industry is expected to continue to expand significantly in the coming years, increasing the amount of electrical load to nearly a third of the grid\u2019s current maximum capacity over the next four years and straining the system, according to a report from the Verge. \u201cThe more crypto mining that comes into the state, the higher the residents should expect the electricity prices to become,\u201d Eric Hittinger, a professor at Rochester Institute of Technology, told the outlet. The cryptocurrency market has crashed in recent months, dropping in value from more than $3tn in November 2021 to less than $1tn."

            "content": "Tech companies should move ahead with controversial technology that scans for child abuse imagery on users\u2019 phones, the technical heads of GCHQ and the UK\u2019s National Cybersecurity Centre have said. So-called \u201cclient-side scanning\u201d would involve service providers such as Facebook or Apple building software that monitors communications for suspicious activity without needing to share the contents of messages with a centralised server. Ian Levy, the NCSC\u2019s technical director, and Crispin Robinson, the technical director of cryptanalysis \u2013 codebreaking \u2013 at GCHQ, said the technology could protect children and privacy at the same time. \u201cWe\u2019ve found no reason why client-side scanning techniques cannot be implemented safely in many of the situations one will encounter,\u201d they wrote in a discussion paper published on Thursday, which the pair said was \u201cnot government policy\u201d. They argued that opposition to proposals for client-side scanning \u2013 most famously a plan from Apple, now paused indefinitely, to scan photos before they are uploaded to the company\u2019s image-sharing service \u2013 rested on specific flaws, which were fixable in practice. They suggested, for instance, requiring the involvement of multiple child protection NGOs, to guard against any individual government using the scanning apparatus to spy on civilians; and using encryption to ensure that the platform never sees any images that are passed to humans for moderation, instead involving only those same NGOs. \u201cDetails matter when talking about this subject,\u201d Levy and Robinson wrote. \u201cDiscussing the subject in generalities, using ambiguous language or hyperbole, will almost certainly lead to the wrong outcome.\u201d The paper was welcomed by child protection groups. Andy Burrows, the head of child safety online policy at the NSPCC, said it was an \u201cimportant and highly credible intervention\u201d that \u201cbreaks through the false binary that children\u2019s fundamental right to safety online can only be achieved at the expense of adult privacy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that legislation can incentivise companies to develop technical solutions and deliver safer and more private online services,\u201d he added. But critics say the proposals undercut the benefits of end-to-end encryption, and that the focus should instead be on non-technical solutions to child abuse. Alec Muffett, a cryptography expert who led Facebook\u2019s efforts to encrypt Messenger, said the paper \u201centirely ignores the risks of their proposals endangering the privacy of billions of people worldwide\u201d. Muffett said: \u201cIt\u2019s weird that they frame abuse as a \u2018societal problem\u2019 yet demand only technological solutions for it. Perhaps it would be more effective to use their funding to adopt harm-reduction approaches, hiring more social workers to implement them?\u201d The discussion paper from Levy and Robinson is not the first time the pair have waded into controversial policy areas. In 2018 they argued for a so-called \u201cghost protocol\u201d solution to encryption, where GCHQ would be able to silently add itself as another recipient of messages sent to and from a target device. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively easy for a service provider to silently add a law enforcement participant to a group chat or call,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis sort of solution seems to be no more intrusive than the virtual crocodile clips that our democratically elected representatives and judiciary authorise today.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-07T16:00:11Z",
            "content": "When I heard there was going to be a TV drama about cybersecurity, my initial reaction was that it was a brave thing to attempt. Trying to make what we do televisual is notoriously difficult. There is very little to see \u2013 just people tapping at keyboards and staring at screens, with most of the action going on inside their heads. So I have been pleasantly surprised by Peter Kosminsky\u2019s Channel 4 series The Undeclared War (whose second episode airs tonight). I binge-watched the entire thing in a weekend. The cyber-attack on the UK in episode one was all too credible. I initially thought they were going to be vague and melodramatic \u2013 \u201cThe internet\u2019s gone down!\u201d \u2013 but the script went on to explain how the BT infrastructure, which does run a huge chunk of web traffic in the UK, had been taken offline. They specified how 55% of web access had been lost and it was cleverly timed to be a disruptive attack, rather than a disastrous one with planes falling out of the sky. You can cause a lot of chaos by taking out any of these \u201cTier 1 networks\u201d. We\u2019ve seen it happen by accident \u2013 last October, Facebook managed to wipe itself by mistake \u2013 so it\u2019s perfectly plausible an attacker could do the same. We have also seen it happen by design. In 2016, there was an attack on a company called Dyn, a Domain Name System (essentially the phonebook for the internet) provider. It took down Amazon, Netflix, gaming platforms, social networks and news organisations for half a day. In internet time, that\u2019s aeons. Two years ago, SolarWinds \u2013 network management software used by all sorts of government departments \u2013 was hacked. Somebody cleverly put in a backdoor, which sat undetected for months. It appeared to be espionage, but rather than stealing data it could have been used for something more disruptive. Of course, the programme is fortuitously timed, too. An hour after it invaded Ukraine, Russia took offensive cyber action. A comms company called Viasat provides a lot of the internet connectivity in Ukraine. Russia managed to freeze it so nothing worked. It prevented people going online, which might not sound like much but look at the younger generation who are glued to their smartphones. A squeal goes up if they lose wifi for 10 seconds. Imagine no internet for 12 hours. That is quite a major disruption. Right from the beginning, The Undeclared War visually represented protagonist Saara Parvin (Hannah Khalique-Brown) completing a digital Capture the Flag exercise. This portrayed her thought process beautifully. People who excel at cybersecurity tend to be good at problem-solving. At Bletchley Park during the war, they would print cryptic puzzles in newspapers and recruit people who completed them fastest. Once it got down to the technological nitty-gritty, I was delighted to see characters using real tools. Analysts unpacked a piece of malware using an IDA (interactive disassembler). The code you saw on screen was actual machine language, rather than gobbledegook. Saara found a second virus nested inside another \u2013 a bit like Russian dolls \u2013 which is a well-known technique. My own original discipline was steganography, the art of hiding things in plain sight. It is used mostly for covert communications but increasingly in malware as well. Make people look in one direction, then suddenly the payload goes off somewhere unexpected. We saw Saara exploit real vulnerabilities and break through a firewall, which was pretty authentic. So was putting the virus into a \u201csandbox\u201d, which is what you do to test out malicious software: load it on to an isolated computer. As it happened, this piece of malware got out \u2013 but that\u2019s also increasingly common. Malware is designed now to recognise when it\u2019s in a sandbox and find ways to escape. I can tell much more thought has been put into The Undeclared War than your average \u201cbombs and bullets\u201d Bruce Willis movie. I enjoyed the juxtaposition in the Cobra meeting between what the ministers demanded and what GCHQ advised. Politicians often suffer from \u201cdo-something-itis\u201d \u2013 they want to be seen to take decisive action. Nobody in our trade would think hacking back is a good idea, because it leads to escalation. The GCHQ representatives \u2013 Danny Patrick (Simon Pegg) and David Neal (Alex Jennings) \u2013 correctly pointed out that tit-for-tat can go horribly wrong. If you\u2019re not careful, a conflict in cyberspace can escalate into military retaliation. Indeed, Nato\u2019s Tallinn document says that if it comes under a cyber-attack of sufficient magnitude, it reserves the right to respond \u201ckinetically\u201d, meaning missiles and bombs. The drama also highlighted the huge problem with retaliation. Cyber-attacks allow plausible deniability, and attribution is incredibly difficult. People presume it was the Russians but nobody knows for certain. If someone launches a missile at you, you\u2019re pretty sure where it came from. With cyber-attacks, it\u2019s hard to tell who wrote the code and where they were. It is also easy to plant false flags in there \u2013 make it look North Korean, say, or timestamp files to correspond with Moscow timezones. You need ancillary intelligence because the bits and pieces gleaned from electronic warfare data aren\u2019t enough. In the show, a rogue British hacker called Jolly Roger responds to the Russian attack by making the lights in Putin\u2019s office flash on and off. You do get these vigilantes. There\u2019s a whole group on the chat app Telegram called \u201cthe Ukrainian IT army\u201d, trying to mount attacks against Russian targets. At another point in the programme, GCHQ mention taking control of Putin\u2019s presidential jet. That\u2019s an in-joke about cybersecurity consultant Chris Roberts, who told the FBI in 2015 that he had hacked into planes and controlled a United Airlines flight. Don\u2019t worry: you might be able to hack into the galley system or in-flight entertainment system, but not the engine management or autopilot. The GCHQ setting also feels very accurate. The old site comprised lots of small individual offices with locked doors and a high degree of compartmentalisation. Since \u201cthe Doughnut\u201d was built in 2003, it\u2019s more like a university campus. Once you are through the doors, there are open plan offices and coffee shops. The baristas serving the coffee have the same security clearance as you. I approved of how Kosminsky shows people in uniform walking around, because GCHQ does support military operations as well. Some staff work in flak jackets or behind armoured glass \u2013 brave people doing important work. It\u2019s refreshing how the drama shows GCHQ in a positive light. These people help defend us on a daily basis, with little or no credit. There are niggles, naturally. The cabinet office briefing rooms are too dark and not shabby enough. There\u2019s too much external connectivity from within the Doughnut. These dramas always come down to six people saving the world, whereas in reality a thousand do the work. And having Saara, a student on placement, crack the code was a stretch. Then again, it\u2019s surprising how often people find something in places where nobody else thought to look. Some viewers have queried whether Saara would get clearance, considering her partner is a climate change activist, but things have changed a lot. In the 21st century, GCHQ welcomes anyone and everyone. The questions aren\u2019t about \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d, as they were when I joined, but whether you will remain loyal. What the process tries to establish is whether you are hiding anything. It doesn\u2019t matter what your sex life involves or if you once took drugs, as long as you\u2019re open and honest about it. If you keep something back that you could be blackmailed or coerced over, that\u2019s where problems arise. The security services nowadays are staffed with people who wouldn\u2019t have got in 30 years ago. In the cold war era, we were mainly looking at the Soviet Union, so an awful lot of recruits were white, male, Russian-speaking public schoolboys. Now the threats are far more widespread. We\u2019re worried about places like China, Iran and North Korea. You need diversity of staff to reflect the threats we are facing. You can absolutely tell that Peter Kosminsky did three years of research. I\u2019d wager he had quite a lot of cooperation as well, because many scenarios, tools and techniques chimed with my own experience. Kosminsky says that everything he depicted has either happened or been \u201cwar gamed\u201d by security services, which I can well believe. We have an organisation called Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. Part of their job is to identify critical points of failure \u2013 \u201cWhat will the impact be if certain telecom towers are taken out?\u201d, \u201cWhat if someone cut through the transatlantic data cables off the coast of Cornwall?\u201d \u2013 and rehearse what might happen. We\u2019re a cautious lot in cybersecurity, but apart from a few elements added for dramatic effect, I feel very positive about the show\u2019s realism. The security industry is just like any other, in that people will pick holes in the technical detail. Overall, though, The Undeclared War is very impressive. I\u2019d love it to be renewed for a second run. That could portray another rogue state \u2013 perhaps ransomware from North Korea, Chinese data-gathering or something escalating out of the Middle East. There is definitely fodder for another series, put it that way. As told to Michael Hogan Alan Woodward is a computer scientist and visiting professor at the Surrey Centre for Cyber Security. He has worked for the UK government on signals intelligence and information security, as well as in business and academia"

He said that, following an intervention from the technical leads of GCHQ and the National Cyber Security Centre backing an extension of the technology on to individual phones, Apple should be emboldened to revive its shelved plans to do just that. \u201cThe pushback was from a relatively small number of privacy groups,\u201d Farid said, speaking to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) on the child safety group\u2019s latest podcast. \u201cI contend that the vast majority of people would have said \u2018sure, this seems perfectly reasonable\u2019, but yet a relatively small but vocal group put a huge amount of pressure on Apple and I think Apple, somewhat cowardly, succumbed to that pressure. \u201cI think they should have stuck their ground and said: \u2018This is the right thing to do and we are going to do it.\u2019 And I am a strong advocate of not just Apple doing this, but Snap doing this, and Google doing this \u2013 all the online services doing this.\u201d Apple first announced its plans to carry out \u201cclient-side scanning\u201d in August 2021, alongside other child-safety proposals that have since arrived on iPhones. The company intended to update iPhones with software that would let them match child abuse images stored in a user\u2019s photo library with identical copies already known to authorities from being shared on the web, and flag those users to child protection agencies. After an outcry from privacy groups, the company shelved the proposal in September that year, and has not discussed it publicly since. But in July, the leads of the UK\u2019s security services published a paper detailing their belief that such scanning could be deployed in a way that assuaged some fears, such as the concern that an oppressive nation could hijack the scanning to search for politically contentious imagery. \u201cDetails matter when talking about this subject,\u201d Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson wrote. \u201cDiscussing the subject in generalities, using ambiguous language or hyperbole, will almost certainly lead to the wrong outcome.\u201d Farid argued that the time is ripe for Apple and other technology companies to act and get ahead of legislation. \u201cWith the online safety bill making its way through the UK government, and with the DSA [Digital Services Act] and the DMA [Digital Markets Act] making its way through Brussels, I believe this is now the time for the companies to say: \u2018We are going to do this, we\u2019re going to do it on our terms.\u2019 And, if they don\u2019t, then I think we have to step in with a very heavy hand and insist they do. \u201cWe routinely scan on our devices, on our email, on our cloud services for everything including spam and malware and viruses and ransomware, and we do that willingly because it protects us. I don\u2019t think it is hyperbolic to say that, if we are willing to protect ourselves, then we should be willing to protect the most vulnerable among us. \u201cIt is the same basic core technology, and I reject those that say this is somehow giving something up. I would argue this is, in fact, exactly the balance that we should have in order to protect children online and protect our privacy and our rights.\u201d Speaking about the Levy/Robinson paper, Mike Tunks, head of policy and public affairs at the IWF, said: \u201cFor the last few years, the government has been saying: \u2018We want tech companies to do more about tackling child sexual abuse in end-to-end encrypted environments.\u2019 \u201cAs we know, at the minute, there is no technology that can do that, but this paper sets out some ways in which that can be achieved.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-14T10:00:54Z",
            "content": "Last week, the US government warned that hospitals across the US have been targeted by an aggressive ransomware campaign originating from North Korea since 2021. Ransomware hacks, in which attackers encrypt computer networks and demand payment to make them functional again, have been a growing concern for both the private and public sector since the 90s. But they can be particularly devastating in the healthcare industry, where even minutes of down time can have deadly consequences, and have become ominously frequent. The number of ransomware attacks on healthcare organizations increased 94% from 2021 to 2022, according to a report from the cybersecurity firm Sophos. More than two-thirds of healthcare organizations in the US said they had experienced a ransomware attack in 2021, the study said, up from 34% in 2020. Ransomware attacks on healthcare are particularly common in the US, with 41% of such attacks globally having been carried out against US-based firms in 2021. \u201cThe current outlook is terrible,\u201d said Israel Barak, CISO of Cybereason. \u201cWe are seeing the industry experience an extremely sharp increase in both the quantity and level of sophistication of these attacks.\u201d Ransomware hacks have caused major healthcare disruptions, including delayed chemotherapy treatments and ambulances being diverted from a San Diego emergency room after computer systems were frozen. In 2021, a lawsuit filed by the mother of a baby who died in Alabama alleged the first \u201cdeath by ransomware\u201d, blaming a 2019 hack of a hospital for fatal brain damage of the newborn after heart rate monitors failed. The possibly devastating consequences for medical facilities may be one of the reasons hackers have identified them as a high-profile target. \u201cThe North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors likely assume healthcare organizations are willing to pay ransoms because these organizations provide services that are critical to human life and health,\u201d said the advisory from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). CISA and others advise hospitals against paying ransoms, but providers often feel they have no choice, said Barak. In 2021, 61% of healthcare organizations that suffered a ransomware attack paid the ransom \u2013 the highest percentage of any industry sector. \u201cWhen lives are at stake, it makes the decision very easy,\u201d Barak said. \u201cThese attackers have identified medical organizations as very, very good targets because they are more likely to pay.\u201d Attacks are typically carried out by private groups of criminals, experts say: in the third quarter of 2021, 30% of ransomware attacks on healthcare entities were carried out by Conti, a crime syndicate thought to be based in Russia, according to an industry report from cybersecurity firm BreachQuest. But the North Korea incident revealed last week is just the latest state actor to orchestrate ransomware attacks on health care organizations after the FBI revealed in June it had thwarted an attack from Iran on a Boston Children\u2019s hospital. Underfunded hospitals hit by Covid squeeze The healthcare industry has been hit by a perfect storm of factors that have escalated the ransomware problem, experts say: patient information is increasingly being digitized as hospitals struggle with small internet security budgets. In 2009, the Obama administration passed a bill requiring all public and private healthcare providers to adopt electronic medical records by 2014, resulting in a massive migration of paper patient records to online systems. But today, just 4-7% of the average healthcare provider\u2019s annual IT budget is focused on cybersecurity, the BreachQuest study said. \u201cHealthcare providers have gone through massive digital transformation in a very short amount of time,\u201d said Hank Schless, senior security expert at the cybersecurity firm Lookout. The move was accelerated by the pandemic, he added, as more providers shifted to telehealth to connect with patients during lockdown and hospital staff were stretched thin by the influx of sick and dying patients. CISA has advised a \u201c3-2-1 backup approach\u201d for healthcare entities, including saving three copies of each type of data in two different formats, including one offline. But the agency\u2019s advisory to hospitals is \u201csomewhat unhelpful\u201d, said Vincent Berk, chief security officer at the cybersecurity firm Quantum Xchange, offering generic recommendations about securing data with little clear path to doing so. \u201cThe issue with this attack, and any other ransomware attack, is that the cure doesn\u2019t really exist,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, if it happens, it is already too late.\u201d Legislators are attempting to fill in those gaps. In May, Senator Patty Murray of Washington led a hearing on strengthening cybersecurity in the healthcare and education sectors, saying that the US \u201cneeds to address cybersecurity attacks and ensure they are treated like the national security threat they are\u201d. \u201cThese kinds of challenges don\u2019t just cause major headaches, lawsuits, and expenses for hospitals,\u201d she said. \u201cThey put patients in danger. They undermine our national security. And in some cases they even cost lives.\u201d In March 2022 the Senate introduced a bipartisan bill called the Healthcare Cybersecurity Act, which would direct CISA and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to collaborate on a plan to bolster cybersecurity measures among healthcare and public health organizations. Those measures would include cybersecurity training to employees of health organizations and authorize studies from CISA to identify risks in the industry. It is unclear when the bill is set for a vote, but experts say such legislation is more urgent than ever. \u201cThere\u2019s zero deterrence right now,\u201d Barak said. \u201cUntil we find a more effective way to tackle this issue, I am afraid the outlook is not looking good.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-27T10:45:16Z",
            "content": "This week, the technical leads of GCHQ and the National Cyber Security Centre made a powerful intervention into an incredibly controversial debate: what should social media companies do to protect children on their platforms? But that wasn\u2019t how the intervention was taken by all parties. Others heard something rather different: tired arguments against end-to-end encryption, dressed up in new clothes but disguising the same attack on privacy rights with the same excuse that\u2019s always wheeled out by law enforcement. From our story: Tech companies should move ahead with controversial technology that scans for child abuse imagery on users\u2019 phones, the technical heads of GCHQ and the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre have said. So-called \u201cclient-side scanning\u201d would involve service providers such as Facebook or Apple building software that monitors communications for suspicious activity without needing to share the contents of messages with a centralised server. Ian Levy, the NCSC\u2019s technical director, and Crispin Robinson, the technical director of cryptanalysis \u2013 codebreaking \u2013 at GCHQ, said the technology could protect children and privacy at the same time. \u201cWe\u2019ve found no reason why client-side scanning techniques cannot be implemented safely in many of the situations one will encounter\u201d they wrote in a new discussion paper . You may remember the debate around client-side scanning from a year ago. To quote myself: Apple is taking a major step into the unknown. That\u2019s because its version of this approach will, for the first time from any major platform, scan photos on the users\u2019 hardware, rather than waiting for them to be uploaded to the company\u2019s servers. By normalising on-device scanning for CSAM [child sexual abuse material], critics worry, Apple has taken a dangerous step. From here, they argue, it is simply a matter of degree for our digital life to be surveilled, online and off. It is a small step in one direction to expand scanning beyond CSAM; it is a small step in another to expand it beyond simple photo libraries; it is a small step in yet another to expand beyond perfect matches of known images. So why is the intervention from Levy and Robinson important? To me, it\u2019s a sincere attempt to address the concerns of these critics, to lay out the advantages of client-side scanning in tackling specific categories of threat \u2013 and to propose meaningful solutions to common fears. The devil is in the details To take one example from the 70-page paper: the pair try to tackle the fear that lists of photos that are scanned for CSAM could expand beyond known CSAM to include, say, images with a political character. In plainer language, what would stop China demanding that Apple include the famous pictures of Tank Man in its scanning apparatus, and forcing the company to flag any iPhones containing that picture as potentially criminal? Robinson and Levy suggest a system that would do just that. They propose that the list of images be assembled by child protection groups around the world \u2013 organisations like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the US, or Britain\u2019s Internet Watch Foundation (IWF). Each of those groups already maintains a database of \u201cknown\u201d CSAM, which they cooperate to keep as comprehensive as possible, and the scanning database can be made only of those images in all the groups\u2019 lists. They can then publish a hash, a cryptographic signature, of that database when they hand it over to tech companies, who can show the same hash when it is loaded on to your phone. Even if China were able to force its domestic child protection group to include Tank Man in its list, it would be unable to do the same for the IWF, so the image wouldn\u2019t make it onto devices; and if it forced Apple to load a different database for China, then the hash would change accordingly, and users would know that the system was no longer trustworthy. The point is not that the proposed solution is the best possible way to solve the problem, Levy and Robinson write, but to demonstrate that \u201cdetails matter\u201d: \u201cDiscussing the subject in generalities, using ambiguous language or hyperbole will almost certainly lead to the wrong outcome.\u201d The fear and fury is genuine In a way, this is a powerful rhetorical move. Insisting that the conversation focus on the details is an insistence that people who dismiss client-side scanning on principle are wrong to do so: if you believe that privacy of private communications is and should be an inviolable right, then Levy and Robinson are effectively arguing that you be cut out of the conversation in favour of more moderate people who are willing to discuss trade-offs. But it is frustrating that much of the response has been the same generalities that accompanied Apple\u2019s announcement a year ago. Technology news site the Register, for instance, published a furious editorial saying: \u201cThe same argument has been used many times before, usually against one of the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse: terrorists, drug dealers, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and organized crime.\u201d I\u2019ve spent enough time talking to people who work in child protection to know that the fear and fury about the harm caused by some of the world\u2019s largest companies is genuine, regardless of whether you think it is correctly targeted. I don\u2019t claim to know Levy and Robinson\u2019s motivations, but this paper represents an effort to create conversation, rather than continue with a shouting match between two irreconcilable sides of an argument. It deserves to be treated as such. It\u2019s not \u2018yourscraft\u2019 Minecraft is big. You might have heard of it. So when the game makes a moderation decision, it\u2019s a bit more important than when Bungie decided to nerf scout rifles in Destiny 2. Particularly when the moderation decision is this: Minecraft will not allow non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be used on the popular gaming platform, with the company describing them as antithetical to Minecraft\u2019s \u201cvalues of creative inclusion and playing together\u201d. Minecraft represented an attractive potential market for NFTs, with a user base \u2013 estimated at more than 141 million by August 2021 \u2013 already engaged in sharing unique digital items developed for the game. But the Microsoft-owned development studio behind Minecraft, Mojang, has put an end to speculation NFTs could be allowed in the game. In a blog post on Wednesday, the developers said blockchain technology was not permitted, stating it was antithetical to Minecraft\u2019s values. Minecraft\u2019s incredible success is thanks to its extendability. As well as the built-in creative aspects of the game \u2013 often described as the 21st century\u2019s answer to Lego \u2013 users can modify it in ways large and small, producing new experiences. That flexibility proved tempting for NFT creators, who settled on the idea of creating new features in Minecraft and selling them as digital assets. In theory, it\u2019s the perfect NFT opportunity: a digital-native creation, with a use-case that is actually achievable, and a demonstrably viable market. Startups flocked to the field: NFT Worlds sells pre-generated Minecraft landscapes, on which people would be able to build experiences and resell them for profit; Gridcraft operates a Minecraft server with its own crypto-based economy. Or they did. Now, it seems, NFTs have become such a toxic phenomenon that even passive acceptance is too much for a company like Mojang. If you want to make it in this world, you have to go it alone.

            "date": "2022-07-28T12:33:45Z",
            "content": "The US economy shrank again in the last three months, unofficially signaling the start of a recession. The commerce department announced Thursday that gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 a broad measure of the price of goods and services \u2013 decreased at an annualized rate of 0.9% in the second quarter after falling at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first three months. The bad news will be a major blow for the Biden administration as it prepares for a tough midterm election season. White House officials have tried to tamp down talk of a recession, arguing that many parts of the economy remain strong. The growth rate stands in marked contrast to the robust 6.9% annual increase in GDP recorded in the final quarter of 2021 when the economy roared back from Covid shutdowns. The fast pace of growth contributed to soaring inflation \u2013 now running at 40-year highs \u2013 and the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to sharply increase interest rates in order to bring down prices. The changing economic environment was reflected in the GDP report. Consumer spending \u2013 the largest driver of the economy \u2013 slowed over the quarter but remained positive, rising 1% on an annual basis. Residential fixed investment, or home construction, dropped 14% on an annual basis and slowing business inventories, goods produced but not yet sold by businesses, dragged down the GDP number. Two quarters of negative GDP growth are widely regarded as a signal that the economy has gone into recession. But the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end. While the GDP figures will play into the NBER\u2019s final verdict, it also looks at a wider range of economic factors, including the jobs market, and is unlikely to give its decision soon. \u201cThe 0.9% annualized fall in GDP in the second quarter is disappointing but doesn\u2019t mean the economy is in recession,\u201d said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. \u201cThat said, the details show that higher rates and surging inflation are weighing on underlying demand, and we expect only a muted rebound in economic growth over the second half of the year.\u201d In the meantime, pressure remains on the Biden administration. Surveys of consumer confidence are falling as recession fears grow and Joe Biden\u2019s overall and economic approval poll numbers are at the lowest levels of his presidency. In a statement, Biden said it was \u201cno surprise that the economy is slowing down as the Federal Reserve acts to bring down inflation. But even as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure.\u201d Republicans countered that the report shows \u201cDemocrats\u2019 reckless economic policies are destroying our economy\u201d. The latest GDP figures came a day after the Fed announced another three-quarter of a percentage point increase in its benchmark interest rates as it fights to tame inflation. Prices rose at an annual rate of 9.1% in the year to June, driven up by soaring costs for fuel, food and shelter. While parts of the US economy remain strong \u2013 most notably the jobs market \u2013 the Covid pandemic continues to play havoc with global supplies and the war in Ukraine has pushed up energy prices. The confusing economic outlook has triggered sell-offs in stock markets around the world and led some economists to predict a recession is coming. Nearly 70% of leading academic economists polled by the Financial Times last month predicted the US economy will tip into a recession next year. Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that he did not believe the US was now in a recession. But he said the Fed was prepared to keep raising rates in order to bring prices back down and that it was inevitable that such a move would slow the economy and affect the job market. \u201cPrice stability is what makes the whole economy work,\u201d said Powell."

            "content": "The Republican chair of the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s happening. Neither does the Democratic president, Joe Biden, nor do a good number of economists. And yet, many Americans appear to believe the world\u2019s largest economy is in a recession, creating yet another liability for Biden in the run-up to November\u2019s midterm elections, where voters are already inclined to hand Republicans control of at least one chamber of Congress. The case for the country experiencing a contraction was bolstered on Thursday when the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported the economy shrank for the second straight quarter, a worrying data point that doesn\u2019t satisfy the technical definition of a recession, but nonetheless underscores the damage done by snarled global supply chains and America\u2019s continuing bout of high inflation. \u201cIt suggests, overall, the economy is weakening, it\u2019s certainly losing steam, where there are storm clouds not only on the horizon but we\u2019re entering them right now,\u201d said James W Hughes, dean emeritus of the Edward J Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear whether we\u2019re in a recession right now.\u201d Biden attempted to downplay the data after its release, saying that a growth slowdown is \u201cno surprise\u201d after the US economy expanded rapidly last year and made up ground from the record collapse caused by Covid-19 in 2020. \u201cEven as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure,\u201d Biden said in a statement that called for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, a compromise bill Democrats announced this week to fund party priorities such as lowering healthcare costs and fighting climate change, while also reducing the federal budget deficit. The Republican chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, appeared inclined to agree. The central bank has spent much of this year raising interest rates to keep prices in check, and on Wednesday announced another big increase. \u201cI do not think the US is currently in a recession and the reason is there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,\u201d Powell said, speaking the day before the GDP data was released. But to Republicans, the report was all the proof they needed that the economy is on the decline, and that the president is to blame. Indeed, they had a moniker at the ready: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s recession\u201d. \u201cBiden and Democrats are responsible for our shrinking economy, and they\u2019re only trying to make it worse,\u201d the Republican National Committee chair, Ronna McDaniel, said. Their announcement wasn\u2019t exactly correct. While many countries consider two consecutive quarters of economic contraction to be a recession, in the US, the private National Bureau of Economic Research makes the call, and defines it as \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months\u201d. Surveys indicate Americans aren\u2019t waiting for those economists to weigh in. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index, which measures Americans\u2019 views of the economy, hit its lowest point ever in June. Though it rebounded slightly in July, the survey\u2019s figure is lower than even April 2020, when Covid-19 had cost more than 20 million people their jobs and the unemployment rate hit 14.7%. \u201cIt\u2019s shock, after shock, after shock and we\u2019re in an environment where these shocks are affecting morale,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at the consultancy EY-Parthenon. The disruptions include the past year and a half of rising inflation, the sharp uptick in gas prices in 2022 and the Covid-19 pandemic itself, particularly the new variants that have hampered the return of everyday life. All of that has sucked the cheer out of what would normally be a critical asset for the Biden administration: low unemployment. The jobless rate was 3.6% in June, near where it was before the pandemic, and the economy has added hundreds of thousands of jobs in recent months. To Daco, the question of why the economy is where it is can\u2019t be answered by the actions of one man. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can really put the blame on any administration when it comes to the state of the economy, especially when you have a shock\u201d like the Covid-19 pandemic, he said. \u201cThat blame game doesn\u2019t really serve much purpose.\u201d Voters nonetheless seem ready to take their frustration out on Biden. A SSRS poll conducted for CNN and released earlier in July found only 30% of respondents agreed with his handling of the economy, and just 38% approved of his job performance in general. The poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight puts the odds of the Democrats losing control of the House of Representatives as high, and they may also become the minority in the Senate. The Republicans waiting to take over leadership of Congress\u2019s lower house are said to be planning investigations of the first two years of Biden\u2019s presidency, including the inflation wave. Consumer prices have climbed 9.1% for the 12 months until June, a rate not seen since the early 1980s. The forces pushing them up are myriad, and include the Fed\u2019s zero interest rate policies during the Covid-19 downturn, the government\u2019s attempts to rescue the economy by sending consumers money and the global supply chain disruptions that remain from the days of pandemic lockdowns, which have been worsened by new shocks to oil and food markets caused by the war in Ukraine. Much has been made of Biden\u2019s policies in 2021, particularly the $1.9tn American Rescue Plan, which was intended to jolt the economy\u2019s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic by again sending Americans stimulus checks, and also aiding unemployed workers and local governments. Economists differ over how much that package added to inflation. William Spriggs, chief economist of the AFL-CIO trade union federation, sees it as one of the few things keeping the economy going. \u201cPeople have been able to spin the story, with the help of economists, that the inflation is Biden\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. Instead, Spriggs credited the American Rescue Plan with giving consumers the funds to continue spending, even as the economy contracted in the second quarter of this year. With its power to raise interest rates and drive up costs for mortgages, car loans and other sorts of debt, the Fed is the most powerful inflation fighter in Washington. It is near certain the central bank, which operates independently from the White House and Congress, will continue raising interest rates when it meets again in September, though perhaps not as aggressively as in months past. The central bank\u2019s approach poses its own problems, Spriggs said. Higher interest rates in the United States won\u2019t do much to lower global oil and food prices that are hitting American markets, but could cut into the consumer spending he argues is keeping the economy afloat \u2013 and create the recession the Fed says it\u2019s trying to avoid. \u201cIf the economy overheated, then how do you get two quarters of negative growth?\u201d asked Spriggs. \u201cThat\u2019s self evident, and I find it disturbing that the Fed is talking about the overheating economy, and because of that, the Fed therefore becomes a threat.\u201d"

Great lava pools have replaced the oceans, and nobody knows what a tree is. Somewhere in what remains of the UK, something looks at a menu, ponders for a moment, and orders a McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger for 99p. Or so you might have expected until yesterday, when the fast food giant announced a change to one of those prices that seemed written in stone: after 14 years, the era of the sub-\u00a31 cheeseburger is over. The company said it had protected consumers from increased costs for as long as it could, and the price had to go up to \u00a31.19. There will be increases to a range of other items like McFlurrys, fries, and large meals \u2013 but it\u2019s the totemic burger that sticks in your head. Energy prices are going to be the biggest pressure for most households: only yesterday, it was forecast that bills will reach \u00a33,850 per year by Christmas. But the way that this price change resonates, and how it compares with other increases in different parts of the economy, tells us some important things about another aspect of how the cost of living crisis is developing. For today\u2019s newsletter, I\u2019ve spoken with economist and author Duncan Weldon about handbags, video games, and the meaning of a 99p cheeseburger. Here are the headlines.

In depth: Inflation variation from Chanel to Asda When we talk about inflation, it can sound like an uncontrollable, mysterious abstraction. In one sense, that\u2019s true: there\u2019s no ambassador for inflation to hold talks with, and no button to switch it off. In another very blunt way, though, it isn\u2019t true: almost any time an item\u2019s price goes up, that\u2019s because somebody, somewhere, has decided to charge more for it. The McDonald\u2019s hamburger hasn\u2019t stayed 99p for 14 years because its recipe happened to feature the only combination of ingredients where costs haven\u2019t changed: it\u2019s stayed there because McDonald\u2019s has decided it\u2019s worth holding the price down and absorbing those costs itself. Duncan Weldon, author of a new history of the British economy, Two Hundred Years of Muddling Through, and the Value Added newsletter on Substack, said that the price change \u201cwill not have been an easy decision for them to make at all. [McDonald\u2019s] know their customers well, and they will have had concern about the impact of moving the prices up. And you never know which are the things that are going to become the examples that get picked up by, for example, the Guardian morning email.\u201d That\u2019s influence for you, eh. From luxury goods to fast food, the tipping points for price hikes will come at very different stages. *** Chanel small classic handbag 2019 \u00a33,810 Today \u00a36,510 Well, look, this might be an area you have to make a cutback. \u201cOn any sort of luxury good, the producer has an awful lot of pricing power,\u201d said Weldon. \u201cAll of their costs will have soared: price inflation for producers is running well ahead of consumer price inflation. Lots of firms have been taking a margin hit. But they don\u2019t have the same issue with passing that on to the consumer.\u201d That\u2019s because, obviously, if you want a Chanel bag, you want a Chanel bag, and you\u2019re unlikely to pick a Primark one instead. Then there\u2019s the fact that, at a certain level, the price becomes a reassuring status symbol in itself (just like the fact that you\u2019re limited to buying one a year). The demand is \u2018inelastic\u2019 \u2013 that is, people who think nothing of a \u00a33,800 handbag are probably pretty comfortable with a \u00a36,500 one as well. This is useful, in part, as an example of what simply isn\u2019t possible in other parts of the economy. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling mass market items competing with lots of others, you don\u2019t have the luxury of simply passing all the costs on without thinking about it,\u201d Weldon said. *** Video games Goldeneye, Nintendo 64, 1997 Around \u00a360 Fifa 22, XBox One, 2022 \u00a359.99 Those of us of a certain age and level of nerdery may remember \u00a360 console titles in the 90s; despite vastly increased levels of complexity and corresponding budgets, so-called \u2018AAA\u2019 games are about the same price today. If they had risen with inflation, they\u2019d be around \u00a3120 \u2013 so it\u2019s a real-terms price cut of about 50%. But that era may be ending. \u201cUntil this bout of inflation, the story in advanced economies has been that the price of goods have effectively been falling, and services have become a bit more expensive,\u201d Weldon said. \u201cThat\u2019s a story of technological change, of outsourcing manufacturing and deeper globalisation. But with a severe supply chain crunch, that\u2019s reversing.\u201d As the pandemic started to bite at the end of 2020, games manufacturers in the US began what they viewed as a long overdue effort to raise the typical price from $60 to $70, while new and confusing revenue sources within games like \u201cloot boxes\u201d and expansion packs are pushing spending up in a way that doesn\u2019t appear in the retail price. The pandemic is a huge factor on the demand side, too. \u201cWe saw this big shift in consumer spending patterns,\u201d Weldon said. \u201cYour typical consumer is spending a lot less than they\u2019re used to on services, the pub or a haircut, and a lot more on goods. And all of that pushed prices up as well.\u201d *** Lurpak slightly salted spreadable 500g Average UK supermarket price 2021 \u00a33.53 Average UK supermarket price 2022 \u00a34.87 You might have seen stories a few weeks ago about this 38% increase, according to research firm Assosia; the grabbier detail came in a social media post showing 750g tubs for \u00a36 in Asda with security tags on. It isn\u2019t just about butter, obviously: most staples have gone up in supermarkets, which have extremely low margins within which to absorb increases in costs. At the same time, said Weldon, it\u2019s important to note that \u201cBritain has had the cheapest food in western Europe for a long time. But now [retailers] are faced with a situation where you can\u2019t squeeze the production costs any more, or your suppliers will go out of business.\u201d You won\u2019t ever see a press release announcing an item\u2019s price rise at Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s: their prices change constantly, with \u201chuge amounts of data on the impact and confidence about how it will affect demand.\u201d Supermarkets will prioritise keeping certain high profile staples \u2013 like a pint of milk or a loaf of bread \u2013 as low as they possibly can. \u201cThey don\u2019t like to put prices up for things which consumers notice,\u201d Weldon said. *** McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger 2008 \u2013 July 25 2022 99p July 26 2022 \u00a31.19 \u201cBehavioural economists think about anchoring points on prices,\u201d said Weldon - and 99p is a very important one. \u201cIn the same way, it was the Pret 99p filter coffee until recently.\u201d And, obviously, even when inflation was around 2%, McDonald\u2019s was effectively cutting the price each year. In the past, that\u2019s been worthwhile as a branding tool and loss leader to get customers through the door even if Big Tasty meals are creeping up. \u201cThey will have wanted to keep this down for as long as they could,\u201d Weldon said. Painful though it is for the company, it has another future benefit: the next increases of a few pennies will be easier to make without putting people off. Just as there was never anything altruistic about the 99p price, there\u2019s nothing particularly wicked about \u00a31.19, either. \u201cIt\u2019s important to step back, and say why is this happening?\u201d Weldon said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening because we had a pandemic, global supply chains are broken, war in Europe is making energy and food more expensive, and so the country is poorer. It\u2019s not a story of greedy corporates\u2019 decisions, or greedy workers demanding more, or stupid bankers printing too much money. It\u2019s because real things have happened.\u201d \u201cThe policy debate should be about how we allocate that pain best among firms, households, different people,\u201d Weldon said. \u201cAnd instead the political debate we have is how do we make it go away.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Oliver Milman follows the Gen-Z environmental activists who\u2019ve turned their ire to gas guzzling SUVs.

            "date": "2022-07-26T15:10:51Z",
            "content": "The International Monetary Fund has said the global economy could soon be teetering on the brink of recession amid evidence that the world\u2019s three biggest economies are all stalling and inflation is higher than previously forecast. In a downbeat update to its April world economic outlook (WEO), the IMF cut its growth forecasts in 2022 and 2023 \u2013 and raised the prospect of a more pronounced slowdown. It said problems in the US, China and the eurozone had resulted in global output falling in the second quarter of this year \u2013 the first contraction since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThe outlook has darkened significantly since April,\u201d said the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. \u201cThe world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one.\u201d The Washington-based IMF said it now expected the global economy to grow by 3.2% in 2022 \u2013 a 0.4-point reduction since April. The slowdown is predicted to continue next year, when growth is now forecast to be 2.9% \u2013 0.7 points lower than had been pencilled in three months ago. The UK is forecast to grow by 3.2% in 2022 and by just 0.5% in 2023 \u2013 cuts of 0.5 and 0.7 points. The IMF expects the UK to slow down markedly in the second half of this year and to be the weakest of the G7 economies in 2023. \u201cThe global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,\u201d Gourinchas said. \u201cHigher than expected inflation, especially in the United States and major European economies, is triggering a tightening of global financial conditions. China\u2019s slowdown has been worse than anticipated amid Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns, and there have been further negative spillovers from the war in Ukraine.\u201d The IMF said that by the fourth quarter of 2022 it was forecasting global inflation of 8.3%, up from its April estimate of 6.9%. It identified the UK \u2013 where inflation is now on course to be 2.7 points higher at 10.5% \u2013 and the eurozone (up 2.9 points to 7.3%) as places where cost of living pressures had particularly intensified. A breakdown of the revised WEO forecasts showed growth downgrades in 2022 of 0.8 points in the US, 0.9 points in Germany and 1.1 points for China. In 2023, all the world\u2019s major economies apart from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia \u2013 both oil exporting countries \u2013 are now expected to grow more slowly. Only Japan and Canada of the group of major industrial nations are forecast to grow by more than 1% next year, with the IMF predicting expansion of 1% in the US and France, 0.8% in Germany and 0.7% in Italy. Gourinchas said there were a number of downside risks to the global economy that could result in an even weaker performance. These included: A sudden stop of European gas flows from Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine. Stubbornly high inflation. A debt crisis triggered by tighter global financial conditions. Further Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in China. Social unrest triggered by rising food and energy prices. Trade wars and geopolitical fragmentation. \u201cIn a plausible alternative scenario where some of these risks materialise, including a full shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, inflation will rise and global growth decelerate further to about 2.6% this year and 2% next year \u2013 a pace that growth has fallen below just five times since 1970,\u201d Gourinchas said. \u201cUnder this scenario, both the United States and the euro area experience near zero growth next year, with negative knock-on effects for the rest of the world.\u201d The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor said combatting inflation should be the top priority for policymakers, and he supported recent central bank decisions to raise interest rates. \u201cTighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship. Central banks that have started tightening should stay the course until inflation is tamed,\u201d he said. Governments could cushion the impact of the slowdown on the most vulnerable through targeted support, Gourinchas said, but the help should be paid for by higher taxes or lower public spending to ensure the job of central banks was not made harder."

            "date": "2022-07-28T21:26:16Z",
            "content": "Apple reported higher-than-expected profit and sales as demand for iPhones holds steady even amid inflation and the challenges of an economic slowdown. Sales and profit for the quarter were $83bn and $1.20 a share, according to Apple, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The report is a positive sign for the company, which earlier this year lost its status as the most valuable company in the world to the oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company\u2019s shares rose by 2.6% after hours in response to the news. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, described the quarter as a reflection of the company\u2019s \u201cresilience and optimism\u201d and said it managed to achieve better than expected results despite supply constraints and the effects of the company suspending sales in Russia. There has been no slowdown in demand for iPhones, Apple\u2019s CFO, Luca Maestri, told Reuters. Apple reported iPhone sales were $40.7bn, up about 3% from a year earlier and well ahead of the overall global smartphone market. The company\u2019s loyal and affluent customer base has in the past allowed it to weather economic dips better than some other companies. But the slowing economy is hurting sales of advertising, accessories and home products, Maestri said. \u201cFortunately, we have a very broad portfolio, so we know we\u2019re going to be able to navigate that,\u201d he said. Parts shortages will continue to limit Mac and iPad sales, Maestri said, though the impact has been easing. \u201cAs a largely hardware company, Apple is arguably more directly exposed to supply chain issues than the other tech giants reporting earnings this week, but it also has a growing services business that is an important part of its diversification strategy, so it has flex in its model,\u201d Tom Johnson, the global chief digital officer at Mindshare Worldwide, said of Apple\u2019s quarterly earnings. In April, Apple warned it expected a growth slowdown despite its stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results. The company has struggled with Covid shutdowns at factories in China and a computer chip shortage. Apple has managed to maintain greater stability than other tech giants that have announced hiring slowdowns and layoffs. But the company does plan to slow hiring and spending next year in an effort to be more cautious as an expected recession looms, Bloomberg reported this month. \u201cApple\u2019s move reflects a broader slowdown in investing in new things, new companies and new products,\u201d Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, told Reuters. \u201cIt signifies that inflation is an issue for these companies.\u201d Google, Microsoft and Meta have announced plans to slow hiring or cut jobs. Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk has said the company will cut 10% of its workforce while Netflix, which lost 1 million subscribers earlier this year, laid off 300 employees. After seeing record profits during the pandemic, the industry as a whole has struggled for months amid rising interest rates, inflation and sluggish economic growth. The tech-driven Nasdaq composite index has already fallen by 26% this year. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, reported higher revenue than last year, suggesting the company may weather a slow economy better than anticipated. Meanwhile, Meta reported that it projected the first decline in its revenue since the company went public. Reuters contributed to this report"

            "date": "2022-07-23T08:00:33Z",
            "content": "When the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade on 24 June, permitting the state criminalisation of abortion in America, the only thing everyone could agree on was that it was a historic decision. Unfortunately for America, the history it was based on was largely fake. The ruling, Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, claims that in reversing Roe v Wade, the court restores the US to \u201can unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment [that] persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973\u201d, when Roe legalised abortion. This assertion, however, is easily disproven.As historians have exhaustively explained, early American common law (as in Britain) generally permitted abortions until \u201cquickening\u201d, or perceptible foetal movement, usually between 16 to 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Connecticut was the first state to ban abortion after quickening, in 1821, which is roughly two centuries after the earliest days of American common law. It was not until the 1880s that every US state had some laws restricting abortion, and not until the 1910s that it was criminalised in every state. In the wake of Dobbs, social media was awash with examples from 18th- and 19th-century newspapers that clearly refuted Alito\u2019s false assertion, sharing examples of midwives and doctors legally advertising abortifacients, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s at-home abortion remedies, and accounts of 19th-century doctors performing \u201ctherapeutic\u201d (medically necessary) abortions. Dobbs\u2019s inaccurate claims about the history of US abortion law is one of many reasons why it is so controversial. It is arguably the most divisive ruling since 1857, when the supreme court found that Dred Scott, who had been enslaved and was suing for his freedom, had no standing in US federal courts as a Black man. The Dred Scott decision was a casus belli of the US civil war four years later, and there are many reasons to fear that Dobbs could prove as divisive. Another proximate cause of the civil war was the Fugitive Slave Act, which led Harriet Beecher Stowe to write what was until 1936 the most popular American novel ever, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, condemning the cruelty of slavery and the insanity of the fugitive slave laws. The Fugitive Slave Act impelled states to return enslaved humans to their enslavers, even if they were residing in free states that did not recognise slavery, and financially incentivised remanding people into slavery. It was this division that prompted Lincoln to give his famous \u201chouse divided\u201d speech, saying that a nation could not endure half-slave and half-free: because an individual\u2019s human rights were drastically changing from state to state. Dobbs has created for pregnant women an analogous situation to the fugitive slave laws, with the bounty hunter laws it has permitted in states like Idaho and Texas, where women may be prosecuted by the state in which they reside for obtaining an abortion beyond its borders. It will create legal chaos, triggering inter-state conflict, as fights over extradition and a state\u2019s legal rights beyond its own borders will certainly erupt once more. But there is yet another, less well-known cause for all this in civil-war era America. Although most people today assume that anti-abortion laws were motivated by moral or religious beliefs about a foetus\u2019s right to life, that is far from the whole story. In fact, the first wave of anti-abortion laws were entangled in arguments about nativism, eugenics and white supremacism, as they dovetailed with a cultural panic that swept the US in the late 19th and early 20th century as a result of the vast changes in American society wrought by the conflict. This panic was referred to at the time in shorthand as \u201crace suicide\u201d. The increasing traction today of the far-right \u201cgreat replacement theory\u201d, which contends that there is a global conspiracy to replace white people with people of colour, and has explicitly motivated white supremacist massacres in the US, is often said to have originated with a French novel called The Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail. Published in 1973, the same year that Roe v Wade enshrined American women\u2019s rights to reproductive autonomy, it is a dystopian account of \u201cswarthy hordes\u201d of immigrants sweeping in and destroying western civilisation. But there were many earlier panics over \u201cwhite extinction\u201d, and in the US, debates around abortion have been entangled with race panic from the start. The fight to criminalise abortion may have successfully passed itself off as a moral crusade, but its origins are rooted in a political one.The idea of \u201crace suicide\u201d was popularised in the early 20th century largely by Theodore Roosevelt, who urged white women to have more babies to protect \u201cnative\u201d American society against \u201cdiminishing birth rates\u201d. He harangued Americans that \u201cintentional childlessness\u201d rendered people \u201cguilty\u201d of being \u201ccriminals against the race\u201d. Roosevelt gave speeches declaring: \u201cI believe in children. I want to see enough of them and of the right kind.\u201d The Dobbs opinion explicitly rejects arguments that anti-abortion laws were historically motivated by eugenicist nativism, rather than by religious or moral beliefs. It says that the opposition was only able to produce \u201cone prominent proponent\u201d of the idea that earlier anti-abortion laws were driven by \u201cfear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than Protestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White Protestant women to \u2018shirk their maternal duties\u2019\u201d. Yet even a cursory survey of American discourse a century ago shows how utterly ubiquitous this idea was, as newspapers and lectures and sermons warned that abortion would mean that Catholics and other foreign-born immigrants would outnumber Protestant, native-born Americans. To take just one example among thousands, a 1903 editorial on population statistics noted that the Protestant population of the US was increasing by 8.1% while the Catholic population was increasing by 21.8%. This \u201calarming condition of things\u201d was reflected by physicians reporting \u201con the average more than five abortions a month, none of them in Catholic families\u201d. The piece was headlined \u201cReligion and Race Suicide\u201d. As a concept, \u201crace suicide\u201d goes back to the aftermath of the civil war. The fundamental problem of primogeniture \u2013 ensuring the legitimacy of property succession in a male-dominated society \u2013 had an even nastier twist in a slave society. Under the laws of American slavery, the more children a Black woman produced, the more human capital her enslaver acquired, while the more white children a white woman produced, the more political capital white men accrued in a representative democracy in which only white men voted and made laws on behalf of all white citizens. But the civil war, and the civil rights amendments that followed it, upended the legal foundations for that old racial and gendered hierarchy. They would have to be rebuilt, and controlling Protestant white women\u2019s reproduction to ensure the reproduction of the Protestant elite was central to that project. The war had devastated a generation of white men, with estimates of around 750,000 dead, or 2.5% of the population, as the ratio of white men to women plummeted after the war. White women were gaining self-determination, forcing their way into higher education and professions. (Men were fighting back: as historians have shown, when American male doctors professionalised in the mid-19th century, one of their projects was to hobble the competition by undermining the legitimacy of midwives and nurse practitioners in caring for pregnant women, and assert their sole control over women\u2019s reproduction, which included supporting anti-abortion laws, except when under their care.) Contraception and medical standards were improving while urban industrialisation mitigated against the need for large families to work farms. As a result, white Americans\u2019 fertility rates dropped precipitously across the 19th century, with families having an average of seven children in 1800, falling to four by 1900. A newly emancipated racial \u201cunderclass\u201d was suddenly shifting the nation\u2019s power structures, even as huge waves of immigration threatened to undermine Anglo-Saxon cultural and political dominance. Already in existence as a phrase, \u201crace suicide\u201d rapidly became shorthand for the protection of \u201cwhite purity\u201d. The expression was used in the former Confederate states to describe mixed-race marriages: an 1884 editorial railed against anyone who \u201capproves of miscegenation\u201d for tolerating \u201cthe great shame and crime of race suicide\u201d. It was invoked to restrict Asian immigration: to allow \u201ccoolie competition,\u201d, wrotedeclared a 1900 editorial in baldly racist terms, \u201cis to commit race suicide\u201d. Soon spokesmen for the patriarchal class (politicians, physicians, preachers and professors) were making explicit claims about the racial obligations of Protestant adults to sustain their political dominance. When Roosevelt and other prominent figures such as sociologist Edward A Ross took up the cry, a panic about \u201crace suicide\u201d began sweeping the nation, as elite Americans explicitly discussed how to maintain their political dominance if their numbers were dwindling. \u201cAnti\u2011race suicide clubs\u201d were formed, as students at Ivy League universities pledged to have no fewer than five children. By 1918, the US army\u2019s campaign for sexual \u201chygiene\u201d among soldiers included an educational film called \u201cBeware of Race Suicide!\u201d Meanwhile, editorials across America called for lawmakers to \u201cprevent the awful waste of life at present so great due to abortions and stillbirths: and, more important still, to refuse the right of marriage to the hopelessly diseased and unfit\u201d. The argument was straightforwardly eugenicist; soon it was shaping bestselling books, such as Madison Grant\u2019s 1916 The Passing of the Great Race, which Hitler referred to as his bible. When the resurgent Ku Klux Klan paraded in Louisiana in 1922, they bore banners that read \u201cWhite Supremacy\u201d, \u201cAmerica First\u201d, \u201cOne Hundred Per Cent American\u201d, \u201cRace Purity\u201d and \u201cAbortionists, Beware!\u201d People are sometimes confused by the Klan\u2019s animus against abortionists, or impute it to generalised patriarchal authoritarianism, but it was much more specifically about \u201crace purity\u201d: white domination can only be maintained by white reproduction. Along the way, improvements in medical science had revealed the gradual development of a human foetus and eliminated the simpler idea of quickening, as moral and existential questions about the beginnings of human life became more complex. By the late 1920s and 30s, the successful criminalisation of abortion had sent it underground, while purporting to protect the purity of white women. By 1938, abortion had become so synonymous with the phrase that a film about a criminal abortion ring that preys on young women was titled Race Suicide. In a forgotten 1928 bestseller called Bad Girl, a married young white woman considers an abortion to maintain her freedom; having decided to keep the baby, she casually employs a racist slur in thinking about the Black mothers with whom she will have to share a ward: \u201cBut I guess you don\u2019t care who your neighbours are once the pain starts,\u201d she reflects. The same point is made from an anti-racist perspective in Langston Hughes\u2019s 1936 story Cora Unashamed, in which a white girl dies from the abortion her mother forces her to undergo rather than see her bear the child of a Greek immigrant. Cora, the Black protagonist, although racially and economically subjugated, has at least borne her own illegitimate mixed-race child free of these lethal hypocrisies. It was the same year Margaret Mitchell published Gone With the Wind, which replaced Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin as America\u2019s bestselling novel. It is also, by no coincidence, a tale of slavery and the civil war, although instead of condemning slavery, it defends it and condemns the war that ended it. The plot of Gone With the Wind is driven less by war, however, than by pregnancy and childbirth. Melanie Wilkes narrowly survives her first labour only to die following a later miscarriage. Scarlett miscarries one child, loses a daughter and contemplates a back-alley abortion. This focus on the dangers of pregnancy for 19th-century women is part of Gone With the Wind\u2019s white feminism \u2013 but is also inextricable from its white supremacism. Melanie won\u2019t move north after the war because her son would go to school with Yankees and Black children. Wanting her children to bear witness, and to bear power, she teaches them to hate the Yankees, \u201cwho have set the darkies up to lord it over us, who are robbing us and keeping our men from voting!\u201d Scarlett thinks in similar terms when contemplating her plantation Tara, \u201cthe red earth which would bear cotton for their sons and their sons\u2019 sons.\u201d Meanwhile Rhett\u2019s love for the daughter he forcibly stops Scarlett from aborting is more than paternal adoration and displaced love for Scarlett. Mitchell also makes clear that Rhett\u2019s devotion to his daughter is a reflection of his dedication to his people \u2013 his race \u2013 and his determination not to let them die out. By 1939, the year Gone With the Wind premiered as a film, the subtext of \u201crace suicide\u201d had become manifest. Reporting the latest population statistics, a California paper declared \u201cthe race suicide prophecies we have heard for many years don\u2019t seem to have been justified\u201d, as \u201cthere\u2019s evidently life in the white race yet\u201d. Fifteen years later, the United States launched into another of its periodic surges of violence in the onward fight for civil rights and a multiracial democracy. Another landmark supreme court ruling, Brown v Board of Education in 1954, desegregated American public schools. In response, social conservatives began setting up private Christian schools, which also happened to be all-white. As late as 1968, evangelicals at a symposium refused to denounce abortion as a sin, \u201cciting individual health, family welfare, and social responsibility as justifications for ending a pregnancy\u201d. But with the passage of Roe in 1973, the picture altered, as ever more single women began exercising their rights to bodily autonomy. At the same time, the Nixon administration decided to remove the tax-exempt status of segregated white Christian schools, causing leading social conservatives to seek a wedge issue. As historians have shown, archival correspondence reveals they found in abortion a socially acceptable pretext for a battle that would mobilise social conservatives and allow them to fight for white Christian patriarchy as they understood it, reproducing their dominance. The day after Dobbs revoked American women\u2019s right to reproductive autonomy, Republican congresswoman Mary Miller of Illinois publicly thanked Donald Trump, \u201con behalf of all the MAGA patriots in America\u201d, for putting on to the court the justices who created \u201cthe historic victory for white life in the supreme court\u201d. She later claimed it was a slip of the tongue, but the crowd cheered nonetheless. Anyone who was startled by this reaction to the injection of race into a decision supposedly about women\u2019s rights does not know the history of abortion law in America. It has always been a contest not only over women\u2019s reproduction, but also over the reproduction of political power \u2013 because in a (putatively) representative democracy, power is a function of population. The assault on women\u2019s rights is part of the wider move to reclaim the \u201ccommanding place\u201d in society for a small minority of patriarchal white men. And, as Alito\u2019s decision shows, where legal precedent and other justifications cannot be found, myth will fill the vacuum. \u2022 The Wrath to Come: Gone With the Wind and the Lies America Tells by Sarah Churchwell will be published by Head of Zeus on 4 August."

Showing his emotion at Cop26 revealed that his motivations are more profound than the usual desire for profit and personal status. A recent paper by the UN Commons Cluster is urging that we need to rise above petty party political differences to fully address the escalating climate and ecological collapse. These existential crises are a global threat: if we cannot cooperate within our own borders, how can we provide worthy leadership to the rest of the world? I would like to see an emergency cross-party government established in the UK to begin to address the reality of ecological collapse. Tragically, our pursuit of GDP growth encourages us to increase all three of the key drivers of environmental damage: population, affluence and technology. We urgently need a new direction. Barbara Williams Long Hanborough, Oxfordshire Covid risks were all too real As a doctor with the erstwhile NHS Covid response team, and the father of teenage girls, I must take issue with Dr Breathnach (\u201cPaying the price of lockdown\u201d, Letters). The risks of Covid were not \u201cvague\u201d. We had real-life evidence from Italy of how a health system could be overwhelmed. Our response was time sensitive, and ultimately tardy, with more than 180,000 deaths. A time-consuming series of intergenerational debates was not feasible. The mental health of young people is extremely important, and the cuts to child and adolescent mental health services further give the lie to the Tory boast that they \u201cgot the big calls right\u201d. Few families have been left unscathed. However, when your house is on fire, you cannot commission a study into the demerits of water damage due to fire hoses. While many aspects of the pandemic were not handled well, treating the pandemic as a public health emergency was not a mistake. Denis Jackson Glasgow Needless deaths of chickens Jon Ungoed-Thomas\u2019s article makes for sobering reading (\u201cEvery week one million chickens \u2018die needlessly to keep prices low\u2019\u201d, News). To put the numbers in perspective, the 2001 cull to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease saw some 6.5 million animals killed. This number will be exceeded on UK poultry farms by the time a new PM has taken office, and exceeded fourfold by Christmas. Regardless of one\u2019s position on the farming of animals for meat, the scale of this needless death seems unjustifiable. That such deaths could be greatly reduced through initiatives such as the Better Chicken Commitment, and that many of our largest retailers refuse to make such a commitment, seems a damning indictment of our society\u2019s relationship with the animals we consume. Jack Slater Bristol Tell us what can be recycled Thank you for an illuminating report about the sorry state of recycling in the UK (\u201cWe\u2019re rubbish at recycling\u201d, Special report). However, I feel the biggest issue is the public being set up to fail, owing to a lack of clear instructions given to households about what is recyclable and what isn\u2019t. My local council, Manchester City, provides three separate recycling collections but only very basic information to residents about what is accepted. Nothing about \u2018the tennis ball rule\u2019 or whether \u201ccompostable items\u201d can be included with food waste; no instruction to wash items or information about what would contaminate the recycling process. Furthermore, there is a system of coding plastics for recycling but that isn\u2019t explained to residents either. The comment in the article of a rather over-enthusiastic recycler, James Piper, resonated for me: \u201cIt is better for people to recycle cautiously than to over-recycle.\u201d If councils can provide more comprehensive information to households about how to better prepare their waste, the system might have a better chance of success. Rachel Gutteridge Manchester Disturbing call for war Simon Tisdall\u2019s call for war by Nato against Russia is deeply disturbing (\u201cPutin is already at war with Europe. There is only one way to stop him\u201d, Foreign affairs commentary). Nato would undoubtedly win a conventional war against Russia and there is little doubt that, pushed into the corner of imminent defeat, Russia would revert to the means by which it could equalise the conflict, using nuclear weapons, probably on the battlefield at first. Tisdall\u2019s call for Nato to defend Ukraine, therefore, is a clear willingness to countenance a nuclear holocaust as it would not be possible to contain a nuclear conflict once it started. However, he does not even make a passing reference to this, the biggest danger of the crisis.

The UN\u2019s global population project predicts a fall in China\u2019s population to 1.3 billion by 2050 but this estimate may be too conservative.

            "date": "2022-07-26T18:46:59Z",
            "content": "Of the many blows traded between Tory leader wannabes Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, perhaps the most surprising has been accusations of \u201caggressive mansplaining\u201d by the former chancellor from the foreign secretary\u2019s camp. Sunak\u2019s interruptions in Monday night\u2019s head-to-head debate, his speaking over Truss, his general \u201cshouty private school behaviour\u201d was condemned as \u201cdesperate\u201d and \u201cunbecoming\u201d by Truss supporters. Sunak\u2019s team hit back. Yes, the debate was lively. But it was \u201cinsulting\u201d to suggest Truss could not look after herself in a \u201crumbustious\u201d debate, insisted the deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab. Sunak was, according to others, merely explaining the deficiencies in Truss\u2019s proposed fiscal policy. Nothing sexist about that. So, when does merely explaining become the far more charged \u201cmansplaining\u201d? According to the OED, the verb \u201cmansplain\u201d is defined as \u201cOf a man: to explain (something) needlessly, overbearingly, or condescendingly , esp. (typically when addressing a woman) in a manner thought to reveal a patronising or chauvinistic attitude\u201d. Or, as shorthanded by Catherine Mayer, co-founder and president of the Women\u2019s Equality Party, journalist and activist: \u201cIn its strictest sense, mansplaining is about men explaining things to women that women already understand perhaps better than the speaker.\u201d \u201cMansplaining can be pretty funny. I know we get angry about it. But, one of the perils of being co-founder of the Women\u2019s Equality Party is the number of men who rush to tell me how to do, or not to do, feminism,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, mansplaining is a huge and constant thing. And there is a lot of it about at the moment\u201d. The term was first coined in 2008, following an essay by US author Rebecca Solnit headlined \u201cMen who explain things\u201d in the Los Angeles Times, in which she described a time a man explained a book to her without acknowledging that she herself wrote it. That led to the term, which was adopted initially on feminist blogs, with usage growing steadily. Now it\u2019s mainstream. Mansplaining, said Mayer, is \u201cvery much part of the wider culture that puts a different value on what men and women say. Men get to have big ideas, and what they say is granted an importance it may or may not have. Whereas women with big ideas get told they are pushy or are talked over, and their ideas are either co-opted or ignored. And the structural exclusion of vital ideas and perspectives is one of the reasons politics is so broken.\u201d She did not watch the Sunak-Truss debate, but believes both are \u201chopeless candidates\u201d. And that being so, she said, \u201cit potentially confuses the issue of mansplaining\u201d in this case. \u201cTrussanomics\u201d \u2013 or Truss\u2019s economic policy \u2013 was unworkable, Mayer believed. \u201cAnd so she is likely to have given Sunak room for explanation as well as mansplanation.\u201d Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price had no such hesitation, tweeting: \u201cMost women MPs have been subject to mansplaining and being talked over in debate. Never a worse example than right now on the BBC.\u201d Hand in hand with mansplaining goes \u201cmanterrruption\u201d. And Sunak definitely interrupted. Asked on BBC Breakfast, Truss supporter Simon Clarke MP, said: \u201cHe was certainly interrupting Liz a lot\u201d, though he declined to use the word \u201cmansplain\u201d saying only: \u201cI\u2019m not going to attach labels\u201d. Sunak supporter David Davis, however saw it as the cut and thrust of healthy debate, saying: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s important to intervene in debates.\u201d Manterruption is \u201ccertainly part of the same culture,\u201d said Mayer. \u201cAsserting yourself is great. Talking over other people is not. It\u2019s sort of on the edge of mansplaining.\u201d Robert Lawson, associate professor in sociolinguistics at Birmingham City University, said the Sunak-Truss debate would inevitably see a surge in Twitter use of hashtags #mansplaining and #manterruption, as such events drive debate on the issue. \u201cThen it becomes a debate around \u2018what is mansplaining? Did he definitely mansplain? Is it just a case he was explaining something and he\u2019s a man?\u2019 And so this debate becomes about what constitutes mansplaining and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Lawson, co-author of an academic paper called Gender Politics and Discourse of #mansplaining #manspreading and #manterruption on Twitter. The definition of mansplaining in the sociolinguistics field is \u201ca patronising and condescending explanation\u201d to someone who we can \u201creasonably expect to have some degree of expertise or knowledge in that field\u201d, he said. \u201cThese kinds of \u2018man\u2019 terms are part of a broader strategy of how do we actually talk about and draw attention to some of the more problematic elements of how men communicate, and if they do communicate like this , what can be done about it.\u201d But, while she thinks this could mean one positive outcome from Monday\u2019s debate, Mayer is less optimistic. \u201cOne of the other things I\u2019ve learned from activism is it is incredibly important to make people aware of stuff so you can change it. But that\u2019s only the first step. You also have to make them care about it, and in our polarised world, those sort of hashtag debates, instead of making people care about [an issue] in terms of having a moment of revelation and thinking I will change my behaviour, it tends to reinforce people in the behaviours they already had.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 July 2022. Rebecca Solnit\u2019s LA Times essay in 2008 was headlined \u201cMen who explain things\u201d, not Men Explain Things to Me, which is the title of her 2014 book."

            "title": "US faces new era of political violence as threats against lawmakers rise",
            "date": "2022-07-31T13:17:43Z",
            "content": "Members of the US House of Representatives will now receive up to $10,000 to upgrade security at their homes in the face of rising threats against lawmakers, the House sergeant at arms announced last week, in yet another sign that American politics has entered a dangerous, violent new phase. As support for political violence appears to be on the rise in the US, experts warn that such threats endanger the health of America\u2019s democracy. But they say the country still has time to tamp down violent rhetoric if political leaders, particularly those in the Republican party, stand up and condemn this alarming behavior. The announcement over increasing security for people in Congress came days after a man attacked Lee Zeldin, a New York congressman and Republican gubernatorial candidate, with a sharp object during a campaign event. Two weeks before that, a man was arrested outside the home of Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, for allegedly shouting racist obscenities and threatening to kill her. Last month, authorities filed federal charges against a man who they say traveled from California to Maryland with the intent of murdering the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh. Public service has clearly become an increasingly dangerous endeavor in America. Recent polls show an increasing number of Americans are comfortable with political violence, although there is a wide range of opinions on the type of violence that is acceptable. According to a mega-survey conducted by researchers at University of California, Davis, and released this month, one in five US adults say political violence is justified at least in some circumstances. A much smaller portion of survey respondents, 3%, believe that political violence is usually or always justified. Liliana Mason, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University and co-author (alongside Nathan P Kalmoe) of Radical American Partisanship: Mapping Violent Hostility, Its Causes, and the Consequences for Democracy, said the phrasing of survey questions on political violence can drastically affect results. But having studied such polling since 2017, Mason said it is clear that support for political violence is indeed on the rise in the US. \u201cI think of it as pretty low numbers of people who actually approve of violence at all,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThe problem is that, if you go from 7% to 20%, that means that there are certain social spaces where the norms around anti-violence are eroding.\u201d The impact of that trend can be seen at every level of American government, from the halls of Capitol Hill to local polling places. The US Capitol police reported 9,625 threats and directions of interest (meaning concerning actions or statements) against members of Congress last year, compared to 3,939 such instances in 2017. The members of the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection have frequently been the targets of violent threats, requiring them to get personal security details. One member of the committee, Republican Adam Kinzinger, recently shared a threatening letter sent to his wife last month. The sender vowed to execute Kinzinger, his wife and their newborn son. He is not seeking re-election in 2022. Even those who help administer elections in the US have reported an increase in threats against them. According to a poll conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice this year, one in six election officials have received threats because of their job, and 77% believe threats against them have increased in recent years. Jennifer McCoy, a political science professor at Georgia State University whose research focuses on polarized democracies, said: \u201cThe kinds of threats and intimidation to \u2026 election administration officials and poll workers is very concerning and is also new.\u201d The apparent increase in threats against public servants has sparked broader concerns about the health of American democracy, particularly in the wake of the January 6 insurrection. \u201cThere is simply no place for political violence in a healthy democracy. The increase in threats and harassment being leveled at people across our government is deeply concerning,\u201d said Jennifer Dresden, policy advocate for the group Protect Democracy. \u201cTo be clear, we\u2019re not yet at a point where political violence has fundamentally undermined our democracy. But when violence is connected to other authoritarian tactics, like disinformation and efforts to corrupt elections, that sets a dangerous path for our democracy that we cannot ignore.\u201d While threats and harassment against lawmakers and political candidates appear to have increased across many government institutions, they are not evenly distributed. One study of online messages sent to 2020 congressional candidates found that women, particularly women of color, were more likely to be the target of abusive content. Of all the candidates reviewed, the progressive congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who is Somali American, received the highest proportion of abusive messages on Twitter. Fellow progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is Puerto Rican American, saw the most abusive comments on Facebook. Women of color serving in Congress have spoken publicly about the threats they face, which have become a regular part of their lives on Capitol Hill. Congresswoman Jahana Hayes, who is Black, told PBS Newshour last year: \u201cI remember, at the beginning of the 116th Congress [in 2019], when we were just spotlighting and highlighting the beautiful diversity of this incoming Congress, but then, on every caucus call, we had members who were getting death threats on a daily basis.\u201d The acts of political violence carried out in the US are also unevenly distributed across the ideological spectrum. According to a study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League, rightwing extremists have committed about 75% of the 450 political murders that occurred in the US over the past decade. In comparison, Islamic extremists were responsible for about 20% of the murders, while leftwing extremists were blamed for 4% of the killings. Expert argue the frequency of rightwing violence compared with leftwing violence can be partly explained by Republican leaders\u2019 failure to condemn threatening rhetoric. \u201cWe see justifications for violence that are similar on the left and right,\u201d said Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies political conflict. \u201cBut we see incidents of violence that are vastly higher on the right and that has to do with all of the normalization of violence from leaders on the right.\u201d That normalization has been on vivid display over the past couple of years in the US. Donald Trump infamously referred to his supporters who carried out the deadly January 6 insurrection as \u201cvery special\u201d, telling them: \u201cWe love you.\u201d Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House for his role in the 6 January riot, but acquitted in the Senate. Last year, House Democrats, over near-unanimous Republican opposition, voted to strip the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of her committee assignments, after it was discovered that she had previously expressed support for assassinating Barack Obama and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. In November, Congressman Paul Gosar received the same punishment, as well as a House censure, after he shared an animated video depicting violence against Joe Biden and Ocasio-Cortez. Only two Republicans supported the censure. Most recently, the Senate candidate Eric Greitens was widely criticized for airing a campaign ad that appeared to encourage violence against more moderate Republicans. In the ad, Greitens, who resigned as Missouri governor over allegations of sexual harassment, is seen carrying a shotgun and bursting into homes as he urges the \u201chunting\u201d of Rinos, meaning Republicans in Name Only. Research indicates that the messages supporters receive from their political leaders have a large impact on whether they actually carry out violent acts, several experts said. In experiments conducted by Mason and her colleagues, some participants were asked to read a quote from Biden or Trump condemning violence while others read nothing. Those who had read the quote were significantly less approving of violence. \u201cLeaders are actually uniquely powerful in being able to tamp down violence,\u201d Mason said. \u201cRepublicans in particular are not using that power. And they could, but they\u2019re not.\u201d Although political leaders are particularly powerful when it comes to reducing violent rhetoric, Mason\u2019s research indicates that average people may have some leverage of their own. Mason\u2019s team saw some positive results when they asked participants to read messages from random Twitter users condemning political violence. For the overwhelming majority of Americans who oppose such violence, the findings could offer some hope. \u201cFor Americans in general, I think it\u2019s sort of empowering to know that every single one of us has the potential to reduce violence by simply rejecting it,\u201d Mason said. \u201cWe can all do that. All the 80% of us who don\u2019t think violence is acceptable have a real voice, and it\u2019s important to use it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-24T06:06:02Z",
            "content": "Among the most notable fans of High Noon, Fred Zinnemann\u2019s unusually circumspect and politically loaded western, are two US presidents: Ronald Reagan, who considered it his favorite film, and Bill Clinton, who reportedly hosted 17 screenings of it at the White House. It is not difficult to see how heads of state might see themselves in Gary Cooper\u2019s Will Kane, a small-town marshal in the New Mexico territory who\u2019s determined to do what\u2019s right, even if it defies popular will. And while it\u2019s funny to imagine either of these men refusing to act out of political expediency, there are certainly times when any leader feels isolated from their constituents or forced into making a hard choice between unappealing options. But Kane doing the right thing is only half the story, which makes it even more revealing that men like Reagan and Clinton embraced the film so fervently. The other, darker suggestion of High Noon is that the citizens are unworthy of such principled representation. When asked to make sacrifices and take some responsibly in their public lives, ordinary people will often retreat into craven self-interest. It\u2019s like a reversal of another president, John Kennedy\u2019s, famous line: they\u2019ll ask not what they can do for their country, but what their country can do for them. Kane ultimately risks his neck for a town that\u2019s not worth saving. Now on its 70th anniversary, High Noon stands out as the proto anti-western, questioning the conventions of a genre long before doing so was in vogue. Aside from a couple of minor scuffles, there\u2019s no violence until the climactic showdown promised by the title. It is not so much a western as a drama set in the old west, though it nonetheless bristles with tension and danger, as Kane desperately scrambles to save himself from a grim fate \u2013 one with implications far beyond his own future. \u201cWhen he dies,\u201d says one character, \u201cthis town dies, too.\u201d The action unfolds in real time, so while there\u2019s little action in High Noon, the race-against-the-clock conceit raises the stakes considerably. For Kane, it should be a blissful, carefree final day in Hadleyville. After a successful run as the town marshal, he\u2019s passing along his tin star to his successor and setting out for a new life with the young, beautiful Amy (Grace Kelly), who he marries that morning in front of a justice of the peace. Before the happy couple can depart, however, Kane gets word that Frank Miller (Ian MacDonald), an outlaw that he\u2019d sent to prison for murder, has been granted an early release and was due to arrive in Hadleyville on a noon train seeking revenge. Waiting at the station are three of Miller\u2019s roughneck allies \u2013 one played by the legendary Lee Van Cleef (\u201cThe Bad\u201d in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) \u2013 and Kane\u2019s chances of defeating them all on his own are nil. The bulk of High Noon, then, is Kane meandering around town, searching for enough men to form the 12-14 person posse necessary to stamp out the threat. His most obvious right hand is his young deputy Harvey (Lloyd Bridges), a temperamental hothead who\u2019s still bitter about Kane passing him over as his successor. All the drunks and scalawags at the saloon are either too inebriated or cowardly to volunteer, or they\u2019re holding some grudge against Kane from his tenure. The congregants at church are more sympathetic to Kane\u2019s cause, but some wonder why they\u2019re being asked to do the job of lawmen or why Kane doesn\u2019t just leave town as planned. If Miller\u2019s beef is with Kane, then his departure would save them all from danger, right? Perhaps most bitterly of all, Kane\u2019s new wife abandons him, too. After being married for less than two hours, Amy is looking to depart on the same train that Miller is due to arrive. Her rationale is more complicated than it seems, but the film\u2019s most intriguing character is Kane\u2019s ex, Helen Ramirez (Katy Jurado), who\u2019s been able to carve out a place for herself in Hadleyville\u2019s business community as a Mexican woman, which speaks to her tough, shrewd personality. Helen is set to leave town, too, but she has a stronger sense of what Kane\u2019s last stand signifies than the other citizens. The film\u2019s ending pivots off her moral resolve. The politics of High Noon are like a Rorschach test. Through one lens, it could be seen as critique of McCarthyism or a pacifist\u2019s plea for non-violence and civic duty, arguing against the use of force until absolutely necessary. Through another, it\u2019s a rock-ribbed defense of law and order, with Kane\u2019s marshal representing the thin blue line between a safe, civilized society and the bloody chaos of the old west. (Director Howard Hawks reportedly hated the film so much that he made Rio Bravo, perhaps his greatest western, as a rebuttal.) The film\u2019s liberal producer, Stanley Kramer, spent a career trying the raise social consciousness on issues like racism (Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner), evolution (Inherit the Wind), and political justice (Judgment at Nuremberg), but High Noon is too ambiguous for the soapbox. After 70 years, High Noon remains an essential American conversation piece, set at a moment in the country\u2019s development where the wild west was beginning to be tamed and towns like Hadleyville had to choose between self-interest and civic duty. Hadleyville may struggle to pass that test, but sturdy leaders like Kane have the potential to pull the masses in the right direction. In this still-young and volatile nation, it will always be high noon somewhere."

            "title": "Sri Lanka: president agrees to resign amid unrest",
            "date": "2022-07-09T17:11:45Z",
            "content": "The Sri Lankan president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has agreed to resign after a dramatic day during which his house and offices were stormed by protesters and the home of the prime minister set on fire. In a late-night message conveyed through the parliamentary speaker, Mahinda Yapa, the beleaguered president said he would step down from power on 13 July to \u201censure a peaceful transition of power\u201d. It was an historic victory for the protesters who have been calling for him to resign for months and gathered on the streets of Colombo in their tens of thousands on Saturday, as the country continues to struggle through its worst economic crisis since independence. Ealier prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, had told a meeting of party leaders that he too would resign as soon as a new all-party government was formed. In extraordinary scenes on Saturday, protesters broke through police barriers and charged into the president\u2019s official residence. Images and witness accounts showed people flooding up the grand staircase of the colonial-era building, with chants calling for the president to go. As protesters poured into the bedrooms and kitchen and rifled through the president\u2019s possessions, many took full advantage of the president\u2019s luxury amenities which had been denied to them in recent weeks due to rampant food and fuel shortages. Protesters were seen cooking up curries in the kitchen, lying down on beds and sofas, lifting weights and jogging in his private gym and jumping into the outdoor pool. The president was not at home, having fled the night before under military protection, and he remained in hiding as Saturday\u2019s events unfolded. Rajith, 50, said he had come to take part in the protests as he had two young children and \u201cthere\u2019s no food to eat\u201d. He spoke of his shock at entering the president\u2019s home and seeing that, while Sri Lankans were suffering, \u201cthey didn\u2019t lack anything. We saw their luxury rooms, their AC, their cooking gas. They even have so many pedigree pets.\u201d Dhanu was also among those who stormed into the president\u2019s residence, having cycled for more than six hours from the city of Galle to attend the protest. \u201cI came because there\u2019s something terribly wrong happening here,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw at the president\u2019s house how he enjoyed his life using taxpayers\u2019 money and now he is hiding like a coward dog. The president has fled because he\u2019s a thief.\u201d Much of the anger and blame for Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis has been directed at the president and the Rajapaksa family, who are Sri Lanka\u2019s most powerful political dynasty and held the positions of president, prime minister, finance minister and several other senior cabinet posts in the government. The Rajapaksas, who pushed a fiercely ultranationalist agenda, are accused of corruption, mismanaging the economy and pushing the nation to bankruptcy. Since March, there have been widespread protests calling for the Rajapaksas, in particular the president, to be removed from power and held accountable for the dire economic circumstances the country\u2019s 22 million people are now grappling with. Rajapaksa, a former military man who was accused of war crimes when he was defence secretary, had refused to step down for months, and was the last Rajapaksa left standing. His resignation next week will mark the end of a two-decade hold that the Rajapaksa family have had over Sri Lankan politics. On Saturday evening, the mood on Colombo\u2019s streets turned tense as protesters breached security barriers and set alight the house of Wickremesinghe, who was appointed as a caretaker prime minister after Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president\u2019s older brother and a former president, was forced to step down in May. He had also been facing calls to resign over allegations that he was propping up the Rajapaksa regime. The arson attack followed an hours-long standoff between protesters and police outside Wickremesigne\u2019s house, with police firing several rounds of teargas into the crowds. Several journalists were violently beaten by police and taken to hospital, prompting a statement from Amnesty International South Asia condemning the \u201cshocking assault\u201d, which was \u201cgravely concerning and blatantly violates press freedom\u201d. Despite fuel shortages, tens of thousands of people travelled into the centre of Colombo on Saturday morning, many commandeering trucks and buses, to attend what became the biggest protest yet against the president. As the crowds swelled and pushed against the barriers, police began firing teargas. But they failed to hold back the angry protesters, who moved towards the president\u2019s home, first breaking down police barriers, and then storming into the palatial property, many carrying Sri Lankan flags and shouting slogans. The president\u2019s office in the Galle Face neighbourhood of Colombo was also taken over by thousands of protesters, who breached the security and barricades and stormed the building, with celebrations continuing inside into the early hours of the morning. For months Galle Face has been the site of an anti-government protest camp, where people have been living in tents and refusing to move until Rajapaksa resigns. Ruki Fernando, an activist, said he had travelled almost 100 miles from the city of Kandy to be at the Colombo protest. On the way he had seen people walking along highways, clutching on to the back of cargo trucks, crushed into lorries and on bicycles, in order to get to the protest despite the lack of transport due to the fuel crisis. \u201cI have never experienced such a widespread people\u2019s uprising,\u201d said Fernando. \u201cThere was such a sense of achievement when people entered the president\u2019s house, and his secretariat. These are all places maintained in luxury by people\u2019s money at a time when the government claims that there isn\u2019t enough money to give medicine, to give food, to give fuel. It\u2019s very politically significant they have been reclaimed by the public.\u201d At least 40 people, including several officers, were injured and hospitalised in Saturday\u2019s protests. Sri Lanka is continuing to struggle through a devastating crisis in which the economy has completely collapsed and the government is unable to afford to import food, fuel and medicines. All sales of petrol have been suspended, schools have shut and medical procedures and surgeries are being delayed or cancelled over a shortage of drugs and equipment, with the UN recently warning that the country is facing a humanitarian crisis. Inflation is a record-breaking 54.6% and food prices have gone up fivefold, meaning two-thirds of the country are struggling to feed themselves. Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debts in May, which total over $51bn, and is in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a $3bn bailout."

            "date": "2022-07-12T21:49:30Z",
            "content": "Sri Lanka\u2019s embattled president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has flown out of the country, heading to the neighbouring Maldives, according to local officials. The 73-year-old leader, his wife and a bodyguard were among four passengers on board an Antonov-32 Sri Lankan military aircraft which took off from Colombo\u2019s international airport on Tuesday, immigration officials told Agence France-Presse. \u201cTheir passports were stamped and they boarded the special air force flight,\u201d an immigration official involved in the process said. There was no immediate confirmation Rajapaksa had reached the Maldives. Airport officials said the aircraft was held up for over an hour on the tarmac without being able to take off following confusion over permission to land in the Maldives. \u201cThere were some anxious moments, but in the end everything worked out OK,\u201d an airport official said. \u201cThe aircraft is due to land at the Male international airport.\u201d Rajapaksa, who is due to officially resign on Wednesday after months of demonstrations calling for him to step down, had reportedly tried to escape to Dubai on Monday night. Officials said immigration staff prevented the president from going to the VIP area of the airport to stamp his passport and he would not go through the ordinary queues for fear of being mobbed by the public. As a result, Rajapaksa reportedly missed four flights to the United Arab Emirates, and he, his wife and a dozen other family members and close aides spent the night at a nearby military base. It appears that the president has attempted to follow several avenues of escape in recent days. The Indian government reportedly refused permission for a Sri Lankan military plane carrying the president to land at an Indian civilian airport, while the US embassy refused to grant him a visitor visa, according to US embassy sources who spoke to local media. Rajapaksa, who lived in the US for years and has a son and grandchild there, gave up his dual US citizenship in order to run for president, which means he is now ineligible for a visitor visa. While he is still president, Rajapaksa enjoys immunity from arrest. It is believed he sought to go abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of being detained. He is accused of overseeing corruption and economic mismanagement that have bankrupted the country and triggered the worst financial crisis on record. He has also been accused of war crimes, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, during his time as defence minister, when he brought the civil war, fought against the Tamil minority, to a bloody end in 2009. For more than a decade the allegations against him have been prevented from reaching the courts. The president was not the only member of the family unsuccessfully trying to flee. His younger brother Basil Rajapaksa, who served as finance minister and has also been accused of widespread corruption, was prevented from boarding a flight to the US via Dubai on Tuesday morning after other passengers protested. Airport staff refused to let him use the fast-track concierge service and stopped him getting on the flight. According to airport officials, as the situation grew tense, Basil Rajapaksa, who has dual US citizenship, retreated. On Tuesday night sources told the BBC that Basil Rajapaksa has also now left the country, with reports that he was on his way to the US. AFP contributed to this report"

            "date": "2022-07-20T15:49:45Z",
            "content": "Sri Lanka\u2019s prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been elected as president to replace the ousted Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a result that is likely to provoke turmoil among protesters who have been calling for weeks for him to resign. Wickremesinghe, who has been prime minister six times but never president, won a comfortable victory in parliament on Wednesday morning, where MPs voted for the new president in an unprecedented secret ballot. The vote came after protesters forced Rajapaksa from office amid anger over a spiralling economic crisis. Wickremesinghe, who comes from an old political lineage, faces a tough road ahead as Sri Lanka continues to be crippled by the worst economic crisis since independence, with shortages of food and fuel, and also grapples with a deep crisis of trust in parliament. Wickremesinghe\u2019s election follows a dramatic week in Sri Lanka, during which Rajapaksa was toppled after his offices and presidential palace were stormed by thousands of protesters, who jumped in his pool and worked out in his gym. Amid the anger, Rajapaksa was forced to flee to Singapore via the Maldives and his resignation was formally announced last Friday. This was the first time in Sri Lanka\u2019s history that a sitting president has been toppled midterm by a mass protest movement There has been fierce resistance and protests on the streets against a Wickremesinghe presidency. Though he had offered to resign as protests engulfed the streets last week, he did not, and instead accepted the role of acting president after Rajapaksa stepped down. Many fear Wickremesinghe will protect the Rajapaksas from being held accountable, as he has been accused of doing in the past, and would not instigate the constitutional change being demanded by the protest movement, including an end to the system of executive presidency. \u201cI am disappointed but not surprised by this result because our politicians have repeatedly shown that they are more concerned about protecting the Rajapaksa cartel than doing what\u2019s right for the country,\u201d said Harini Fernando, 37, a social entrepreneur who was among those who joined a rally against Wickremesinghe on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cRanil has bent the constitution like a pretzel in order to make sure he can retain power. This proves, once again, that our politicians don\u2019t stand for real democracy.\u201d In recent days, Wickremesinghe, who declared a state of emergency this week, had made statements calling protesters \u201cfascists\u201d and indicating he would not be afraid to crack down on the demonstrations . Less than an hour after he was declared president, a court order was issued prohibiting anyone from congregating within a 50-metre radius of a statue that stands at Galle Face in Colombo, where anti-government protesters have been camped out for months. Speaking to reporters outside a Buddhist temple he was visiting on Wednesday afternoon, Wickremesinghe made it clear he would not tolerate those he perceived to be stirring up violence. \u201cIf you try to topple the government, occupy the president\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s office, that is not democracy; it is against the law,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will deal with them firmly according to the law. We will not allow a minority of protesters to suppress the aspirations of the silent majority clamouring for a change in the political system.\u201d However, people defied the order and dozens gathered on the steps of the president\u2019s offices, which are still occupied by the protest movement, to shout rallying cries of \u201cdeal Ranil\u201d \u2013 a reference to Wickremesinghe\u2019s reputation as a scheming politician \u2013 as well as \u201cRanil bank robber\u201d, referring to a bank bond scam he was implicated in. Hundreds of police and military stood on the periphery but did not interfere in the rally. Father Jeevantha Peiris, a Catholic priest who has been a protest leader, said that \u201cparliament today have taken a decision against the people\u2019s will\u201d and emphasised that peaceful protest would continue until Wickremesinghe resigned. \u201cThe people of Sri Lanka wanted a just system, a democratic system, but we know Ranil Wickremesinghe was brought in by the Rajapaksa regime to cover up their brutal system,\u201d he added. Wickremesinghe, 73, won the election with backing of the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party (SLPP), which has the most seats in parliament. He was seen as the candidate favoured by the Rajapaksa family, who despite no longer being in power have significant influence over the party they formed. Wickremesinghe beat competition from another SLPP MP, Dullas Alahapperuma, who was part of a breakaway group and who had formed a coalition with the major opposition parties. However, it appeared that in the vote most of the ruling party MPs had rallied behind Wickremesinghe and secured his victory with 134 votes out of 219, while Alahapperuma got just 82. In a speech after his victory was declared, Wickremesinghe asked opposition parties to work with him. \u201cI need not tell you the status our country is in. Now that the election is over we have to end this division. We had 48 hours to stay divided but from now on I am ready to have a dialogue with you,\u201d he said. Present in the parliamentary chamber for the vote were three members of the Rajapaksa family who remain MPs, including Gotabaya\u2019s older brother, the former president and prime minister Mahinda. It was the first public outing for the family since Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee the country. Wickremesinghe has more than four decades of experience in politics and has pitched himself as an experienced and capable pair of hands to guide Sri Lanka through its worst political and economic crisis in its history, and in particular help the country negotiate a critical bailout from the International Monetary Fund. However, his legitimacy among voters has been tainted by his close relationship to the Rajapaksa family, and many have accused him of having no political legitimacy or mandate, as he was appointed into the prime minister role by Gotabaya Rajapaksa and has little support among voters. Wickremesinghe is due to serve for the rest of Rajapaksa\u2019s term, until November 2024. However, there are concerns his election signals an unstable future for Sri Lankan politics, with protesters vowing to unseat him just as they did Rajapaksa. \u201cRanil will be chased away, he is a crook and he doesn\u2019t have a mandate,\u201d said Anura Goonaratna, 53, a toy exporter. \u201cThis protest movement is going to get worse. There has to be an end to this and the only ending we will accept is throwing Ranil out, whatever it takes.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-07-08T14:55:51Z",
            "content": "A daughter of Angola\u2019s former president Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, who died on Friday in Barcelona, has demanded the hospital retain his body for a postmortem after allegations of foul play. Dos Santos, who ruled Africa\u2019s second-biggest oil producer for nearly four decades, died aged 79 at the Teknon clinic in the Spanish city after a prolonged illness, the Angolan presidency said. The veteran politician was taken to hospital and into intensive care after suffering a cardiac arrest two weeks ago. Angola\u2019s current head of state, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, announced five days of national mourning starting on Friday, when the country\u2019s flag will fly at half-staff and public events will be cancelled. Dos Santos, who was married four times, is survived by his current wife, Ana Paula, with whom he has three children. He is known to have at least three other children and various grandchildren. The highest-profile is his oldest daughter Isabel dos Santos, long described as Africa\u2019s richest woman, who has been accused of corruption and nepotism. She has strongly denied both charges and says she is the victim of a political \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. Another daughter, Welwitschia \u201cTchize\u201d dos Santos, on Friday filed a legal case against her father\u2019s current wife and his personal physician for attempted murder, police and her lawyers said. In a statement, lawyers said her complaint included allegations relating to \u201cattempted murder, failure to exercise a duty of care, injury resulting from gross negligence and disclosure of secrets by people close to her father\u201d. The complaint accuses dos Santos\u2019s wife, Ana Paula, and his personal physician of causing the deterioration in his health. Police said they had opened an inquiry. Dos Santos was one of the last survivors of a generation of African leaders who came to power after bitter struggles for freedom from European colonial powers. His lengthy rule was marked by a brutal civil war lasting nearly three decades against the US-backed Unita rebels \u2013 which the former president won in 2002 \u2013 and a subsequent oil-fuelled boom that generated huge funds for the ruling elite but barely benefited most Angolans. Dos Santos\u2019s record as a freedom fighter was marred by accusations of nepotism, human rights abuses and economic mismanagement. \u201cThere is no human activity without errors, and I accept that I too made some,\u201d he said in a final speech as president of his party, the People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), in 2018. Dos Santos stepped down five years ago. His successor was Louren\u00e7o, a veteran of the ruling MPLA who was then the defence minister. Within months of taking power, the hand-picked political heir surprised analysts by turning on his predecessor and launching a series of investigations of multibillion-dollar corruption, some of which targeted the former leader\u2019s children. But many who lived through the decades of fighting, which left half a million dead, credit Dos Santos with bringing stability to a country that had known only war since becoming independent from Portugal in 1975. Dos Santos frequently described himself as an accidental president, taking the reins after Angola\u2019s first leader, Agostinho Neto, died during cancer surgery in 1979. With Neto having served for just four years and the 37-year-old dos Santos regarded as a relatively weak outside candidate, few could have imagined he would go on to rule for just shy of four decades. However, he proved an astute politician, skilled at exposing rivals and forcing them into line. \u201cHe humiliated people,\u201d said Alves da Rocha, a senior economist who worked for many years at the ministry of planning. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons support for him collapsed once he left office.\u201d Although dos Santos would increasingly be regarded by his critics as a dictator, it was his apparent willingness to compromise and stand byelection results in 1992 as part of a UN-negotiated peace process that would seal the popularity of his party. Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita) that fought on the other side of the civil war, refused to accept the result of that election and took the tired country back to war. When the Angolan army eventually succeeded in killing Savimbi, Unita had lost much of its support. With peace the allegations of corruption began to mount. Between 2002 and 2014, as oil production grew in tandem with booming prices, the size of Angola\u2019s economy multiplied by 10, from $12.4bn (\u00a310.3bn) to $126bn. While little of the money trickled down to the poor, those closest to dos Santos became billionaires. His eldest daughter Isabel became, according to Forbes, Africa\u2019s richest woman and youngest billionaire worth about $3bn. Forbes has since dropped Isabel from its list of billionaires because of the asset freezes. Isabel also became chairman of state oil company Sonangol, while son Jos\u00e9 Filomeno headed a $5bn sovereign wealth fund. Dos Santos, who said in a rare 2013 interview he would like to be remembered \u201cas a good patriot\u201d, never specifically responded to the allegations that he had allowed corruption to become rampant. The main opposition, Unita, disputed the MPLA\u2019s result in 2017 polls and is set to make gains in forthcoming elections in August. About 10 million electors will vote for a members of a 220-seat parliament that would automatically select the candidate of the winning party as president."
