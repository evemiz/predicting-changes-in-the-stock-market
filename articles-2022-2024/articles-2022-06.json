            "content": "Hello, and Happy Thursday, A few Fridays ago, I was sitting in a large hotel ballroom in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, when a lawyer named Cleta Mitchell took the stage. Mitchell was on Donald Trump\u2019s legal team in 2020 and played a central role in his efforts to overturn the election result. She was one of the people on the phone when Trump tried to pressure Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s top election official, to find enough votes to overturn the election in Trump\u2019s favor. She also recruited John Eastman, another lawyer, to work on the president\u2019s team and asked him to prepare a memo explaining his idea that state legislatures could override the popular vote and appoint their own electors. Both Eastman and that theory were at the heart of the effort to overturn the election result and the violence at the US capitol on January 6. In Raleigh, Mitchell eschewed the term \u201celection denier\u201d. \u201cThere were so many things wrong with that election,\u201d she said. \u201cThat the outcome was correct, that\u2019s all I deny.\u201d I had bought a $20 ticket to attend the summit. But shortly after Mitchell\u2019s remarks, a security guard tapped me on the shoulder and asked me to leave the event, saying it was closed to the press. You can read the full story we published this morning on the summits here. Mitchell wasn\u2019t in Raleigh just to talk about the 2020 election \u2013 she was focused on the next one. Working with a group tied to Trump, Mitchell has been going around the country the last several months in battleground states to work the polls and to form task forces to monitor state and local election officials. \u201cWe are trying to build a permanent election integrity infrastructure in every county in America that will be there to oversee what\u2019s happening,\u201d Mitchell said during an April appearance on Steve Bannon\u2019s War Room podcast. During the same podcast appearance Bannon asked her whether the summits were a chance to learn how to \u201ctake over and grab hold of and control the local apparatus in their local elections and then to network throughout the country, so we have an apparatus that\u2019s unbreakable?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mitchell said. Mitchell\u2019s effort is happening parallel to a significant effort from the Republican National Committee to recruit election workers. So far, the RNC has recruited 16 in-state election integrity directors, more than 15,000 poll workers, and 10,000 observers in swing states, according to Gates McGavick, an RNC spokesperson. Josh Findlay, the RNC\u2019s national director of election integrity, spoke at the North Carolina summit. The RNC said it \u201cworks with other groups who have an interest in promoting election integrity\u201d but that its poll worker focus was independent. Audience members at the Raleigh summit received a 20-page document that lays out in detail how to form local task forces to monitor election offices. The document encourages them to become a presence in the office and research whether government officials are \u201cfriend or foe.\u201d Parties and campaigns have long sought to recruit people to be their eyes and ears in precincts to monitor against wrongdoing. But an effort organized by people who sought to overturn the last election and have people with deeply seeded doubts in critical election jobs is concerning, experts told me. \u201cGiven that people who were part of the attempted coup are behind this, it\u2019s certainly something that at a minimum we need to be vigilant about,\u201d David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, told me. The 2020 election illustrated the power of having people watching ballots being cast and counted. In the aftermath of election day, workers in states like Georgia, Arizona, and Michigan came forward and signed affidavits or other statements saying they had seen irregularities at the polls. Even though those claims were all dismissed in court or debunked, they served as critical fuel for Trump and allies to spread the lie that something was amiss in the 2020 election. \u201cYou have those people who may have worked the precinct who intentionally don\u2019t understand the procedures and that can then, with some level of authority, spread misinformation,\u201d Barb Byrum, the county clerk in Ingham county, Michigan, told me. Byrum told me that at least one election official had already seen an unprecedented surge in Republicans working the polls. She said she was encouraging the clerks in her county to assign new election workers they didn\u2019t know \u2013 Democrats or Republicans \u2013 to jobs like handing out \u201cI voted\u201d stickers, where they would have limited interaction with voters at critical points in the voting process. Gary Sims, the election director in Wake county, which includes Raleigh, told me he hasn\u2019t yet seen a huge surge in election workers signing up. He said North Carolina law was clear about what was allowed in the precinct and that disruptive people would be removed. Still, he said he had learned that speakers at the summit had shared false information about how his county handles ballots with people it was encouraging to be election workers. \u201cWhat they stated was, I want to say disinformation, not misinformation. Because it was not true,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually intentionally trying to villainize us.\u201d Also worth watching\u2026 The US Supreme court will allow Louisiana to use a congressional map this year, even though a lower court found it discriminated against Black voters. Tina Peters, a local clerk who faces criminal charges for allowing unauthorized access to voter equipment, lost her bid to be Colorado\u2019s top election official. The January 6 committee has broken the mold of the typical congressional hearing to create something gripping."

            "content": "A deeply alarming attack on democracy is well under way in America. Latching on to Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election, candidates across the country are running for positions in which they would exert enormous influence over the way ballots are cast and counted. Candidates who have embraced election lies are also seeking to be governors in swing states like Arizona and Pennsylvania, where they would play a critical role in certifying elections. Several of these candidates, many of whom Trump has endorsed, refuse to acknowledge Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election and have embraced the idea of \u201cdecertifying\u201d the presidential election. Some have called for jailing their political rivals. Many of these contests are races for secretary of state, the chief election official in many places, and a little-known office. If these candidates are successful, there is concern that the pieces will be in place to overturn the results of a future election. The Guardian is tracking several of these races throughout US primaries this year. *** Arizona Kari Lake Running for: Governor Trump endorsed: Yes Role in 2020: TV news anchor Lake won the GOP gubernatorial nomination in August. She has said the election was \u201ccorrupt\u201d and that she would not have certified the 2020 vote. She has called for \u201cdecertifying\u201d the 2020 election, which is not legally possible. She has called for jailing Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who now serves as secretary of state, as well as ending all early voting, which is widely used in Arizona. Mark Finchem Running for: Secretary of state Trump endorsed: Yes Role in 2020: Arizona state representative Finchem, who is running to be Arizona\u2019s top election official, won the GOP nomination for secretary of state in August. He was among 30 Arizona lawmakers who signed a joint resolution in December 2020 calling on Congress not to give Arizona\u2019s 11 electors to Joe Biden, who won the state, and instead give them to Trump. He has been involved with the Oath Keepers, an extremist group, and was at the US Capitol on January 6, and has been subpoenaed by the congressional committee investigating the attack, which is interested in his communications with organizers of the \u201cstop the steal\u201d rally planned for that day but cancelled. He hosted Rudy Giuliani in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election as he spread misinformation about the election. He has also introduced legislation to \u201cdecertify\u201d the 2020 election. Shawnna Bollick Running for: Secretary of state \u2013 lost GOP nomination in August Trump endorsed: No Role in 2020: Arizona state representative Bollick wrote an unsuccessful bill that would have allowed the Arizona legislature to overturn the results of an election. The same bill would have ended no-excuse mail-in voting in Arizona and contained provisions that appeared based on conspiracies about the 2020 election, including a requirement that ballots be printed with a hologram or unique water mark. She also signed a resolution in December 2020 asking Congress to give Arizona\u2019s 11 electoral college votes to Trump, even though Joe Biden won the state. Georgia David Perdue Running for: Governor \u2013 lost GOP nomination in May Trump endorsed: Yes Role in 2020: US senator After losing his Senate re-election campaign in 2020, Perdue announced he was running for governor against Brian Kemp, Georgia\u2019s Republican incumbent. Trump is backing Perdue as he continues to fume at Kemp over the governor\u2019s refusal to block certification of Biden\u2019s victory in 2020. Perdue, considered a long shot to beat Kemp, has embraced election conspiracies. \u201cIn my election and the president\u2019s election, they were stolen. The evidence is compelling now,\u201d he said in March. He said he would not have certified the 2020 election. After his campaign announcement, he joined a lawsuit seeking to show that there \u201cwere serious violations of Georgia law in the Fulton absentee ballot tabulation\u201d. Jody Hice Running for: Secretary of state \u2013 lost GOP nomination in May Trump endorsed: Yes Role in 2020: US representative Hice\u2019s campaign for secretary of state, the top election official in Georgia, is one of the most important races in the US this year. Trump endorsed Hice as part of a retaliatory effort against Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump\u2019s request to \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d after the 2020 election. Hice was one of the 147 members of Congress who voted to overturn the election results. He joined an amicus brief at the supreme court supporting an effort to throw out lawful 2020 election results in Georgia, as well as in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. He has said he\u2019s not convinced \u201cfor one second, that Joe Biden won the state of Georgia\u201d. Hice has said he saw nothing wrong with Trump\u2019s request to Raffensperger to overturn the election. \u201cAbsolutely, there was nothing wrong with that request,\u201d he said in May. \u201cHe was not saying \u2018go out and find illegal ballots for me.\u2019 He was saying look at all the fraud that\u2019s out here. Do your job. Make sure we have legal ballots that are cast, legal ballots that are counted, and had Brad done so, I believe the outcome would have been different.\u201d Hice has also said there is nothing that could convince him the 2020 election result was accurate, despite several recounts and audits showing that it was. \u201cThis election was just overwhelmed with fraudulent activity. There\u2019s nothing that can change my opinion of that.\u201d Michigan Kristina Karamo Running for: Secretary of state Trump endorsed: Yes Role in 2020: No public office Michigan Republicans nominated Karamo to be the state\u2019s next top election official in April. She has never held elected office, but gained prominence in conservative circles when she alleged she saw misconduct as workers counted ballots in Detroit. Her allegations were inaccurate, but she became well known after appearing repeatedly in conservative outlets. She has endorsed the untrue idea that election equipment was flipping votes, and called the speaker of the Michigan house of representatives, who refused to overturn the election for Trump, a \u201cfraud\u201d. She also joined legal efforts to try to block certification of the 2020 election. Matthew DePerno Running for: Attorney general Trump endorsed: Yes Role in 2020: No public office DePerno earned the GOP nomination for Michigan attorney general in April. He has never held elected office, but became known for spreading misinformation about fraud in Antrim county, Michigan, where human error briefly led to incorrect results being reported on election night. A GOP-authored report harshly criticized DePerno\u2019s involvement in an effort to \u201caudit\u201d election equipment in the county, saying his claims were \u201cdemonstrably false and based on misleading information and illogical conclusions\u201d. The report also suggested the state attorney general investigate DePerno\u2019s efforts to fundraise off the Antrim county effort. He has said that if he is elected attorney general, he would \u201carrest\u201d Michigan\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, both Democrats. Nevada Jim Marchant Running for: Secretary of state Trump endorsed: no Role in 2020: US House candidate Marchant won the Republican primary for secretary of state in June. After losing his bid for the US House in 2020 by about 16,000 votes, Marchant unsuccessfully tried to have it overturned, citing baseless voter fraud claims. He has said he would support sending an alternate slate of electors in 2024. He also has ties to QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory, saying the prominent QAnon influencer Juan O Savin pushed him to run to be Nevada\u2019s chief election official. He is leading a coalition of like-minded candidates running for secretary of state offices in other places. He told the Guardian he would get rid of electronic voting machines, introduce voter ID, and get rid of mail-in voting in his state. Pennsylvania Doug Mastriano Running for: Governor \u2013 won Republican nomination Trump endorsed: No Role in 2020: Pennsylvania state senator A close Trump ally, Mastriano is one of the most prominent spreaders of misinformation about the 2020 election and tried to block certification of the results. He earned the Republican nomination for governor in May. He has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee and pushed to have an alternate slate of electors for Trump in Pennsylvania. He was present at the Capitol on January 6 and paid for buses to transport people to Washington on the day of the attack. Mastriano also pushed for a full \u201caudit\u201d of the 2020 election and has championed \u201cdecertifying\u201d the 2020 race in the state, which is not legally possible. Lou Barletta Running for: Governor \u2013 lost GOP nomination in May Trump endorsed: No Role in 2020: Former US congressman Barletta was one of the first Republicans to endorse Trump in 2016 and Trump endorsed him in a failed 2018 Senate campaign. Barletta signed on to the slate of false electors in 2020. He also called for a \u201cfull forensic audit\u201d of the 2020 election. Wisconsin Rebecca Kleefisch Running for: Governor Trump endorsed: No Role in 2020: Former Wisconsin lieutenant governor After saying Biden won the election in Wisconsin, Kleefisch has since expressed doubt. \u201cWell, I think the better question is, did he win the state of Wisconsin fairly? And I think that answer is going to wind up being no,\u201d she said in February. She has called for dissolving the bipartisan, six-person Wisconsin elections commission so that voters have \u201cone throat to choke \u2026 if their elections go wrong.\u201d Tim Ramthun Running for: Governor Trump endorsed: No Role in 2020: Wisconsin assemblyperson Ramthun is a leading proponent of decertifying the 2020 race in Wisconsin, which is not legally possible. He has pressured Robin Vos, the speaker of the state assembly, to embrace decertification, and said he wanted to \u201cpunch him in the nose\u201d. He has also backed a \u201cfull forensic physical and cyber audit\u201d in Wisconsin."

            "date": "2022-06-17T05:00:01Z",
            "content": "Lynton Crosby, the election guru and businessman, has been attending Boris Johnson\u2019s 8.30am meetings in No 10, showing he is more involved in the prime minister\u2019s decision making than previously thought. The Australian political strategist, whose advisory firm has represented tobacco as well as oil and gas interests, is known to have been helping Johnson remotely over his leadership woes but his involvement in the regular meetings shows he appears to have taken a much greater role than before. Crosby runs CT Group \u2013 a government affairs, polling and research company \u2013 as well as advising political leaders on their electoral strategy. His return to advising Johnson has coincided with a shift to the right as the prime minister tries to bolster his standing with that wing of the party and those who elected him 2019. A No 10 source confirmed that Crosby had attended some morning meetings, but insisted these were party political rather than official government ones. A government spokesperson said: \u201cLynton Crosby is not a government employee. Any assistance to the prime minister would be party political and in his capacity as leader of the Conservative party.\u201d One source with knowledge of Crosby said the election strategist, who mostly lives in Australia, had been mostly dialling into meetings. A second source said he also sometimes attended in-person, entering No 10 via a more discreet entrance in the Cabinet Office. They claimed that officials had raised concerns about his attendance. Labour\u2019s Fleur Anderson, the shadow paymaster general, said the revelations were \u201cdeeply alarming and raise questions about whether Crosby has inappropriate access to high-level government decision making\u201d. She added: \u201cGiven his business interests in sectors such as oil and gas, the potential conflicts of interest are seriously concerning, especially if they have not been declared. \u201cThis stinks of yet more Tory cronyism at the highest levels. The public deserve proper transparency and the PM must come clean on the role that Crosby plays in his government.\u201d A CT Group spokesperson said it was \u201cengaged to provide strategic advice to the Conservative party and its leader\u201d and that Crosby, as its chief executive, \u201cprovides that advice from time to time\u201d. They added that \u201cthe company complies fully with requirements under the Lobbying Act regarding the disclosure of clients\u201d. Crosby was handed a knighthood after he helped the Conservatives secure a majority in the 2015 general election, when the party was led by David Cameron. During Johnson\u2019s rocky period with Conservative MPs when the Partygate scandal first broke, he proudly told them he was enlisting Crosby\u2019s services again as a means of trying to regain the party\u2019s lead in the polls. The pair were said to already have been working together prior to February, though relations between them had cooled after the general election in late 2019. Crosby had helped with Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign, which resulted in him becoming prime minister in July 2019 after Theresa May stepped down. The cooling of relations was partly fuelled by tensions over the role of the prime minister\u2019s now-wife, Carrie Johnson but he has come back into the prime minister\u2019s sphere of influence in the last year. The Guardian can also reveal that David Canzini, Johnson\u2019s deputy chief of staff and a former employee of CT Group, last week ordered an urgent review of work conducted by polling companies across government departments. The Cabinet Office wrote to senior Whitehall leaders last week asking them to audit the work done by 10 polling firms at Canzini\u2019s request, including YouGov, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Savanta and TNS. They were given five days to respond to the urgent request, with an edict to include all work, not just on the subject of communications. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis is part of our routine and ongoing work looking at how public funds are spent to ensure maximum value for money.\u201d"

            "title": "US supreme court case could give state politicians huge power over elections",
            "date": "2022-06-30T19:05:48Z",
            "content": "The US supreme court agreed on Thursday to hear a case that could dramatically upend the fight over voting in America and give state lawmakers enormous power in setting rules for elections to federal office. The case, Moore v Harper, asks the supreme court to endorse the \u201cindependent state legislature theory\u201d \u2013 the idea that state legislatures have exclusive authority to set the rules for federal elections. Republicans have complete control of government in 23 states, and have used redistricting to lock in their advantage for the next decade in many places. The dispute involves a challenge to North Carolina\u2019s congressional map. Earlier this year, the state supreme court struck down the map passed by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature for being so gerrymandered that it violated the state\u2019s constitution. When the legislature did not come up with a constitutionally compliant new plan, the court imposed one drawn by a special master. That was illegal, lawyers representing the general assembly argued in their petition to the US supreme court. The elections clause in the US constitution says that state legislatures shall set the \u201cThe Times, Places and Manner\u201d for federal elections. The state supreme court, the lawyers said, does not have the power to set the rules for congressional elections. \u201cThe question presented here goes to the very core of this nation\u2019s democratic republic: what entity has the constitutional authority to set the rules of the road for federal elections, the means we use to 'exercise self-government\u2019,\u201d the lawyers wrote in their brief to the supreme court. The case could have profound implications for voting rights. State courts in recent years have been increasingly active in disputes around partisan gerrymandering, the practice of distorting district lines to guarantee election outcomes. Courts in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and New York have all played a key role in recent year in reining in excessive partisan gerrymandering. They have become increasingly active, in part, because the US supreme court said in 2019 that federal courts could not address partisan gerrymandering, but that state courts could use state constitutions to police it. The impact could also extend far beyond gerrymandering. State supreme courts in recent years have been called on to weigh in on a range of rules for elections, such as mail-in voting laws and identification requirements. A ruling in favor of state legislatures could also make it easier for officials to subvert an election and reject a result favoring the other party, Richard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in a blogpost. \u201cSuppose a state agency interprets state rules to allow for the counting of certain ballots, and doing so favors one candidate,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf the leaders of the legislature are from the other party, and they say that the interpretation does not follow the views of the legislature, it\u2019s impermissible and the results need to flip.\u201d Giving state lawmakers virtually uncheckable authority to set election rules would upend nearly a century of law, lawyers representing the challengers in the case wrote in a brief to the court. \u201cApplicants\u2019 unsupported theory to the contrary \u2013 that the Elections Clause bars a state court from hearing a state constitutional challenge to any law regulating federal elections, including a congressional plan \u2013 runs headlong into at least half a dozen of this Court\u2019s decisions, federal statutes, another provision of the US Constitution, and numerous North Carolina statutory and constitutional provisions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is also repugnant to the sovereignty of states, the authority of state constitutions, and the independence of state courts, and would produce absurd consequences,\u201d they added. Allison Riggs, a lawyer at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice representing some of the challengers in the case said the independent state legislature theory was \u201ca fringe, desperate and anti-democratic attack by a gerrymandered legislature\u201d. Even if the court is eager to weigh in on the doctrine, lawyers representing the challenger pointed out that the North Carolina case was a bad case on which to do so. State law explicitly lays out a process for state courts to review redistricting plans. In 2015, the court considered a similar case, ruling 5-4 that the elections clause did not preclude voters from using a voter referendum in Arizona to create an independent commission with control over redistricting. Chief Justice John Roberts was in the minority in that case and wrote a sharply worded dissent. But the composition of the court has changed significantly since then. Several of the conservative justices have already indicated they are eager to embrace the idea of limited court action. \u201cIf the language of the Elections Clause is taken seriously, there must be some limit on the authority of state courts to countermand actions taken by state legislatures when they are prescribing rules for the conduct of federal elections,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote earlier this year, joined by Neil Gorsuch, dissenting from a procedural ruling not to block North Carolina\u2019s map from going into effect. \u201cI think it is likely that the applicants would succeed in showing that the North Carolina Supreme Court exceeded those limits.\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas had previously said the court\u2019s refusal to consider the question was \u201cbaffling\u201d. Justice Brett Kavanaugh called the independent state legislature question \u201cextraordinarily important\u201d."

            "date": "2022-06-17T16:31:41Z",
            "content": "The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is facing the most serious personal challenge of his four years in power after claims he tried to cover up the theft of millions of US dollars hidden at his game farm. The scandal \u2013 labelled Farmgate by South African media \u2013 could potentially derail Ramaphosa\u2019s efforts to win a second term in power and destabilise Africa\u2019s most developed economy. Ramaphosa has not been formally charged with any crime, but a police spokesperson confirmed authorities had started investigating the allegations made against the president. The claims, made by a former head of South Africa\u2019s intelligence agency, centre on a burglary in February 2020 at an expansive commercial game farm owned by Ramaphosa in the north-eastern province of Limpopo. At least $4m in cash was taken by burglars who broke in and found the money in cushions on sofas. Arthur Fraser, who was appointed by Ramaphosa\u2019s predecessor Jacob Zuma, told police in a criminal complaint lodged earlier this month that the suspects in the robbery had been tracked down, abducted by Ramaphosa\u2019s presidential protection unit, interrogated, and then bribed to keep quiet about the existence of the cash. Ramaphosa said he wanted a full investigation to take place before answering questions about theft. The allegations could lead to prosecution for tax evasion or a variety of criminal charges that would at the very least be extremely embarrassing for the president and undermine any efforts to tackle endemic graft in South Africa. \u201cThe robbery that took place on my farm Phala Phala in 2020 is the subject of a criminal complaint, and the law must take its course. In other words, due process must be followed,\u201d Ramaphosa told lawmakers in parliament last week. \u201cWe want the police to investigate whatever crime, whoever it is against, without any fear, without any favour and on an impartial basis,\u201d Ramaphosa told a news conference later. The 69-year-old labour activist turned tycoon came to power in 2018 on an anti-corruption ticket but has been unable to push through reforms. He now faces a battle to retain the leadership of the ruling African National Congress party (ANC) later this year and then general elections in 2023. The accusations have provided an opportunity for enemies within the ANC, long split by bitter factional battles, and outside the party. If Ramaphosa is found to have broken the law or the party\u2019s ethics code, the ANC committee could ask him to step aside as the party\u2019s leader or suspend him, which could be the first step to parliament removing him as president. Supporters of the president have said the accusations are politically motivated and claim the former spy chief holds a grudge against Ramaphosa, who fired him for allowing South Africa\u2019s intelligence services to serve the interest of Zuma, who was forced out in 2018 amid allegations of systematic corruption. Ramaphosa has admitted the theft took place but has suggested a far smaller amount of money was taken, saying it was the proceeds of legitimate sales of animals raised on his farm. John Steenhuisen, the leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, said Ramaphosa \u201cneeds to stop hiding behind the false cover of a \u2018pending investigation\u2019 and explain to the nation why he failed to report this massive theft and why he used state resources to try to retrieve his dirty dollars\u201d. Ramaphosa\u2019s election to the leadership of the ANC and subsequent victory in national elections four years ago raised hopes South Africa had reached a turning point after years of soaring unemployment, crumbling infrastructure and flagging economic growth. But entrenched opposition within the ruling party, the president\u2019s own consensual approach and the Covid pandemic have all contributed to widespread disappointment in his term in office."

            "date": "2022-06-24T01:27:44Z",
            "content": "The Republicans Matt Gaetz and Mo Brooks sought a blanket pardon of members of Congress involved in Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden through lies about electoral fraud, the House January 6 committee revealed on Thursday. A witness said Andy Biggs of Arizona, Louie Gohmert of Texas and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania also contacted the White House about securing pardons. The same witness, former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, said she heard Marjorie Taylor Greene, an extremist from Georgia, wanted a pardon too. The committee displayed an email written by Brooks, of Alabama, on 11 January 2021, five days after the deadly attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters. Brooks, who delivered a fire-breathing speech at a rally before the Capitol riot, sought pre-emptive pardons for \u201cevery congressman and senator who voted to reject the electoral college vote submissions of Arizona and Pennsylvania\u201d. A total of 147 Republicans lodged such votes, even after the Capitol was stormed, an attack that endangered the life of the vice-president, Mike Pence, and to which a bipartisan Senate committee linked seven deaths. Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, potential rivals to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, were among them. For the January 6 committee, the Illinois Republican Adam Kinzinger said Brooks \u201cemailed the White House, quote, \u2018pursuant to a request from Matt Gaetz [of Florida]\u2019, requesting a pardon for Representative Gaetz, himself and unnamed others. \u201cWitnesses told the select committee that the president considered offering pardons to a wide range of individuals connected to the president,\u201d Kinzinger added. It has been widely reported that Trump allies sought January 6-related pardons before Trump left office, and that Trump considered offering pre-emptive pardons to himself and family members. He has repeatedly floated the idea of pardoning Capitol rioters should he return to power. The January 6 committee previously revealed that John Eastman, the law professor who pushed Pence to overturn election results, contacted Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, to ask if a pardon was possible. In testimony played on Thursday, Eric Herschmann, a Trump White House lawyer, said of Gaetz: \u201cThe general tone was, \u2018We may get prosecuted because we were defensive of the president\u2019s positions on these things.\u2019 \u201cThe pardon that he was discussing, requesting was as broad you could describe, from the beginning of time up until today, for any and all things. \u201cHe mentioned Nixon and I said Nixon\u2019s pardon was never nearly that broad.\u201d Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal, involving political dirty tricks and their cover-up. He was pardoned by Gerald Ford, his successor in office. In other testimony played on Thursday, Hutchinson, a former assistant to Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, said: \u201cMr Gaetz, Mr Brooks, I know both advocated for there to be a blanket pardon \u2026 pre-emptive pardons. \u201cMr Gaetz was personally pushing for a pardon \u2026 since early December. I\u2019m not sure why. He reached out to me to ask if he could have a meeting with Mr Meadows about receiving a presidential pardon.\u201d Hutchinson listed the other Republicans who requested pardons. On Twitter, Gaetz said: \u201cThe last Republican president to be sworn in without congressional Democrats objecting to electors was George HW Bush.\u201d He did not immediately comment about the pardon revelations. Kinzinger said: \u201cThe only reason I know to ask for a pardon is because you think you\u2019ve committed a crime.\u201d This article was amended on 24 June 2022 to correct an error in the standfirst indicating Ted Cruz had sought a pardon."

            "date": "2022-06-16T10:14:37Z",
            "content": "A gospel singer who wants to be Kenya\u2019s first disabled presidential candidate has brought a case in the country\u2019s courts after being barred from the electoral race. Reuben Kigame, who is blind, filed against Kenya\u2019s Electoral Commission (IEBC) last Tuesday, claiming he had been blocked from entering the 9 August election. Kigame\u2019s campaign team claims the IEBC discriminated against him and that the commission had provided no credible explanation for his disqualification. They allege that commission officials gave Kigame the runaround when he tried to submit his paperwork and kept him waiting for hours before declaring he had missed the deadline. Kigame said he had met the requirements to stand as an independent candidate, gathering 48,000 signatures and voter IDs from across the country. \u201cIt was like I was a non-entity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad that I\u2019d have to fight for inclusion like this.\u201d Kigame said the head of the commission, Wafula Chebukati, admitted to him in a meeting on Sunday that there were no systems in place to accommodate candidates with a disability. Gitobu Imanyara, a Kenyan human rights lawyer present at the meeting, said Chebukati\u2019s admission \u201cwas an outright acknowledgment of the commission\u2019s breach of its obligations as a public body, for which they should be held accountable\u201d. Imanyara said Kigame had been placed at a disadvantage and that his constitutional rights had been violated. The IEBC did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment. Kigame has received muted support from Kenyans, although a group of young people camped outside the Electoral Commission\u2019s building in a silent protest last week. They draped white cloths over their eyes as a symbol of Kigame\u2019s blindness and political vulnerability and held placards that read: \u201cNo Kigame, no elections\u201d. Kigame, a former schoolteacher, is known for many different things, said Sungu Oyoo, a writer and social activist. He is a veteran gospel singer whose music is famous in churches across the country. He is also known for his support of young talent through his music academy and work with #LindaKatiba, a citizen movement to defend the constitution. He is also considered a trailblazer in disability activism through his presidential bid. He first entered national politics in 2013, when he ran for a gubernatorial seat in Kenya\u2019s western Vihiga county and came in fourth. He says people discouraged him from going into politics, saying it was too \u201cdirty\u201d for a Christian leader. \u201cBut that\u2019s the reason I want to go into it \u2013 because it needs a clean-up,\u201d said Kigame, whose politics are influenced by Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cIn Kenya, 59 years of doing things the same way have not delivered economic stability \u2013 or dealt with the three issues we faced at independence: ignorance, poverty, and disease,\u201d he said. His campaign pledges to prioritise the basic needs and rights of Kenyans, calling out the current government\u2019s focus on infrastructural development over the welfare of citizens. Despite Kigame\u2019s accomplishments, some still struggle to see beyond his disability. His campaign team have faced such questions as: \u201cHow would he be able to inspect the presidential guard?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a poor cultural perception around people with disabilities,\u201d Kigame said. \u201cMany people only know blind people as people in need.\u201d At least 900,000 Kenyans are disabled, according to the 2019 census, yet the country has little to no infrastructural accommodation for them, leaving people socially and economically marginalised. Caroline Pereina, of Kenya\u2019s Society for the Blind, said that since Kigame began his campaign, she had seen people show more interest in what it is like to live with a disability. \u201cHis candidacy was historic for the disabled community. It felt like we were finally being seen and heard, so it was a really sad day for us when we heard that he was disqualified,\u201d she said. For her, his exclusion from the race mirrored her daily experiences. August\u2019s election is considered a two-horse race between the populist candidate and current deputy president, William Ruto, and the longtime opposition leader, Raila Odinga. Mark Bichachi, a political analyst, said: \u201cFor those of us in the city, we may understand that Kigame\u2019s candidacy was a big step in terms of Kenya coming of age. But if you\u2019re in politics, you also know that there\u2019s no possibility of a fringe candidate getting the 50%-plus votes needed to clinch the presidency. \u201cAround elections, you\u2019ll hear the common Kenyan sentiment \u2018Sitaki kutupa kura\u2019 \u2013 Swahili for \u2018I don\u2019t want to waste my vote\u2019,\u201d said Bichachi. \u201cKigame just didn\u2019t have the numbers.\u201d However, Wanja Njuguna, a Kigame supporter, said discussions about his chances were not the issue \u201cIt\u2019s not about whether or not he would win,\u201d said Njuguna. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether he met the requirements for running \u2013 which he did.\u201d With his name not on the ballot, Kigame said his sponsors were pulling out, but he has carried on, holding town-hall meetings and sharing his plans for the country as he waits for the court\u2019s judgment."

            "title": "Trump lawyer John Eastman sought presidential pardon after January 6",
            "date": "2022-06-16T21:52:33Z",
            "content": "Former Trump legal adviser John Eastman sought a presidential pardon in the days after January 6, the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack revealed on Thursday \u2013 indicating he knew he acted illegally as he sought to return Donald Trump to the White House. The disclosure, which came at the end of the panel\u2019s third hearing on Thursday, appears to show a degree of consciousness of guilt from Eastman over his role in attempting to execute the unlawful plan to have then-vice president Mike Pence overturn the 2020 election results. According to an email that Eastman sent to Trump\u2019s former attorney Rudy Giuliani, and obtained by the select committee, Eastman directly sought a pardon from the former president: \u201cI\u2019ve decided that I should be on the pardon list, if that is still in the works.\u201d The revelation about Eastman\u2019s pardon request was the most legally significant moment that came from the hearing, signalling consciousness of guilt that went beyond Eastman\u2019s earlier admissions that his proposals to reverse Trump\u2019s election defeat were all unlawful. Eastman proposed two strategies ahead of January 6: to have Pence declare a 10-day recess so supposedly \u201cdisputed\u201d states \u2013 there were none \u2013 could re-certify their election results in favour of Trump; or have Pence just reject electoral college votes for Biden. The select committee showed Eastman knew the proposals were unlawful but pressed ahead anyway, which could form the basis of a case against him that he committed multiple felonies in seeking to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiring to defraud the United States. First, according to testimony from Jacob, Eastman admitted days before January 6 that having Pence declare a recess would violate the Electoral Count Act, the statute governing the process by which Congress certifies the results of the presidential election. The former Trump legal adviser nonetheless recommended the option to Trump and Pence in meetings at the White House, according to Jacob, rationalizing it as the more \u201cpalatable\u201d route for the vice-president from a political standpoint. Second, according to emails Eastman sent to Jacob as the Capitol was being breached, Eastman established that he knew that having Pence simply reject slates of electors for Biden was also unlawful, but nevertheless urged Pence to adopt the plan. \u201cThe fact that he was looking into a pardon for himself as a lawyer suggests either consciousness of guilt or fear that he might be guilty,\u201d said Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee. Eastman does not appear to have ever received a pardon and it was not clear what Giuliani made of the request. But, two sources familiar with the matter said, Giuliani received a pardon request from another person at the Trump war room at the Willard hotel on January 6. Eastman knew his Pence strategies were unlawful. So did Pence, who took the advice of Jacob and his former chief of staff, Marc Short. But did Trump, and his top advisers? The select committee appeared to make the case on Thursday that they did. The panel revealed in questioning led by Congressman Pete Aguilar that Giuliani conceded to the former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann on the morning of January 6 that Eastman\u2019s theories were wrong and his critics were \u201cprobably right\u201d. But even though Giuliani appeared to know that Eastman\u2019s strategies were unlawful, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney took to the stage at the Save America rally at the Ellipse hours later and told the Trump supporters there that Eastman\u2019s plan was all legal. The panel then also raised the prospect that Trump should have known Eastman\u2019s plan was unlawful \u2013 once again returning to the doctrine of \u201cwilful blindness\u201d \u2013 after being told that by Pence and Jacob, who shared the same opinion as Herschmann. Like Giuliani, Trump said repeatedly at the Ellipse rally that he hoped Pence would do the \u201cright thing\u201d and declare a recess so that states could recertify the election in his favor, falsely telling the crowd Pence had the power to delay the joint session of Congress. Their remarks at the Ellipse rally \u2013 as well as Trump\u2019s tweets attacking Pence \u2013 directly contributed to the fixation on Pence as the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, the select committee argued, raising the spectre of legal exposure for Trump and Giuliani. According to an FBI informant identified as \u201cW-1\u201d, the crowd took Trump\u2019s attacks on Pence for refusing to adopt Eastman\u2019s plan literally: the far-right Proud Boys group \u201cwould have killed Mike Pence if given the chance\u201d, the informant told the justice department."

            "title": "Capitol attack pardon revelations could spell doom for Trump and allies",
            "date": "2022-06-12T08:00:43Z",
            "content": "The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack revealed at its inaugural hearing that Donald Trump\u2019s top Republican allies in Congress sought pardons after the January 6 insurrection, a major disclosure that bolstered the claim that the event amounted to a coup and is likely to cause serious scrutiny for those implicated. The news that multiple House Republicans asked the Trump White House for pardons \u2013 an apparent consciousness of guilt \u2013 was one of three revelations portending potentially perilous legal and political moments to come for Trump and his allies. At the hearing, the panel\u2019s vice-chair, Liz Cheney, named only one Republican member of Congress, congressman Scott Perry, the current chair of the ultra-conservative House freedom caucus, who sought a presidential pardon for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. The select committee did not elaborate on which other House Republicans were asking for pardons or more significantly, for which crimes they were seeking pardons, but it appeared to show at the minimum that they knew they had been involved in probably illegal conduct. The extraordinary claim also raised the prospect that the Republican members of Congress seeking clemency believed Trump\u2019s election fraud claims were baseless: for why would they need pardons if they really were only raising legitimate questions about the election. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a more explicit statement of consciousness of guilt than looking for a pardon for actions you\u2019ve just taken, assisting in a plan to overthrow the results of a presidential election,\u201d Jamie Raskin, a member of the select committee, told reporters. Willful blindness The disclosure about the pardons came during the opening hour of the hearing in which the panel made the case that Trump could not credibly believe he had won the 2020 election after some of his most senior advisers told him repeatedly that he had lost to Joe Biden. Trump, according to videos of closed-door depositions played by the select committee, was told by his data experts he lost the election, told by the then attorney general, Bill Barr, that his election fraud claims were \u201cbullshit\u201d, a conclusion Ivanka Trump said she accepted. The admissions by some of Trump\u2019s top aides are important since they could put federal prosecutors one step closer to being able to charge Trump with obstructing an official proceeding or defrauding the United States on the basis of election fraud claims he knew were false. At the heart of the case the panel appears to be trying to make is the legal doctrine of \u201cwillful blindness\u201d, as former US attorney Joyce Vance wrote for MSNBC, which says a defendant cannot say they were not aware of something if they were credibly notified of the truth. The potential case against Trump might take the form that he could not use as his defense, against charges he violated the law to stop Biden\u2019s certification on January 6, that he believed there was election fraud, when he had been credibly notified it was \u201cbullshit\u201d. Trump-Flynn-Powell meeting Also in the first hour of the hearing, the select committee cast in a new light the contentious 18 December 2020 meeting Trump had at the White House with his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and former Trump lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell. The Guardian has reported extensively on that meeting, where Powell urged Trump to sign an executive order to seize voting machines and suspend normal law, based on Trump\u2019s executive order 13848, and to appoint her special counsel to investigate election fraud. Cheney confirmed the reporting by this newspaper and others, that the group discussed \u201cdramatic steps\u201d such as seizing voting machines, but also alluded to a potential discussion about somehow obstructing Biden\u2019s election win certification. The basis for that characterization, based on how Cheney described the late-night meeting in the Oval Office that later continued in the White House residence, appears to be how Trump, just hours later, tweeted that there would be a \u201cwild\u201d protest on January 6. It was not clear whether Cheney was laying the groundwork for the select committee to tie Trump into a conspiracy of some sort, claiming this represented two people entering an agreement and taking overt steps to accomplishing it \u2013 the legal standard for conspiracy. But the \u201cwild protest\u201d phrase would shortly after be seized upon by some of the most prominent far-right political operatives. Hours after Trump\u2019s tweet, according to archived versions of its website, Stop the Steal changed its banner to advertise a \u201cwild protest\u201d before Ali Alexander, who led the movement, even applied for a permit to stage a rally on the east side of the Capitol on January 6."

            "date": "2022-06-16T18:27:49Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia and meeting with its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is \u201cthe equivalent of a presidential pardon for murder\u201d, according to Khalid Aljabri, the son of the exiled former senior Saudi intelligence officer Saad Aljabri. The US president once vowed to make Saudi Arabia \u201ca pariah\u201d after the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist whose 2018 murder was ordered, according to US intelligence. But this week the White House announced that Biden will meet the crown prince in Jeddah at the end of a four-day trip in July \u2013 a development described by Saudi human rights activists as a \u201cbetrayal\u201d. \u201cBiden [has] made it clear that there won\u2019t be any direct consequences for MBS for murdering Khashoggi. Unfortunately, [the visit] is the equivalent of a presidential pardon for murder, and MBS would perceive it as the Biden-issued license to kill more Khashoggis,\u201d Aljabri told the Guardian. Aljabri said he understood that Biden\u2019s hand may have been forced by rising oil costs and the geopolitical fallout of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but said the president\u2019s visit should not re-establish an \u201coutdated transactional relationship\u201d that sidelined concerns over human rights. \u201cI think a lot of Saudis, whether inside the kingdom or in the diaspora, are proponents of a healthy US relationship. I am, despite everything I\u2019m facing. But a healthier US relationship can only happen when there are safeguards against the reckless behavior of MBS,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand the predicament President Biden is in. It\u2019s impossible to cut ties with the kingdom, nor would I advocate for that, mainly because the kingdom existed long before MBS and I really hope it outlasts his reckless, demolishing behavior. Biden can and should fix the relationship, but not at all costs.\u201d Aljabri spoke to the Guardian after the street in front of the Saudi embassy in Washington was renamed Jamal Khashoggi Way, in memory of the murdered columnist. Aljabri\u2019s father, Saad Aljabri, was a senior aide to Mohammed bin Nayef, the former crown prince who was deposed in a 2017 palace coup. He fled to exile in Canada, where he has become an outspoken critic of the crown prince. Aljabri\u2019s younger sister and brother, Sarah and Omar, remain imprisoned in the kingdom after being arrested in March 2020 in Riyadh airport en route to the United States, where they planned to attend university. They were charged with money-laundering and conspiracy to unlawfully escape the kingdom, in what is widely seen as an as an attempt to force their father back to the country. Aljabri repeated calls for them to be released, along with his brother-in-law, Salem Almuzaini, who was also arrested in August 2020. \u201cEvery time MBS feels he has unchecked or unconditional support or endorsement by a US administration, he goes rogue. If the whole premise of the Biden visit is to protect US interests, then resolving our issue would help protect those national security equities.\u201d The cost of a rapprochement with Saudi cannot be Aljabri\u2019s siblings, who he says were taken into custody as minors and could now face a similar fate to Khashoggi. The UN working group on arbitrary detention has called for the immediate and unconditional release of Aljabri\u2019s children. It is not clear when or if that will happen. Aljabri said: \u201cAccountability for Jamal matters, and not just because of Jamal himself. Jamal died exposing the ruthless MBS repression that is still ongoing, the repression that has taken my siblings hostage, and the repression keeping other US citizens hostages in Saudi Arabia.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-01T16:08:43Z",
            "content": "The Republican party is building a grassroots \u201carmy\u201d to target and potentially overturn election results in Democratic precincts, the Politico website reported on Wednesday, citing video evidence. The alleged scheme includes installing party-trained volunteers prepared to challenge voters at Democratic-majority polling places, creating a website to put these workers in touch with local lawyers and establishing a network of district attorneys who could intervene to block vote counts. Many Republicans still believe Donald Trump\u2019s lie that he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden because of widespread voter fraud. At state level the party has passed laws that make it harder to vote while pro-Trump candidates are running for positions that would give them control over future elections. Politico obtained a series of recordings of Republican meetings between the summer of 2021 and May this year. It said one from November shows Matthew Seifried, the Republican National Committee\u2019s (RNC) election integrity director for Michigan, urging party activists in Wayne county to obtain official designations as poll workers. Seifried says: \u201cBeing a poll worker, you just have so many more rights and things you can do to stop something than [as] a poll challenger.\u201d Some of the would-be poll workers complain that fraud was committed in 2020 and that the election was \u201ccorrupt\u201d. At another training session last October, Seifried promises support for such workers: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an army. We\u2019re going to have more lawyers than we\u2019ve ever recruited, because let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to be fought, right?\u201d Politico also obtained Zoom tapings of Tim Griffin, legal counsel to the Amistad Project, a self-described election integrity group that Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani once portrayed as a \u201cpartner\u201d in the Trump campaign\u2019s legal efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Griffin is seen meeting with activists from multiple states and discussing plans for identifying friendly district attorneys who could stage interventions in local election disputes. He says during one meeting in September: \u201cRemember, guys, we\u2019re trying to build out a nationwide district attorney network. Your local district attorney, as we always say, is more powerful than your congressman. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that can seat a grand jury. They\u2019re the ones that can start an investigation, issue subpoenas, make sure that records are retained, etc.\u201d Politico added that installing party loyalists on the board of canvassers, which is responsible for certifying election results, also appears to be part of the Republican strategy. The revelations are sure to intensify concerns about fresh assaults on American democracy in 2022 and 2024. Nick Penniman, founder and chief executive of Issue One, an election watchdog group, told Politico: \u201cThis is completely unprecedented in the history of American elections \u2013 that a political party would be working at this granular level to put a network together. It looks like now the Trump forces are going directly after the legal system itself, and that should concern everyone.\u201d The RNC insisted that it is simply trying to restore balance to election oversight in heavily Democratic cities such as Detroit. Gates McGavick, an RNC spokesperson, was quoted as saying: \u201cDemocrats have had a monopoly on poll watching for 40 years, and it speaks volumes that they\u2019re terrified of an even playing field. \u201cThe RNC is focused on training volunteers to take part in the election process because polling shows that American voters want bipartisan poll-watching to ensure transparency and security at the ballot box.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-10T13:12:26Z",
            "content": "There are a few clear lessons from the recent primary elections in California. The first is that California is still a one-party state. The second is that once partisanship is removed in the eyes of voters, conservative forces have a lot of room to operate. Despite their failure at a federal level, conservative forces are on the move in California using a playbook that will be repeated across the country. In California\u2019s top statewide races, Democrats easily finished with a large majority of votes across the board, with Republicans struggling to even approach 40% of the statewide vote. As recently as a decade ago, Republicans in California could threaten Democrats when they had an advantage in the national climate. Today, there\u2019s effectively no threat of Republicans being involved in state-level governing. Republicans may pick up a few seats in California if there ends up being a giant Republican wave this fall, but they are still a defeated force at the federal and state level in all but a few pockets of California. The election did see some huge results which will have implications across the country, in particular on the municipal level. California represents the vanguard of a phenomenon of urban reaction. Progressive movements centered on racial justice, criminal justice reform, tenants\u2019 rights and more have spent the last decade building power locally in cities across the country; these movements are now running into a serious and well-financed backlash from the entrenched interests they vowed to fix. This is most apparent in the successful recall of the progressive San Francisco district attorney, Chesa Boudin, but can also be seen in the first-place primary finish of the real estate developer and recent Republican Rick Caruso in the Los Angeles mayoral race, and the first-place primary finish of Los Angeles\u2019s rogue sheriff, Alex Villanueva. This comes on the heels of Republican Ann Davison winning the Seattle city attorney election and as a number of other Republican-aligned candidates make headway in Democratic primaries and non-partisan municipal elections in a number of historically progressive cities. This election cycle is the first test case of how entrenched powers in cities react to threats. The recall of Boudin is instructive. The San Francisco power establishment had its sights on him from the day he won, and used a number of tactics to stymie and ultimately defeat him. The first prong is one we will see more and more as progressives try to enact their democratic mandates in municipal governments: a police work slowdown. Police in the United States have operated with impunity for decades, effectively isolated from democratic accountability to the communities they serve. In California in particular, police and sheriff departments have allegedly engaged in large-scale criminality, operating in many locales as gangs that terrorize the population or as occupying forces. When police see the threat of being held accountable to the public, they impose costs that protect their positions. This is an age-old tactic of conservative sections of the state when they feel threatened by elected progressive governments. After Boudin was elected, police in San Francisco stopped fully doing their jobs, a tactic used by the Baltimore police department after the death of Freddie Gray and the New York police department to punish Mayor Bill de Blasio. San Francisco now boasts a woeful clearance rate. Police efforts to sabotage Boudin went so far that the prosecutor had to rent a U-Haul to carry out a major arrest because the police refused to participate. The message to residents was clear: remove Boudin and stop efforts to exercise accountability or people won\u2019t be safe. The second prong of the attack on Boudin came directly from capital. San Francisco is increasingly run by extremely wealthy tech oligarchs who can outspend any opposition by huge margins. Actually dealing with crime involves spending more on social programs and redistributing wealth downwards, anathema to the ultra-wealthy. Progressive prosecutors threaten a shift from prosecuting petty crime to enforcing regulations on businesses and the wealthy. The oligarchs can finance massive political campaigns, but they can also threaten capital flight and capital strikes, another age-old tactic to resist progressive government and democratic oversight. In the US and California in particular, a new wealthy class has been moving from suburbs to cities and displacing the urban working-class population. In San Francisco, billionaires and the ascendant class of wealthy tech workers moved into a city with all that urban life entails \u2013 noise, homelessness, people of many economic and racial backgrounds in close proximity, etc \u2013 and have responded by trying to turn the city into the suburbs. As the housing crisis worsens and cities become more wealthy and more unequal, we will see a sort of reverse of the white flight of the 1950s and 60s and the suburban tax revolts of the late 1970s, as the new urban ruling classes seek to instate a homogeneous society in place of the bustling, messy, diverse, cultured places they inherited. The final prong of the recall effort was a massive campaign by the media, which has ramped up around the country. Boudin\u2019s tenure was marked by breathless coverage of crime and increasing media alarmism about the city becoming a war zone. Hundreds of articles have been written in San Francisco and elsewhere attributing rising crime to progressive prosecutors and criminal justice reform. This hysteria is largely evidence-free: crime has been rising nationwide at about the same rate, with no correlation whatsoever to progressive prosecutors or city governments. In fact, cities with Republican mayors and prosecutors are far more dangerous. Republican-governed Jacksonville, for example, is about the same size as San Francisco and has three times the murder rate. The media, however, has focused almost exclusively on progressive-run jurisdictions. In San Francisco, people were whipped into a frenzy, despite the fact that the city is vastly safer than it was for most of the previous 50 years. Boudin\u2019s recall is the tip of the spear of reaction, rather than just one example of backlash against progressive governance. San Francisco is a unique city that, despite its left-leaning reputation, gave unique opportunities for conservative forces to move so aggressively. For one, Boudin only won in the first place with 36% of the vote, hardly a clear mandate. Indeed, the 40% who voted to retain him demonstrates that, if anything, he gained support over his tenure. In contrast, the handy re-election victories of progressive prosecutors Larry Krasner in Philadelphia and Kim Foxx in Chicago further demonstrate Boudin\u2019s unique vulnerability. Krasner and Foxx both lost white voters, winning re-election on the back of large margins from the Latino and especially Black voters who together make up a majority of both their districts. In San Francisco, however, Black people and Latinos together make up just 20% of the population, with Black residents alone just 5% of residents. San Francisco is also vastly wealthier than most other American cities, leaving a much smaller base of people affected by policies that primarily harm poor and marginalized people. The election map shows that support for the recall was strongest in the wealthiest areas. In Philadelphia, someone seeing a homeless encampment on their way to work is likely to be a working-class person; in San Francisco, there\u2019s a decent chance this person is a millionaire or even billionaire who will make their distaste everyone\u2019s problem. There is much to learn in these results for progressives, but no clear path forward. How can institutions be made to actually respond to democratic leadership? How can the ultra-wealthy be counteracted? Can the left build an alternative media structure? There are no obvious answers, and, absent a plan, the forces of municipal conservative backlash will continue unabated. Unless activists, workers and tenants regroup, reflect and commit to organization and politics on a mass level, the results in California will be the first in a series that serve to further militarize cities, stratify them by class, and brutalize the most vulnerable. These results are a canary in the coalmine for anyone who wants thriving, diverse, equitable cities that are good places to live and work. Ben Davis works in political data in Washington DC.

            "date": "2022-06-02T17:30:07Z",
            "content": "Local issues and candidates with strong connections to their communities shaped the unusual election results across western Sydney, experts say, with major parties increasing their vote in some areas but being ejected from safe seats in others. In Fowler, the independent candidate and former councillor Dai Le won against Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally, overturning a 14% margin. Le, who was born in Vietnam and came to Australia as an 11-year-old, told Guardian Australia her community was \u201clooking for genuine and real representation\u201d during the election. \u201cThe people understood, at the end of the day, that only the locals understand us, and would fight for better services and federal resources,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately the community has not seen improvements from previous federal representatives, and this time they believe they wanted one of their own to represent them, who is connected to them, and will fight for them, just like other electorates. On the surface, Le\u2019s win looks like an outlier in the region \u2013 a single independent elected among a big swings toward the major parties. But a common theme in the results was that if a candidate engaged with local issues they likely won their seat. Prof Andy Marks, the director of the research hub the Centre for Western Sydney, said the Covid-19 lockdowns in 2021 during the Delta wave exacerbated a focus on localised issues for people in the region. \u201cThese are areas that felt abandoned by governments \u2013 state and federal. They are also home to among the largest numbers of people in low-paid and insecure work, many of them in jobs that could not readily transition to remote work.\u201d A report from the Centre for Western Sydney released just prior to the election said voters in the region would defy \u201cprediction and conventional political logic\u201d. It said there was a growing \u201celectoral volatility\u201d in the region, and Marks believes the results confirm that prediction. \u201cWestern Sydney did not behave the way the rest of the country did, with some really strong swings to Labor, in excess of the national average,\u201d Marks said. \u201cWhile the national story was of people deserting the major parties, that was not the case in western Sydney.\u201d Marks said the hyper-localisation of politics in the region was the key determining factor in the seats, with candidates who best engaged with their locality winning their seats. \u201cCandidates, regardless of party affiliation, that maintained a strong local profile were in general those who attracted the highest primary vote,\u201d Marks said. \u201cWe saw this in the formerly marginal Labor seats of Macquarie and Greenway, where Susan Templeman and Michelle Rowland focused heavily on local issues like bushfires, floods, congestion and local infrastructure. The same was true for the Liberals in Lindsay, where Melissa McIntosh also kept the focus local. \u201cThis differs from inner Sydney seats where national themes of women, sustainability and integrity dominated.\u201d Marks said the late selection of candidates by the Liberals in seats such as Parramatta \u201chobbled\u201d their campaign, building cynicism among voters. \u201cJust as Labor parachuted in candidates, it created a cynicism at the process. Candidates need time to build support and zero in on local issues.\u201d Ben Raue, an electoral analyst, agrees that the localisation of politics shaped individual races, saying the process had reforged identities. \u201cPeople feel more associated with the city or state they live in now. They are reconsidering their political allegiances.\u201d Some commentators have identified western Sydney as a potential new Liberal heartland, after the party was rejected by voters in the northern and eastern suburbs. But Raue is not convinced, saying the results did not indicate that the culture wars fostered by the Liberal party during the election, particularly the focus on transgender athletes and the comments made by the Warringah candidate Katherine Deves, changed anything. He said the Liberal campaign had staked a lot of hope on the results of the marriage equality vote, explaining that areas with high \u201cno\u201d votes were targeted by the Coalition, but with mixed results. \u201cThere is no obvious path for the Liberals. It\u2019s a hard road back,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople might have been opposed to transgender athletes, but they did not feel very strongly for it \u2013 it did not rank that highly.\u201d Adam Leto, the executive director of the Western Sydney Leadership Dialogue, said the results reflected a growing desire among people in the region to be better represented, and to have their concerns taken seriously. \u201cIn the last four months, lots of locals didn\u2019t feel like they had a voice, especially on chosen candidates. There was a lot of politics playing out. Lots felt frustrated in trying to get traction on key matters,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when candidates were out there saying they were going to act on concerns, that resonated with people, it empowered them.\u201d Leto listed cost of living, housing affordability, childcare, and access to services and amenities as key issues for locals, things many other communities \u201ctake for granted\u201d. \u201cThe priorities of western Sydney families are different to the rest of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cFamilies are looking at how they can put a house over their head, how to have steady employment.\u201d Leto said these priorities led voters overall to the major parties, bucking the national trend and demonstrating the area\u2019s political independence. But the strong negative swing Labor suffered in Fowler lost it the seat for the first time since its creation in 1984. Keneally reflected on the loss on Sunday, telling Nine\u2019s newspapers she thought it came down to the \u201cimpacts of the Covid lockdowns\u201d. \u201cThose harsh lockdowns engendered an understandable sense of parochialism that the community had been left behind by both major political parties,\u201d she said. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, later told Sky News that Labor had to learn from the result. \u201cYou have to learn lessons from an outcome like that \u2013 I think the lessons are very clear that the community sent a message,\u201d he said."

I was admitted to a major London teaching hospital on 10 June following my return from Africa with an unidentified infection. Monkeypox was ruled out and I was treated with intravenous antibiotics.

After 48 hours, with no indication of how long the delay would continue and with food being left outside my room to go cold, I discharged myself and, wearing what PPE I could find, got myself home. More than a week later, I remain in isolation at home. And despite requests for the result made to the hospital by my GP and the local patient advice and liaison service, all we are told is that \u201can increase in cases means that there are more results for the labs to process and it can take some time for the results to come back\u201d.

            "date": "2022-06-01T02:58:31Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s been almost two weeks since Australia parted ways with its nine years of conservative Coalition government. The new Coalition leadership fight for burnt scraps on a scorched landscape. Though the Nationals held their heartland, the Liberals lost more seats in 2022 than when John Howard was decimated by Kevin Rudd in 2007. Even with their own lowest primary vote since federation, preferences have flowed Labor into government with the largest parliamentary majority since Tony Abbott\u2019s in 2013. The novelty of the federal election is not the seats that Labor won in the suburbs and the regions, but those the Liberals lost across its own old urban heartlands to non-Labor candidates from the \u201cteal\u201d independents and the Greens. Even the impressive 10.94% primary swing that won the Greens the former Labor seat of Griffith tells this story. Labor\u2019s Terri Butler lost a fatal 1.98% from her primary but it was Griffith\u2019s Liberals who lost a whopping 10.04% from theirs. Former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce and former prime minister Scott Morrison are both insisting voters merely wanted to \u201cchange the curtains\u201d after nine years of a Coalition government. Flames and floods lapping at such curtains strongly suggest that what drove old Liberal votes to teals and Greens was electoral desperation for action on climate said government refused to provide. As the Liberals will \u2013 or not \u2013 recriminate, 16 crossbenchers now sit amid the 151 seats of our House of Representatives. It is unusual and significant, but it is neither \u201cunprecedented\u201d or a \u201crevolution\u201d. Friends, we have been here before \u2013 specifically, at the collapse of Stanley Bruce\u2019s centre-right Nationalist government in 1929 and then the collapse of the centre-right United Australia party government in 1941. Note the dates: both were ideological character tests failed by governing centre-right parties at the height of Australian emergency. A civics lesson with this history: our geographically based lower house electorates are represented by single members. This structurally encourages major party groupings to coalesce around broad centre-left and centre-right positions to assemble the parliamentary majority necessary to form government. The implications of this within a system of compulsory voting is that \u2013 unlike the contests of mobilised polarity that now define elections in the United States \u2013 Australian elections are all fought around the ideological centre. Preferences from the edges dribble towards each side, but winning the centre determines who gets the power of government. History shows Australia that when a governing centre-right party drifts from the priorities of their \u201cbroad church\u201d, it\u2019s not only their support that fractures, it\u2019s their party structure, too. In 1929, Bruce\u2019s bitter pursuit of unions despite the approaching Depression resulted in not only the fall of his government but the loss of his own seat; a right-leaning independent\u2019s preferences flowed against him. Bruce\u2019s Nationalists splintered and shattered, yet a centre-right that thirsted for government soon reformed their parliamentary presence into the UAP. By 1941, the UAP had achieved government, but then-PM Robert Menzies unwisely dashed to the UK rather than face encroaching military threats at home. His resignation was demanded, leadership chaos followed. Two right-leaning independents threw support behind Labor and John Curtin. Labor crushed a riven UAP in 1943. Yet Menzies learned from his Waikiki-holiday-level misjudgment. The Liberal party he led to creation in 1944 re-amalgamated those on the centre-right into a liberal-dominated movement rather than a conservative one. The \u201cold survivor\u201d knew that while conservatives would always grudgingly vote for liberals, he\u2019d seen the reverse was not guaranteed. We are seeing the return of this phenomenon now. Menzies\u2019 Liberals regathered their disaffected centrists and went on to win non-conservative voters with tealish support for unions, welfare measures, expanded public education and even the maintenance of Curtin\u2019s full-employment policy. Menzies regained government in 1949. His party retained it for 23 unbroken years. On the other side, Labor\u2019s most enduring government similarly encouraged the aspirations of the ideologically centrist small-business-curious. The Hawke-Keating partnership clocked up 13 years of government \u2013 something of which Anthony Albanese is very well aware. Can Albanese gateway a centre-right who this time voted teal or Green towards his party? Maybe. Some. Peter Dutton is unlikely to scoop up the Liberals\u2019 misplaced moderate voters and chart a winnable course for the middle. He\u2019s already in insistent pursuit of a \u201csilent\u201d conservative majority out there no demographer can find. This centre-right flight could bring about the destruction of Dutton or his party. Ideological velocity and personal ambition have ever spurred non-Labor politicians to amalgamate. Governing is beyond them otherwise \u2013 and rarely does a protest movement arise without a thirst for the power that lies elsewhere."

            "date": "2022-06-23T06:00:39Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson faces a hugely important verdict from voters on Thursday as the Conservatives defend seats in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton, with a double defeat likely to reignite speculation about a new challenge from Tory MPs. The byelections were called after the respective MPs resigned in disgrace. Imran Ahmad Khan stepped down in Wakefield having been convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage boy, while Neil Parish quit in Tiverton and Honiton after watching pornography in the Commons. The West Yorkshire seat had been safely Labour before Khan took it for the Conservatives in 2019, and Labour is the clear favourite to win on Thursday. The Devon constituency, in contrast, is seen as neck-and-neck between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, despite the seat in its various forms having been strongly Tory for more than a century. Parish won in 2019 by a majority of more than 24,000. If the Lib Dems win, it is being billed as the biggest majority ever overturned in this way, although there have been higher percentage swings. Losing Tiverton and Honiton would be likely to particularly worry Conservative MPs given not just the size of the majority but also that it would be another rural, Brexit-minded Tory stronghold to shift to the Lib Dems in less than six months. In December the Lib Dems took North Shropshire, overturning a Tory majority of nearly 23,000 after the former MP, Owen Paterson, quit over a lobbying scandal. In June last year the Lib Dems won another formerly very safe Tory seat, Chesham and Amersham, a so-called blue wall commuter-belt constituency to the north-west of London. Lib Dem campaigners have said Tiverton and Honiton is seen as winnable but they worry that a number of disaffected Conservative voters will stay at home rather than transferring their support. While Labour and the Lib Dems are fielding candidates in both seats and have made no pact, there has been an implicit understanding that each party would concentrate resources in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton respectively, so as to boost their chances of victory. This month sustained pressure on the prime minister over lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street and worries about a sense of drift in government led to a confidence vote in which 148 Tory MPs tried to oust Johnson and 211 backed him. While ministers sought to present this as a resounding endorsement, Johnson did worse than Theresa May when she faced a similar vote, with 41% of his parliamentary party wanting a new leader. Under Conservative party rules, the win gives Johnson a 12-month immunity from challenge, but these could be changed if there is sufficient appetite for it among Tory MPs. This seems unlikely in the short term, but rebel MPs would see a double byelection loss as a significant setback, which could mean a renewed effort to unseat Johnson in the autumn. Johnson has sought to reset his premiership with a focus on issues that give him the opportunity to please his core voters, including battles with lawyers over deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda, changing human rights rules, and trying to blame Labour for rail strikes."

            "content": "Voting has closed for two crucial byelections, in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton, the results of which could play a pivotal role in Boris Johnson\u2019s political future. Defeat in both of what were previously Tory-held seats could reignite a challenge to the prime minister from disgruntled Conservative MPs, particularly if the Liberal Democrats overturn a 24,000-plus majority in Tiverton and Honiton. The Devon seat, which has been Tory-held in its various incarnations for more than a century, was represented by Neil Parish from 2010. Parish resigned after admitting he had watched pornography in the Commons. Turnout for the byelection in Tiverton &amp; Honiton was 52%, the local authority said. The turnout in the 2019 general election was just under 72%. Results are expected from about 4am on Friday, with Wakefield likely to declare first, given the West Yorkshire constituency is more geographically concentrated. That vote also happened after the sitting Tory MP resigned in disgrace. Imran Ahmad Khan stepped down after being convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage boy. While Labour is widely predicted to triumph in Wakefield, a constituency it consistently held up to the 2019 election, a Tory defeat in Tiverton and Honiton would send significant jitters through the parliamentary Conservative party. If the Lib Dems win, it is believed this would be the largest numerical majority overturned in a byelection, although there have been bigger percentage swings in other seats. Turnout in the Wakefield byelection was 39.09%, Wakefield council said. There were 27,205 verified ballots cast out of a total electorate of 69,601. The turnout in the 2019 general election was 64.15%. Both the Lib Dems and Tories have described the Devon race as too close to call. However, the sheer scale of the Lib Dems\u2019 efforts on the ground \u2013 on Wednesday, party activists hand-delivered more than 40,000 leaflets \u2013 could tip the result in their favour. Johnson is in Rwanda for the Commonwealth heads of government summit, before travelling to the G7 and Nato summits in Germany and Spain, keeping him out of the country for the next week. Speaking to broadcasters in Kigali, Johnsons said: \u201cI\u2019m going to be watching the results with interest but always full of optimism and buoyancy but most seasoned political observers know that byelections in mid-term are never necessarily easy for any government.\u201d A double loss, particularly if there is a notably significant swing back to Labour in Wakefield, could push Tory backbenchers towards restarting efforts to oust Johnson in his absence. After this month\u2019s no-confidence vote, in which 41% of Tory MPs voted against him, under party rules he is safe from similar challenge for a year. However, these rules can be changed. The pressure on Johnson will be particularly intense if the Wakefield result indicates Labour under Keir Starmer is making significant inroads into such \u201cred wall\u201d seats, adding to the pressure from the resurgent Liberal Democrats. In December, the Lib Dems took another rural, Brexit-minded Tory stronghold, overturning a majority of nearly 23,000 to win the North Shropshire byelection, after the former incumbent Owen Paterson quit over a lobbying scandal. This followed a win for the Lib Dems last June in Chesham and Amersham, a commuter-belt constituency north-west of London, prompting worries among Tory MPs that dozens of similar \u201cblue wall\u201d seats could fall amid widespread dislike of Johnson among more liberal-minded Conservative voters. A sense that Johnson is no longer an electoral asset, coupled with the controversies over lockdown-breaking Downing Street parties, which prompted the initial confidence vote, could see Tory MPs turn decisively against the prime minister, although a new challenge is viewed as unlikely before autumn."

On the primary vote, independent Suzie Holt finished fourth in the Liberal National party-held seat. But Holt has surged into second spot with 42.89% of the two-candidate preferred vote due to preference flows. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d Green said. \u201cOff the top of my head, I can\u2019t think of a case where someone\u2019s come from fourth to finish in the final two.\u201d While she won\u2019t win the seat in 2022, Holt said the \u201coverwhelming\u201d result, amounting to a 13.3% swing, has given her a \u201cbeautiful platform\u201d to work with \u201cmoving forward\u201d. \u201cOur volunteers have expanded already,\u201d Holt said. \u201cWe were facing one of the hardest battles in the nation \u2026 and this positive response has shown that people want us to keep going.\u201d Groom (and its predecessor, Darling Downs), which is centred on Toowoomba, has been held safely by conservative parties since federation in 1901. In 2019, John McVeigh won 70.48% of the vote after preferences to Labor\u2019s 29.52% \u2013 placing it among the safest seats in the country. But when the moderate McVeigh stood down, the preselection of mining engineer Garth Hamilton \u2013 on the right of the LNP \u2013 and concerns about the influence of pentecostalism on the party encouraged a number of challengers to run. Holt, along with another independent, nurse and small businesswoman Kirstie Smolenski, and Labor\u2019s Gen Allpass, each ran lengthy campaigns with the conviction they could pull off an unlikely triumph in this heartland of Christian conservatism. There were also three other candidates vying for votes on the right, including former police officer, Grant Abraham, who stood down from the service over Covid vaccine mandates and ran for One Nation. Abraham finished third on first preferences with 9.56%; Allpass won 18.74%, placing Labor second; while 43.71% of the electorate put Hamilton first. Smolenski won a handy 7.14% and both the Greens and United Australia party gathered more than 5%. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning What all these figures and the subsequent preference flow to Holt amount to, Green said, was that there were a lot of voters in Groom who went to some effort \u201cto make sure they voted for somebody else before LNP\u201d. \u201cThe issue here is entirely the negative sentiment towards the LNP,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis tells you that the LNP was well on the nose in this electorate.\u201d Green said Holt\u2019s remarkable surge after preferences were distributed was only made possible by the decline in the major party vote \u2013 but it would still take \u201ca big effort\u201d to knock off the LNP in Groom. \u201cIn the end, [Holt] only got about 8% of the vote,\u201d he said. Holt said the campaign had given Groom voters a taste for a \u201cshift away from being represented by [a] major party\u201d and that she planned to continue, either at a local, state or federal level. \u201cThe campaign will keep going, one way or another,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are genuinely excited about the possibility for the future.\u201d Allpass won\u2019t yet say if she will run for Groom again. She says her community deserves \u201csomeone constant\u201d but she wonders whether 2025 will offer another chance to shake the electorate. \u201cThis was very, very different period,\u201d she says. \u201cYou had the first push of the teals, the indies and the \u2018voices of\u2019 groups and also a sitting member who was unknown, who got there in [a] preselection process that was on the nose,\u201d she says. \u201cThis election was the window for anyone other than the LNP locally.\u201d"

            "content": "Nearly half of Republican voters think the US just has to live with mass shootings, according to a poll released in the aftermath of the Texas elementary school murders and as politicians in Washington negotiate for gun reform. The CBS and YouGov poll returned familiar results, including 62% support for a nationwide ban on semi-automatic rifles, the kind of gun used in Uvalde, Texas. Nineteen young children and two adults were killed at Robb elementary school on 24 May by an 18-year-old who bought his weapon legally. But clear national support for a ban on such rifles or changes to purchasing ages and background checks is not mirrored in Congress. Most Republicans, supported financially by the powerful gun lobby, remain opposed to gun reform. In an effort fueled by horror at events in Uvalde, senators led by Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut elected after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting killed 26 in 2012, and John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, have expressed optimism that some changes may be possible. On Monday, Murphy told NBC News: \u201cSometimes when we go away for a week \u2026 sensitive negotiations like this fall apart. This week, the opposite is happening because my colleagues went home and heard the same thing I did. Parents are frightened to death. \u201cThey\u2019re frightened to death for their kids and they\u2019re frightened to death that government isn\u2019t going to be able to respond the most fundamental concern the parents have: the safety of their kids. I think senators are coming back to town today with a newfound resolve to get something done.\u201d Reporting on the Senate talks has largely focused on \u201cred flag\u201d laws designed to stop gun purchases by people deemed a potential danger to others or themselves. In the CBS/YouGov poll, support for such laws ran at 72%. Murphy was asked: \u201cIs this about incentivising states to pass their own [red flag law] or a federal one?\u201d He said: \u201cI actually don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a good idea to have a federal red flag law. I think it\u2019d be very inaccessible for local law enforcement to have to go to the federal court system. \u201cSo I support the state laws. I think they need some guidance and some funding in order to implement these laws and make sure that everybody knows how to access them.\u201d A Senate reform package could also contain efforts to close loopholes in background checks. In the CBS/YouGov poll, support for federal background checks on all gun purchases ran at 81%. Joe Biden has called for an assault weapons ban, or at least raising the minimum age for purchases. In the new poll, 77% said the minimum age for buying an assault rifle should be higher than 18: 32% said it should be 21 and 45% opted for 25. Murphy said: \u201cI think there\u2019s certainly Republican support for raising the age. I don\u2019t know whether there are 60 votes yet and right now, my entire focus is on what can get 60 votes.\u201d But the new poll\u2019s most telling evidence came when respondents were asked if mass shootings were \u201cunfortunately something we have to accept as part of a free society\u201d or \u201csomething we can prevent and stop if we really tried\u201d. Among Democrats, 85% said mass shootings could be stopped if US politicians would only try. Among independents, the figure was 73%. Overall, it was 72%. But 44% of Republicans said mass shootings should be accepted as part of a free society. Following strict messaging guidelines, Republican politicians repeatedly say mental health and security issues are to blame for mass shootings, not access to guns. Poll respondents were also asked: \u201cRegardless of how you feel about the issue, how likely do you think it is that Congress will pass any laws in the next few months that will make significant changes to gun policy?\u201d Only 7% thought it was \u201cvery likely\u201d Congress would act, while a combined 69% thought it was \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d likely. Some state governments have passed reforms. In New York City on Monday, the state governor, Kathy Hochul, signed a package of laws including licensing measures for assault rifles and a minimum purchase age of 21, expanded red flag provisions and a ban on sales of body armour. Hochul told reporters: \u201cIt just keeps happening. Shots ring out, flags come down and nothing ever changes \u2013 except here in New York.\u201d The state, however, is home to another politician whose fate starkly shows what can happen to Republicans who express openness to gun reform. On Friday, the New York congressman Chris Jacobs abandoned his bid for re-election, after stoking fury by expressing support for a federal assault weapons ban. Jacobs represents suburbs of Buffalo, the city in which 10 people were shot dead at a supermarket on 14 May in what authorities say was a racially motivated attack. Mass shootings, widely defined as shootings in which four people excluding the gunman are hurt or killed, have continued since Buffalo and Uvalde. Last week, at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a gunman killed two doctors, a receptionist and a patient. According to the non-profit Gun Violence Archive, the following weekend saw mass shootings in Philadelphia, Chattanooga, South Carolina, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, New York and Michigan. Fifteen people were killed and more than 60 wounded. The archive says there have been 246 mass shootings in the US in 2022, considerably more than one a day. On Sunday, Murphy told CNN: \u201cThe possibility of success is better than ever before. But I think the consequences of failure for our entire democracy are more significant than ever.\u201d"

            "title": "As France goes to the polls, voters are asking: who really is Emmanuel Macron? | Marion Van Renterghem",
            "date": "2022-06-12T11:00:46Z",
            "content": "In the autumn of 2018, as the gilets jaunes movement took off, Emmanuel Macron faced a crisis in France that also represented a personal political failure. A little more than a year previously, he had arrived at the Elys\u00e9e, elected on a centrist, social-liberal, pro-Europe agenda. He embodied fierce opposition to national populism, yet now seemed the president on whose watch populism in France was growing. At the time, I wrote an article for the Guardian asking if centrist and anti-populist leaders were creating breeding grounds for the populists they had sworn to defeat. Barack Obama, after all, had been followed by Donald Trump. In Italy, Matteo Renzi produced Matteo Salvini. In the UK, a post-Blairite Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government had produced Brexit. So after Macron, what? The answer came on 24 April of this year: after Macron, Macron. But which Macron? And at what cost? After five years in power and embarking on a second term, the president who pledged in 2017 to \u201cdo everything to make sure you never have reason again to vote for extremes\u201d faces the first round of legislative elections on 12 June in a political landscape more divided and extreme than ever. The country is split into four watertight blocs that are seemingly unable to talk to each other. We have a strengthened far right: Marine Le Pen received 2.7m more votes in the second round of this year\u2019s presidential election than she did in 2017. The radical left is also stronger. The hard-left Eurosceptic Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon came third in the first round of the presidential election, and has imposed himself as the strong man of the left and all its competing factions. We have an extreme abstentionist bloc, an expression of public weariness, indifference and/or violent rejection of politics, and an extreme centre, a combination of right and left that has formed around Macron. The catchphrase \u201cen m\u00eame temps\u201d (which roughly means \u201cat the same time\u201d), which Macron used repeatedly in his first election campaign to convey the promise that two seemingly conflicting ideas could coexist, has come to define Macronism. The slogan has served him well. He managed the incredible feat of becoming the youngest president in the history of the French Republic and of being elected twice on the vague promise of a large, catch-all pro-European reformist centre that is neither right nor left \u2013 a sort of Blairite third way but without the machinery or support of a major party. Macronism\u2019s En Marche manifesto was, essentially, Macron himself. Macron\u2019s movement vampirised the traditional parties \u2013 right, left and Greens. He was elected because he was the reasonable middle way for a democratically fragile country. But Macron himself helped to accelerate this polarisation of France. In seeking to airbrush away the old party dividing lines, his great centrist \u201cat the same time\u201d mission sucked in all the air on either side of the political centre ground, leaving oxygen for nothing but the radical left and far right. At the solemn official investiture of Macron II in the Elys\u00e9e\u2019s \u201csalle des f\u00eates\u201d last month, two of the vampire\u2019s victims stood in the front row among hundreds of guests. Neither Fran\u00e7ois Hollande nor Nicolas Sarkozy showed much joy at being there. Never before in the history of the French Republic had one, let alone two, former presidents attended the inauguration ceremony of the newly elected head of state. Nor had two former rivals from the right and the left previously called on voters to support them. Hollande and Sarkozy did it this year for different reasons: one to block Le Pen, the other to make sure conservative ideas were represented. Perhaps most remarkable was that the two major parties of the centre embodied by these former presidents, which dominated French political life for decades, were wiped out at national level. Macron was reelected on their corpses. But we still don\u2019t know who Macron is. Big horizontal wrinkles on his forehead and less hair give some insight into the five years of crisis that marked his first term, from the yellow vests through Covid, to Putin\u2019s war in Europe. In his 7 May inauguration speech, he vowed to reinvent himself on the strength of the decisive new mandate entrusted to him by the people. Aware of how reviled he is among certain groups of French voters, and that many even among his own supporters are fed up with his top-down Jupiter act, his inability to delegate and his propensity to operate behind closed doors, he also promised \u201ca new method\u201d. Brand new, then. But to what end? This president, brilliant enough for us to bring him back for an encore, is strangely the one we understand the least. His contradictions mean he can be an economic liberal and \u201cen m\u00eame temps\u201d a statist. At times he\u2019s a technocrat, demonstrating no obvious stake in society, the attitude that first enraged the gilets jaunes, and sometimes he is more of a socialist than any previous French head of state, indebting the country with \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to limit the effects of the Covid crisis. He is firmly against the nationalist-populist extremes of the right and left, yet aligned with them in his self-centred practice of power. Both versions of Macron are pragmatic. They adapt to circumstances, based on a few unwavering convictions: Europe, their primary political identity, is the only battleground on which they will not compromise. They encourage business, work, individual emancipation. Both have succeeded in making unemployment a thing of the past, and they have imposed their vision of a more sovereign Europe. But Macron must now choose between his different identities if he and his rebranded centre-right coalition are to win an overall majority, govern effectively and confront multiple and converging crises: the collapse of purchasing power, inflation, a colossal external deficit, growth at half-mast, fractured social cohesion, the energy transition and the war in Ukraine. M\u00e9lenchon has forged an alliance on the left to challenge Macron in parliament with a pact linking the Socialist party, the Greens and the Communist party. The New Ecologic and Social People\u2019s Union or Nupes, as M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s bloc is called, could, in the current mood, comfortably win between 160 and 200 of the national assembly\u2019s 577 seats (289 seats is the threshold Macron needs for an absolute majority). Nupes share several traits with the far right, including a rejection of \u201celites\u201d and \u201cthe system\u201d \u2013 and, in some cases, Euroscepticism tinged with a questionable leniency towards Putin. Even if Macron secures enough votes to govern effectively, we can expect his many emboldened opponents to be agitated and noisy both in parliament and on the streets. But which Macron will respond? He\u2019s been strangely absent and silent throughout this campaign. His second term looks as fragile as his reelection was spectacular. Marion Van Renterghem is a French journalist and author"

            "date": "2022-06-27T07:10:44Z",
            "content": "For more than a decade, Natalya Hassoumi\u2019s family in Ukraine have worried about her safety in the Gaza Strip; they have been unable to reach her for days at a time while airstrikes have pummelled the isolated Palestinian territory. Now, Hassoumi is experiencing something similar. She has not heard from her parents and siblings in Russian-occupied Kherson for three weeks. \u201cI think the Russians must be making people switch to using Russian networks and sim cards, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d the 41-year-old doctor said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard not knowing.\u201d Hassoumi is one of about 830 Ukrainian-born people living in Gaza, which according to community leaders is the largest population of foreigners living in the blockaded coastal zone. Having lived through three rounds of war between Israel and Hamas, the militant group in control of the Strip, the endocrinologist is acutely aware of what her family in Kherson is facing. \u201cI never thought that war could happen in Ukraine,\u201d Hassoumi said at the house in Beit Lahia she has shared with husband Iyad and the couple\u2019s three young sons since 2011. \u201cNo food, no electricity \u2026 Gaza and Ukraine have the same problems now.\u201d The Soviet Union was a major champion of the Palestinian cause, for decades offering scholarships and business visas to people from the West Bank and Gaza. After Ukraine declared its independence in 1991, many of those ties endured: the majority of Ukrainians now in Gaza are women who met Palestinian spouses studying at Ukrainian universities, and moved back with their husbands. Last May, during the 11-day war between Israeli forces and Palestinian militant groups that killed 256 people in Gaza and 14 people in Israel, about 120 Gaza families with links to Ukraine were evacuated, but less than a year later, one woman found herself travelling the other way. Pandemic travel restrictions meant that Viktoria Saidam, 21, had not been able to visit Gaza to meet her in-laws for two years \u2013 but after the Russian invasion in February, she and 24-year-old husband Ibrahim, both students in Kyiv, heard the shelling getting closer and closer. The couple decided to seek safety with Ibrahim\u2019s parents, fleeing her home city of Vinnytsia by minibus and then walking across the Romanian border. They then flew to Cairo and headed for Egypt\u2019s Rafah crossing with the southern Gaza Strip. She says she was aware of the issues in Gaza caused by the Hamas takeover and subsequent 15-year-old Israeli-Egyptian blockade. Its population of 2 million suffers with an unemployment rate of more than 50%, sporadic electricity, a polluted water supply, and the constant and unpredictable possibility of a new round of fighting. The couple hope their stay will be temporary. \u201cSince we got married, I kept preparing her for what she would see in Gaza,\u201d Ibrahim told local media. \u201cI tried to make the situation look even worse than it actually is so that when she came, she would not see it as that bad.\u201d Natalya Mabhouh, 45, has lived in Gaza since 1997. Her mother and sister are still in her home town of Kharkiv, and her eldest son, Ahmed, was also living there when Russia invaded in February. Ahmed and his Ukrainian wife have since found safety in Germany. \u201cWhen I came to Gaza the economic situation was good, there was peace, but we got used to wars and escalation since then,\u201d the hairdresser said. \u201cThis has been a huge shock. Russians and Ukrainians are like one people \u2026 I still don\u2019t understand how this could happen.\u201d In general, Palestinian society supports Russia over Ukraine in the four-month-old conflict, viewing it as a proxy superpower struggle with the US, Israel\u2019s most important ally. Neither Hamas nor the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority has taken a public position on the Russian invasion. The outbreak of war in Europe has also led to tensions within the Ukrainian and Russian-speaking communities in Gaza: in March, many local Ukrainians were upset after a group of Russians held a pro-Moscow demonstration. Friendships going back years have ended, and vicious arguments continue on social media. \u201cIt is really difficult,\u201d said Hassoumi. \u201cMy mother is Ukrainian and my father is Russian and suddenly people are not talking to me. I feel like many people don\u2019t care about the details, but it\u2019s an occupation, like the Israelis.\u201d Forced to keep up to date with the war from afar, either online or watching television news bulletins, Gaza\u2019s Ukrainian community has been left feeling fearful for the future of both their native land and adopted home. \u201cWe built a life here, so despite everything we will stay,\u201d said Ashraf al-Nimr, one of the leaders of the local Ukrainian community who holds a Ukrainian passport, married a Ukrainian, and lived in Mariupol for a decade. Fifteen of his wife Olya\u2019s family members have gone missing since Russia\u2019s brutal siege of the city began. \u201cWe can help by giving people in Ukraine instructions on how to deal with war, how to hide, raising money. Any way we can help, we will,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-06-06T11:30:33Z",
            "content": "In the midst of the second world war, Lieutenant Kurt Reuber, a pastor and physician with the German army at Stalingrad, drew a Madonna which hung pinned to a mud wall outside the dugout. In the midst of the darkness, the brutality and the cruelty of war, he portrayed a mother protecting her child from the world. Around the margin are the words: \u201cLicht, Leben, Liebe\u201d. In the depths of conflict and suffering that have occurred so often in the history of humanity (and still occur today), people have always imagined those possibilities: light, life and love. Peace is something that human beings long for \u2013 in our lives, our families, our communities, our country and our world. And yet we are living again in the shadow of war in Europe as Ukraine fights for its existence, hearing regular stories of the chaos, cruelty, suffering and destruction that characterises the effect of war on blameless people. There is no shortage of political and cultural conflict and turmoil in this country and around the world. And all of us have experienced personal conflict with close friends or loved ones, relationships that are often deeply painful and can bear lasting scars. So why do we keep making the same mistakes, repeating these cycles of conflict at every level of our society? The question of identity is core to any understanding of conflict. Identity can be inherited, it can be imposed \u2013 but most of all, when it comes to conflict, identity is about our relationships with others. When we fall into the trap of defining ourselves by who we are not, or we attempt to forcefully define the identities of others, we set ourselves up for serious ruptures in the fabric of our relationships. That doesn\u2019t mean that peace is unanimity, a shared conformist identity. No, peace is the ability to deal with discord by non-violent means. It is the transformation of violent conflict into non-violent disagreement. In Christian thought, we have the concept of just war theory, which attempts to understand how conflict might sometimes be morally justifiable. But we have no equivalent \u201cjust peace\u201d theory. We accept that peace doesn\u2019t need justification; we all know inherently that peace is good. The result is we think hard about how to fight, but not about often how to build alternatives to fighting \u2013 how to resolve the conflict and competition that are an inevitable part of being human. The effort we are rightly making to support Ukraine in defending itself against aggression needs to be matched by efforts towards negotiation, dialogue, reconciliation and peace. You cannot have one without the other. Our challenge is to put in place the infrastructures of reconciliation and the architecture of peacebuilding that enable disagreement to happen robustly, but not violently. In a culture that often expects instant results and gratification, this work does not happen overnight. There is no \u201ckiss and make up\u201d moment. More often, there is the gradual transformation \u2013 sometimes over generations \u2013 of enmity and hostility to respect and trust. I clearly remember a leader in Northern Ireland being interviewed on the radio in the early summer of 1998, a few weeks after the signing of the Good Friday agreement. He was asked whether reconciliation had been \u201cachieved\u201d, and responded that the idea that something called reconciliation could be achieved in weeks, after 30 years of the Troubles and several centuries of bitterness, was absurd. Deep wounds take a long time to become scars. Each of us carries our own pain, which makes it difficult to apologise and to forgive where we have wronged and been wronged. When we look towards reconciliation, we must also recognise \u2013 and have compassion for \u2013 our own conflicted and hurting hearts. Reconciliation is often risky and always costly \u2013 but it is less costly than the alternative. Many years ago, I was in Burundi, just after the end of the civil war, facilitating a conference of rebel and government leaders. On the third day, a man in one part of the room pointed across the room to another. He said: \u201cIn the war he led a militia that killed 30,000 people. How can I forgive him? How can I be reconciled?\u201d Just outside the window was the lake. I pointed out to it and asked: \u201cIf you go out in a boat on the lake and you fall out of the boat, what do you do?\u201d He replied: \u201cI swim.\u201d I said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t swim what happens?\u201d And he said \u201cWell, I drown.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t reconcile you will slaughter each other.\u201d Dealing with conflict means dealing with complex people and complex situations. It will involve flawed people \u2013 sometimes acting in ways that are well meaning, sometimes acting in ways that are profoundly evil. Sometimes those involved will be extremely powerful, while others will be terribly vulnerable \u2013 as we see with the war in Ukraine. Reconciliation will always be complicated and flawed because we ourselves are complicated and flawed. It will often feel overwhelming, when we look at our entrenched histories of conflict and the sheer scale of violence around the world. We might wonder how we can begin to unpick the threads of the tangled mess we have made, and knit them together into new relationships. But in all this, there is great hope. A friend of mine was a bishop who worked in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Much of his work was with survivors of the worst parts of humanity \u2013 refugees, child soldiers, victims of rape and severe violence. When I visited him I was overwhelmed by the suffering. \u201cHow do you deal with all this?\u201d I asked him. He said: \u201cWe do what God gives us the resources to do, and the rest we leave.\u201d In trying to build peace, we can only do what is possible. Often, it\u2019s far more difficult to take these small, concrete actions \u2013 to pick up the phone to an estranged child, or forgive a cruel word said to us by someone else. But that is what each of us can do to build a more peaceful world. There are three transformational habits we can all cultivate to restore broken relationships, build connections across difference and bridge divides. First, be curious. When we encounter difference, or people we don\u2019t understand, do we truly hear their story and see the value they might bring? Do we come to discussions with humility to learn from those who aren\u2019t like us? Are we open to learning from people with whom we disagree? Second, be present. Can we fully encounter other people with authenticity? Can we bring our beliefs as well as our vulnerabilities to conversations? Finally, reimagine. Peace requires a shift in our moral imagination, a transformation of our understanding of what could be possible. That\u2019s how we break out of repeating cycles of violence, the same mistakes \u2013 we have to be able to imagine a different world before it can become reality. Much of this reimagining happens collectively; it\u2019s with others that we can often envision and create something new. This is a world that cries out: \u201cHave mercy. We want peace.\u201d As a Christian, I believe the presence of God in Jesus Christ cries out to each of us: \u201cHave hope, here is peace.\u201d We are bound to make mistakes, to do bad things, to hurt others. That is the nature of being human. But there is always hope in the possibility of making whole what we have broken. It is not easy or straightforward \u2013 the repentance and forgiveness required for reconciliation means pain and sacrifice. But out of our brokenness can emerge a new world, one held together by the strength of new relationships with those we have chosen to know and love, regardless of our differences. \u2022 The Power of Reconciliation by Justin Welby is published by Bloomsbury.

            "date": "2022-06-29T17:47:51Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has announced that the US will increase its military forces across Europe with more land, sea and air deployments, as he gathered with Nato leaders for a two-day summit in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Arriving at the meeting in Madrid, the US president announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain. \u201cThe US and its allies are going to step up. We\u2019re stepping up. We\u2019re proving that Nato is more needed now than it ever has been,\u201d Biden said in a short statement he read out before the first summit meeting began. Biden\u2019s announcement is expected to be followed by further commitments by Nato members to a strengthening of forces on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank, which was being discussed by Nato leaders on Wednesday morning. The morning meeting heard an address from Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he called on Nato members to supply more advanced weaponry, particularly artillery, to help \u201cUkraine end this war by winning on the battlefield now\u201d. He also warned that Kyiv needed financial support to deal with the costs of fighting Russia. \u201cWe need about $5bn a month,\u201d Zelenskiy said, arguing that his country was fighting a country identified as Nato\u2019s most serious threat. \u201cWe are deterring Russia from destroying us and from destroying you,\u201d he said. Britain confirmed that it would increase its commitment to a Nato battlegroup in Estonia from 1,700 by about 1,000, although the extra forces will be based in the UK, earmarked to deploy to the country at short notice if needed. In total, eight frontline Nato battlegroups stretching from Estonia to Bulgaria, once designed to act as small initial defence force, are expected to be increased in size to a brigade level of 3,000 to 5,000 troops. Different Nato members will contribute to each as part of radical change in the alliance\u2019s military posture. Germany has already said it will increase its existing commitment to Lithuania to the size of a brigade. The US president also said the US fifth army corps would establish a permanent base in Poland, extra troops would be committed to the Baltic states and extra air defence systems would be stationed in Germany and Italy. It was, Biden said, a response to Russian aggression, adding: \u201cTogether with our allies, we are going make sure Nato is ready to meet threats across every domain, land, air and in the sea\u201d, which came \u201cat a moment when Putin has shattered peace in Europe and the very tenets of rules-based order\u201d. The US sent a further 20,000 troops to Europe earlier this year, taking the total based across the continent to over 100,000. Wednesday\u2019s announcements come on top of that and Biden said the US would \u201ccontinue to our adjust our posture\u201d if necessary. Nato\u2019s new defence plans mean that 300,000 troops would be placed at high readiness to deter any Russian attack. The forces will be available at a few days or weeks\u2019 notice to be sent into the frontline if necessary. Later, Biden also thanked his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for reaching a deal with Finland and Sweden to allow the Nordic countries to end decades of neutrality and join Nato, at a bilateral meeting between the leaders. US officials added that they now supported Turkey\u2019s desire to buy F-16 fighter jets and upgrade its air force. \u201cThe US Department of Defense fully supports Turkey\u2019s modernisation plans,\u201d Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs, said. The leaders attending the summit signed off on a new Nato strategic concept, the first time the alliance has revised its vision statement since 2010. It formally recognised that Russia poses \u201cthe most significant and direct threat to allies\u2019 security\u201d. The 2010 summit where the old document was agreed was attended by Russia\u2019s then president, Dmitri Medvedev, Stoltenberg recalled. \u201cWe agreed that Russia is a strategic partner for Nato and we had meetings with Russia at the Nato summit. And of course, this will not be the case now.\u201d The new document also referred to China for the first time, warning that Beijing\u2019s \u201cstated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values\u201d and that a \u201cdeepening strategic partnership\u201d with Russia, and the two countries\u2019 attempts to undercut the rules-based international order, \u201crun counter to our values and interests\u201d."

Western analysts expected a quick \u201cshock and awe\u201d invasion, and it seems there were indeed attempts by Russia to directly target the Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, probably in order to replace his government with one more pliable to Moscow\u2019s will. But if Putin expected a quick, easy war with little Ukrainian or international opposition \u2013 like his invasion of Crimea in 2014 \u2013 he has been disappointed.

            "content": "Germany needs to \u201cnormalise\u201d its relationship with the military and learn to take a leadership role in Europe after \u201calmost 80 years of restraint\u201d, the co-leader of the governing Social Democratic party (SPD) has said. In a speech marking a further point in Berlin\u2019s slow pivot from a broadly pacifist foreign policy agenda since Russia\u2019s 24 February invasion of Ukraine, Lars Klingbeil said it was important to recognise military force as a legitimate political measure for a government striving for peace. \u201cIt is the last measure, but it has to be clear that it is a measure,\u201d the centre-left politician told a security congress in Berlin on Tuesday. \u201cWe are currently seeing that in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cMy wish is that we as a society develop a new normality in our dealings with the Bundeswehr.\u201d Germany\u2019s pacifist foreign policy instincts, coupled with a history of expanding economic ties with Russia, have come under intense scrutiny in recent months, both domestically and among the country\u2019s Nato allies. Germany phased out compulsory military service in 2011 and the country\u2019s defence expenditure per GDP, though rising over the last four years, remains below the EU average and below Nato\u2019s 2% spending target. The SPD and its Green party junior coalition partners campaigned for unilateral nuclear disarmament as recently as last year\u2019s federal election. Chancellor Olaf Scholz surprised many of his own allies when he announced a U-turn on defence spending and Germany\u2019s restrictive stance on exporting lethal weapons on 27 February, but he has faced criticism for failing to follow up words with actions. Ukraine said on Tuesday that it had \u201cfinally\u201d deployed an advanced German artillery system in the latest delivery of the long-range weapons it has been calling for. \u201cPanzerhaubitze 2000 are finally part of 155mm howitzer arsenal of the Ukrainian artillery,\u201d defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov wrote on social media, thanking his German counterpart Christine Lambrecht. In his speech on Tuesday, Social Democrat co-leader Klingbeil said Germany\u2019s newly boosted defence budget would not only mean its army would eventually grow to become the largest in Europe, but that the country needed to learn to become a \u201cleading power\u201d \u2013 a term long considered a taboo among German politicians for fear of evoking ghosts of an aggressive past that would alienate its neighbours. \u201cGermany needs to hold itself to the standard of a leading power,\u201d Klingbeil said. \u201cAfter almost 80 years of restraint, Germany has a new role in the international system. Over the last decades, Germany has earned itself a great amount of trust. With this trust come expectations. [\u2026] We should meet these expectations.\u201d Since the start of the Ukraine war, some SPD politicians have come across as more hurt by the criticism of its Ostpolitik towards Russia than willing to reflect on their mistakes. Talking to international press ahead of Tuesday\u2019s security summit, the former president of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, merely said his party had been \u201cbadly advised\u201d in its expanding reliance on Russian energy. Klingbeil\u2019s speech signalled more willingness to rake over the past, conceding that German politicians had too often dismissed the security fears of Russia\u2019s neighbours. \u201cIf we hear from the Baltic states or Poland that they are scared of becoming Russia\u2019s next targets, we have to take them seriously,\u201d he said. For too long, Klingbeil said, Germany had \u201cmade itself too comfortable in the world\u201d. \u201cWe should have seen the signals from Russia differently. At least with an annexation of Crimea that was contrary to international law.\u201d The 44-year-old politician, once a protege of the disgraced ex-chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, said one lesson of Germany having allowed itself to become too reliant on Russian gas was that \u201cEurope has to expand its strategic autonomy\u201d. \u201cWith view to China, for example, that means reducing dependencies in medicine or technology,\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do any trade with China whatsoever, as some are calling for \u2013 but it means we should create a strategically wise and resilient set-up.\u201d"

            "content": "Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert was \u201cstill digesting yesterday\u2019s bombshell\u201d that was the second of the House select committee\u2019s public hearings on the events of 6 January 2021. The hearing on Monday included evidence that Donald Trump scammed his followers out of $250m with his \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\u201d to fight fictional voter fraud in the aftermath of the 2020 election. \u201cSurprise, surprise, the committee discovered the whole thing was a grift,\u201d the Late Show host said. \u201cSo he duped $250m from his most passionate supporters, then watched as they all go to prison while he sat at Mar-a-Lago double-fisting coconut shrimp. \u201cAnd these aren\u2019t wealthy people! You can always tell, because they\u2019re wearing nothing but giveaway merch from the losing team,\u201d he said over a photo of Capitol rioters decked in Maga gear. According to the committee, $1m of the \u201celection defense fund\u201d was donated to the personal foundation of Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cYes, the Meadows foundation is a charity that raises money to fund research into how much money it can raise,\u201d Colbert joked. Another $200,000 went to the former president\u2019s hotels, \u201cand that was just Giuliani\u2019s bar tab\u201d, Colbert quipped. And the former Fox News anchor turned Don Jr paramour Kimberly Guilfoyle was paid $60,000 for her two-minute speech at Trump\u2019s January 6 rally. \u201cBut it was worth every dime,\u201d Colbert deadpanned. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget her immortal words: \u2018Yaaahhghaahheetahaaaghhh!!\u2019\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers noted a speech by Joe Biden in which he lamented that ExxonMobil \u201cmade more money than God last year\u201d \u2013 \u201cworse, they made it by selling a natural resource,\u201d said Meyers, \u201cso that\u2019s technically God\u2019s money.\u201d Meyers then turned to the committee hearings, starting with Representative Liz Cheney\u2019s assessment that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was \u201capparently inebriated\u201d when advising the former president on election night. \u201cTo be fair, his legal advice doesn\u2019t get any better when he\u2019s sober,\u201d Meyers said. Meyers also noted Kimberly Guilfoyle\u2019s $60,000 payment for a two-minute speech. \u201cWell, technically $20,000 to speak and then $40,000 to please stop,\u201d he joked. And the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, appeared on an episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All-Stars \u2013 \u201ceither that or she didn\u2019t, and that person should win\u201d, said Meyers. Jimmy Fallon A recent poll found that the biggest drop in support for Biden was among young voters, \u201calthough to Biden, I\u2019m pretty sure a young voter is just a voter\u201d, Jimmy Fallon joked on the Tonight Show. \u201cThen Biden said \u2018OK, so this means I\u2019m doing OK with older voters?\u2019 and his staff was like, \u2018oh goodness, no.\u2019\u201d The White House is considering a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax. \u201cTake your time, gang,\u201d Fallon deadpanned. \u201cYou can tell the president is on the older side when he\u2019s like \u2018why don\u2019t we give everyone a quarter?\u2019\u201d And the stock market is in its biggest freefall since the start of the pandemic. \u201cRight now the ticker on CNBC is just showing the lyrics to Everybody Hurts,\u201d Fallon said. Finally, there was a new Guinness world record set for largest chicken nugget, which involved 40 pounds of ground chicken, 20 slices of white bread and 40 eggs. \u201cAt that point, they\u2019re really taking liberty with the word nugget,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cThey made a chicken cake.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-18T07:00:12Z",
            "content": "At 8.38pm on 4 November 2020, the day after America had gone to the polls to elect its next president, Donald Trump sent out a message to hundreds of thousands of his supporters from the email address contact@victory.donaldtrump.com. By then it was already clear that not only was victory eluding Trump, but that he was heading towards defeat. A couple of hours earlier, Associated Press had called Michigan and Wisconsin for Joe Biden, putting the Democratic candidate just six electoral college votes away from the White House. Not that you would have known it from Trump\u2019s email. \u201cFriend,\u201d it began. \u201cThe Democrats are trying to STEAL the Election. I\u2019ve activated the Official Election Defense Fund and I need EVERY PATRIOT, including YOU, to step up and make sure we have enough resources to PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTION.\u201d Over the next nine weeks Trump bombarded his loyal followers with a blitzkrieg of emails, sometimes 25 in a single day. Some of the emails were specific, like the one sent on 8 November calling for help in Michigan where Trump said \u201cwe have filed a lawsuit to halt counting\u201d (the email didn\u2019t say that a judge had already thrown out the complaint as baseless). Some of the emails were general, pleading with Trump supporters to \u201cdefend our democracy\u201d and prevent the \u201cRadical Left\u201d from \u201cDESTROYING America\u201d. They were sent under several different names \u2013 from Trump himself, his sons Don Jr and Eric, the former speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, the current chair of the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel, and then vice-president Mike Pence. Despite the nuances, all the millions of emails sent out from the @victory.donaldtrump.com address essentially said the same thing. They exhorted Trump supporters to back the \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\u201d with their hard-earned dollars. \u201cIf EVERY Patriot chips in $5, President Trump will have what it takes to DEFEND the Election and WIN!\u201d said the email that was transmitted on 10 November \u2013 three days after Biden\u2019s victory had been sealed. There was only one problem with this epic flurry of emails: the Official Election Defense Fund did not exist. As the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol revealed in a public hearing this week, Trump and his allies raised $250m from the emails by persuading loyal followers to donate to a chimera. There was no fund dedicated to fighting election battles as part of Trump\u2019s mendacious and ultimately vain \u201cbig lie\u201d that the presidency had been stolen from him. Instead, the money went into Trump\u2019s new fundraising entity Save America Pac, from where millions of dollars were distributed to pro-Trump organizations including his own hotel properties and the company that produced the Ellipse rally in Washington on January 6 just hours before the storming of the Capitol. As Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic member of the January 6 committee, put it: \u201cThe big lie was also a big rip off.\u201d David Becker, executive director of the non-partisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, said that the nonexistent \u201celection defense fund\u201d added a new layer to the January 6 investigation. On top of insurrection, sedition and an attempted coup, the American people were now learning about grift. \u201cWe now know that Donald Trump was told repeatedly by his own family, cabinet and staff that his claims about a stolen election had no merit, and yet he continued to use those claims to raise money,\u201d Becker said. \u201cHe was selling false claims to his supporters. The money they gave was not even being used for what he said it would be used: fighting the election in court.\u201d Lofgren\u2019s unveiling of \u201cthe big rip-off\u201d is not the first time Trump has been accused of playing rough and loose when it comes to cash. In his book Uncovering Trump, the former Washington Post journalist David Fahrenthold lays bare the sleight of hand the real estate developer practiced in his charitable dealings dating back to the 1980s. During his first presidential run in 2016, Trump said he had given away \u201ctens of millions\u201d in charitable donations over his lifetime. Yet when Fahrenthold went looking for evidence of such benevolence, all he could find were records of $6m having been transferred to Trump\u2019s charitable arm, the Trump Foundation, since 1987. It was also unclear where most of that $6m had gone. The only hard evidence of philanthropic giving amounted to a few thousand dollars. One such gift, for $20,000, turned out to have been used by Trump to buy a portrait of himself to give to his wife Melania. Fahrenthold\u2019s reporting at the Post uncovered other irregularities. Trump used more than a quarter of a million dollars from his charitable foundation to cover legal fees incurred in lawsuits relating to his profitable businesses. The largest gift from the foundation, of $264,631, was used to repair a fountain on the grounds of the New York Plaza hotel, which Trump owned at the time. If Trump\u2019s claims about his philanthropic largesse raised questions, so too did his use of taxpayers\u2019 money during his time in the White House. While in the presidency, he billed government departments for millions of dollars for use of his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and other hotel properties. Trump has also come to the rescue of those who have been accused of defrauding unsuspecting conservative Americans by making false promises to them. Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, was pardoned by Trump on the last day of his presidency. Bannon had been charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly defrauding donors after he and his co-conspirators had raised more than $25m ostensibly to build a stretch of wall along the Mexican border. All the cash raised by We Build the Wall was supposed to go towards construction, but prosecutors alleged $1m was spent on personal uses and expenses. Now Trump is facing his own accusations of defrauding his people. The allegation that he cheated his supporters out of millions of dollars by dangling in front of them a fictitious election defense fund could expose the former president to legal peril. It remains unclear what impact, if any, the revelations will have on Trump\u2019s loyal army of devotees. \u201cThe January 6 committee is doing what it can to introduce these people back to reality, by showing them that Trump\u2019s claims were completely false,\u201d Becker said. But he added: \u201cIf you\u2019ve been living in a fog of lies for a long time, I imagine it\u2019s really hard to have people tell you that the sky is not polka-dotted, it\u2019s blue. And that\u2019s what we are dealing with.\u201d The final money-begging email from the contact@victory.donaldtrump.com address was sent at 1.23pm on January 6. That was 20 minutes after Pence had gaveled in the Senate at the start of the process to certify Biden as president, and 26 minutes before a riot was officially declared at the Capitol. After that, the \u201cOfficial Election Defense Fund\u201d vanished from Trump begging requests. But the blitzkrieg of emails has continued unabated. This week alone, Trump supporters were assailed with a slew of fundraising appeals, each one more exotic than the last. There was the invitation to sign Trump\u2019s 76th birthday card \u2013 but only if you donated first. Then there was the email that offered those of \u201cMy LOYAL, AMERICA FIRST Patriots\u201d who donated at least $75 \u201ca signed photo with their very own personalized message from yours truly\u201d. (In fact, the offer was of a photocopy of the former president grinning at the camera with a facsimile of his signature printed on it in gold ink.) Other emails promised donors a \u201cTrump gold card\u201d, or a seat on the \u201cTrump advisory board\u201d. The gold card is purely figurative, and what the board does \u2013 or whether it even exists \u2013 is a moot point. But the greatest prize of all was reserved for only the staunchest of Trump supporters. They could apply to be crowned a \u201cGreat MAGA King\u201d or, as a separate email sent out on Friday outlined, they could join the very first roster of \u201cOfficial 2022 ULTRA MAGA MEMBERS\u201d. All at a price, of course."

            "content": "Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. It is currently 3am in the capital Kyiv. We will be pausing our live reporting overnight and returning in the morning. In the meantime, you can read our comprehensive summary of the days\u2019 events in our summary below. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he expects Russia will intensify attacks on Ukraine and possibly other European countries after the EU Commission proposed it as a candidate for EU membership. \u201cObviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities,\u201d he said in a nightly video address. \u201cAnd not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready. We warn partners.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s forces remain on the defensive in the eastern Donbas region, where fighting continues in Sievierodonestsk. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russia was massing forces in an attempt to take full control of the city after weeks of fighting but maintained that \u201call Russian claims that they control the town are a lie\u201d. \u201cThey control the main part of the town, but not the whole town,\u201d he told Ukrainian television. European Union foreign ministers will discuss ways to free millions of tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. It is hoped a deal can be struck to resume Ukraine\u2019s sea exports in return for facilitating Russian food and fertiliser exports but remains unclear if the EU would get involved in militarily securing such a deal. \u201cWhether there will be a need in the future for escorting these commercial ships, that\u2019s a question mark and I don\u2019t think we are there yet,\u201d an EU official said. The war in Ukraine could last for years and will require long-term military support, according to Nato and other western leaders. \u201cWe must prepare for the fact that it could take years,\u201d Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in an interview with the German newspaper Bild on Sunday. British prime minister, Boris Johnson, added: \u201cI am afraid that we need to steel ourselves for a long war.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s parliament voted through two laws on Sunday which will place severe restrictions on Russian books and music. Proposed laws will forbid the printing of books by Russian citizens, banning the commercial import of books printed in Russia and prohibiting the playing of music by post-1991 Russian citizens on media and on public transport in the latest attempt to break cultural ties between the two countries. The New York Times identified over 2,000 munitions used by Russian forces in Ukraine, \u201ca vast majority of which were unguided.\u201d According to the newspaper, over 210 weapons that were identified were types that have been widely banned under a variety of international treaties. Austria\u2019s government announced that it will reopen a mothballed coal power station because of power shortages arising from reduced deliveries of gas from Russia. The authorities would work with the Verbund group, the country\u2019s main electricity supplier, to get the station in the southern city of Mellach back in action, the chancellery said on Sunday. Morocco\u2019s national human rights body has urged Russian authorities to guarantee a \u201cfair trial\u201d for a young national appealing a death sentence imposed by a pro-Russian court in Ukraine. Amina Bouayach, president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), has contacted the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation and urged the Russian body to take \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure Brahim Saadoun receives a fair trial during his appeal.\u201d Successful Ukrainian counterattacks in the Zaporizhia area are forcing Russian forces to rush reinforcements to this weakened sector of the front line, the institute for the study of war has said in its latest update. Russian forces focused on maintaining their occupied frontiers north of the city of Kharkiv and fired at Ukrainian positions in the Kharkiv region on Sunday, the report added. According to the policy research organisation, Russian forces are also likely seek to levy their attempts to interdict the T1302 Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway to support offensive operations in Lysychansk. Ukraine\u2019s parliament has voted through two laws which will place severe restrictions on Russian books and music in an attempt to break cultural ties between the two countries. One law will forbid the printing of books by Russian citizens, unless they renounce their Russian passport and take Ukrainian citizenship. The ban will only apply to those who held Russian citizenship after the 1991 collapse of Soviet rule, Reuters reports. It will also ban the commercial import of books printed in Russia, Belarus, and occupied Ukrainian territory, while also requiring special permission for the import of books in Russian from any other country. Another law will prohibit the playing of music by post-1991 Russian citizens on media and on public transport, while also increasing quotas on Ukrainian-language speech and music content in TV and radio broadcasts. The laws need to be signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to take effect, and there is no indication that he opposes either. Both received broad support from across the chamber, including from lawmakers who had traditionally been viewed as pro-Kremlin by most of Ukraine\u2019s media and civil society. Ukraine\u2019s Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said he was \u201cglad to welcome\u201d the new restrictions. The laws are designed to help Ukrainian authors share quality content with the widest possible audience, which after the Russian invasion do not accept any Russian creative product on a physical level,\u201d the Ukrainian cabinet\u2019s website quoted him as saying. The new rules are the latest chapter in Ukraine\u2019s long path to shedding the legacy of hundreds of years of rule by Moscow. Ukraine says this process, previously referred to as \u201cdecommunisation\u201d but now more often called \u201cderussification,\u201d is necessary to undo centuries of policies aimed at crushing Ukrainian identity. European Union foreign ministers will discuss ways to free millions of tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine due to Russia\u2019s Black Sea port blockade at a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. Ukraine is one of the top wheat suppliers globally, but its grain shipments have stalled and more than 20m tonnes have been trapped in silos since Russia\u2019s invaded the country and blocked its ports. The EU supports efforts by the United Nations to broker a deal to resume Ukraine\u2019s sea exports in return for facilitating Russian food and fertiliser exports, but that would need Moscow\u2019s green light. Turkey has good relations with both Kyiv and Moscow, and has said it is ready to take up a role within an \u201cobservation mechanism\u201d based in Istanbul if there is a deal. It is unclear if the EU would get involved in militarily securing such a deal. Whether there will be a need in the future for escorting these commercial ships, that\u2019s a question mark and I don\u2019t think we are there yet,\u201d an EU official said. Meanwhile, talks among EU member states on a new package of sanctions against Russia are continuing, according to the EU official who signalled that fresh measures are not imminent. The existing sanctions are already extensive and there is not much scope for agreement to impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s gas exports to the EU, the official said. Ukraine has just thanked Australia for sending four armoured vehicles to the war-torn country. Ukraine will not forget this. Another batch of Australian armoured vehicles are on their way to Ukraine. These are four of the 14 M113 armoured personnel carriers promised by the Australian government. A half-world-long aviation aid bridge unites our people in these difficult times for Ukraine.\u201d It\u2019s 1am in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where things stand: Austria\u2019s government announced Sunday that it would reopen a mothballed coal power station because of power shortages arising from reduced deliveries of gas from Russia. The authorities would work with the Verbund group, the country\u2019s main electricity supplier, to get the station in the southern city of Mellach back in action, said the chancellery. Russia has deported over 300,000 Ukrainian children since its invasion of Ukraine in February, the Kyiv Independent reports. In total, 1.9 million Ukrainians have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to the report. Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced on Sunday that he expects Russia to intensify attacks on Ukraine after the EU Commission proposed it as a candidate for EU membership. \u201cObviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities, as an example,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. The New York Times has identified over 2,000 munitions used by Russian forces in Ukraine, \u201ca vast majority of which were unguided.\u201d According to the outlet, over 210 weapons that were identified were types that have been widely banned under a variety of international treaties. Russia is preparing for an offensive towards the city of Sloviansk in Donetsk, the Kyiv Independent reports. Additionally, according to the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces, Ukrainian troops are repelling a Russian offensive near Berestove, a town approximately 70km from Sloviansk. Ukraine\u2019s parliament adopted new laws on Sunday, including a ban on publications imported from Russia and Belarus. Other news laws adopted included prohibition of public performance of music \u201cof the Russian region\u201d and the exemption of military personnel \u201cinvolved in hostilities\u201d from the country\u2019s special war tax. Morocco\u2019s national human rights body has urged Russian authorities to guarantee a \u201cfair trial\u201d for a young national appealing a death sentence imposed by a pro-Russian court in Ukraine. Amina Bouayach, president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), has contacted the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation and urged the Russian body to take \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure Brahim Saadoun receives a fair trial during his appeal.\u201d \u2022 This post was amended on 20 June 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that 1.9 million Ukrainians have been deported to Russia since the invasion, not from Russia as an earlier version said. That\u2019s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand over the blog to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock, who will bring you the latest updates on Ukraine. Thank you. Austria\u2019s government announced Sunday that it would reopen a mothballed coal power station because of power shortages arising from reduced deliveries of gas from Russia. Agence France-Presse reports: The authorities would work with the Verbund group, the country\u2019s main electricity supplier, to get the station in the southern city of Mellach back in action, said the chancellery. The statement followed a crisis meeting of the government. The aim is to be able to once again produce electricity from coal, should that be required in an emergency. But the process would likely take several months, the environment ministry told Austria\u2019s APA news agency. Mellach power station, which was the country\u2019s last coal-fuelled power station, closed in the spring of 2020 as the government phased out polluting energy in a bid to move to 100 percent renewables. \u201cOur first objective is to secure the country\u2019s supply,\u201d said Austria\u2019s conservative chancellor, Karl Nehammer, who governs with the Greens. But 80% of the country\u2019s gas supplies come from Russia, he explained. This is about replacing the missing Russian gas with other sources or suppliers so as to be able to continue to build up reserve. Moscow has lost several European gas clients after it demanded that all \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries pay for Russian natural gas in rubles in response to a barrage of western sanctions over Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine. Gazprom has said exports to countries that did not belong to the former Soviet Union were down 28.9% between January 1 and June 15 compared with the same period last year. Russia has deported over 300,000 Ukrainian children since its invasion of Ukraine in February, the Kyiv Independent reports. Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced on Sunday that he expects Russia to intensify attacks on Ukraine after the EU Commission proposed it as a candidate for EU membership. Obviously, this week we should expect from Russia an intensification of its hostile activities, as an example,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. \u201cAnd not only against Ukraine, but also against other European countries. We are preparing. We are ready.\u201d The New York Times has identified over 2,000 munitions used by Russian forces in Ukraine, \u201ca vast majority of which were unguided\u201d. According to the outlet, over 210 weapons that were identified were types that have been widely banned under a variety of international treaties. \u201cAll but a handful were cluster munitions, including their submunitions, which can pose a grave risk to civilians for decades after war has ended,\u201d the New York Times said, adding: \u201cMore than 330 other weapons appeared to have been used on or near civilian structures.\u201d Russia is preparing for an offensive towards the city of Sloviansk in Donetsk, the Kyiv Independent reports. Additionally, according to the general staff of the Ukraine armed forces, Ukrainian troops are repelling a Russian offensive near Berestove, a town approximately 70km from Sloviansk. Ukraine\u2019s parliament adopted new laws on Sunday, including a ban on publications imported from Russia and Belarus. Other news laws adopted included prohibition of public performance of music \u201cof the Russian region\u201d and the exemption of military personnel \u201cinvolved in hostilities\u201d from the country\u2019s special war tax. Morocco\u2019s national human rights body has urged Russian authorities to guarantee a \u201cfair trial\u201d for a young national appealing a death sentence imposed by a pro-Russian court in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse reports: Brahim Saadoun, a Moroccan citizen born in 2000, was sentenced to death on June 9 along with two British men by a court in Donetsk, a self-proclaimed statelet in eastern Ukraine. The trio have been accused of acting as mercenaries for Ukraine following Russia\u2019s invasion of its neighbour. Amina Bouayach, president of the National Council of Human Rights (CNDH), has contacted the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation, a source from the Moroccan rights council told AFP on Sunday. She has urged the Russian body to take \u201cthe necessary steps to ensure Brahim Saadoun receives a fair trial during his appeal,\u201d the source said. Taher Saadoun, father of the accused, has said his son, who obtained Ukrainian citizenship in 2020, \u201cis not a mercenary\u201d, calling him instead a \u201cvictim of manipulation\u201d. But Dmytro Khrabstov, 20, a friend of Saadoun, has said the Moroccan joined the Ukrainian military last year, telling friends he wanted to \u201cdie as a hero\u201d. The Moroccan government had not responded until last Monday, saying through its embassy in Ukraine that Saadoun \u201cwas captured while wearing the uniform of the army of the state of Ukraine, as a member of the Ukrainian marine unit\u201d. It said he was \u201ccurrently imprisoned by an entity that is recognised by neither the United Nations nor Morocco\u201d, without commenting further. Morocco has taken a position of neutrality at the United Nations on the war in Ukraine. The move reflects Rabat\u2019s desire to avoid alienating Russia, a member of the UN Security Council, on the question of the disputed Western Sahara, a key Moroccan diplomatic priority. Morocco controls 80 percent of the disputed former Spanish colony and insists the territory must remain under its sovereignty, while the Algeria-backed Polisario Front movement seeks independence. UK ministers will change visa rules and now allow unaccompanied Ukrainian minors to enter the UK, The Times reports. The new rule change will allow hundreds of stranded children and teenage refugees to enter the UK. The change comes to an existing rule that currently prohibits individuals under 18 years old who are without a parent or guardian from entering the UK. Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based thinktank, wrote in a note that \u201cRussian forces will likely be able to seize the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk in the coming weeks, but at the cost of concentrating most of their available forces in this small area\u201d. Gaining full control of the Luhansk region \u2013 one of the two provinces making up the Donbas \u2013 is now a top target for Russian forces, as part of a larger focus on trying to take complete control of the Donbas. In Sievierodonetsk\u2019s twin city of Lysychansk, residential buildings and private houses had been destroyed, Gaidai said. \u201cPeople are dying on the streets and in bomb shelters,\u201d he said, adding that 19 people had been evacuated on Sunday. The mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second largest city, Ihor Terekhov, said he would cancel a planned trip to Madrid to discuss the city\u2019s reconstruction with Norman Foster and other architects due to the uncertainty caused by increased bombardment, Reuters reports. In southern Ukraine, western weaponry had helped Ukrainian forces advance 10km (6 miles) towards Russian-occupied Melitopol, its mayor said in a video posted on Telegram from outside the city. Ukraine has hailed the release of a celebrated medic whose footage was smuggled out of the besieged city of Mariupol in a tampon by a team of journalists in mid-March. \u201cI always believed that everything would be exactly this, and everyone who is now on the other side, they know everything will work out,\u201d Yuliia Paievska said in a video address on Saturday in which she thanked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for her release. My colleague Pjotr Sauer has more. The Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank president, Loretta Mester, has said it will take two years for inflation to come down to the central bank\u2019s 2% target. \u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be immediate that we see 2% inflation. It will take a couple of years but it will be moving down,\u201d Mester said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday. Voices from across the political spectrum bemoaning high inflation and debating its causes in recent weeks have underlined that many fear sanctions against Russia, as well as other support measures for Ukraine, are among the developments that are primarily to blame for the economic turmoil, which suggests that the support from the public the Ukrainian resistance campaign has enjoyed so far across the west could fizzle out. On social media, many have taken to blaming Joe Biden personally for the high levels of inflation over the past few days, citing unprecedented pandemic stimulus measures he introduced as main causes for the current crisis alongside western sanctions. President Biden appeared to respond to these critics on Friday, tweeting that the global energy crisis was fuelled by Russia and describing this as the driver of inflation worldwide. Here is an interesting thread from NPR\u2019s Tim Mak on the phenomenon of \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d: Italian foreign minister Luigi Di Maio on Sunday accused his own Five Star Movement party of undermining government efforts to support Ukraine and Rome\u2019s international reputation. Reuters reports: His outburst could signal an imminent schism in the group he once led, with Five Star officials due to meet later on Sunday to consider Di Maio\u2019s position following other recent broadsides. The internal party feuding also creates problems for prime minister Mario Draghi as he faces an important vote in parliament on Tuesday over Ukraine, with some Five Star members looking to limit Italy from sending further weapons to Kyiv. Italy, like many EU countries, has been dispatching arms to Ukraine to help it battle the Russian assault. In a statement, Di Maio said the government had to defend the values of democracy and freedom, adding that while everyone wanted peace, Russian president Vladimir Putin was pursuing war. Against this backdrop, he said Five Star leaders were attacking him with \u201chatred\u201d and causing trouble for the government with its European partners. \u201c[This is] an immature attitude that tends to create tensions and instability within the government,\u201d he added. There was no immediate comment from Five Star leader, former prime minister Giuseppe Conte. Earlier on Sunday, one of Conte\u2019s loyalists, Riccardo Ricciardi, said Di Maio had turned on his political family and should face the consequences. Five Star is the largest political force in parliament after winning 33% of the vote in 2018 national elections. Its fortunes have however suffered since then as it lost its anti-establishment identity once in government. Latest opinion polls put it on around 13% and it won barely 3% of the vote in local elections last weekend. Di Maio blamed the rout on Conte, while the latter said Five Star was paying a price for being in Draghi\u2019s broad coalition. Party officials said he was lashing out because the Five Star leadership had said it would enforce an old rule that its members cannot stand for re-election after two consecutive terms in parliament - a measure that would stop Di Maio from being a candidate next time around. If Di Maio leaves the party, a band of supporters might follow him and create a breakaway party inside parliament, bringing fresh turbulence to Draghi\u2019s administration. I\u2019m Jedidajah Otte and taking back over now for the next few hours. AFP has this map showing the latest positions of military forces: A couple in Kharkiv oblast prepare food for people who have been living in a shelter near the frontline for three months as Russian attacks on Ukraine continue: Italian company Eni has joined Qatar Energy\u2019s $28.75bn (\u00a323.5bn) project to expand production \u2013 just days after Russia reduced gas supplies to Italy. Eni will have a stake of just over 3% in the North Field East project, Qatar Energy\u2019s CEO said at the signing ceremony in Doha, Reuters reports. Russia supplies 40% of the European Union\u2019s natural gas, but the EU has pledged to cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. Qatar Energy estimates that the North Field East project contains about 10% of the world\u2019s known gas reserves. The UK military must be prepared to \u201cfight in Europe once again\u201d, the new head of the British army has said. Boris Johnson has ruled out sending British troops in aid of Ukraine, but warned this weekend that the country would have to show support for \u201cthe long haul\u201d. Patrick Sanders, who took command of the British army this month, is quoted in the i newspaper to have told troops: We are the generation that must prepare the army to fight in Europe once again. There is now a burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies and defeating Russia in battle. I am the first Chief of the General Staff since 1941 to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a continental power.\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose \u2013 to protect the UK by being ready to fight and win wars on land.\u201d Hello, I\u2019m Clea Skopeliti and I\u2019m covering the blog for the next hour while Jedidajah has a break. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme has warned on Sunday that food rations for refugees in east and west Africa have had to be reduced due to a surge in demand and insufficient funding. Three-quarters of refugees in east Africa supported by the United Nations\u2019 programme have seen their rations reduced by up to 50%, WFP said, with those in Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda the worst affected. \u201cWe are being forced to make the heartbreaking decision to cut food rations for refugees who rely on us for their survival,\u201d said WFP executive director David Beasley. Available resources could not keep up with the soaring demand for food around the globe, he said. In west Africa - specifically Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger - WFP had \u201csignificantly\u201d reduced rations. It warned of imminent disruptions in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Republic of Congo, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. On Tuesday, the WFP appealed for $426m to stave off famine in South Sudan, where years of conflict and floods have forced millions of people from their homes. It said more than two-thirds of the population required humanitarian assistance, with 8.3 million people, including refugees, expected to face \u201csevere acute hunger\u201d this year. The war in Ukraine has significantly worsened the global refugee crisis and the risk of famine, as it created six million additional refugees fleeing conflict zones, and has driven up commodity prices, especially the cost of grain. On Saturday, the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accused Russia of choosing to \u201cweaponise\u201d grain exports by blocking grain from Ukraine destined for poor countries, AFP reports. Germany will adopt emergency measures to ensure its energy needs are met after the drop in supply of Russian gas, including increased use of coal, the government said Sunday. \u201cTo reduce gas consumption, less gas must be used to generate electricity. Coal-fired power plants will have to be used more instead,\u201d the economy ministry said in a statement. Robert Habeck, the minister for economic affairs and climate action, said bringing back coal-fired power plants was \u201cpainful, but it is a sheer necessity\u201d. In addition, an auction model for the sale of gas to manufacturers is to be launched in the summer, intended to encourage industrial gas consumers to save gas - which is then to be stored, the dpa reports. Coal-fired power plants that are currently only operating to a limited extent, will soon be shut down or are in reserve are to be used to supply energy. The move follows a warning by Russian energy giant Gazprom last week that it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe. The decision by Berlin marks a turnaround by the ruling coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and the liberal FDP, which has vowed to wind down its coal usage by 2030. So far, Germany has managed to reduce the share of its natural gas supplied by Russia from 55 percent before the invasion to 35 percent - thanks to increased deliveries from countries like Norway and the Netherlands, and through liquefied natural gas contracts (LNG). Russia said on Sunday its offensive against Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine was proceeding successfully after it took control of a district in the outskirts of the city. \u201cThe offensive in the Sievierodonetsk direction is developing successfully,\u201d Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a video statement. He said the settlement of Metyolkine, on the eastern outskirts of the city, had been taken. \u201cThe armed forces of the Russian Federation continue to strike military targets on the territory of Ukraine,\u201d he said. Konashenkov said long-range Kalibr cruise missiles struck a command centre in the Dnipropetrovsk region, killing Ukrainian generals and officers, including from the general staff. Kyiv has been attacked from the air again, with the sound of air raid alarms and explosions ringing through the Ukrainian capital. \u201cExplosions were heard in Vyshhorod district this morning. Air defence fired at enemy targets,\u201d the military governor of the Kyiv region, Oleksiy Kuleba, said on his Telegram channel on Sunday. He said the shelling had not caused damage or injuries in the city, but asked Kyiv residents to continue taking refuge in shelters. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said it had hit a tank repair plant in Kharkiv with its Iskander missiles, and destroyed ten howitzers as well as up to 20 military vehicles in the Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv that had been supplied by Western countries over the past 10 days, Reuters reports. This from Francis Scarr from BBC Monitoring: The Japanese low-cost airline Zipair Tokyo Inc had said it will ditch its logo featuring the letter Z, a pro-war symbol often seen on Russian military vehicles, to avoid misunderstanding. The president of the subsidiary of Japan Airlines Co. told a press conference at Narita airport near Tokyo that some people might see the current logo as indicating the company approves of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the Mainichi newspaper reported. \u201cI think some people might feel that way when they see it without any explanation,\u201d Shingo Nishida said. The new logo will be a geometric pattern in green, black and white, the company said. The head of Nato has warned that the war in Ukraine could go on \u201cfor years\u201d as president Volodymyr Zelensky vowed Sunday that his forces would not give up the south of the country to Russia after his first visit to the frontline there. While Ukraine remained defiant, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warned Western countries must be ready to offer long-term support to Kyiv. \u201cWe must be prepared for this to last for years,\u201d Stoltenberg told German daily newspaper Bild. \u201cWe must not weaken in our support of Ukraine, even if the costs are high - not only in terms of military support but also because of rising energy and food prices.\u201d Stoltenberg added that he believes a supply of modern weapons would increase Kyiv\u2019s chances to weaken the Russian grip on the Donbas region. \u201cAlthough the fight in the Donbas is being waged ever more brutally by Russia, Ukrainian soldiers are putting up a brave resistance. With more modern weapons, the likelihood increases that Ukraine will be able to drive Putin\u2019s troops out of the Donbas again as well,\u201d he said. His comments echo remarks by British prime minister Boris Johnson, who has urged other Western leaders to provide sustained support for Kyiv or risk \u201cthe greatest victory for aggression\u201d since the second world war. \u201cTime is now the vital factor,\u201d Johnson wrote in an article for the Sunday Times after returning from his second visit to Kyiv, calling for the West to ensure Ukraine has the \u201cstrategic endurance to survive and eventually prevail\u201d. Tensions between Russia and the west are aggravating talks about the future of one of the United Nations\u2019 biggest and most perilous peacekeeping operations aimed at helping Mali resist a decade-long Islamic extremist insurgency. The UN\u2019s mission, known as Minusma, in the West African nation, where extremist attacks are intensifying, is up for renewal this month, while France and the European Union are ending their own military operations in Mali. Three UN peacekeepers have been killed this month, and Mali\u2019s economy is choking on sanctions imposed by neighbouring countries after its military rulers postponed a promised election. UN Security Council members widely agree the peacekeeping mission, which began in 2013, needs to continue, but a council debate this week was laced with friction over France\u2019s future role in Mali and the presence of Russian military contractors, the Associated Press reports. \u201cThe situation has become very complex for negotiations,\u201d said Rama Yade, senior director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based thinktank. \u201cThe international context has a role, and Mali is part of the Russian game on the international stage,\u201d she said. Minusma now counts roughly 12,000 troops, plus about 2,000 police and other officers. More than 270 peacekeepers have died since the mission began. France is leading negotiations on extending the mission\u2019s mandate and is proposing to continue providing French aerial support, which Mali strongly objects to. Mali asked France, its former colonial ruler, for military help in 2013. The French military was credited with helping to push insurgents out of Timbuktu and other northern centres, but they regrouped elsewhere and began attacking the Malian army and its allies. Patience with the French military presence is waning amid a rising number of extremist attacks, and ties between Mali and Russia have tightened in recent years, in part due to both countries\u2019 animosity towards the West. There have been a series of anti-French demonstrations in the capital, which some observers suggest have been promoted by the government and a Russian mercenary company, the Wagner Group. The Kremlin denies any connection to the company, but Western analysts say it\u2019s a tool of Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s campaign to gain influence in Africa. The Wagner Group has committed serious human rights and international humanitarian law violations, according to allegations by the EU and human rights organisations. In Mali, Human Rights Watch has accused Russian fighters and Mali\u2019s army of killing hundreds of mostly civilian men in the town of Moura, while Mali said those killed were \u201cterrorists.\u201d The UN peacekeeping force and the Malian government is investigating. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said in a TV interview in May that the Wagner Group was in Mali \u201con a commercial basis,\u201d and Russian deputy UN ambassador Anna Evstigneeva told the security council that African countries have every right to engage soldiers-for-hire. Ukrainian troops have \u201csuccessfully repulsed\u201d Russian attacks on villages near the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, where bloody battles have been raging for weeks, Kyiv\u2019s armed forces said Sunday. The UN warned this week that remaining civilians in Sievierodonetsk, in the eastern region of Donbas, are running out of clean water, food and sanitation. \u201cOur units repulsed the assault in the area of Toshkivka,\u201d the Ukrainian army said on Facebook. \u201cThe enemy has retreated and is regrouping.\u201d It said an attack from Russian forces who were \u201cstorming\u201d towards the village of Orikhove had been warded off. Sievierodonetsk is mostly, but not entirely, under Russian control, according Ukrainian officials, AFP reports. \u201cAll declarations by Russians that they control Sievierodonetsk are lies. Indeed, they control the majority of the city but they do not control it entirely,\u201d local governor Serhiy Haidai said on Telegram Sunday. He said Russian forces are \u201cconstantly replenishing their army with reserves\u201d. \u201cThey are now using so-called crawling tactics, they are trying to push through step by step, metre by metre,\u201d he added. Authorities continue evacuations from Lysychansk, across a river from Sievierodonetsk and heavily hit by shelling, he said, but evacuations from Sievierodonetsk have not been possible for days, after a last bridge connecting it to Lysychansk was blown up. Ukrainian authorities say hundreds of people are hiding from shelling in the Azot chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk, which Haidai said was \u201chit twice\u201d in 24 hours. I\u2019m Jedidajah Otte and now taking over the blog for the next few hours. Hundreds gathered on Saturday to mourn campaigner Roman Ratushnyi, after the political and environmental activist was killed fighting near Ukraine\u2019s second-biggest city, Kharkiv. \u201cAll our brightest, bravest guys are dying. The war\u2019s toll on society is immense,\u201d said activist Ivana Sanina, 23, on Thursday during an earlier remembrance ceremony for Ratushnyi. Pjotr Sauer reports from Kyiv: The Kyiv Independent has this graphic showing the Ukrainian military\u2019s estimates of Russian losses. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintzadze has singled out Germany for not having provided enough military aid to her country\u2019s military. While Klympush-Tsintzadze, who is chair of the parliamentary committee on integration of Ukraine to the EU, welcomed EU leaders backing candidate status for Ukraine, she called on the bloc to provide \u201cmajor humanitarian aid\u201d and weaponry. \u201cThat decision ... should not dismiss the other needs of our country,\u201d she said, calling for weaponry. \u201cUnfortunately, we are not getting enough from those particular states.\u201d She pointed to Germany in particular, saying it has \u201cbeen giving smaller weaponry\u201d. \u201cWe understand that that was already a big change in their policy. But so far heavy weaponry does not come really from that country. And I think it\u2019s a big mistake of Germany, trying to kind of postpone those decisions.\u201d Klympush-Tsintzadze added that Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s visit to Kyiv will convince him to provide more aid, now that he and other leaders \u201chave actually seen the ruins and destruction that Russians have have brought on our land near Kyiv with their own eyes\u201d. \u201cMaybe that could change their personal readiness to take the decisions on additional weaponry for us to protect \u2013 because we are protecting ourselves.\u201d Ukraine is losing territories and struggling to regain them since Russia began concentrating its military attacks on the country\u2019s east, Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintzadze has said. Klympush-Tsintzadze told Sky News that she hopes the military situation in eastern Ukraine will change soon. \u201cUnfortunately, at this particular moment, Russia has gathered all this military capacity in the in the east of the country. \u201cWe are losing some of the territories and and they are staying in this particular moment in the hands of occupiers. We hope there will be a moment and the possibility for us to to get those territories and people back.\u201d The MP thanked allies for providing Ukraine with military aid but said the country requires further assistance. In some areas, Ukraine\u2019s military capability is outnumbered 1-10 by Russia, she said. Allies must provide Ukraine with major humanitarian aid and weaponry, a Ukrainian MP has said. Appearing on Sky News, Ivanna Klympush-Tsintzadze said the situation for Ukrainians is not improving. \u201cThe situation is not getting easier on us and that\u2019s why it\u2019s extremely important that there\u2019s a continuous stream of military aid,\u201d she said. Klympush-Tsintzadze said that the country has no option but to win the war if it is to survive as a state. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many options on the table \u2013 we have to survive,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this war, the aggressor has come to erase us from the map of the world, and we we want to live, build our country and preserve our nation. So therefore we have to win.\u201d Reuters has this line from a Ukrainian official about the situation near Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second largest city: Russia is trying to make Kharkiv a frontline city,\u201d Vadym Denysenko, an adviser to the interior minister, told Ukraine\u2019s national television. It comes after Amnesty International this week accused Russia of war crimes in Ukraine, saying attacks on Kharkiv - many using banned cluster bombs - had killed hundreds of civilians. The US has transferred 1,400 anti-aircraft Stinger systems and 6,500 Javelin anti-armor systems to Ukraine, the leader of the Ukrainian political party Golos has said. It comes after the US department of defence announced a further $1bn in weapons aid for Ukraine earlier this week. Ukrainian MP and Golos party leader Kira Rudik tweeted: As EU leaders prepare to decide on whether to grant Ukraine candidate status, Politico has this Venn diagram showing which states are applying to join the bloc and Nato: Alongside Ukraine, EU leaders will also decide next week whether to grant Moldova and Georgia EU candidate status, although full membership would be probably take years. The European Commission has already said Ukraine should be given candidate status, and recommended it for Moldova, but has been more guarded in the case of Georgia. Ukrainians being hosted by Britons under the Homes for Ukraine scheme face a \u201ccliff edge\u201d of crumbling support when their placements end, and could be blocked from renting privately, refugee organisations have warned. They said it could be impossible for many refugees to pass checks on prospective tenants in the private sector. Families have already reported being frozen out after failing reference tests due to lacking evidence of work or tax history stretching back years Even those with secure jobs, savings and no history of debt have been blocked Thousands could be affected in the months to come as placements end Opora, a network assisting Ukrainians, urged the government to act now to avert problems Read the full report, by Shanti Das and Mark Townsend, here: Hello, I\u2019m Clea Skopeliti and I\u2019ll be updating the blog for the next few hours. It\u2019s 10.15am in Kyiv. German chancellor Olaf Scholz says the Group of Seven leading democracies will make clear at their coming summit that Ukraine can expect to receive the support it needs \u201cfor as long as necessary\u201d. In an interview with Germany\u2019s dpa news agency published on Saturday, Scholz said he wanted to use next week\u2019s meeting with fellow G7 leaders in the Bavarian village of Elmau to discuss Ukraine\u2019s long-term prospects. \u201cWe will continue to support Ukraine for as long as necessary,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cWe want to make sure that Russian president [Vladimir Putin\u2019s] calculations do not work out. \u201cPutin obviously hopes that everything will fall into place once he has conquered enough land and the international community will return to business as usual,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is an illusion.\u201d Associated Press reported Scholz as saying he and his counterparts from France, Italy and Romania had discussed further weapons supplies for Ukraine, specifically ammunition and artillery, with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy during their visit to Kyiv on Thursday. The four leaders also backed Ukraine\u2019s bid for membership of the European Union, a stance Scholz said he hoped all of the bloc\u2019s countries would support at a gathering in Brussels next week. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had visited soldiers on the southern frontline in the Mykolaiv region, about 550km (340 miles) south of Kyiv. \u201cI talked to our defenders \u2013 the military, the police, the national guard,\u201d he said in a video on Telegram on Sunday that appeared to have been recorded on a moving train. \u201cTheir mood is assured: they all do not doubt our victory,\u201d Zelenskiy said. \u201cWe will not give the south to anyone, and all that is ours we will take back.\u201d Another video showed Zelenskiy in his trademark khaki T-shirt handing out medals and posing for selfies with servicemen. Reuters reported Zelenskiy\u2019s office as saying he had also visited national guard positions in the southern region of Odesa to the west of Mykolaiv. The timing of the trips was not revealed. Zelenskiy has stayed mostly in Kyiv since Russia invaded, although in recent weeks he has made unannounced visits to Kharkiv and two eastern cities near battles. The besieged city of Sievierodonetsk faced heavy artillery and rocket fire again as Russian forces attacked areas around it, the Ukrainian military said. The military\u2019s general staff acknowledged its forces had suffered a setback in the settlement of Metolkine, just south-east of Sievierodonetsk, as the battle for the industrial city in eastern Ukraine continued. \u201cAs a result of artillery fire and an assault, the enemy has partial success in the village of Metolkine, trying to gain a foothold,\u201d it said in a Facebook post late on Saturday. Serhiy Gaidai, the Ukrainian-appointed governor of Luhansk, referred in a separate online post to \u201ctough battles\u201d in Metolkine, Reuters reported. Russia\u2019s Tass news agency, citing a source working for Russian-backed separatists, said many Ukrainian fighters had surrendered in Metolkine. It is approaching 10am in Kyiv and here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine could take years, the Nato secretary general said. Jens Stoltenberg said the supply of state-of-the-art weaponry to Ukraine would boost the chance of freeing its eastern region of Donbas from Russian control, Germany\u2019s Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported. \u201cWe must prepare for the fact that it could take years,\u201d Stoltenberg said. \u201cWe must not let up in supporting Ukraine, even if the costs are high, not only for military support, also because of rising energy and food prices.\u201d Russia was sending a large number of reserve troops to Sievierodonetsk from other battle zones to try to gain full control of the besieged eastern city, the governor of Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk region said on Sunday. \u201cToday, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, they will throw in all the reserves they have \u2026 because there are so many of them there already, they\u2019re at critical mass,\u201d Serhiy Gaidai said on national television. Two top commanders of fighters who defended the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have been transferred to Russia for investigation, Russia\u2019s state news agency Tass reported. Citing an unnamed Russian law enforcement source, Tass said late on Saturday that Svyatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of the Azov battalion, and Serhiy Volynsky, the commander of the 36th marine brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces, were moved to Russia. A big explosion rocked an area near Sievierodonetsk on Saturday. Rodion Miroshnik, an official in the self-styled separatist administration of the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, posted a video of what he said was the cloud on the Telegram messaging app. Five civilians were killed on Saturday in Ukrainian strikes on the eastern separatist city of Donetsk, according to local authorities. \u201cAs a result of the bombardment by Ukrainian forces, five people were killed and 12 others were wounded in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d the authorities said in a statement posted on Telegram. Several Russian missiles hit a gasworks in the Izium district in eastern Ukraine, Kharkiv region governor Oleh Synehubov said. \u201cA large-scale fire broke out, rescuers localised the fire,\u201d he wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Saturday. Reuters reported him adding that some other buildings had also been damaged. Russian missiles destroyed a fuel storage depot in Novomoskovsk, a town in eastern Ukraine. According to the head of the regional administration on Saturday, three people have been sent to the hospital. The Pentagon is considering sending four additional rocket launchers to Ukraine, Politico reports. According to US defence department officials, speaking to the outlet on condition of anonymity, the US may likely send four more high mobility artillery rocket systems, making their total number about eight. The decision would be \u201cbased on Ukrainian immediate needs\u201d, one official said. Russia and Ukraine have carried out a prisoner exchange, the Kyiv Independent reports. Five captured Ukrainian individuals were returned to Ukraine on 18 June in exchange for five captured Russian individuals, according to the Ukrainian defence ministry\u2019s intelligence directorate. Yuliia Paievska AKA \u201cTaira\u201d, the Ukrainian captured paramedic who was freed from Russian captivity during the week, released a video thanking Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for her release. \u201cI always believed that everything would be exactly this, and everyone who is now on the other side, they know everything will work out,\u201d she said. Zelenskiy presented state awards to border guards in Odesa as he visited troops in southern Ukraine. \u201cI want to thank you from the people of Ukraine, from our state, for the great work you are doing, for your heroic service,\u201d the president said on Saturday. \u201cIt is important that you are alive. As long as you live, there is a strong Ukrainian wall that protects our country.\u201d Hello, I\u2019m Adam Fulton in Sydney and welcome to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine."

            "date": "2022-06-30T19:30:05Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson has signalled a significant increase in the UK\u2019s defence budget to 2.5% of GDP by the end of the decade, raising questions about his commitment to cutting taxes, as a Nato summit dominated by the Ukraine conflict drew to an end in Madrid. \u201cWe need to invest for the long term in vital capabilities like future combat air while simultaneously adapting to a more dangerous and more competitive world,\u201d the prime minister told a press conference. \u201cThe logical conclusion of the investments on which we propose to embark, these decisions, is that we\u2019ll reach 2.5% of GDP on defence by the end of the decade.\u201d Downing Street insisted Johnson\u2019s remarks did not constitute a concrete pledge, with any formal decisions left for the future; however, it followed pressure from the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, for more resources beyond the current spending round, which ends in 2024-25. After Johnson\u2019s announcement, a source close to the defence secretary said Wallace had \u201calways been clear that as the threat changes, so should defence spending\u201d. Defence sources said the decision would mean a total budget of \u00a374.5bn in 2029-30, and a cumulative extra \u00a355.1bn to reach 2.5% in 2030. With many Conservative backbench MPs pressing for the government to slash taxes, the announcement raises questions about where Johnson\u2019s priorities lie \u2013 and what offer the Tories will make at the next election on tax and spending. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cIf we\u2019re permanently going to get to 2.5%, then you are talking about a significant shift in what the state is doing. In the long run, we\u2019ve managed to grow our welfare state without raising taxes, by shrinking the military. If we\u2019re wanting to reverse the direction of travel on that, then you\u2019re not also going to be able to turn around the NHS and have taxes substantively coming down.\u201d Johnson is planning to make a joint speech with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in the coming weeks, setting out how the pair see the UK economy, against a backdrop of soaring inflation. At a press conference capping a nine-day trip during which the prime minister has also attended a Commonwealth summit in Rwanda and the G7 summit in southern Germany, Johnson said Vladimir Putin had succeeded in uniting the west against Russia. He said there had been \u201cstrong unanimity\u201d at Nato and the G7 but the argument on supporting Ukraine had to be made across the international community. He said he had been listening to \u201cother voices, some of whom I think are under a misapprehension about what is really going on, and who is really to blame, and the spikes in fuel prices, under a misapprehension about what Nato really is\u201d. With soaring food and fuel prices back home, Johnson was asked whether there was a risk that consumers would suffer from Ukraine \u201cfatigue\u201d as the cost of living crisis bites. He replied that the \u201cpoint about the cost of freedom is that it is always worth paying\u201d. Labour said the prime minister should shoulder some of the responsibility for falling living standards, however. The shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, James Murray, said: \u201cWe must of course do all we can to support Ukraine as Russia\u2019s aggression continues. \u201cBut the Tories have only got themselves to blame for a decade of stagnating wages, low growth, higher taxes and poor delivery. They have let the country down and are looking for any excuse instead of fixing the problems they created. At the press conference, Johnson said Nato should offer a security guarantee for Ukraine: \u201cAll of Nato, or just some Nato countries, should be offering deterrence by denial, so that we fortify Ukraine with Nato-grade weaponry, plus intelligence, plus training, so that no future attack is conceivable. \u201cThat\u2019s stage one, and that\u2019s the position we want to get to. And I think that will prove to be a very effective solution. There can then be a further argument down the track about Nato, but that would be my interim solution.\u201d Earlier, Downing Street had announced it would almost double the UK commitment to military support for Ukraine with an additional \u00a31bn. The announcement prompted a backlash from the Welsh government, however, after it emerged that \u00a395m would come from the devolved Scottish and Welsh budgets. The Welsh finance minister, Rebecca Evans, said the move was \u201cworrying and potentially divisive\u201d."

            "date": "2022-06-21T02:17:27Z",
            "content": "The New South Wales budget, the last before the state goes to the polls next March, seeks to learn from lessons that saw voters kick out Coalition governments in South Australia and federally, while projecting an optimism about the future even as economic clouds darken. \u201cThere\u2019s always a better tomorrow if we choose to reach for it,\u201d was the tone presented by the characteristically upbeat treasurer, Matt Kean. After female voters turned on the Morrison government, Kean has allocated $16.5bn over the coming decade \u201cto make NSW the best place for women to live, work and raise a family\u201d. The forecast economic dividend of an additional $17.1bn in economic activity within that 10 years from such spending will come in handy, too \u2013 but whether this amounts to \u201ca once-in-a-generation reform budget\u201d, as Kean put it, remains to be seen. The biggest nod in the direction of reform is starting a shift from the reliance on stamp duty \u2013 still worth $14.6bn to the 2022-23 budget. This remains tentative, open only to first home buyers purchasing homes up $1.5m in value before the federal government comes to the party to help cover the shortfall in revenue. The trajectory of the economy in NSW and beyond will determine whether the budget can deliver on its promises, such as shifting from a record annual deficit estimated at $16.6bn for the fiscal year about to end, to a surplus of $601m by 2024-25. In the background, net debt at $53.5bn at June 2022 will more than double to $114.8bn in four years\u2019 time when it will \u201cstabilise\u201d at 14% of gross state produce \u201cbefore trending back down\u201d. Global ratings agencies will be among those watching closely \u2013 with two of the big three already cutting NSW\u2019s triple-A debt rating \u2013 but there are other predictions to eye somewhat sceptically. Economic growth itself will be one of them. The quickening of growth in the coming fiscal year to 5.5% expansion, doubling from 2.75% in the year just ending, will be one to watch. The pace of growth, though, slows sharply to 1.75% in 2023-24, and that assumes no more Covid variants or other big surprises such as another La Ni\u00f1a-influenced season of floods in the year ahead. Inflation and its consequences \u2013 good and bad for the budget \u2013 are also among the numbers to watch. The budget counts only Sydney\u2019s consumer price inflation rate \u2013 rather than NSW-wide \u2013 and this it sees accelerating from 4% in 2021-22 to peak at 5.5% in the coming year before easing back to 3% in the two following years. Wage growth, though, will only quicken from 2.25% to 3.5% in the coming year, and 3.25% in the coming years. The prospect of labour strife from the public sector is already evident from recent industrial action by teachers, paramedics, rail workers and others. That the government plans to increase spending on public sector salaries by 2.9% on average over the coming four years, a rate likely less than inflation, will probably be noted by restless unions. Similarly, a proposed \u201cefficiency dividend\u201d of $515m in 2023-24, from a 1% rate, will probably be unwelcome, not least because it will rise to 2% in 2024-25 and 3% in 2025-26 onwards. \u201cSavings are targeted to be delivered through non-frontline activities, grants management and administration, and ongoing digital transformation,\u201d the budget states. Frontline staff will, though, be retained, Kean told journalists. Rising inflation, meanwhile, will have a benefit of lifting the GST take NSW receives from the commonwealth, pumping more than $11bn more funds than were originally forecast into the budget over the coming four years. Aside from a $4bn boost from extra minerals royalties \u2013 thanks largely to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sending coal prices skyward \u2013 no other budget boost came close. There are some interesting additions to the budget such as increased spending on compliance that seems to provide the biggest return on investment. Some $60m spent will return $368m in more land tax and $200m in more stamp duty. Money well spent. Similarly quirky will be the requirement of overseas drivers to take a NSW licence within three months, a move that will recoup $53.5m in hitherto unpaid fines in the first year alone. That tally shrinks below $20m in the second year as those lessons sink in. Future clouds, meanwhile, include the end of the stamp duty bonanza that lifted the tax take from property transfers by an extra $1.2bn or 9.2% in 2021-22 alone. That sum will fall away as prices drop but the government predicts the market stabilising after a couple of tough years. Not mentioned in the budget but of note for their omission are the big dam projects, none of which get any funding. While there is a passing mention of the Dungowan dam, the dam wall raising efforts for Wyangala in central NSW and Warragamba to Sydney\u2019s west \u2013 both potentially multibillion-dollar projects - have \u201cno new money in the 2022-23 budget\u201d, staffers say. Those savings, assuming those projects don\u2019t go ahead, will save some future government a budget headache."

            "date": "2022-06-29T17:47:51Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has announced that the US will increase its military forces across Europe with more land, sea and air deployments, as he gathered with Nato leaders for a two-day summit in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Arriving at the meeting in Madrid, the US president announced the stationing of a brigade of 3,000 combat troops in Romania, two squadrons of F-35 fighters in the UK and two navy destroyers in Spain. \u201cThe US and its allies are going to step up. We\u2019re stepping up. We\u2019re proving that Nato is more needed now than it ever has been,\u201d Biden said in a short statement he read out before the first summit meeting began. Biden\u2019s announcement is expected to be followed by further commitments by Nato members to a strengthening of forces on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank, which was being discussed by Nato leaders on Wednesday morning. The morning meeting heard an address from Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which he called on Nato members to supply more advanced weaponry, particularly artillery, to help \u201cUkraine end this war by winning on the battlefield now\u201d. He also warned that Kyiv needed financial support to deal with the costs of fighting Russia. \u201cWe need about $5bn a month,\u201d Zelenskiy said, arguing that his country was fighting a country identified as Nato\u2019s most serious threat. \u201cWe are deterring Russia from destroying us and from destroying you,\u201d he said. Britain confirmed that it would increase its commitment to a Nato battlegroup in Estonia from 1,700 by about 1,000, although the extra forces will be based in the UK, earmarked to deploy to the country at short notice if needed. In total, eight frontline Nato battlegroups stretching from Estonia to Bulgaria, once designed to act as small initial defence force, are expected to be increased in size to a brigade level of 3,000 to 5,000 troops. Different Nato members will contribute to each as part of radical change in the alliance\u2019s military posture. Germany has already said it will increase its existing commitment to Lithuania to the size of a brigade. The US president also said the US fifth army corps would establish a permanent base in Poland, extra troops would be committed to the Baltic states and extra air defence systems would be stationed in Germany and Italy. It was, Biden said, a response to Russian aggression, adding: \u201cTogether with our allies, we are going make sure Nato is ready to meet threats across every domain, land, air and in the sea\u201d, which came \u201cat a moment when Putin has shattered peace in Europe and the very tenets of rules-based order\u201d. The US sent a further 20,000 troops to Europe earlier this year, taking the total based across the continent to over 100,000. Wednesday\u2019s announcements come on top of that and Biden said the US would \u201ccontinue to our adjust our posture\u201d if necessary. Nato\u2019s new defence plans mean that 300,000 troops would be placed at high readiness to deter any Russian attack. The forces will be available at a few days or weeks\u2019 notice to be sent into the frontline if necessary. Later, Biden also thanked his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for reaching a deal with Finland and Sweden to allow the Nordic countries to end decades of neutrality and join Nato, at a bilateral meeting between the leaders. US officials added that they now supported Turkey\u2019s desire to buy F-16 fighter jets and upgrade its air force. \u201cThe US Department of Defense fully supports Turkey\u2019s modernisation plans,\u201d Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs, said. The leaders attending the summit signed off on a new Nato strategic concept, the first time the alliance has revised its vision statement since 2010. It formally recognised that Russia poses \u201cthe most significant and direct threat to allies\u2019 security\u201d. The 2010 summit where the old document was agreed was attended by Russia\u2019s then president, Dmitri Medvedev, Stoltenberg recalled. \u201cWe agreed that Russia is a strategic partner for Nato and we had meetings with Russia at the Nato summit. And of course, this will not be the case now.\u201d The new document also referred to China for the first time, warning that Beijing\u2019s \u201cstated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values\u201d and that a \u201cdeepening strategic partnership\u201d with Russia, and the two countries\u2019 attempts to undercut the rules-based international order, \u201crun counter to our values and interests\u201d."

            "date": "2022-06-21T15:30:21Z",
            "content": "Germany needs to \u201cnormalise\u201d its relationship with the military and learn to take a leadership role in Europe after \u201calmost 80 years of restraint\u201d, the co-leader of the governing Social Democratic party (SPD) has said. In a speech marking a further point in Berlin\u2019s slow pivot from a broadly pacifist foreign policy agenda since Russia\u2019s 24 February invasion of Ukraine, Lars Klingbeil said it was important to recognise military force as a legitimate political measure for a government striving for peace. \u201cIt is the last measure, but it has to be clear that it is a measure,\u201d the centre-left politician told a security congress in Berlin on Tuesday. \u201cWe are currently seeing that in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cMy wish is that we as a society develop a new normality in our dealings with the Bundeswehr.\u201d Germany\u2019s pacifist foreign policy instincts, coupled with a history of expanding economic ties with Russia, have come under intense scrutiny in recent months, both domestically and among the country\u2019s Nato allies. Germany phased out compulsory military service in 2011 and the country\u2019s defence expenditure per GDP, though rising over the last four years, remains below the EU average and below Nato\u2019s 2% spending target. The SPD and its Green party junior coalition partners campaigned for unilateral nuclear disarmament as recently as last year\u2019s federal election. Chancellor Olaf Scholz surprised many of his own allies when he announced a U-turn on defence spending and Germany\u2019s restrictive stance on exporting lethal weapons on 27 February, but he has faced criticism for failing to follow up words with actions. Ukraine said on Tuesday that it had \u201cfinally\u201d deployed an advanced German artillery system in the latest delivery of the long-range weapons it has been calling for. \u201cPanzerhaubitze 2000 are finally part of 155mm howitzer arsenal of the Ukrainian artillery,\u201d defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov wrote on social media, thanking his German counterpart Christine Lambrecht. In his speech on Tuesday, Social Democrat co-leader Klingbeil said Germany\u2019s newly boosted defence budget would not only mean its army would eventually grow to become the largest in Europe, but that the country needed to learn to become a \u201cleading power\u201d \u2013 a term long considered a taboo among German politicians for fear of evoking ghosts of an aggressive past that would alienate its neighbours. \u201cGermany needs to hold itself to the standard of a leading power,\u201d Klingbeil said. \u201cAfter almost 80 years of restraint, Germany has a new role in the international system. Over the last decades, Germany has earned itself a great amount of trust. With this trust come expectations. [\u2026] We should meet these expectations.\u201d Since the start of the Ukraine war, some SPD politicians have come across as more hurt by the criticism of its Ostpolitik towards Russia than willing to reflect on their mistakes. Talking to international press ahead of Tuesday\u2019s security summit, the former president of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, merely said his party had been \u201cbadly advised\u201d in its expanding reliance on Russian energy. Klingbeil\u2019s speech signalled more willingness to rake over the past, conceding that German politicians had too often dismissed the security fears of Russia\u2019s neighbours. \u201cIf we hear from the Baltic states or Poland that they are scared of becoming Russia\u2019s next targets, we have to take them seriously,\u201d he said. For too long, Klingbeil said, Germany had \u201cmade itself too comfortable in the world\u201d. \u201cWe should have seen the signals from Russia differently. At least with an annexation of Crimea that was contrary to international law.\u201d The 44-year-old politician, once a protege of the disgraced ex-chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, said one lesson of Germany having allowed itself to become too reliant on Russian gas was that \u201cEurope has to expand its strategic autonomy\u201d. \u201cWith view to China, for example, that means reducing dependencies in medicine or technology,\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do any trade with China whatsoever, as some are calling for \u2013 but it means we should create a strategically wise and resilient set-up.\u201d"

            "content": "Dressed from head to toe in his dark blue naval uniform, Lieutenant Commander Oliver Brown doesn\u2019t look anything like an archetypal HIV activist. We\u2019re meeting by the commander\u2019s offices at HM Naval Base, Portsmouth. Late last year, Brown\u2019s campaigning efforts led to the announcement of a major sea-change in British military policy. It\u2019s thanks to him that outdated rules which see HIV+ people discriminated against within the military are imminently due to be scrapped. With two vast aircraft carriers visible through a window, it feels a long way from the protests, direct actions and LGBTQ+ activism which have for a long time been the frontline of the fight to improve the lives of \u2013 and tackle stigma against \u2013 people living with the diagnosis. It\u2019s not hard to imagine some of those campaigners being surprised to find a naval warfare officer among their ranks. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen myself as an activist,\u201d Brown says, \u201cbecause of where I am, who I am and what I do. But being in uniform lets me speak to a section of society who likely haven\u2019t read anything about HIV since the 1980s. That\u2019s a vital conversation to be had.\u201d Aged 19, Brown joined the military straight out of college. Growing up on Hayling Island, Hampshire, he spent his childhood in the shadow of the navy\u2019s Portsmouth HQ. He\u2019d been a cadet through adolescence so signing up seemed the obvious next step. For a year, he undertook his basic officer training at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth. Upon completion, he joined a mine-hunting ship. \u201cThese ships are seen as the jewel in the navy\u2019s crown,\u201d he explains, clearly proud. \u201c\u2018I started out here in Portsmouth, then in Scotland, before flying out to Bahrain.\u201d Soon, he\u2019d qualified, allowing him to drive a naval ship from the bridge. A couple of deployments later, he was commanding his own patrol boat based across the UK. Next came the opportunity to work among naval high command. \u201cI became the Flag Lieutenant to the Second Sea Lord,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThat\u2019s like being an executive assistant to the deputy CEO and HR director of the navy.\u201d At first, Brown was based at Navy Command in Portsmouth. When his boss got tapped on the shoulder for a promotion in London, Brown relocated, too. \u201cThat\u2019s where the story completely changes for me.\u201d On an afternoon in October 2019, Brown set off from his Battersea pad for a short cycle through London, to collect some documents from his boss\u2019s South Kensington home. \u201cJust around the corner from my place, a plastic bottle got stuck in the spoke of my bicycle\u2019s tyre and jammed my front wheel,\u201d Brown says. \u201cI lost control, ended up smashing into a brick wall and then \u2013 still attached to the bike \u2013 slid the other way across the pavement.\u201d Thankfully, Brown says, the bike came off far worse than he did. \u201cOne of my fingers had been shredded,\u201d he recalls, \u201cso I headed to Chelsea and Westminster hospital assuming I\u2019d be out within a couple of hours.\u201d But his doctors became concerned there was something more serious at play. \u201cAt first,\u201d he says, \u201cthey thought it might be internal bleeding.\u201d There were X-rays, blood tests and CT scans. Alarmingly, tests showed his lymph nodes were enlarged. \u201cThe doctors,\u201d Brown says, \u201cwere concerned they\u2019d identified the early stages of cancer. I was only 29.\u201d Military training kicked in. He tried to stay calm and collected. Two days later \u2013 Halloween \u2013 Brown was back in a hospital consulting room. \u201cThat was the first time I heard someone say HIV.\u201d Unbeknown to Brown, this hospital was part of an opt-out HIV testing scheme. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich was either chance, coincidence or fate, I still may not know today. I went from a bike accident to concerns of cancer to then having the news broken that I was HIV+ all in just a couple of days.\u201d Focusing on thinking rationally in difficult circumstances had been drilled into Brown for his entire career. \u201cI went through school while Section 28 was still in place,\u201d he explains. \u201cHIV was never talked about.\u201d He racked his brain for context \u2013 at that stage, his only reference point was the musical Rent, set in late-1980s New York. He set about trying to answer three questions: \u201cWhat\u2019s my life going to be like? When will I die? And, do I still have a job?\u201d Almost immediately, answers for the first two were forthcoming. Modern treatment has ensured that, when started in time, living with HIV need have no detrimental effect on quality of life, let alone life expectancy. Within weeks, Brown would have an undetectable viral load in his body meaning he couldn\u2019t pass it on. No medical professional, however, knew what the news might mean for the career Brown valued so much. To this day, he doesn\u2019t remember the journey he made after his diagnosis to meet a friend and colleague outside the Ministry of Defence. Within a few days, he\u2019d informed his family, close friends and immediate colleagues. \u201cMy direct line manager couldn\u2019t have been more supportive,\u201d Brown says, \u201cbut it took a few days to actually get an answer to the question: what would my career look like?\u201d Back in Portsmouth, naval medics finally confirmed what he feared: he\u2019d be medically downgraded, making him \u201cmedically limited deployable\u201d. In his office job, that had little practical consequence. Had he still been based on a ship, however, he\u2019d have been removed \u2013 temporarily at least \u2013 deemed unfit to undertake his duties. \u201cOver time,\u201d Brown says, \u201cthis label made me feel debilitated. Being called \u2018limited deployable\u2019 made me feel like I wasn\u2019t able to do my job when I knew that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d At first he kept his head down, desperate to ignore it. A year later, medics cleared him to return to work on a navy ship. \u201cBut every time I walked into my cabin,\u201d Brown remembers, \u201cI would sit on the chair, staring at the wall, crying my eyes out in hysterical distress. When I had a task that needed completing, I\u2019d shut down all emotion and walk out the door.\u201d He put on a brave face in public, but privately the pressure was just too much. Brown also found that the military wasn\u2019t free of broader societal stigma and prejudice. \u201cOur humour is unique at the best of times,\u201d he explains, \u201cmuch like other high-pressure jobs, it is a coping mechanism.\u201d But now, these jokes hit Brown differently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t unusual,\u201d he says, \u201cfor someone with any nature of illness to be told: \u2018It could be Aids.\u2019\u201d Navigating when and how to disclose his diagnosis to an ever-changing roster of colleagues became a deep source of anxiety and shame. \u201cI developed this paranoia,\u201d Brown says, \u201csecond guessing every situation. I was broken.\u201d He was downgraded again with depression and anxiety, and signed off work temporarily. With support, he worked hard to build himself back up again. Brown went to counselling with the Terrence Higgins Trust; it was revelatory. \u201cAt this point I could regurgitate thousands of statistics about HIV, but it was a defence mechanism. I\u2019d never considered how it made me feel.\u201d Only two years into his diagnosis, there was close to three decades of stigma still to unpack. \u201cI found myself thinking the thoughts most people used to jump to: you\u2019re dirty, promiscuous, reckless and negligent. Those labels are routinely slapped on to people with HIV.\u201d Emboldened, he looked to the military\u2019s policies on HIV, determined to understand better the situation for people living with HIV across each of the armed forces. What he discovered was deeply uncomfortable. \u201cThe way each talked about HIV was out of touch with the modern day,\u201d he says. Most striking was the military\u2019s blanket ban on HIV+ people joining the armed forces. With what Brown now knew about the virus, this made no sense. \u201cIf you went on to the NHS website,\u201d he explains, \u201cit set out the restrictions on people living with HIV in the UK. It meant problems travelling to certain countries, and other things totally beyond the control of the British government. The only barrier to life domestically was joining the armed forces.\u201d A similar prohibition was in place for people taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), preventive medication which reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%. For those already serving upon diagnosis, it was a slightly more complex picture. But diving deeper into the army, navy and air force\u2019s respective policies did little to placate Brown\u2019s concern. The RAF\u2019s document referenced the prospect of \u201ccognitive degradation\u201d of those living with HIV; pilots could be barred from flying for 12 months. The navy, meanwhile, seemed concerned with the prospect of flying body shrapnel, alongside a similar 12-month period away from the frontline. \u201cIt dawned on me that within the navy, if I was blown up by an incendiary device, their principal concern was how a small part of my body might transmit HIV to those around me as if I was a virus-laden bullet. But this was almost laughable; certainly not a potential method of transmission.\u201d Brown, and others like him, were deemed to be a risk to their colleagues and operations. In reality, they presented no danger. With the support of HIV organisations, he set about challenging this. His time spent in Whitehall meant he knew the doors to knock on and being so well informed about HIV ensured he knew precisely what to say. \u201cIt was a relentless battle,\u201d Brown says, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a lot of knowledge base to build from. I just continued to ask why.\u201d There were meetings with the Government Equalities Office, the Department for Health, and the Number 10 policy team. Brown lobbied MPs from the All Party Parliamentary Group, defence ministers and military top brass. Almost every conversation unfolded in a similar fashion: once Brown had set out his case, and the science which backed it, there was universal agreement that something needed to urgently change. On 1 December 2021, the Ministry of Defence put out a press release: \u201cArmed Forces make major changes to end HIV being a barrier to service.\u201d In it was a commitment to ensuring being HIV+ would no longer exclude anyone from the option to join the military. Candidates taking PrEP could now be welcomed; serving personnel with HIV could be recognised as fully fit. Brown was in a taxi when the news came. \u201cWhen I got that call telling me it was official and that the prime minister would tweet the announcement,\u201d he says, \u201cit was the first time I was truly at peace with the fact I was someone living with HIV. I never thought it would happen, let alone so quickly.\u201d Today, Brown has a tattoo of a red ribbon on his big toe. \u201cWhen I was feeling low,\u201d he says, \u201cI had a conversation with my brother. \u2018What does HIV mean to you?\u2019 he asked. Well, I thought, it\u2019s no more important than my big toe. A part of me, yes. But it doesn\u2019t matter too much.\u201d At first, he\u2019d look at this tattoo fairly regularly. More recently, Brown has started to forget that it\u2019s even there."

            "date": "2022-06-06T10:00:32Z",
            "content": "Dangerous levels of toxic PFAS are contaminating water supplies in areas around at least 12 military bases, new Department of Defense testing has revealed, drawing concern from public health advocates that the DoD is not doing enough to protect the public. The data released this week by the military shows levels for five kinds of PFAS compounds at what Scott Faber, vice-president of government affairs for Environmental Working Group, characterized as \u201cextremely high\u201d levels, and he said they present a health threat to residents living nearby. \u201cYou can only hope now that people know and are finding alternative sources of water because those are shockingly high levels of PFAS,\u201d he added. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 chemicals used across dozens of industries to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. Though the compounds are highly effective, they are also linked to cancer, kidney disease, birth defects, decreased immunity, liver problems and a range of other serious diseases. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d due to their longevity in the environment. The military\u2019s firefighters use aqueous film-forming foam, or AFFF, which contains extremely high levels of PFAS, in training exercises and emergencies. Though AFFF is effective, it has led to widespread contamination around bases and airports, and Congress just mandated the military check for PFAS pollution at 700 facilities while earmarking $571m for cleanup, though observers say the cost will likely be much higher. Meanwhile, the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act mandates that the defense department phase out AFFF and use safer alternatives already on the market. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set an advisory health standard of 70 ppt for PFOS and PFOA, two types of PFAS used in the foam, though that may soon be lowered, and some states have already set much lower standards. Levels of PFOS in groundwater around Whidbey Island NAS near Seattle in the Puget Sound topped 4,700 ppt, while eight sites exceeded the EPA\u2019s advisory levels. Meanwhile, levels for three other PFAS compounds that the department tested for topped 1,150 ppt, and though no federal standard for those compounds exists, many exceeded limits some states have set. In a statement, the DoD said it has since 2016 provided bottled water and filtration systems or connected residences to municipal water lines in locations where it has found PFAS contamination. \u201cDoD continues to perform routine sampling at impacted locations off-base and expand sampling to further investigate and identify locations where there is known or potential risk of PFAS release,\u201d a spokesperson said. But Faber said the military has known about the threat for decades, and \u201cthey are only alerting neighbors because Congress ordered them to do so\u201d. \u201cIn the absence of a Congressional order, they would continue to be a bad neighbor,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2022-06-21T04:00:26Z",
            "content": "Unidentified operatives have been using the fitness tracking app Strava to spy on members of the Israeli military, tracking their movements across secret bases around the country and potentially observing them as they travel the world on official business. By placing fake running \u201csegments\u201d inside military bases, the operation \u2013 the affiliation of which has not been uncovered \u2013 was able to keep tabs on individuals who were exercising on the bases, even those who have applied the strongest possible account privacy settings. In one example seen by the Guardian, a user running on a top-secret base thought to have links to the Israeli nuclear programme could be tracked across other military bases and to a foreign country. The surveillance campaign was discovered by the Israeli open-source intelligence outfit FakeReporter. The group\u2019s executive director, Achiya Schatz, said: \u201cWe contacted the Israeli security forces as soon as we became aware of this security breach. After receiving approval from the security forces to proceed, FakeReporter contacted Strava, and they formed a senior team to address the issue.\u201d Strava\u2019s tracking tools are designed to allow anyone to define and compete over \u201csegments\u201d, short sections of a run or bike ride that may be regularly raced over, like a long uphill climb on a popular cycling route or a single circuit of a park. Users can define a segment after uploading it from the Strava app, but can also upload GPS recordings from other products or services. But Strava has no way of tracking whether those GPS uploads are legitimate, and allows anyone to define a segment by uploading \u2013 even if they may not have been to the place they are tracking. In fact, some uploaded segments are clearly artificially generated, with average paces of hundreds of kilometres an hour, unnaturally straight lines and instant vertical leaps up clifftops all recorded. Some of those fake uploads may have been used for the purposes of cheating on friendly competitions, or setting up a segment to guide others: but at least one set appears to have a more malicious purpose. An anonymous user, with their location given as \u201cBoston, Massachusetts\u201d, had set up a series of fake segments across a number of military establishments in Israel, including outposts of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies and highly secure bases thought to be associated with its nuclear programme. \u201cBy exploiting the capability to upload engineered files, revealing the details of users anywhere in the world, hostile elements have taken one alarming step closer to exploiting a popular app in order to harm the security of citizens and countries alike,\u201d Schatz said. The fake segment approach also bypasses some of Strava\u2019s privacy settings. Users can set their profiles to be only visible to \u201cfollowers\u201d, which prevents prying eyes from tracking their movements across time. But unless they also set each individual run to be actively secured, then their profile picture, first name, and initial will show up on segments they have run, in the spirit of friendly competition. With enough segments scattered across the map, individuals can still be identified: one user, for instance, tracked their participation in a publicly reported race, which they won, as well as running in secure military establishments. In a statement, the fitness company said: \u201cWe take matters of privacy very seriously and have been made aware by an Israeli group, FakeReporter, of a segment issue regarding a specific user account and have taken the necessary steps to remedy this situation. \u201cWe provide readily accessible information regarding how information is shared on Strava, and give every athlete the ability to make their own privacy selections. For more information on all of our privacy controls, please visit our privacy centre as we recommend that all athletes take the time to ensure their selections in Strava represent their intended experience.\u201d The discovery has echoes of a scandal from 2018 when a new Strava feature published a visualisation of all activity on the fitness tracking platform across the world. The heat map showed popular running, cycling and swimming routes, and an announcement from Strava highlighted that it could be used to spot locations like the route of the Ironman triathlon in Hawaii. But it also laid out routes that were less public: the location and layout of multiple military bases in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, were clearly visible, as was a popular outdoor swimming spot next to RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands. The map even recorded the route of a lone cyclist in Area 51, Nevada. Strava\u2019s response to the uproar was to advise military users to opt out of its visualisation, arguing that the information was made public by the users who uploaded it. In an echo of the latest privacy vulnerability, some users were tracked in alarming detail: one US air force service member could be tracked from a tour in Djibouti, where she ran the 7km loop of the runway, to an airbase in Germany where she was transferred in 2016."

            "content": "Russia will deliver missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads to Belarus in the coming months, President Vladimir Putin has said as he received Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. \u201cIn the coming months, we will transfer to Belarus Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which can use ballistic or cruise missiles, in their conventional and nuclear versions,\u201d Putin said in a broadcast on Russian television at the start of his meeting with Lukashenko in St Petersburg on Saturday. Putin has several times referred to nuclear weapons since his country launched a military operation in Ukraine on 24 February, in what the west has seen as a warning not to intervene. Lukashenko said last month that his country had bought Iskander nuclear-capable missiles and S-400 anti-aircraft anti-missile systems from Russia. The development came on the eve of a meeting of G7 leaders in Germany on Sunday, to be hosted by Chancellor Olaf Scholz in the Bavarian alps, which is set to be dominated by Ukraine and its far-reaching consequences, from energy shortages to a food crisis. The G7 leaders are expected to seek to show a united front on supporting Ukraine for as long as necessary and cranking up pressure on the Kremlin \u2013 although they will want to avoid sanctions that could stoke inflation and exacerbate the global cost-of-living crisis. \u201cThe main message from the G7 will be unity and coordination of action \u2026 That\u2019s the main message, that even through difficult times \u2026 we stick to our alliance,\u201d an EU official said. The G7 partners are set to agree to ban imports of gold from Russia, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. A German government source later said that leaders were having \u201creally constructive\u201d conversations on a possible price cap on Russian oil imports. This year, Scholz invited as partner countries Senegal, the current chair of the African Union, Argentina, which heads the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Indonesia and India, the present and next hosts of the G20 group of large industrial nations, and South Africa. \u201cThe summit must send not only the message that Nato and the G7 are more united than ever, but also that the democracies of the world stand together against Putin\u2019s imperialism just as they do in the fight against hunger and poverty,\u201d Scholz told the German parliament this week. Putin also offered to upgrade Belarus\u2019 warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons, amid soaring tensions with the west over Ukraine. \u201cMany Su-25 [aircraft] are in service with the Belarusian military. They could be upgraded in an appropriate way,\u201d the Russian leader said. \u201cThis modernisation should be carried out in aircraft factories in Russia and the training of personnel should start in accordance with this,\u201d he added, after Lukashenko asked him to \u201cadapt\u201d the planes. \u201cWe will agree on how to accomplish this,\u201d Putin said. During the meeting Lukashenko expressed concern about the \u201caggressive\u201d, \u201cconfrontational\u201d and \u201crepulsive\u201d policies of its neighbours Lithuania and Poland and asked Putin to help Belarus mount a \u201csymmetrical response\u201d to what he said were nuclear-armed flights by Nato near Belarus\u2019 borders. Putin said he saw no need at present for a symmetrical response. The Iskander-M, a mobile guided missile system codenamed \u201cSS-26 Stone\u201d by Nato, replaced the Soviet Scud missile. Its two guided missiles have a range of up to 500km (300 miles) and can carry conventional or nuclear warheads. In the past week, Lithuania in particular has infuriated Russia by blocking the transit of goods subject to European sanctions travelling across its territory from Russia, through Belarus, to Russia\u2019s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad. Russia has termed it a \u201cblockade\u201d, but Lithuania says it affects only 1% of the normal goods in transit on the route, and that passenger traffic is unaffected.

            "date": "2022-06-25T16:37:33Z",
            "content": "Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, has said talks will restart on the Iran nuclear deal, averting a complete collapse in the agreement which could spark a nuclear arms race across the Middle East. After a meeting with the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in Tehran, Borrell said he had broken the stalemate which had led to talks on the revival of the nuclear deal being stalled since March. Borrell gave no detail about the exact date of the resumption of talks or the precise format, but said the process had the agreement of Iran and the US. He also met Iran\u2019s national security chief Ali Shamkhani. Previous talks broke down with most aspects of the US\u2019s return to the nuclear agreement settled. However the US president, Joe Biden, was not willing to accept Iran\u2019s demand that sanctions be lifted on the Islamic revolutionary guard corps (IRGC) by ending its designation as a foreign terrorist organisation. Iran had recently privately revised that stipulation, but then felt the US had not reciprocated by setting out the future steps the IRGC could take to end its terrorist designation. At a joint press conference in Tehran, Amir-Abdollahian said: \u201cWe are ready to resume the Vienna talks within the next days.\u201d He expressed hope that the US would \u201cthis time\u201d pursue a \u201crealistic and fair approach\u201d and give Iran the full economic benefit of the 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Programme of Action (JCPoA). In 2018 Donald Trump announced he would impose \u201cthe highest level of economic sanctions\u201d on Iran and pulled the US out of the agreement. The Iranian foreign minister said he held \u201cdetailed, precise and deep\u201d talks with Borrell on the JCPoA revival negotiations, adding: \u201cWe are going to break the stalemate in the Vienna talks and end the tension that has existed in recent days.\u201d Borrell later said the initial talks will not take place in Vienna because the discussions involve the US, Iran and the EU. He said they would take place in a Gulf country. If they succeed, the deal would be referred to a wider meeting of the JCPoA, including the other signatories of Russia and China, in Vienna. Pressure had been building for the resumption of talks as the UN nuclear inspectorate had lost almost all effective access to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites. Iran had responded to a censure motion passed earlier this month by the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency by disconnecting some cameras in its facilities, undermining the UN\u2019s \u201ccontinuity of knowledge\u201d about Iranian nuclear activities. Many regional observers remain dubious that a deal will be reached, but the Ukraine war has not produced an economic windfall for Iran as Russia has been offering its oil to China at a discount price, squeezing Iran out of key markets. Iran\u2019s oil exports to China had fallen by 34% as of May, according to Hamid Hosseini, president of the Oil and Gas Exporters\u2019 Union in Iran."

            "content": "Iran has been accused of making \u201cmaximalist demands\u201d in the latest unsuccessful round of talks on reviving the nuclear non-proliferation deal at a grave session of the UN security council in which it was widely acknowledged that the talks \u2013 and the whole 2015 deal \u2013 were on the brink of collapse. Iranian and US officials, with the EU acting as mediators, held two days of talks in Doha in a bid to break a months-long impasse, but no progress was made on Iran\u2019s central demand that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps be removed from US sanctions and its list of foreign terrorist organisations. \u201cNot only has Iran not taken up the offer on the table, but it also added yet more issues which fall outside the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] with maximalist and unrealistic demands,\u201d the French ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Rivi\u00e8re, said on Thursday. The broader talks have been stalled since March, but the recent fresh restrictions placed on UN weapons inspectors \u2013 as well as Iran\u2019s speeding up of uranium enrichment \u2013 has injected a sudden urgency into the crisis. Western leaders will have to take decisive steps including reimposing UN sanctions in weeks if the nuclear inspectorate continues to be unable to carry out its monitoring duties. During the special session of the UN security council, Barbara Woodward, the UK envoy, warned Iran that no better deal was going to be offered. Olof Skoog, the EU\u2019s ambassador to the UN, said: \u201cI am concerned that we might not make it over the finishing line. My message is: seize this opportunity to conclude the deal, based on the text that is on the table. The time to overcome the last outstanding issues, conclude the deal and fully restore the [agreement] is now.\u201d The context of the impasse \u2013 growing Iranian enrichment and ballistic missile activity \u2013 is also concerning European leaders. Woodward warned: \u201cIran\u2019s nuclear programme has never been more advanced than it is today and Iran\u2019s nuclear escalation is a threat to international peace and security.\u201d \u201cAt the current enrichment rate, by the end of this year, Iran is likely to have enough enriched material to rapidly produce highly enriched uranium at 90% enrichment for several nuclear devices,\u201d she said. \u201cIran also continues to develop ballistic missiles in a way that is inconsistent with UN resolutions.\u201d In a joint statement, Germany, France and the UK claimed that Iran was testing ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology. The statement said: \u201cOnly a few days ago, Iran conducted another test of a space launch vehicle, which contains dual-use technology that can be used to construct long-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u201d The Iranian ambassador, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said an agreement was \u201cnot out of reach\u201d but that success required significant changes in US policy, specifically regarding the imposition of sanctions. He also said guarantees were needed that the US would not leave the deal again as they had under Donald Trump in 2018."

            "date": "2022-06-13T09:33:19Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s nuclear arsenal is expected to increase in the coming years for the first time since the end of cold war at a time that the risk of such weapons being used is the greatest in decades, a leading conflict and weapons thinktank has said. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and western support for Kyiv have heightened tensions among the world\u2019s nine nuclear-armed states, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) said on Monday. Countries increasing their stockpiles of nuclear warheads included the UK, which in 2021 announced its decision to increase the ceiling on its total warhead stockpile, in a reversal of decades of gradual disarmament. The increase come despite a statement from the UN\u2019s five permanent members of the security council in 2021 \u2013 the US, Russia, China, the UK and France \u2013 stating that \u201cnuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u201d. All P5 members continue to expand or modernise their nuclear arsenals. The UK currently has about 195 nuclear warheads, of which 120 are operational, according to an estimate by researchers at the Federation of American Scientists. While the UK has criticised China and Russia for lack of nuclear transparency, the UK also announced that it would no longer publicly disclose figures for the country\u2019s operational nuclear weapon stockpile, deployed warheads or deployed missiles. In early 2021, France officially launched a programme to develop a third-generation nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) while India and Pakistan appear to be expanding their nuclear arsenals, and both countries introduced and continued to develop new types of nuclear delivery system in 2021. Israel \u2013 which does not publicly acknowledge possessing nuclear weapons \u2013 is also believed to be modernising its nuclear arsenal. While the number of nuclear weapons fell slightly between January 2021 and January 2022, Sipri said that unless immediate action was taken by the nuclear powers, global inventories of warheads could soon begin rising for the first time in decades. \u201cAll of the nuclear-armed states are increasing or upgrading their arsenals and most are sharpening nuclear rhetoric and the role nuclear weapons play in their military strategies,\u201d Dr Wilfred Wan, the director of Sipri\u2019s weapons of mass destruction programme, said in the thinktank\u2019s 2022 yearbook. \u201cThis is a very worrying trend.\u201d \u201cThere are clear indications that the reductions that have characterised global nuclear arsenals since the end of the cold war have ended,\u201d said Hans M Kristensen, an associate senior fellow with Sipri\u2019s weapons of mass destruction programme and director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). Three days after Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, put Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent on high alert. He has also warned of consequences that would be \u201csuch as you have never seen in your entire history\u201d for countries that stand in Russia\u2019s way. Russia has the world\u2019s biggest nuclear arsenal, with a total of 5,977 warheads, 550 more than the US. The two countries possess more than 90% of the world\u2019s warheads, though Sipri said China was in the middle of an expansion, with more than 300 new missile silos, according to the latest estimate. Sipri said the global number of nuclear warheads had fallen from 13,080 in January 2021 to 12,705 in January 2022. An estimated 3,732 warheads were deployed with missiles and aircraft, and about 2,000 \u2013 nearly all belonging to Russia or the US \u2013 were kept in a state of high readiness. Stefan L\u00f6fven, the Sipri board chair and a former Swedish prime minister, said: \u201cRelations between the world\u2019s great powers have deteriorated further at a time when humanity and the planet face an array of profound and pressing common challenges that can only be addressed by international cooperation.\u201d Despite hopes in the post-cold-war era that countries would give up their nuclear weapons, few countries have followed through, while some agreements to restrict nuclear forces have gone into reverse, not least after the decision by the former US president Donald Trump to unilaterally withdraw from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces agreement. In 1993 South Africa renounced its small stockpile of six nuclear warheads, while Iraq abandoned its nuclear weapons research programme under international pressure after the first Gulf War. Ukraine also relinquished its arsenal of nuclear weapons for an unfulfilled promise of security. Reuters contributed to this report"

            "content": "Rapidly falling continuity of care levels pose an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to patient safety, Britain\u2019s top family doctor will warn today as research reveals only half of Britons regularly see the same GP. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs (RCGP), will say trusted relationships between family doctors and patients are the most \u201cpowerful intervention\u201d for delivering effective, high-quality care as they boost patient satisfaction and health outcomes, and reduce use of hospital services. But in a keynote speech to the college\u2019s annual conference, Marshall will warn that continuity of care is becoming almost impossible to deliver on the NHS amid soaring demand and shrinking numbers of GPs, in what he will describe as the \u201cmost worrying crisis in decades\u201d. There are mounting concerns over the ability of the NHS to tackle record waiting lists, with 6.5m patients awaiting care in England alone. Earlier this month Sajid Javid, the health secretary, admitted the current model of GP care \u201cis not working\u201d but insisted there would be no more money for the health service. Marshall\u2019s intervention comes after GPs in England threatened on Tuesday to take industrial action over a contract that forces them to offer appointments at evenings and weekends. Medics at the British Medical Association (BMA) annual conference in Brighton called on the union\u2019s leaders to act on a 2021 indicative ballot and \u201corganise opposition\u201d to the contract, \u201cincluding industrial action if necessary\u201d. GPs would be unlikely to stop providing emergency and urgent care, but could refuse to carry out other routine work or cut their hours. At the RCGP conference in London, Marshall will tell delegates that because of rising workloads and fewer staff, GPs no longer have the time to properly assess patients, with 65% warning safety is being compromised due to appointments being too short, according to a recent survey commissioned by the college. Only 39% of respondents said they were able to deliver the continuity of care their patients need \u2013 down from 60% two years ago. The findings are backed by a separate study published today. A Queen Mary University of London review of 1m NHS patients found half (52%) regularly see the same GP despite growing evidence of improved clinical outcomes. The research found the patients who benefit most from seeing the same GP are those with long-term health conditions and people who visit a practice frequently. However, Marshall will tell delegates the current state of general practice in the UK is \u201cnot conducive\u201d to \u201cthe building of relationships\u201d, adding: \u201cOn average three problems are presented in a 9.8-minute consultation \u2013 the second shortest consultations in Europe after Germany. \u201cAt a time when workload is going up and the size of the GP workforce is reducing, as it is in the UK, this may require a redesign of how we work, with a shift from GP-as-all-things-to-all-people to a more focused approach, where we add value as members of a wider professional team \u2013 and continuity of care is one of those areas.\u201d Marshall will suggest that continuity of care can still be delivered, but perhaps not in the way it has been previously. \u201cContinuity of care is a defining feature of family practice but doctors shouldn\u2019t have a monopoly on its delivery,\u201d he will say, citing examples of where good patient relationships are held by more than one clinician, such as nurses or physiotherapists. Meanwhile, Tony Blair today urges the health service in England to radically reform how it operates in order to remain viable, declaring that \u201cthe NHS is a service, not a religion\u201d. A new report from the ex-prime minister\u2019s Institute for Global Change warns that the NHS as a whole is at risk of going the same way as dentistry, with patients unable to get care they need. In his foreword Blair says that the service\u2019s founding principles \u2013 that it be available to everyone, free at the point of use and funded by general taxation \u2013 must remain in place. \u201cHowever, the NHS envisioned by Sir William Beveridge and Aneurin Bevan \u2013 a centrally controlled, \u2018one size fits all\u2019 service focused on how we treat sick people \u2013 no longer fits the requirements of today\u2019s world. \u201cThe way the NHS is established and organised should not be and cannot be a matter of belief, but of practicality. As presently constituted, the NHS cannot be the service we now need.\u201d Ministers and NHS bosses need to embrace technology and innovation such as AI on a much larger scale, concentrate more on preventing illness and allow the 42 new \u201cintegrated care systems\u201d \u2013 groupings of NHS bodies which launch on Friday \u2013 freedom from central control to decide themselves how best to deliver healthcare in their area, the report says. Ministers will on Wednesday outline plans for a huge increase in the number of patients who self-monitor their own conditions and are treated at home in \u201cvirtual wards\u201d in a bid to take the pressure off overstretched hospitals."

            "date": "2022-06-16T12:36:21Z",
            "content": "The US could have saved more than 338,000 lives and more than $105bn in healthcare costs in the Covid-19 pandemic with a universal healthcare system, according to a study. More than 1 million people died in the US from Covid, in part because the country\u2019s \u201cfragmented and inefficient healthcare system\u201d meant uninsured or underinsured people faced financial barriers that delayed diagnosis and exacerbated transmission, the report states. The US had the highest death rate from the virus among large wealthy countries and is also the only one among such countries without universal healthcare. It spends almost twice as much on healthcare per capita as the other wealthy countries, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data. \u201cThe current healthcare system in the US is economically inefficient and leaves millions of Americans without adequate access to medical treatment,\u201d said Alison Galvani, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis at the Yale School of Public Health and the lead author of the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The authors recommend that the country adopt Medicare for All, a single-payer healthcare program, to \u201cfacilitate recovery from the ongoing crisis and bolster pandemic preparedness, as well as safeguard well-being and prosperity more broadly\u201d. To determine how many Covid deaths were potentially preventable, the authors built upon previous studies of the insurance gap and mortality rate in the US with data on how many people lost employer-sponsored insurance due to Covid-related business closures and restrictions that led to unemployment. \u201cWhile stay-at-home orders and temporary closures of nonessential businesses curbed the immediate spread of Covid-19 and prevented catastrophic demands on hospital capacity, the measures also led to spikes in unemployment,\u201d the report states. \u201cFor employees, a layoff often results in insurance loss or the need to switch to a different type.\u201d The authors calculated potential cost savings from universal healthcare in part by reviewing the average Medicare and Medicaid costs for a Covid-19 hospitalization that required mechanical ventilation, which were $57,822 and $47,396, respectively, according to the report. The average charge to private insurance was $114,842. The study also asserts that fear of losing health insurance during a pandemic might have caused people to still go to work even when they didn\u2019t feel well. \u201cUniversal single-payer healthcare is both fiscally responsible and morally imperative for the US,\u201d Galvani stated. David Rosner, who studies public health and social history at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, described the study as the \u201cultimate condemnation of a health system from a public health point of view\u201d. \u201cIt was clear that the essential workers who were delivering our food [and other items] to the middle class were being exposed disproportionately,\u201d Rosner said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that they found that these folks were dying at a higher rate.\u201d A single-payer healthcare system could prevent such deaths because it would improve access to primary care, which would lead to quicker diagnosis of a virus and better treatment of co-morbidities such as diabetes, the study states. Ann Keller, an associate professor of health policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley, said the lack of a single-payer healthcare system is not the only reason the country has high rates of chronic diseases. She also blamed a weak welfare state, poverty and food deserts. \u201cBut all other things being equal, if you provide people with consistent healthcare, they are better able to prevent chronic disease and or manage it once it\u2019s present,\u201d said Keller. Recent Democratic efforts to implement a single-payer health system or expand the Affordable Care Act have stalled. \u201cResults of studies like ours are up against a Goliathan healthcare industry that contributes heavily to political campaign financing and lobbying,\u201d said Galvani. \u201cLegislators who sway under such influence are not working for the health or prosperity of their constituents.\u201d"

            "title": "More healthcare to go online in England under digitisation plan",
            "date": "2022-06-29T07:47:56Z",
            "content": "People in England will receive more healthcare treatments online, enabling them to check NHS records, receive messages from their GP and attend virtual wards, under government plans to digitise healthcare. Ministers hope that the expansion of technology will free up hospital beds and clinician time by enabling doctors and nurses to monitor about 500,000 people remotely. The plan for digital health and social care, published on Wednesday, also sets out how patients will be able to manage hospital appointments, book Covid vaccines and have virtual consultations through the NHS app, which 28 million people now have, by March 2023. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: \u201cWe are embarking on a radical programme of modernisation that will make sure the NHS is set up to meet the challenges of 2048 \u2013 not 1948, when it was first established. \u201cEnsuring more personalisation and better join up of the system will benefit patients, free up clinician time, and help us to bust the Covid backlogs.\u201d The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the plan, which will use \u00a32bn of money earmarked for NHS digitisation in the spending review, is intended to \u201csave billions in taxpayers\u2019 money while also promoting economic growth and private investment\u201d. The department said more than 280,000 people already used remote monitoring at home and in care homes for long-term conditions in the last year, resulting in improved outcomes, with problems picked up earlier, shorter stays in hospital, and fewer admissions. By September 2024, patients will be able to complete hospital pre-assessment checks from home. The plan builds on the NHS data strategy, announced by Javid this month, which aims to have three-quarters of the adult population in England registered with the NHS app within the next two years. He said this would give them \u201cmore control of their own care at home, picking up problems sooner and seeking help earlier\u201d. Under the latest plan, care teams will also be able to better share information through joined-up digital health and social care records. Fewer than half (45%) of social care providers use a digital social care record, and 23% of care home staff cannot access the internet consistently at work, according to the DHSC. Dr Timothy Ferris, national director of transformation at NHS England and NHS Improvement, said the plan \u201csets out an ambitious vision for a future where the NHS puts more power and information at patients\u2019 fingertips, and staff have the tools they need to deliver better and more joined-up services for those who need them\u201d. Layla McCay, director of policy at NHS Confederation, said the plan was \u201can important step\u201d to enable vital data to be shared more widely, but warned that the rollout \u201cwill be challenging and must be done carefully not to exacerbate inequality\u201d, including by investing in IT infrastructure and NHS workforce recruitment and retention. A national digital workforce strategy is to be developed, which will create 10,500 more positions in the data and tech workforce as part of several measures aimed at strengthening workers\u2019 skills and making the NHS an attractive place to work for digital professionals. How to use the digital technology will also be included in university curriculums in degrees that train future NHS staff, while accessible training will be provided to adult social care workers. Dr Pritesh Mistry, digital fellow at the King\u2019s Fund, said the biggest risk to the government\u2019s vision was the \u201clack of capacity among the health and care workforce\u201d. He added: \u201cNHS and social care staff are already under intense pressure and many will wonder where they will find the time needed to learn the new skills to use technologies, change organisational culture to work better with tech innovators, and avoid the pitfall of implementing new tech without adequately consulting the staff and patients who will use it.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-26T17:30:50Z",
            "content": "The average distance to the nearest doctor is more than 9km in some metropolitan areas, according to new data from the Australian Urban Observatory. Often found on city fringes, these areas also tend to have worse access to other social infrastructure, such as education, transport, community and sporting facilities, and emergency services. Associate Prof Melanie Davern, the director of the Australian Urban Observatory, says the issue is at least partly to do with how we plan our cities. \u201cWe don\u2019t have planners working with the health system \u2013 this is the major problem. We don\u2019t think about an urban system. We just have a planning department, a health department and a transport department. But they are not really connected,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause [planning is] population based, [those outer areas] are never going to see improved access to things like GPs.\u201d Tamborine Mountain lies to the south of Brisbane and its residents have an average distance to a doctor of almost 8km. It scores 0 out of 16 on the Urban Observatory\u2019s \u201csocial infrastructure index\u201d, which counts many of the services above. You can move and hover over the map below to explore the average distance to the nearest GP clinic in Australia\u2019s metropolitan areas. \u201cWe plan everything based on population,\u201d Davern says. Only once an area hits a certain population size will some services start to be provided. For growth areas, that can mean critical social infrastructure like healthcare lagging far behind the population growth, while for other areas it might never arrive. \u201cIt fits the same pattern as all social infrastructures we have across the country,\u201d Davern says. \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly important is that if you have people that are more disadvantaged, then they are more likely to have health concerns. And we are making it harder for those people to get to a doctor and we are making them drive further, which reinforces the health inequities we already have.\u201d Health services tend to cluster in areas of high activity. So in the centre of Brisbane or the Gold Coast the average distance to a GP clinic might be only a few hundred metres, but in some areas the distance can be many multiples of that. \u201cIf you could afford it, would you move closer in? It\u2019s affordability that really pushes people to growth areas. So you\u2019ve got less money, you\u2019re in a new suburb, you have to drive to everything because the population is smaller and less dense.\u201d Analysis of other data from the Urban Observatory shows that transport access and walkability is correlated with access to these other services. \u201cAs social infrastructure becomes fewer and fewer, so does transport,\u201d says Davern. \u201cSo we are just enforcing car dependency.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-24T16:30:39Z",
            "content": "Doctors and pro-choice activists have condemned the overturning of Roe v Wade, describing it as an \u201cunconscionable attack\u201d that will leave the supreme court justices with \u201cblood on their hands\u201d and cause a global chilling effect on women\u2019s rights. In a statement signed by more than 100 global healthcare organisations, including the UK\u2019s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), medics said the US supreme court\u2019s move was \u201ca catastrophic blow\u201d to millions. The statement, also signed by the RCOG\u2019s faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare, warned: \u201cIt is a decision that will cost lives for years to come.\u201d Dr Edward Morris, president of the RCOG, said: \u201cThis decision is an unconscionable attack on the health and rights of women and girls in the United States \u2026 It is shocking to think that the future of so many women and girls has been dictated by politics rather than evidence-based opinion.\u201d Dr Ranee Thakar, president-elect of the RCOG, urged governments to support healthcare workers to provide women with safe abortions, rather than impose greater legal restraints. \u201cThe chilling effect of the ruling will undoubtedly be felt around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call on governments to create and protect legal and regulatory environments that support healthcare professionals to provide access to safe and affordable abortion care.\u201d Ever since it became clear in May that the supreme court was preparing to strike down the 1973 legislation that effectively legalised abortion, pro-choice campaigners and medics have been warning that the ripple effect would be felt internationally \u2013 particularly in countries where abortion rights are fragile. Concern is now mounting that the decision could embolden the anti-choice movement, increase pressure on healthcare workers performing abortions, and threaten hard-won gains in countries where stigma around terminations is still rampant. Activists have said they are particularly worried about the impact in Central America, a region with a number of total abortion bans, and sub-Saharan Africa. But the message the court\u2019s opinion sends \u2013 that legalising abortion had been \u201cegregiously wrong from the start\u201d \u2013 could find echoes almost everywhere, not least in the European anomalies Poland and Malta. \u201cThe fallout from this calculated decision will also reverberate worldwide, emboldening other anti-abortion, anti-woman and anti-gender movements and impacting other reproductive freedoms,\u201d said Dr Alvaro Bermejo, director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). \u201cThe justices who put their personal beliefs ahead of American will, precedent and law will soon have blood on their hands, and we are devastated for the millions of people who will suffer from this cruel judgment.\u201d Banchiamlack Dessalegn, MSI\u2019s Africa director, said the decision could undermine the pro-choice movement\u2019s efforts in countries across the continent. She said: \u201cI am so proud of the steps the government in Ethiopia has taken to expand access to abortion over the last two decades; action that has saved countless lives and empowered women to take control of their futures. \u201cBoth here and across Africa, US-linked groups have been trying for years to roll back this progress, with well-funded misinformation campaigns and by lobbying governments to restrict access. But we vow to protect choice. We are not going back.\u201d In a statement that did not directly refer to the supreme court decision, UNFPA, the UN\u2019s sexual and reproductive health agency, said it feared in general that if women faced greater barriers to getting terminations, more unsafe abortions would occur, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. \u201cAlmost all unsafe abortions currently occur in developing countries, and UNFPA fears that more unsafe abortions will occur around the world if access to abortion becomes more restricted. Decisions reversing progress gained have a wider impact on the rights and choices of women and adolescents everywhere,\u201d it said. Dr Jeanne Conry, president of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), said the impact of the decision would be \u201cfelt on a global scale.\u201d \u201cThis decision undermines our commitment to advancing the rights of women and girls around the world, and is a threat to gender equality and the bodily autonomy of millions. The United States now is out of step with the rest of the world, and fails to take into account the overwhelming global medical evidence that supports abortion as essential health care,\u201d she said. Sarah Shaw, the head of advocacy at MSI Reproductive Choices, said history had already shown that decisions made in Washington DC \u2013 such as the imposition of the global gag rule \u2013 could \u201chave an impact far beyond [US] borders\u201d. Shaw added: \u201cBut while this vote may embolden the anti-choice movement around the world, it has also motivated the global community to reassert the right to choose. \u201cTo anyone who wants to deny someone\u2019s right to make decisions about what is right for their body and their future, our message is \u2026 We will never stop working towards a world where everyone, everywhere has the right to choose, and this attack only strengthens our resolve.\u201d Echoing her defiant spirit, Sara Pantuliano, chief executive of the ODI global affairs thinktank, wrote on Twitter: \u201cMake no mistake, this ruling is a threat to everyone, everywhere. Solidarity with those in the US who will be faced with unimaginable decisions following this ruling, as they seek to protect their bodily autonomy. \u201cLet this be the fire to ignite our collective determination to prevent further backsliding. We must fight to ensure this trend does not gain any further momentum. We must draw a line by dealing in deeds not words.\u201d The decision sparked fury among many politicians in Britain, where Diana Johnson, Labour MP and chair of the all-party parliamentary group on sexual and reproductive health, urged Boris Johnson\u2019s government \u201cto stand in support of women in the US and condemn this decision\u201d. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, tweeted: \u201cTo every one of our American sisters, we are with you. We will not rest until your rights are restored as your fight is our fight. They won\u2019t stop trying to control women and we won\u2019t stop fighting for their freedom everywhere. None of us should live under his eye.\u201d"

            "content": "The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has hit back at private hospital operators after the sector accused the state government of excluding their staff from prospective $3,000 bonus payments for healthcare workers. On Monday, Andrews stressed that the state government did not employ private healthcare staff and said some for-profit providers had done \u201cparticularly well\u201d in recent years. \u201cWe don\u2019t do their enterprise bargaining so we\u2019re not doing the paying of their wages,\u201d he sad. \u201cThey [private hospitals] should spend a little bit more time rewarding their staff appropriately rather than calling upon others to do it.\u201d \u201cThey might want to get on with \u2026 nurse-to-patient ratios as well while they\u2019re at it, [those] are not in the private system,\u201d he said, referring to a mandated ratio of one nurse to every four patients in Victoria\u2019s public health system that was legislated in 2015. The Age reported on Sunday that private healthcare operators Ramsay Health Care, Epworth HealthCare and St John of God had pressed the government on why their workers had been snubbed by the scheme, claiming they were blindsided by the announcement. A Ramsay Health Care spokesperson said the $3,000 payments could lure private healthcare workers into the public system. \u201cThe Victorian government will be relying on the goodwill of private health workers to provide this ongoing assistance,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWithout private sector support, the system does not function.\u201d Catholic provider St John of God Health Care declined to comment. Epworth HealthCare, which is not-for-profit, did not respond to questions. The Victorian government announced the payments last week in a bid to retain and entice back healthcare workers during the challenging winter period. It came just days after New South Wales announced $3,000 \u201cappreciation\u201d payments for the state\u2019s public healthcare workers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The $3,000 payments \u2013 to be made in two instalments \u2013 are for full-time staff working in Victoria\u2019s public hospitals and ambulance services like cleaners, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals. To receive the full payment, workers need to be employed by a public health service by 1 July and still be employed on 30 September. Those who start between 1 July and 30 September will be eligible for a pro rata payment, as will casual and part-time staff, based on how many hours they work. The payments will be made in two rounds \u2013 the first on 15 August, the second at the end of September The Victorian government\u2019s $353m package also included free meals to staff who work overnight shifts. Victoria and NSW have both outlined plans to recruit extra healthcare workers to tackle skilled visa approval delays plaguing a range of sectors, including healthcare. The two states have also pushed for an overhaul of federal health funding. Prior to the election, premiers in both Labor and Liberal-led states \u2013 backed by the Australian Medical Association \u2013 had urged the Morrison government to abolish its 6.5% annual growth cap on hospital funding and lift its contribution from 45% to 50%. The AMA has estimated that a 50-50 public hospital funding split and the removal of the cap \u2013 introduced by the Turnbull government in 2017 \u2013 would cost the commonwealth $20.5bn across four years. A Covid funding deal that provided additional commonwealth investment for Covid-related health costs is also due to expire in September. Andrews has argued this should be extended, warning the effects of the pandemic will not end after winter."

            "content": "The delayed public inquiry into the UK\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has been launched after Boris Johnson accepted calls to widen the terms of reference to consider its unequal impact on minority-ethnic people, on children and on mental health. The inquiry chair, Heather Hallett, and her team of 12 QCs have begun work under the terms of the Inquiries Act, which makes it an offence to destroy or tamper with evidence. She will be joined by two panellists to be appointed by Johnson, although she had argued for presiding alone. The launch of what is expected to be one of the largest public inquiries conducted in the UK comes days after campaigners for the bereaved threatened legal action against the government over the delay to the prime minister\u2019s commitment to set the inquiry up in spring 2022. \u201cToday is a special day for thousands of bereaved families from all corners of the country,\u201d said Hannah Brady, a spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign. \u201cFinally we can begin the process of learning lessons from the awful suffering we\u2019ve endured so that we can move forward with our lives and protect others in the future.\u201d The inquiry will \u201cexamine, consider and report on preparations and the response to the pandemic in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland\u201d and it begins as the number of UK fatalities with Covid on their death certificate approaches 200,000. In an apparent warning to people and organisations required to submit evidence and witnesses, which could include Johnson, cabinet ministers and senior civil servants, Lady Hallett said: \u201cI shall not tolerate any attempt to mislead the inquiry, to undermine its integrity or its independence.\u201d The terms of reference published by the Cabinet Office on Tuesday cover 37 topics divided into three areas: the public health response across the whole of the UK; the response of the health and care sector across the UK; and the economic response to the pandemic and its impact, including governmentinterventions. The topics likely to prove most controversial include the use of lockdowns, which could examine the effect of rule breaking in Downing Street; the test-and-trace system; infection control in care homes, which the high court has already ruled was unlawful and \u201cirrational\u201d; the procurement and distribution of PPE; and the use of do-not-resuscitate notices. In a letter to Hallett, Johnson described the terms of reference as \u201cundoubtedly \u2026 broad and challenging\u201d. The inquiry will travel around the UK to take evidence, and Hallett said it would listen to people who had suffered during the pandemic and felt they had been ignored. It would produce a series of interim reports \u201cto reduce or prevent the suffering and hardship in any future pandemic\u201d, she said. Evidence hearings are expected to begin in 2023 and Hallett has asked for patience as she and team try to meet what she described as an ambitious timetable. Downing Street agreed the inquiry should examine disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic on different categories of people, including those relating to legal \u201cprotected characteristics\u201d under equality laws which means the impact of poverty as well as race, religion and gender could be examined. It will not consider individual cases of harm or death in detail, but instead will launch a \u201clistening project\u201d to gather accounts from those who were bereaved to \u201cinform its understanding\u201d of the pandemic\u2019s impact, the response and the lessons to be learned."

More than half of the families of young children say they need more information on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for this age group. On top of the questions families have about vaccines, there may also be significant access issues in this younger age group. When vaccines for five- to 11-year-olds rolled out, Kates got an email from her son\u2019s school about the vaccination clinics they were holding. But younger kids may not be in school, and even if they are, pre-schools and daycares probably won\u2019t hold similar clinics. That makes it harder to schedule a vaccination \u2013 and, for families that haven\u2019t followed the vaccine news closely, they may not know the vaccines are available until someone, like a pediatrician or family doctor, offers them. \u201cIt may be the case that a parent isn\u2019t even going to encounter an offer for it until they go to a routine visit,\u201d Kates said. That means it\u2019s important for \u201ctrusted messengers\u201d like pediatricians, family doctors and local public health officials to get the word out quickly, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic here. It really is the hard work of letting people know, and then educating them about how safe these are.\u201d More than 4m doses of the under-fives vaccine have been delivered to about 13,000 sites in the US, the White House coronavirus coordinator, Ashish Jha, said on Thursday. The federal government plans to deliver a total of 10m doses. Nearly 20 million children in the US are under the age of five. More than 20,000 children in this age group have been hospitalized, and more than half \u2013 63% \u2013 of the young children hospitalized during the first Omicron wave had no underlying conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict which young children are going to develop severe disease and need to be hospitalized,\u201d said Kristina Bryant, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Children\u2019s hospital in Louisville and professor of pediatrics at the University of Louisville. And 442 children under five have died from Covid since January 2020. \u201cSome parents just have not yet heard the message that Covid-19 can be a serious illness in young kids,\u201d Bryant said. An estimated three in four American children have recovered from Covid at least once. But new variants are increasingly able to overcome immunity from prior infection \u2013 and \u201cthere\u2019s no guarantee that the second time will be mild,\u201d Bryant said. Vaccination can help shore up protection, especially against severe illness and death. Families may also not understand how much data officials have on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. \u201cThey also don\u2019t realize that there have been so many millions of these vaccines administered, with such good safety results \u2013 that it\u2019s really incredibly safe,\u201d Kates said. Some parents are also hesitant because of the long-delayed timeline on vaccines for America\u2019s youngest. The independent vaccine advisers for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) planned to meet in February to discuss trial data, before the meeting was abruptly canceled. \u201cAnything that creates any level of uncertainty or anxiety or questioning can backfire in this environment,\u201d Kates said \u201cParents want to protect our children as much as possible,\u201d she said. When it comes to Covid, they need to know the risks of infection and the benefits of vaccination \u2013 which means answering their questions and offering reliable information to battle the wealth of misinformation they encounter. \u201cIt comes down to the trusted messengers and as many access points as you can provide,\u201d Kates said, to help make vaccination quick and easy. \u201cParents who have questions should definitely work with their pediatricians or primary care providers to get those questions answered. As pediatric clinicians, we need to meet those families where they are,\u201d Bryant said. A recommendation from a pediatrician or trusted primary care provider is one of the most important factors in parents\u2019 decision to immunize their child against a variety of diseases, she said. \u201cPediatricians and other primary care providers need to be ready to speak about the vaccines and make a strong recommendation.\u201d Having two options on vaccines for children now could help with some of the hesitations and access issues that some parents have. Pfizer is a lower dose, which means that maybe parents who are concerned about side-effects might go for that one, while Moderna is only the two doses for now, which may be helpful for parents or guardians taking time off work or finding transportation \u2013 both of which can be important equity issues in getting vaccinated. It\u2019s important to move as quickly as possible, the experts said. The vaccines offer protection two weeks after the last dose in the series \u2013 which is after dose 2 for Moderna and dose 3 for Pfizer among this age group. \u201cIf families wait until there\u2019s a lot of Covid in their communities, or they say, \u2018I\u2019ll wait until school starts,\u2019 well, then their child is not going to be protected at that time, because immunity is not immediate,\u201d Bryant said. Vaccinating children now could help prevent a surge in fall or winter, particularly as kids head back to school in a few weeks. Dr Bhattacharyya, for his part, was relieved that his son will soon be protected by vaccines. His son was thrilled, too \u2013 especially when they celebrated with ice-cream."

            "content": "Wimbledon\u2019s Covid-19 protocols are under review after Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw from the championships on the morning of his first-round match following a positive test for Covid-19. The Italian was the second player in the men\u2019s draw to pull out in less than 24 hours after a positive test and the withdrawals prompted the women\u2019s French No 1, Aliz\u00e9 Cornet, to claim the virus was widespread in the locker room at Roland Garros, with players maintaining a code of silence. Berrettini, the No 8 seed, was one of the biggest contenders for the title after reaching the final last year. After being out for nearly three months following surgery on his finger, the Italian returned at the beginning of the grass season and immediately won nine matches in a row, with titles in Stuttgart and Queen\u2019s Club. Wimbledon\u2019s review comes after the No 14 seed, Marin Cilic, another former finalist and a semi-finalist at the French Open this month, also withdrew on Monday having tested positive for Covid-19, stoking fears of an outbreak among the players. While Cilic trained with the men\u2019s defending champion, Novak Djokovic, in the days before the tournament, Berrettini trained with the No 2 seed, Rafael Nadal. Wimbledon was conducted last year under significant Covid protocols, but this year the championships have returned to normal conditions. There are no preventative protocols for players, with the All England Club following UK government guidance. After the recent outbreak the All England Club will review its current measureson Tuesday. \u201cAs a major event we have and continue to work in conjunction with the UK Public Health Security Agency and our local authority,\u201d a spokesperson for the All England Club said on Tuesday. \u201cWe have maintained enhanced cleaning and hand sanitising operations, and offer full medical support for anyone feeling unwell. We are following UK guidance around assessment and isolation of any potential infectious disease. Our player medical team also continue to wear face masks for any consultation.\u201d After her straight-sets win against Yulia Putintseva on Tuesday, Cornet was asked about these recent developments and she said Covid was also present in the locker room at the French Open, referencing the withdrawal of Barbora Krejcikova after she tested positive. \u201cAt Roland Garros there was an epidemic of Covid-19 and nobody talked about it. In the locker room, everyone had it and we said nothing,\u201d said Cornet. Berrettini had been due to play Cristian Gar\u00edn in the opening round and he was expected to make another deep run considering his form and his comfort on the surface. In a statement on Instagram, Berrettini conveyed his disappointment. \u201cI am heartbroken to announce that I need to withdraw from @wimbledon due to a positive Covid-19 test result. I have had flu symptoms and been isolating the last few days. Despite symptoms not being severe, I decided it was important to take another test this morning to protect the health and safety of my fellow competitors and everyone else involved in the tournament,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have no words to describe the extreme disappointed I feel. The dream is over for this year, but I will be back stronger.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-09T17:30:37Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s peak medical body is calling for Anthony Albanese to revive national cabinet\u2019s focus on the Covid-19 pandemic, warning that this winter will be \u201cthe worst it has ever been\u201d for the country\u2019s overburdened health network. Facing a deadly flu season along with the ongoing spread of Covid, the Australian Medical Association says that the country\u2019s hospital system is already struggling to cope with surging demand as a result of workforce shortages. The AMA\u2019s president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said next Friday\u2019s meeting of state and territory leaders \u2013 the first since Albanese was sworn in as prime minister \u2013 needed to come up with a new Covid strategy to try to ease the burden over winter, after the issue had largely been ignored during the election campaign. \u201cThat needs to change. I want to get back to a situation where we have a considered, coordinated and preferably nationally consistent response to the pandemic,\u201d Khorshid told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe pandemic is not over and our health system is struggling, partly due to the ongoing effect of the pandemic. \u201cIt is the worst it has ever been \u2026 and it will be worse [than last winter] because we will have flu and Covid in every state and territory,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have also got the cumulative effect of ongoing burnout and stress at the frontend for those workers who\u2019ve been doing the heavy lifting [in] hospitals and in primary care. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t actually fixed any of the problems, so there\u2019s no extra capacity, there\u2019s no extra staff. Nothing had been done to help the system to cope with this foreseeable increase in demand.\u201d Khorshid said national cabinet needed to discuss how to lift the rate of third-dose vaccinations, consider mask-wearing guidelines, refocus on workforce strategies and consider a national drive to vaccinate against the flu, which is being described as a looming disaster for the health sector. Booster rates for third Covid vaccination doses are sitting at about 72% nationally, and are lowest in Queensland (63%) and NSW (67%). Only about 30% of the population has received a flu vaccination. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The AMA is also supporting state calls to extend a national funding agreement for hospitals that sets the commonwealth\u2019s share of funding at 50% \u2013 the current agreement is due to expire in September. \u201cThe impact of the Covid pandemic is absolutely still here,\u201d Khorshid said, \u201cand it\u2019s going to be even worse as we go through winter, so our health system needs that extra support that\u2019s been provided by the commonwealth and that should be extended.\u201d He said that not only was the increase in funding \u201ccritical\u201d to maintain health services, but the federal government also needed to scrap the 6.5% cap on spending growth as wage rises and inflation made the cap impossible to meet and would result in real cuts to frontline care. All states and territories are pushing for the health agreement to be extended, but Labor remained quiet on the commitment during the election campaign. Albanese said he would wait until after the election to discuss the issue with state and territory leaders. In the final days of the campaign, Albanese also flagged that he wanted to see a new national Covid strategy aimed at reducing the impact of the disease on the community, with a focus on a new education campaign. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has said he and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, would be asking national cabinet to look at ways to better coordinate demand between the state-run hospital network and federally funded primary healthcare. Amid the concern about staff shortages, Khorshid said incentives such as the Victorian government\u2019s recently announced $3,000 retention bonus would increase wages in the sector and add to hospital costs as states began competing for the same workers. The Health Services Union\u2019s national secretary, Gerard Hayes, said state and territory leaders needed to do more to address workforce issues and called for the new government to address the funding needs for health and aged care. \u201cThe pandemic has shown us that this was a pandemic of the workforce,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWe need to be able to attract and retain the best people and at the moment with the [federal] cap, we are not able to do that, so the government really needs to buy in and make that contribution.\u201d Without urgent reform, Khorshid said the country was facing a perfect storm over winter that would see patients dying unnecessarily as hospitals were unable to meet demand. \u201c[Without change] it means further burnout, carnage, chaos in the emergency departments, with patients receiving inadequate care or care that is delayed,\u201d Khorshid said. \u201cWe know that for a whole series of conditions, delays can mean the difference between complete recovery and permanent disability, or the difference between living and dying. \u201cSo we will see deaths that are avoidable, we will see injury that is avoidable. We\u2019re already seeing that right now and we know that\u2019s going to get worse through the winter.\u201d"

            "content": "Trained dogs may be able to detect Covid-19 more effectively than nasal swab PCR tests, according to new research. A study published on Wednesday by the peer-reviewed Plos One journal found that canines were able to better detect the presence of Covid than PCR antigenic tests in both symptomatic and asymptomatic people. In the study, trained dogs were able to detect Covid in 97% of symptomatic cases and nearly 100% of asymptomatic cases. \u201cThe dog doesn\u2019t lie,\u201d Dominique Grandjean, a professor at the Alfort National Veterinary School in France and a study author, told Science News, noting that different errors can occur with PCR tests. The study featured 335 participants from Covid screening centers in Paris. Of the participants, 109 were positive with Covid, including 31 who were asymptomatic. The detection dogs, provided by French fire stations and the United Arab Emirates, received three to six weeks of training, depending on if a dog was previously trained for odor detection. The dogs sniffed samples of human sweat placed in an olfaction cone. If a dog detected Covid, it sat down in front of the cone. Ultimately, the trained dogs were more sensitive to positive cases. Nasal PCR tests were better able to better detect negative cases. In two false positive cases, dogs falsely identified other coronavirus respiratory illness strains that were not Covid. While there have been previous studies on the capability of dogs to detect Covid, this is believed to be the first to compare the accuracy of dogs to antigenic tests. A study published in May by researchers in the UK found that trained dogs could detect Covid with an accuracy of 82% to 94%, NBC News reported. A 2021 study in Florida found that dogs had a 73% to 93% accuracy rate after a month of training. The authors of the French study said more dogs could soon be used to detect Covid in mass screening settings including airports. PCR tests can take days to deliver a result. The trained dogs were able to analyze 20 samples in just 15 seconds, Grandjean told NBC. Using dogs for Covid testing could also benefit those who have trouble tolerating nasal swabs, such as patients with Alzheimer\u2019s, the authors said. Experts not affiliated with the study warn that translating its positive results into everyday use could prove difficult. \u201cThe ideal \u2013 and I would consider it the Holy Grail \u2013 is that the dog is just standing there, a person walks by, and they say, \u2018Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no,\u2019\u201d Dr Cynthia Otto, director of the Penn Vet Working Dog Center at the University of Pennsylvania, told NBC. \u201cThat eventually could be done, but making sure it\u2019s done with all the proper controls and quality assurances and safety \u2013 it\u2019s a big step. I haven\u2019t seen anyone who has proposed how to make that transition in a way that\u2019s scientific and safe.\u201d Dogs are starting to be used at mass testing sites. In September 2021, Miami international airport was the first US airport to deploy Covid dogs. Airports in the UAE, Finland and other countries use dogs to sniff out Covid. Schools in Massachusetts and Hawaii have also employed dogs to test students."

            "content": "The pound has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar since the onset of the Covid pandemic amid growing concern over the strength of the British economy. Sterling dropped by more than a cent against the dollar to trade below $1.20 on foreign exchange markets for the first time since March 2020, as City traders reacted to mixed figures from the jobs market and the prospect of a fresh referendum on Scottish independence. The currency also lost ground as the dollar strengthened to a fresh two-decade high in anticipation of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates on Wednesday to tackle soaring inflation, possibly by as much as 0.75 percentage points. The Fed last raised rates by this amount in 1994. Versus the euro, the pound fell more than 1% to about 86.81p, its lowest level since May last year. Analysts said sterling was under pressure from a stronger dollar after unexpectedly high US inflation figures fuelled expectations for more aggressive rate hikes from the American central bank. With forecast for the UK to fall close to the bottom of global growth league tables next year, the Bank of England could be forced to take a more cautious approach when setting rates on Thursday despite inflation surging to the highest level since the early 1980s. Threadneedle Street is expected to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, lifting its base rate to 1.25%. The latest drop in the currency comes after the UK unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 3.8% in the three months to April, up from 3.7% in March. City economists had forecast a decline to 3.6%. Against a backdrop of negative developments for the strength of the pound, analysts said Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s announcement on Tuesday that she was preparing for a new Scottish independence referendum was also weighing on the currency. Scotland\u2019s first minister said on Tuesday she would update Holyrood on her plans \u201cvery soon indeed\u201d.

            "date": "2022-06-01T07:00:10Z",
            "content": "More than two years on from the realisation that we are dealing with a novel pandemic, we are still nervously wondering what comes next. In the UK, Covid infection rates appear to have fallen to their lowest level since the summer of 2021, as has the number of deaths the virus is causing, but we know that new variants are still likely to emerge. So when will the end of this pandemic come, and what might it look like? This is a very difficult question, because we won\u2019t know we have passed the end of the pandemic until some time has elapsed. The expectation is that eventually the disease will reach endemic levels, meaning immunity in the population will balance out the reproduction of the virus, resulting in a stable level of infection year on year. That stability could include regular, repeatable fluctuations such as seasonality, but we won\u2019t know that stability has been achieved unless the same pattern of infections is observed for more than one consecutive year. There are two big unknowns in attempting to determine how soon the end of the pandemic may arrive and what it might look like. The first is: how durable will our immunity be, particularly against severe disease but also against infection? And the second is: how fast will the Sars-CoV-2 virus evolve, in particular with respect to overcoming our immune defences? To answer these questions, we need to look at the lessons the pandemic has taught us so far. The year of the Sars-CoV-2 virus was very much 2020, when it caused high levels of mortality and disease, and changed lives around the world. We saw a virus transmit into humans and began to observe some evolution, but thanks to the relatively slow rate of evolution of Sars-CoV-2 compared with other RNA viruses, we did not observe much change beyond the immediate public health impact until the very end of the year, with the emergence initially of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants. Looking back, 2021 appears to have been the year of the variant. The Alpha variant rapidly displaced the initial strain of the virus: it was more transmissible and more likely to cause severe disease and death, necessitating far more robust public health responses including the reimposition of restrictions in the UK and elsewhere. The degree of adaptation was staggering; the Alpha variant was more than 50% more transmissible in humans compared with the original virus, a leap of adaptation that has never previously been observed in real time. The Beta and Gamma variants also displayed a degree of immune escape, a brief glimpse into the possibility that these viruses might be able to, at least in part, evade defences we had built against previous forms of the virus, whether by infection or vaccination. And of course, these variants were succeeded by the Delta variant, which was about 50% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, and also more severe, bringing another wave of disease and devastation. Towards the end of 2021 we were hit by another variant, Omicron, which brought its own unique challenges and lessons in viral evolution. Omicron is highly evasive of the antibodies that vaccination and prior infection confer, and thereby can breach our immune defences. Fortunately, protection against hospitalisation and death is not eroded to the same extent, though protection against severe disease has declined. And of course, Omicron is capable of reinfecting individuals who have previously been exposed to other forms of the virus. The idea that viral infection is a \u201cone and done\u201d risk \u2013 that you can get it over with by being infected \u2013 has well and truly been dispelled by Omicron. Thus, if 2021 was the year of the variant and the vaccine, 2022 so far appears to be the year of reinfection. We don\u2019t yet know how severe reinfections will be going forward \u2013 presumably there will be some decline on average between primary infections and reinfections. However, as immunity wanes and the virus keeps evolving and changing, will the gap in severity between secondary and primary infections be eroded, increasing levels of mortality? We also don\u2019t know to what extent secondary infections bring reduced risks of morbidity, such as long Covid. And we don\u2019t know how the importance of reinfections varies across risk groups. We will almost certainly see the further erosion of immune protection as the virus continues to evolve, and the need to redouble vaccination campaigns as well as research and development is as pressing as it ever has been \u2013 we cannot take the earlier success of vaccines for granted. We may know how the end of the pandemic might occur in theory, and the patterns to look out for to determine whether we are approaching endemicity. What is a lot less clear is what our future with this virus will look like when Covid is no longer at pandemic levels. For now, we are experiencing multiple waves per year, each with a substantial burden of disease and death. Will endemicity continue to involve multiple waves of infection, with potentially high severity each year? How frequently will variants like Omicron, capable of partial breaching our immune defences, arise, and will this eventually include variants that can escape the protection that vaccines induce, at least in part, against hospitalisation and death? The pandemic will not end this year, but the behaviour of this virus in highly vaccinated countries across the world may offer a glimpse of what the endpoint may look like: low risk of severe disease from any given infection, a better understanding of the cumulative disease toll of reinfections, an idea of the likelihood of further Omicron-like immune escape events and whether disease severity is further restored, and data available to guide further vaccination strategies.

It is a curation of scenes and images that straddles the concepts of the essay movie, the road movie and \u2013 that emerging genre \u2013 the lockdown movie. Perside Rodrigues portrays a young woman of colour who is making a kind of mythic or hallucinatory journey, a dreamed quest through a British landscape from north to south, in which she often seems like the only person left alive, reflecting on her experience of empire, identity and racism. It is set in a notional future time of pandemic (and filmed during the real pandemic lockdown) and shows this figure mostly alone in an eerily untenanted world, sometimes carrying or wearing a weird gas mask. Achiampong recently told the Guardian that he had in fact made these masks for his own family during lockdown. There is one face-to-face encounter: the Wayfinder meets Britain\u2019s first black female Olympic athlete, the sprinter Anita Neil, who speaks powerfully and positively about her feelings of pride in being able to represent her country and community in a time when the establishment were ungenerous, to say the least, to someone from her background. The Wayfinder walks past Hadrian\u2019s Wall, into E Pellicci\u2019s caf\u00e9 in east London, through the Turner wing of the National Gallery where she impassively looks at pictures that celebrate British naval and imperial adventure, before ending up at Margate, whose faded glamour has often been an inspiration for British film-makers. Wayfinder is a slightly static work, though intentionally so, with some striking images of solitude and alienation. \u2022 Wayfinder is released on 1 July in cinemas."

            "date": "2022-06-04T21:52:58Z",
            "content": "Bilderberg is back with a vengeance. After a pandemic gap of two years, the elite global summit is being rebooted in a security-drenched hotel in Washington DC, with a high-powered guest list that includes the heads of Nato, the CIA, GCHQ, the US national security council, two European prime ministers, a healthy sprinkle of tech billionaires, and Henry Kissinger. What a difference those two years have made. The western world order, which the Bilderberg group has been quietly nudging into shape for the best part of 70 years, is in all kinds of flux. Back in 2019, the last time Bilderberg met in the flesh, the conference kicked off with the optimistic topics \u201cA Stable Strategic Order\u201d and \u201cWhat Next For Europe?\u201d This year however, the agenda reeks of chaos and crisis. Top of the schedule is the blandly terrifying item \u201cGlobal Realignments\u201d, followed by \u201cNato Challenges\u201d, the biggest of which is obviously Ukraine. To be sure, the Washington conference is a high-level council of war, headlined by the secretary general of Nato, Bilderberg veteran Jens Stoltenberg. He\u2019s joined at the luxurious Mandarin Oriental hotel by the Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, and the CEO of Naftogaz, the state-owned Ukrainian oil and gas company. They\u2019ll be clinking bespoke cocktails in the Empress lounge with some of the allied war effort\u2019s leading lights, among them Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s half-Ukrainian deputy prime minister. The summit is heaving with experts in Russia and Ukraine, including the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, Celeste Wallander, and ex-deputy national security adviser Nadia Schadlow, who has a seat on the elite steering committee of Bilderberg. The conference room is rigged up with video screens for shy dignitaries to make a virtual attendance, and it\u2019s highly likely that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will Zoom in for a T-shirted contribution to the talks. Just a few days beforehand, Zelenskiy met with a Bilderberg and US intelligence representative Alex Karp, who runs Palantir, the infamous CIA-funded surveillance and data analysis company. Palantir, which was set up by billionaire Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel, has agreed to give \u201cdigital support\u201d to the Ukrainian army, according to a tweet by the country\u2019s deputy prime minister. The participant list is rife with military advisers, one of which is a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and some hefty cogs from the Washington war machine. Among the heftiest is James Baker, head of the ominous sounding office of net assessment. Bilderberg is sometimes dismissed as a talking shop or crazed imagining of conspiracy theorists. But in reality it is a major diplomatic summit, attended this year as ever by extremely senior transatlantic politicians, from the US commerce secretary to the president of the European Council. Many consider it an older, less flashy Davos, staged annually by the World Economic Fund. The two events have a good bit in common: namely, three WEF trustees at this year\u2019s conference, and Klaus Schwab, the grisly head of Davos, is a former member of Bilderberg\u2019s steering committee. His \u201cGreat Reset\u201d looms large over the Washington conference, with \u201cDisruption of the Global Financial System\u201d at the heart of the agenda. The conference troubles some ethicists, with politicians thrashing out an \u201cEnergy Security and Sustainability\u201d talk with the CEOs of oil giants BP, Shell and Total. There\u2019s also \u201cPost Pandemic Health\u201d with the CEOs of Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, who are locked away for days with Wall Street investors and no press scrutiny. Bilderberg gets scant coverage partly because of its connections to the transatlantic intelligence community. Formed in the mid-1950s as a joint project of British and US intelligence, the conference has kept its cards so close to its chest that the world\u2019s press has given up trying to get a glimpse of them. This year\u2019s conference lineup, led by the CIA head, William Burns, reflects those roots. Burns is a former US ambassador to Russia and was elected to Bilderberg\u2019s steering committee just a few months before Joe Biden gave him the job, whereupon he discreetly resigned his seat. Four other active intelligence chiefs are attending: the head of the UK\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters; the director of France\u2019s external intelligence agency, DGSE; the leader of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; and Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. Former spy chiefs at the talks include David Petraeus (CIA) and Sir John Sawers (MI6), now a board member of Bilderberg and BP. And of course, holding court at the hotel bar will be Klaus Schwab\u2019s mentor, Henry Kissinger. Incredibly, Kissinger, 99, has been attending Bilderbergs since 1957. The prince of realpolitik has been the ideological godfather of Bilderberg for as long as anyone can remember. And he\u2019s recently co-authored a book, The Age of AI, with Bilderberg steering committee member Eric Schmidt, the former head of Google, and this year\u2019s Washington conference is noticeably rammed with AI luminaries, from Facebook\u2019s Yann LeCun to DeepMind\u2019s Demis Hassabis. Bilderberg knows that however the global realignments play out, and whatever a reset global financial system looks like, the shape of the world will be determined by big tech. And if the endgame is \u201cContinuity of Government\u201d, as the agenda suggests, that continuity will be powered by AI. Whatever billionaire ends up making the software that runs the world, Bilderberg aims to make damned sure that it has its hand on the mouse."

            "title": "Back to union-bashing: government is now openly aggressive | Larry Elliott",
            "date": "2022-06-23T11:01:11Z",
            "content": "A little more than two years ago Rishi Sunak stood outside 11 Downing Street flanked by the head of the TUC, Frances O\u2019Grady, and Carolyn Fairbairn, the boss of Britain\u2019s leading employers\u2019 group, the CBI. The photo op was meant to demonstrate a new spirit of tripartite solidarity that would help see Britain through the pandemic. The TUC had played a big part in plans for the furlough wage subsidy scheme and the chancellor was eager to show his gratitude. Announcing the government\u2019s emergency economic package to parliament, Sunak thanked the TUC for its \u201cconstructive conversations\u201d with the Treasury. That spirit of consensus has departed. The talk of a new era of \u201cbeer and sandwiches\u201d \u2013 shorthand for the days when ministers, organised labour and employers sat down to seek agreement on pressing issues \u2013 has been replaced by union bashing. Sunak now accuses the rail unions of being irresponsible for taking industrial action over pay, jobs and working conditions. The government\u2019s openly aggressive approach to the unions is relatively recent and was certainly not evident at last year\u2019s Conservative party conference, where Boris Johnson said he was \u201cpleased\u201d to see wages rising faster than before the pandemic began. There was, the prime minister added, going to be no return to the \u201csame old broken model\u201d of low wages, low skills and low productivity. The message was clear: the Conservatives were on the side of the workers. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies thinktank, says he is not surprised that relations between the government and the unions have soured. \u201cIt was always a false dawn that the furlough scheme was going to herald a new era of partnership. It was a marriage of convenience.\u201d Three things have caused the atmosphere to change. First, the government is a lot less popular than it was in March 2020, when Johnson was still enjoying a honeymoon after winning an 80-seat majority at the December 2019 election. Second, workers have emerged from the pandemic in a much stronger position than they or ministers expected. Despite fears that shutting down the economy would lead to mass unemployment, the jobless rate is back to pre-crisis levels and there are labour shortages in many industries. Even though trade union membership is half the peak level of 13.2 million reached at the end of the 1970s, employers have been forced to pay more in order to attract and keep staff. But the most important factor has been the cost of living crisis caused by the strength and duration of inflation. Desperate to find a scapegoat for the stagflation afflicting the economy, ministers have focused on unions seeking to protect the living standards of their members. Ministers have sought to make political capital out of the industrial unrest by talking about \u201cLabour\u2019s strikes\u201d. Paul Nowak, the TUC deputy general secretary who was part of the furlough talks, says: \u201cTrade unions worked closely with the government to protect jobs and keep people safe during the pandemic. Ministers could have carried on in this constructive spirit. \u201cBut they have decided to pick a fight with unions to distract people from their failings and the cost of living emergency. Instead of inflaming tensions, and pitching worker against worker, the government should be getting people around the table to find a fair resolution to this rail dispute.\u201d Nowak says government plans to bring in agency staff to replace striking workers are \u201cunworkable\u201d and will simply poison industrial relations. Some Conservatives think the government is adopting a high-risk approach. Writing on the ConservativeHome website, the former Cabinet minister David Willetts said: \u201cOverall, pay is rising less than inflation. This is not some inflationary spiral. It looks as if the adjustment to our being poorer is partly happening through pay rates. The disappointment of expectations which inflation brings is particularly felt amongst workers. They are unhappy, but they are not getting an explanation of what is going on around them which is honest about the economic pain and recognises who is bearing it.\u201d Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, says Britain is not used to high inflation, which is putting \u201chuge strain\u201d on the relationship between employees and employers. In the private sector, Bell adds, the debate is about whether workers should suffer through falling real wages or whether employers should take the strain through raising prices or cutting profits. \u201cIt is slightly more acute in the public sector because the trade-off is between pay and tax. \u201cThe government has announced big tax rises and has a red line against announcing any further increases. It wants to cut taxes and is therefore desperate not to build in any spending pressures. It is as much about taxes as about a possible wage-price spiral. \u201cBut the government needs a narrative so it makes the unions and the Labour party the problem.\u201d History suggests ministers will struggle to regain the political initiative even if workers heed the warnings about wage-price spirals and accept below-inflation settlements. Governments that preside over periods when real wages and living standards are rising tend to be popular; those that don\u2019t are often removed at the next general election. \u201cA lot of this is about politics,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cIt is the only conceivable way the government can make the cost of living crisis Labour\u2019s fault. But it is hard to make 10% inflation the fault of the RMT.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-22T14:52:01Z",
            "content": "The Boston-based biotech Moderna is to build the UK\u2019s first research and manufacturing centre dedicated to the development of mRNA vaccines against new Covid variants and other respiratory illnesses, in an effort to improve readiness for future pandemics. Under a \u00a31bn deal with the UK government, construction of the new centre \u2013 Moderna\u2019s first facility in Britain \u2013 could begin later this year and is expected to start producing the first shots in 2025. The government has committed to buying Moderna\u2019s vaccines for the next decade. The jabs are based on messenger RNA, the molecule that teaches our cells to make specific proteins that will trigger an immune response inside our bodies. Moderna developed one of two mRNA vaccines used worldwide against Covid-19, the other being produced by Germany\u2019s BioNTech and US firm Pfizer. Moderna\u2019s chief executive, St\u00e9phane Bancel, said the priority was to develop a jab combining boosters against Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms but can be serious for infants and older people. MRNA technology proved one of the fastest routes to produce an effective vaccine against Covid, and scientists are exploring its use against other diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, flu and malaria. Boris Johnson said the investment would \u201cguarantee jabs in arms against some of the toughest viruses out there, bringing us to the forefront of the fight against future threats\u201d. He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen what vaccines can do, and today\u2019s partnership brings us one step closer to finding cures for some of the most devastating diseases.\u201d The health secretary, Sajid Javid, added: \u201cOur new partnership with Moderna will cement the UK\u2019s status as a science superpower, significantly boosting the economy and creating jobs \u2013 and it has the potential to unlock the next generation of cutting-edge vaccines to fight diseases such as Covid, seasonal flu and RSV.\u201d Moderna said it planned to expand its presence in the UK through investments in R&amp;D and promised deliver a large share of its clinical trials in the UK. Separately, Moderna said it plans to apply within days to US and UK regulators for approval for its new two-strain Covid-19 vaccine. The company released data to show the vaccine, called mRNA1273.214, protects against the Omicron strains BA.4 and BA.5, which are driving a current surge of cases. The new vaccine combines 25 micrograms of the original Moderna Covid vaccine with 25 micrograms of vaccine specifically targeted at the Omicron variant. Dr Paul Burton, Moderna\u2019s chief medical officer, said the company is ready to deliver the vaccine for booster programmes as early as August. Relying on vaccines based on the original Covid strain for autumn booster programmes will result in \u201ca shorter duration of protection, less robust protection and more severe disease and hospitalisation\u201d, Burton said."

            "date": "2022-06-26T07:00:38Z",
            "content": "For some American families, it was a much-anticipated and badly needed victory: Covid vaccines for children under five began rolling out in the US last week. \u201cI\u2019ve already been waiting a year and a half since I got my first dose, and that\u2019s been intolerable,\u201d says Dr Roby Bhattacharyya, an infectious diseases doctor at Massachusetts general hospital and parent of a four-year-old who received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday. But others still have questions as America\u2019s problem with vaccine hesitancy has not gone away. Less than one in five families want to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible, while the majority say they want to \u201cwait and see\u201d first. Only 18% of parents plan to have their children under five vaccinated right away, while 38% want to see how the vaccine rollout goes, according to an April survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). Another 11% say they will only get their kids vaccinated if they are required to, while 27% say they definitely won\u2019t do it. This trend mirrors hesitancy among families with older children. Less than a third \u2013 29.6% \u2013 of children aged five to 11, and 59.8% of children 12 to 17, are fully vaccinated, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u201cMost parents are not rushing to do this,\u201d says Jen Kates, senior vice-president and director of global health and HIV policy at KFF. More than half of the families of young children say they need more information on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for this age group. On top of the questions families have about vaccines, there may also be significant access issues in this younger age group. When vaccines for five- to 11-year-olds rolled out, Kates got an email from her son\u2019s school about the vaccination clinics they were holding. But younger kids may not be in school, and even if they are, pre-schools and daycares probably won\u2019t hold similar clinics. That makes it harder to schedule a vaccination \u2013 and, for families that haven\u2019t followed the vaccine news closely, they may not know the vaccines are available until someone, like a pediatrician or family doctor, offers them. \u201cIt may be the case that a parent isn\u2019t even going to encounter an offer for it until they go to a routine visit,\u201d Kates said. That means it\u2019s important for \u201ctrusted messengers\u201d like pediatricians, family doctors and local public health officials to get the word out quickly, she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic here. It really is the hard work of letting people know, and then educating them about how safe these are.\u201d More than 4m doses of the under-fives vaccine have been delivered to about 13,000 sites in the US, the White House coronavirus coordinator, Ashish Jha, said on Thursday. The federal government plans to deliver a total of 10m doses. Nearly 20 million children in the US are under the age of five. More than 20,000 children in this age group have been hospitalized, and more than half \u2013 63% \u2013 of the young children hospitalized during the first Omicron wave had no underlying conditions. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict which young children are going to develop severe disease and need to be hospitalized,\u201d said Kristina Bryant, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Children\u2019s hospital in Louisville and professor of pediatrics at the University of Louisville. And 442 children under five have died from Covid since January 2020. \u201cSome parents just have not yet heard the message that Covid-19 can be a serious illness in young kids,\u201d Bryant said. An estimated three in four American children have recovered from Covid at least once. But new variants are increasingly able to overcome immunity from prior infection \u2013 and \u201cthere\u2019s no guarantee that the second time will be mild,\u201d Bryant said. Vaccination can help shore up protection, especially against severe illness and death. Families may also not understand how much data officials have on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. \u201cThey also don\u2019t realize that there have been so many millions of these vaccines administered, with such good safety results \u2013 that it\u2019s really incredibly safe,\u201d Kates said. Some parents are also hesitant because of the long-delayed timeline on vaccines for America\u2019s youngest. The independent vaccine advisers for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) planned to meet in February to discuss trial data, before the meeting was abruptly canceled. \u201cAnything that creates any level of uncertainty or anxiety or questioning can backfire in this environment,\u201d Kates said \u201cParents want to protect our children as much as possible,\u201d she said. When it comes to Covid, they need to know the risks of infection and the benefits of vaccination \u2013 which means answering their questions and offering reliable information to battle the wealth of misinformation they encounter. \u201cIt comes down to the trusted messengers and as many access points as you can provide,\u201d Kates said, to help make vaccination quick and easy. \u201cParents who have questions should definitely work with their pediatricians or primary care providers to get those questions answered. As pediatric clinicians, we need to meet those families where they are,\u201d Bryant said. A recommendation from a pediatrician or trusted primary care provider is one of the most important factors in parents\u2019 decision to immunize their child against a variety of diseases, she said. \u201cPediatricians and other primary care providers need to be ready to speak about the vaccines and make a strong recommendation.\u201d Having two options on vaccines for children now could help with some of the hesitations and access issues that some parents have. Pfizer is a lower dose, which means that maybe parents who are concerned about side-effects might go for that one, while Moderna is only the two doses for now, which may be helpful for parents or guardians taking time off work or finding transportation \u2013 both of which can be important equity issues in getting vaccinated. It\u2019s important to move as quickly as possible, the experts said. The vaccines offer protection two weeks after the last dose in the series \u2013 which is after dose 2 for Moderna and dose 3 for Pfizer among this age group. \u201cIf families wait until there\u2019s a lot of Covid in their communities, or they say, \u2018I\u2019ll wait until school starts,\u2019 well, then their child is not going to be protected at that time, because immunity is not immediate,\u201d Bryant said. Vaccinating children now could help prevent a surge in fall or winter, particularly as kids head back to school in a few weeks. Dr Bhattacharyya, for his part, was relieved that his son will soon be protected by vaccines. His son was thrilled, too \u2013 especially when they celebrated with ice-cream."

            "date": "2022-06-27T06:15:04Z",
            "content": "When Annah Kadhenghi had her first child last year, she named him Brighton Ushindi Baraka: baraka meaning \u201cblessing\u201d in Swahili, ushindi meaning victory. Last month, at the age of seven months, Brighton fought his first battle against an enemy that plagues millions of the world\u2019s poorest: malaria. \u201cHis temperature was very high; he was vomiting. I took him to the hospital,\u201d says Kadhenghi, a schoolteacher in Kilifi, eastern Kenya. Brighton defeated the mosquito-borne disease, and now sits contentedly at the weigh-in clinic at Kilifi county hospital. More than 600,000 in Africa in 2020 and about 12,500 in Kenya alone, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), were not as lucky. Across vast swathes of the continent, malaria remains a leading killer of under fives. So Kadhenghi was relieved to hear there could soon be an effective vaccine. \u201cA lot of people are suffering in this area from malaria,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d Scientists at the Jenner Institute at Oxford University \u2013 birthplace of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine \u2013 are hoping Kadhenghi, and others like her, won\u2019t have to wait long. WHO has already endorsed one malaria jab for widespread use, and there should soon be a second, which those who have been working on it say is worth the wait. The RTS,S vaccine, given the green light last year, has a modest level of efficacy, preventing 39% of all malaria cases and 29% of severe cases; however, the new R21 jab is the first to exceed the WHO target of 75%. In a 2019 trial in Burkina Faso it demonstrated high-level efficacy of 77%, results expected to be echoed at the end of a larger trial in four African countries. The Serum Institute of India, the world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer, stands ready to deliver at least 200m doses annually \u2013 a scale necessary to beat malaria. In 2020, Africa saw an estimated 228m cases of the disease, about 95% of the world\u2019s total. Mainga Hamaluba, head of clinical research at the Kemri-Wellcome Trust in Kilifi and principal investigator on the phase III trial, says watching R21\u2019s progression has been astonishing. In 2017, when she returned to Kenya after training in the UK, it was just one of several promising vaccine candidates. It looked like \u201ca bit of a leap of faith \u2013 until we saw the data from the Phase II trial\u201d. When the results were shown to her and her colleagues, she recalls: \u201cThe data was being presented. And \u2026 you get goosebumps. It was absolutely extraordinary. It still is.\u201d At that point, before the world had seen the speed at which Covid vaccines were developed and manufactured, the idea that R21 would be approved by 2023 had seemed ambitious. \u201cThen you see that,\u201d Hamaluba says, \u201cand you think: gosh, this might be possible.\u201d If backed up with adequate funding, the jab could save \u201cexponentially more lives\u201d, says Hamaluba. It can\u2019t be looked at as the sole weapon in the armoury: it will not mean the end any time soon of insecticide-treated bed nets, or of antimalarial drugs. \u201cBut it is pretty amazing.\u201d Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, who has long championed the vaccine believes that R21 could reduce deaths substantially from next year, and by as much as 75% by 2030. \u201cWith a fair wind, the 2030s could see the reduction of malaria from a major killer \u2026 to a more localised minor cause of mortality,\u201d he says. He believes the world could be on course for the ultimate goal of eradicating malaria by 2040. The vaccine hunt has been a century in the making. Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite, is complex, with more than 5,000 genes, evading human immune systems with skill. \u201cPinning down what is the Achilles heel is tougher [than a virus],\u201d says George Warimwe, a vaccinologist at Kemri-Wellcome. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why it has taken so long.\u201d Warimwe suspects there are other reasons, aside from biological complexity, behind the long wait for a jab. \u201cWe know a lot more about the epidemiology of malaria than we do of some of these newly emerging [diseases] \u2013 I can\u2019t help but think about Covid,\u201d he says. \u201cBut malaria continues to kill very many people, very many children, in Africa. It should be at the same scale as Covid in terms of prioritisation, but unfortunately that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d He says a vaccine demonstrating high protective efficacy, should be considered for the same WHO emergency authorisation as the Covid vaccines. \u201cThis is something that fits that bill, so why is it not happening?\u201d he asks. The response to the pandemic has puzzled the community in Kilifi, a sleepy coastal town, which \u2013 in partnership between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri), the Wellcome Trust and Oxford university \u2013 gained a world-class health research unit in 1989. When staff returned to work after Kenya\u2019s lockdown, the unit\u2019s community liaison group faced awkward questions, recalls Mary Mwangoma, community facilitator at Kemri-Wellcome Trust. \u201cThe community members would ask \u2026 how come you got this [Covid] vaccine so fast when there are other diseases like HIV and malaria you\u2019ve done studies on for quite some time and you haven\u2019t got a vaccine?\u201d she says. While locals appreciate the work the researchers do, \u201cthey would really wish that there was a permanent solution\u201d to malaria, a far bigger threat here than Covid. Deep in the lush countryside inland, the village of Junju has seen more than 5,000 cases of malaria so far this year. The tally is kepton a blackboard outside the dispensary: 1,708 for January, 655 for February, 1,283 for March. \u201cMalaria is the commonest illness we encounter here \u2013 you can see here the number of cases,\u201d says Stephen Chakaya, a medical officer who says numbers will peak at the end of the rainy season in July. \u201cWe can see more than 50 cases in a day.\u201d Outside the dispensary, mothers wait with children to be seen. A baby cries. A chicken stalks in the dust. In the chipped paint on the walls is written: \u201cVision: a nation free from preventable diseases and ill health.\u201d Junju, home to nearly 8,000 people, including more than 1,000 under-fives, is a high-transmission area for malaria, as is much of the undulating, tropical land on Kenya\u2019s coast. Things have improved significantly in the past two decades: most children sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets, and most cases Chakaya sees are mild or moderate. At the dispensary, medics use rapid diagnostic tests that detect malaria in less than 20 minutes. But anyone over 30 here can remember what it used to be like and they take nothing for granted. Peter Chitsao, who was a child in Junju in the 1980s, says death from malaria was common. \u201cYou might see a child taken to the medicine man [a traditional healer] \u2013 that was what people called him. And then the child would die.\u201d Mwangoma recalls the itchy skin, bitter taste and bad dreams that came from a childhood taking chloroquine: \u201cWe would call it malariaquine.\u201d The experience of Junju is mirrored in the statistics: globally, malaria deaths reduced steadily from 2000-2019, from 896,000 in 2000 to 558 000 in 2019. By 2015, the mortality rate was half what it had been in 2000. Better targeted health education and greater investment in the science meant that more and more children avoided the worse. But, as of 2018, that progress has stalled, and in 2020, with services disrupted by the Covid pandemic, malaria deaths rose for the first time in decades, revealing how easily fragile gains could be squandered. There are fears over growing resistance \u2013 in the parasite to drugs and in the mosquito to insecticides. So a vaccine could be coming in the nick of time. Scientists believe R21 has the potential to be a game-changer, if funded. The stalling of progress on malaria has been accompanied, says the WHO, by a widening gap in what is needed and what wealthy donor countries like the UK are investing. By 2020, the gap had reached $3.5bn. Will Boris Johnson\u2019s government commit to ensuring the research is translated into action? A crucial sign will come this autumn when Britain makes its pledge to the Global Fund, the body providing more than half of all international financing for malaria programmes. The Fund has said that to get back on track after the pandemic it needs funding to rise by 30%, which would require the UK raising its contribution from \u00a31.46bn to \u00a31.8bn, according to Malaria No More UK. Given Liz Truss\u2019s plan to almost halve the aid budget for multilateral bodies, the mood music is not encouraging. For now Kemri-Wellcome scientists remain focused on the phase III trial, which in Kenya saw 600 babies and toddlers \u2013 half of them from Junju \u2013 take three doses of the vaccine four weeks apart. In the autumn, a year after the first jab, they will have a booster. Across Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Mali and Kenya, a total of 4,800 children are participating. There was little trouble finding participants for the trial, says Chakaya. \u201cEveryone is optimistic [about] having a malaria vaccine \u2026 [Malaria] is a high cause of morbidity for under fives and pregnant women, so for the community [the possibility of the vaccine coming] is motivation enough,\u201d he says. The enthusiasm is at least partly down to Mwangoma and her community liaison team, who try to work, tactfully and respectfully, towards engaging people in what researchers are doing and explain the science. Johnson Masha, a community facilitator working with Mwangoma, says, when discussing a trial, \u201cwe talk of altruism. That you aim to do good for the benefit of society.\u201d Hill, who has dedicated his career to malaria research, with a brief detour into Covid, for which he was given an honorary knighthood, says the Kemri unit in Kilifi has played a major role in R21\u2019s development \u2013 from being the first site in Africa to test the vaccine, finding \u201cit showed excellent safety and strong immune responses in adults and children\u201d, to building on that in phase III. For Hamaluba the importance of an African-led team embedded in an African community cannot be understated. \u201cIt has to be African-led scientists [working on] diseases of importance in the areas they live and they work. It has to be,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause otherwise things are lost.\u201d Kemri workers are in \u201ca continuous conversation,\u201d she says, with the community. In Junju, Khadija Mcharo Kapitao, 32, sits with her toddler Rumeisa waiting to see a nurse. She remembers the malaria she suffered as a child, reoccurring two or three times a year with \u201cchills, abdominal pain, back pain, vomiting\u201d.

            "date": "2022-06-29T13:35:13Z",
            "content": "Ted Cruz is fighting a muppet over vaccines, again. The conservative Texas Republican senator has attacked a video posted on Sesame Street\u2019s Twitter account where Elmo\u2019s dad is discussing the Covid-19 vaccine for children. The video, unlike a previous Sesame Street video about vaccination that Cruz also denounced, is not just for children. It also aims to alleviate the anxiety that even some pro-vaccine parents may feel about Covid-19 vaccines for children as young as six months old that were approved earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to have questions about Covid-19 vaccines for children!\u201d read the caption of the video. \u201cElmo\u2019s dad Louie talked to their pediatrician, and learned that Elmo getting vaccinated is the best way to keep him and his whole neighborhood safe and healthy!\u201d The video, which has garnered more than 500,000 views in less than 12 hours, shows Elmo excited that his dad has \u201csuper-duper bandages just like Elmo.\u201d \u201cI had a lot of questions about Elmo getting the Covid vaccine \u2013 was it safe? Was it the right decision?\u201d the father says, adding that he consulted Elmo\u2019s pediatrician to learn more so he could make \u201cthe right choice\u201d. \u201cI learned that Elmo getting vaccinated is the best way to keep himself, our friends, neighbors and everyone else healthy and enjoying the things they love,\u201d he adds. Within a few hours, Cruz launched his second attack on Sesame Street since November, claiming that Elmo did not cite any scientific evidence for the vaccine. \u201cThanks, @sesamestreet for saying parents are allowed to have questions! You then have @elmo aggressively advocate for vaccinating children UNDER 5. But you cite ZERO scientific evidence for this,\u201d Cruz posted. Cruz also linked his response to a press release from his office where he demanded answers from the Federal Drug Administration about the recent vaccine approval. But he gathered little support on the social media thread, with most replies making fun of him for spending his time bashing a muppet. \u201cWe now understand where you get your health care information,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cExcuse me, has this episode of Sesame Street been peer reviewed?\u201d another user commented. The criticism is nothing new for Sesame Street, which has often been targeted by the right for taking a stand on issues from vaccines to racism after the killing of George Floyd. In response to both the video as well as Cruz\u2019s response, Sesame Street was further applauded for using its platform to educate its audience. The Guardian has contacted Sesame Workshop for comments."

            "date": "2022-06-08T17:55:12Z",
            "content": "An updated version of Moderna\u2019s Covid vaccine produces an eightfold increase in antibody levels against the Omicron variant, according to early trial results, raising hopes for a once-a-year booster to protect against the disease. The vaccine is the first \u201cbivalent\u201d formulation to combine protection against Omicron and the original strain of coronavirus, and is the company\u2019s leading candidate for upcoming autumn booster programmes. Dr Paul Burton, Moderna\u2019s chief medical officer, said the new vaccine raised antibody levels to such a degree that one booster a year could be enough, unless a substantially different variant calls for the vaccine to be redesigned again. \u201cThe data we show today are really important because we get a really strong antibody response against Omicron,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the first time, we could really be looking at the potential for just once-yearly boosting, because we can get people to such a high level that they will take longer to decay.\u201d The new vaccine, called mRNA1273.214, combines 25 micrograms of the original Moderna Covid vaccine with 25 micrograms of vaccine specifically targeted at the Omicron variant. In the phase 2/3 trial, the 50mcg shots were given to 437 people who had already received two primary jabs and a booster of the original Moderna vaccine earlier in the pandemic. The company has not released full data from the trial, but according to a press statement, in people who received a shot of the new vaccine \u2013 their fourth in total \u2013 antibody levels against Omicron rose eightfold in the first four weeks. About a quarter of those who took part in the trial had previously been infected with Covid, and in these, antibody levels rose even further. Burton said antibody levels above 400 units seemed sufficient to prevent infection, and in the trial, levels rose as high as 6,000 in those who had not been infected with Covid before, and 9,500 in those who previously tested positive. \u201cBoth got a very good, brisk, robust increase in antibody levels,\u201d Burton said. The first Omicron variant, called BA.1, emerged late last year and fuelled severe waves of Covid around the world. Although it was less severe than some previous variants, its high transmissibility meant it was still able to drive up hospitalisations and deaths and put intense pressure on health systems. Since the first wave of Omicron swept through the UK in December and January, sub-variants have emerged that are even more transmissible. After a wave of so-called BA.2 Omicron in the spring, two more variants, known as BA.4 and BA.5, have started to gain ground. Moderna\u2019s bivalent vaccine targets the BA.1 variant, but Burton said that even if there was some reduction in protection against more recent Omicron variants, it should still offer good long-term protection. \u201cI feel confident it will hold up against the family right now,\u201d he said. Moderna intends to apply for approval from medical regulators in the coming weeks, including the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, with a view to supplying the vaccine for the autumn booster programme. \u201cWe have started producing it and we would definitely plan to have it ready for the UK, Europe, the US and countries around the world, in very large supply,\u201d Burton said. If the booster does provide year-long protection against Covid, it could pave the way for dealing with the disease in a similar way to the flu, where strains are tracked continuously to identify which should go into the coming year\u2019s seasonal shot. \u201cTo be able to get ahead, we need to get to a world like we do with flu, where we see the new strain, we insert it into the new vaccine, we can do that quite quickly, and we can adapt far faster,\u201d Burton said."

I am the only child psychotherapist in the school, which has many students with extremely complex mental health difficulties, many of whom with severe special needs. The head of special educational needs told me earlier in the year that school should be about education and not sorting out mental health issues (Letters, 25 May). If the school has any funding, they will spend it on a new teacher, not on a child psychotherapist who can only see up to five students a day. Her words reflected the stress and huge anxiety in the school system, and how thinly spread many of the staff feel. There is a strong desire to have specific funding for child psychotherapists and mental health workers. Child and adolescent mental health services have extremely long waiting lists, and if help is given, it is often too late. I am also losing my job in an inner-city primary school, which also has very young children with severe trauma. The headteacher has had to let me go due to lack of funds, even though she takes mental health issues extremely seriously. I am very concerned that trained child and adolescent psychotherapists will not get jobs in schools due to lack of funding, and so huge numbers of young people will suffer alone and unsupported unnecessarily.

            "date": "2022-06-27T23:01:04Z",
            "content": "The pandemic has had a lasting legacy on the mental health of the \u201cCovid generation\u201d of students, exacerbating rates of anxiety, depression and self-harm and resulting in a \u201csignificant rise\u201d in young people struggling at university, experts have said. UK universities have reported that more students are experiencing mental health problems in the aftermath of the pandemic, and that this is expected to continue with the cohort arriving in September, whose school experience was heavily disrupted by the pandemic. The president of the National Union of Students, Larissa Kennedy, said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the student mental health crisis, which was \u201cgetting worse\u201d, with NUS research suggesting \u201cthe majority of students are burdened by anxiety\u201d. Recent research by the Humen mental health charity suggested that more than two in five (41%) of students did not think their institution prevented problems from arising. Nearly half (47%) of students said mental health difficulties had a negative impact on their university experience, while a third said they didn\u2019t know where to go to seek help, according to the survey of 7,385 students. Kennedy said students\u2019 struggles were caused by exam pressure combined with the cost of living crisis, and called for more funding to introduce \u201cearly support hubs\u201d that would \u201cprevent thousands reaching crisis point\u201d. Last week the government announced \u00a33m in funding to close the gap between the NHS and university mental health services, which the NUS warned was a drop in the ocean, equating to just \u00a31 per student. Universities were \u201cseeing an increase in students experiencing mental health difficulties and, while this has been growing over time, it has undoubtedly been accelerated by the pandemic\u201d, said Rachel Sandby-Thomas of the Association of Heads of University Administration (AHUA). Dr Dominique Thompson, a leading medical expert on student mental health, added that professionals had seen \u201ca significant rise\u201d in students presenting with eating disorders, anxiety, loneliness and self-harm. She said the younger generation had been \u201cterribly impacted\u201d by the pandemic and lockdown, and needed help to \u201crebuild their social skills, reassure them about their academic abilities, and support them to be emotionally well\u201d, especially black, Asian or ethnic minority, LGBTQ+ and disabled students. Recent data from the Student Loans Company suggested that these difficult experiences may be translating into higher university dropout rates, with 3,706 more students quitting their courses. Humen also ranked universities on the mental health support they offered students by drawing on the survey results and freedom of information data, including how much institutions spend and student satisfaction. On that basis, the University of Reading was ranked highest, partly due to spending the most per student at an average of \u00a370. Oxford and Central Lancashire came in second and third places. Paddy Woodman, the director of student services at Reading, said the university recognised that mental health was affected by \u201ca broad range\u201d of issues, and that universities had a unique role as \u201can organisation that has to help their customers with everything to do with their lives\u201d. This includes helping students with welfare questions that don\u2019t necessarily require professional support, such as difficulties getting on with their housemates. Helping students socialise was a particular focus, especially post-pandemic, Goodman said. She has observed that students want quieter, more comfortable spaces in which to make friends, and has noticed a notable drop in those attending the campus night club. \u201cThey have missed out on that transition to adulthood but in a safe home environment \u2013 exploring opportunities, going to parties, learning the rules of how you behave and manage yourself,\u201d she said. A spokesperson for Universities UK said that universities had \u201cstepped up\u201d their efforts to support their students in reflection of the difficult pandemic they have had, in combination with \u201csocial media saturation and climate anxiety\u201d. He added that this was a \u201cshared priority\u201d with the NHS and the government, which universities were pressuring to ensure \u201csustained funding and by commissioning student-facing NHS services\u201d."

            "date": "2022-06-29T10:44:06Z",
            "content": "A coroner has said Britain is failing young people and more will die because of under-resourced mental health services, as she ruled that neglect led to the death of a 14-year-old girl. Penelope Schofield, the senior coroner for West Sussex, said she would write to the health secretary, Sajid Javid, to raise concerns after the case of Robyn Skilton, who killed herself after being let down by \u201cgross failures\u201d in NHS mental health services. Robyn, from Horsham in West Sussex, disappeared from her family home and took her own life in a park on 7 May last year, her inquest in Chichester heard. Despite serious concerns about her mental health, Robyn did not get face-to-face consultations, was not seen by a child psychiatrist or assessed for mental health issues, and was discharged from an NHS service a month before her suicide though she was on its high-risk \u201cred list\u201d. Her father, Alan Skilton, a software company director, told the inquest he pleaded for help, and he described the lack of care his daughter received as \u201castonishing\u201d. He said he believed that if Robyn had been seen earlier, her mental health would have improved and she would not have killed herself. Skilton said Robyn was outgoing, sociable and made friends easily, enjoyed ballet, gymnastics and swimming, and was \u201cnaturally artistic\u201d. But she had mental health breakdowns, self-harmed repeatedly, attempted suicide, and was admitted to hospital four times. She told medics she was hearing voices and seeing images. The coroner said: \u201cAs a society we are failing young people.\u201d She said she was shocked to hear that the number of young people seeking mental health help had increased by 95%. \u201cTrying to manage it without more resources means we are not providing the help that young people need. Robyn\u2019s case is a testament to that. It\u2019s a clear risk that more lives will be lost if we don\u2019t address it.\u201d Schofield ruled there were gross failures by Sussex Partnership NHS foundation trust and its child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS). She said: \u201cI do appreciate the landscape the trust was working in as Covid-19 heightened the level of complexity, but there were many failings in the care provided to Robyn. The totality of these failures, in my mind, means I must reach a conclusion of neglect. There was a gross failure to provide care for someone in a dependent state. Robyn took her own life while struggling with her mental health.\u201d Issues outlined by the coroner included a failure by CAMHS to assess Robyn \u201cappropriately or at all\u201d, leading to missed opportunities to address her escalating needs over several years but in particular April 2021 when it was clear there was a danger to her life. Schofield said there was a failure to arrange face-to-face consultations and to offer Robyn CAMHS treatment. She ruled that the decision to discharge the teenager from CAMHS and instead pursue autism support was inappropriate. Dr Alison Wallis, the trust\u2019s clinical director for children\u2019s services, told Robyn\u2019s parents: \u201cYou didn\u2019t get the service you deserved.\u201d She said Covid had affected her care. Rebecca Agnew, a solicitor representing the trust, said: \u201cCAMHS didn\u2019t assess Robyn appropriately, leading to missed opportunities for her escalating needs \u2026 The trust extends a formal apology to her parents for these failings.\u201d A spokesperson for Sussex Partnership NHS foundation trust said: \u201cWe offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Robyn Skilton and apologise unreservedly that the care and support from us did not recognise her vulnerability and provide the intervention and help she needed. \u201cIn response, we have made significant changes to the way we monitor and escalate cases where there is an increase in risk. Working with our partners, we have also introduced a new referral system and we are developing a new drop-in service to provide access to specialist emotional and wellbeing support for children and young people.\u201d In the UK, the youth suicide charity Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or email pat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and Ireland Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "title": "UK is failing fostered children with mental health problems, warns charity",
            "date": "2022-06-26T08:00:39Z",
            "content": "Foster care in Britain is facing a \u201cmental health crisis\u201d because the government is failing to meet the needs of mentally ill children in care. That is the damning verdict of the latest report from the Fostering Network, a charity representing foster carers. The report, shared with the Observer, suggests half of all foster carers are looking after a child with complex mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression and attachment and eating disorders. Yet only a quarter of the 3,352 foster carers surveyed by the charity said their foster child was receiving help with their mental health problems. Another quarter reported they were looking after a foster child who needed mental health support but was not getting it. The charity\u2019s head of policy and campaigns, Jacqui Shurlock, said the findings reveal a \u201csignificant area of unmet need for children in foster care\u201d and suggest a \u201cmental health crisis\u201d may be looming in the sector. \u201cWe know, from the fact that they\u2019re in care, they will have experienced trauma,\u201d said Shurlock. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t expecting to find that percentage not getting any mental health support at all. \u201cA good home life makes a massive difference to children,\u201d she added. \u201cBut foster carers can\u2019t do everything. Where children have mental health needs, foster carers need support from mental health services \u2013 they can\u2019t deal with that burden all on their own.\u201d She called on the government to stop expecting foster children to restart their referral to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) when they move to a new foster care placement in a different local authority or NHS trust. Another barrier placed in front of foster children is that their short-term foster care placements can be deemed not \u201cstable\u201d enough to enable them to qualify for support \u2013 for example, because the child is waiting to hear from a judge about whether or not they will go back to their birth family. \u201cImagine how difficult that situation is for a child. That might be the very time they most need mental health support,\u201d said Shurlock. By failing to meet that need in a timely fashion, \u201cwe are obviously risking much more negative outcomes in their lives, which could be avoided\u201d. The report also showed foster carers face a similar battle when caring for a child with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which occurs when prenatal alcohol exposure affects the developing brain and body of a foetus, causing permanent health, developmental and behavioural problems. Nine per cent of foster carers said they had looked after a child diagnosed with FASD. A further 13% said they had cared for a child with suspected FASD in the last two years, suggesting significant numbers of foster children with the condition are falling through the cracks in the system. Children in care, Shurlock said, are simply not being valued and supported the way they need to be. \u201cIt feels like the state is failing in its duty to meet the needs of those children.\u201d She suspects the \u201cnear impossible burden\u201d this places on foster carers may be one of the reasons why around one in five fostering families left fostering last year. About 9,200 new foster families are now needed across the UK. In Essex, Darren Harman-Page and his partner Karen have been fostering children for over 27 years, caring for more than 100 foster children and adopting six. He said some of the traumatised and neglected children they have fostered who have severe mental health needs are still waiting for support, more than two years after they were referred to Camhs. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough,\u201d he said. Children in these circumstances may struggle with anxiety and self-harm or become hypervigilant or aggressive. They may also feel overwhelmed or unsafe in what others may perceive to be \u201cnormal\u201d everyday situations. \u201cTheir \u2018normal\u2019 was chaos and neglect.\u201d He is doing all he can to provide the children he fosters with a secure and loving home, but finds it heartbreaking \u2013 and frustrating \u2013 when these children, who have suffered so much already, are not able to access the mental health support they so obviously need. \u201cYou feel terrible. That\u2019s where the sadness creeps in, I suppose. Because you haven\u2019t been able to help them.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-23T05:26:14Z",
            "content": "The Victorian government will require patient advocacy services be notified of any compulsory treatment under changes to Victoria\u2019s mental health system, with a former federal court judge to lead a review into the criteria used for coercive practices. But the state\u2019s peak mental health body said the proposed Mental Health and Wellbeing Act \u2013 unveiled by the government on Thursday in response to a scathing royal commission \u2013 would not create \u201cfundamental change\u201d for patients. The Victorian Mental Illness Awareness Council (VMIAC) called on the government to immediately end the compulsory treatment practices of seclusion and restraint on mental health wards. \u201cPeople in mental health services, including children will continue to be detained, restrained, secluded and treated against their will,\u201d said VMIAC\u2019s chief executive, Craig Wallace. Under the proposed legislation, mental health services are required to notify advocacy services when a person is forced to undergo treatment to ensure patients are aware of their rights and have more agency. This reflects a recommendation from a royal commission into the state\u2019s mental health system, which found that the intervention of advocacy services may drive down the use of coercive practices. While the bill makes minor legal changes to the rights of people who experience compulsory mental health treatment, a review \u2013 that will commence in October \u2013 will make recommendations to the government next year for future legislative changes. Tabling the new legislation, the mental health minister, James Merlino, announced the government had appointed Judge Shane Marshall to lead the review into the criteria for compulsory treatment, alongside psychiatrist Prof Richard Newton and mental health advocates. Merlino said the legislation would centre the views and values of Victorians living with mental illness, their families and carers by enshrining in law the vision of the royal commission. \u201cWe will create the service system envisioned by the royal commission, providing world-leading mental health and wellbeing services for all Victorians,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an unapologetically aspirational bill but it would be naive to expect that the reform of the royal commission can be implemented overnight.\u201d Marshall \u2013 a former federal court judge and acting judge of Tasmania\u2019s supreme court \u2013 has previously spoken publicly about his struggles with depression and mental health issues in the legal profession. The royal commission, which published its final report last year, found human rights were being breached by having patients locked away or handcuffed. It recommended practices like seclusion and restraint be phased out within a decade. It comes after a damning report by VMIAC, published last week, revealed Victoria\u2019s public mental health facilities were still secluding and restraining people more frequently and for longer than national averages, despite the commission\u2019s recommendation. The report also revealed that physical restraint of children had increased by 32% in 2020-2021 compared with the previous year. Child and adolescent psychiatrist Prof Patrick McGorry said he supported expediting the phasing out of the practices but stressed they were symptomatic of \u201cneglect\u201d in the mental system. \u201cThe system has been allowed to just collapse on itself,\u201d he said. The new bill will also establish a new mental health watchdog \u2013 to absorb the existing regulator \u2013 to hold the government to account on implementing the reform. The independent statutory body will include commissioners who have lived experience of mental illness. For the first time, carers and family members of people who receive mental illness treatment will also be able to make complaints on their behalf. It will also establish a new youth organisation to oversee reform for young people, which will include those with lived experiences of mental health issues on its advisory board. Opposition mental health spokesperson, Emma Kealy, said the Coalition would seek feedback from the sector to make sure it could \u201cget the bill right\u201d."

            "content": "Ukraine more than doubled interest rates to 25% on Thursday in a move to try to stem double-digit inflation and protect its currency, which has collapsed since Russia\u2019s invasion. In the first interest rates intervention since Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank\u2019s governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%. It takes borrowing costs to their highest level since September 2015 \u2013 when Ukraine\u2019s economy was reeling from Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea \u2013 and the highest in Europe. The Russian invasion has devastated Ukraine\u2019s economy, which the World Bank has forecast could shrink by at least a third this year. The war has forced businesses to close, destroyed infrastructure, blocked shipping routes and reduced whole towns to rubble. Shevchenko called for talks with the International Monetary Fund on a new aid programme. The increase was criticised by an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s office, who said the rate was too high and dangerous to the economy during wartime. It was not clear whether he was speaking in a personal capacity. The National Bank of Ukraine had frozen its main rate 10% at the start of the invasion, but last week signalled it could resume regular monetary policy reviews as business activity partially recovered in safer parts of the country. It is betting that a sharp rate rise will also nudge the government to lift the yield on domestic bonds, making assets held in its currency, the hryvnia, more attractive and preventing household incomes and savings from being eroded by inflation. Inflation was already in double digits before the conflict began and climbed further to about 17% in May from 16.4% in April, according to central bank estimates. It said inflation could double in 2022 from 10% in 2021, pushed up by rising global prices and the damage of the war on domestic production and supply chains. The number of small businesses that had suspended operations in April fell to 26% from 73% in March, according to a survey by the European Business Association, the union of businesses operating in Ukraine."

            "title": "We face a global economic crisis. And no one knows what to do about it",
            "date": "2022-06-18T16:00:22Z",
            "content": "Back in February, plenty of investors were betting that the buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine\u2019s border was no more than an elaborate bluff. The Russian and Ukrainian currencies appreciated in value as hedge funds and private equity firms, signalling their faith in some form of peace deal emerging, confidently bought roubles and the Ukrainian hryvnia. Today there is a war going on that has effectively locked up the raw materials and food usually exported by both nations, and no one knows when the conflict will end. It is clear from the collapse in global stock markets and sliding cryptocurrency values that investors are panicked by the uncertainty. Shares in the US, where the S&amp;P 500 index is down by almost a quarter since January, have suffered their worst start to a year for 60 years. We have seen panics before, notably after the 2008 crash. Investment firms, despite their reputations as the clever custodians of pension fund money, always press the sell button at the first sign of trouble. Collectively, it leads to a rout. Seasoned policymakers know how to react in such uncertain times, and that is to do whatever it takes to reassure investors that their money is safe. Western governments have dipped into their reserves, and when that well of cash has run dry, borrowed heavily to maintain a stable outlook for their economies. Vital support has arrived in the form of cheap borrowing from central banks. With low interest rates acting like the cavalry in a John Wayne film, everyone has been able to rest assured the panic will be shortlived. Not any more. This time there is a real war, not just a financial one, and no one quite knows what to do. The major powers cannot agree about how to fight it and policymakers cannot agree about how to handle the fallout, especially the shortages of raw materials and food from Ukraine and Russia that are pushing inflation to 10% and beyond. In particular, central banks have lost their nerve. Instead of being a reassuring presence, they are adding to the sense of panic by increasing the cost of borrowing. As one analyst said about the US central bank\u2019s decision to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage points last week: \u201cThe Federal Reserve is going to hike interest rates until policymakers break inflation, but the risk is that they also break the economy.\u201d On Thursday, the Bank of England pushed its base rate to 1.25% after a period of more than a decade during which it had never climbed higher than 0.75%. Some analysts believe the base rate will increase to 3% by the end of next year after Threadneedle Street put tackling inflation above sustaining growth. We know that an increase in the cost of borrowing in the UK, the eurozone and the US, which is what we are now witnessing, will do nothing to bring down prices. Inflation is an affliction caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and to a lesser but important extent by China\u2019s difficulties with Covid after its vaccine development failures, which have caused repeated lockdowns and holdups at ports. In the UK, Brexit adds a further big twist because it has damaged trade and cut the number of available workers. The justification for higher interest rates, then, must lie elsewhere, and central banks, to justify their spasm of action, argue they must go ahead to avert a wages spiral \u2013 one where pay exceeds inflation. In Britain, this argument presumes that the average worker, to prevent a fall in personal living standards, will be able to negotiate a pay deal that beats the Bank of England\u2019s latest forecast for peak inflation later this year of 11%. When the government is expected to limit public sector pay rises to between 0% and 3% this year, that means private sector increases would have to be even higher \u2013 about 12% or 13% on average. These levels of pay rise are a fiction. Worker power, apart from in some discrete pockets of the labour market, is a mirage. Yet the Bank looks likely to press ahead anyway, which leaves anyone looking for reasons to remain confident turning to Rishi Sunak. The chancellor has made it clear he values fiscal rectitude above the \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d open-ended commitments needed to foster confidence. He has warm words for investors about low business taxes, special visas for foreign entrepreneurs and a reheated Thatcherite plan to increase the number of workers by compelling more of those on benefits to look for work. That is a feeble collection of micro-policies that will do little to improve the mood of companies looking to invest in the UK. No wonder the pound has tumbled. Few investors want to buy British at the moment, and who can blame them?"

            "title": "The Observer view on Britain\u2019s dire economic outlook | Observer editorial",
            "date": "2022-06-12T07:28:47Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s growth prospects are the gloomiest of all developed nations. The OECD predicted last week that the UK economy would not grow at all next year, the worst outlook for any OECD nation. This follows warnings in April from the IMF that the UK will experience the worst growth out of the G7 nations in 2023. After a decade of stagnant wages, it seems Britons need to resign themselves to the fact that the buoyant growth of the 2000s is but a distant memory. Every country has suffered the shock of the pandemic, followed by the spike in oil and wheat prices triggered by Russia\u2019s illegal war in Ukraine. But other developed economies have proved more resilient, enjoying export-driven recoveries in the wake of Covid. Here in Britain, the economic malaise left exposed by the 2008 financial crisis is long term and structural. This crisis was supposed to prompt a big economic rethink: a reckoning with Britain\u2019s addiction to growth fuelled by rising levels of consumer debt enabled by rising house prices. The then shadow chancellor George Osborne pledged to rebalance the economy away from debt-driven growth to more productive development, driven by business investment and exports, underpinned with an expansion of the UK\u2019s manufacturing base and a reduction in the huge regional inequalities between the south-east and the rest of the country. No such thing materialised. Instead, the least affluent areas of the country were forced to bear the biggest burden of cuts to public services, undermining their potential to attract investment. Britain\u2019s sluggish recovery from the financial crisis \u2013 average GDP growth in the decade after 2008 was a full percentage point lower than it was in the run-up to the year \u2013 was propelled by consumer spending and resurgent house prices. Productivity growth dropped substantially, taking Britain from second in the G7 for productivity growth pre-financial crash, to the second slowest post crash. There remains a significant finance gap for fast-growing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a market failure the government has not adequately addressed. And Brexit has pushed the British economy in precisely the opposite direction to what was needed after the financial crisis. The hard Brexit pursued by Boris Johnson \u2013 taking Britain out of the EU\u2019s economic and political institutions in an ill-thought-through attempt at a \u201cclean break\u201d \u2013 has undermined the fragile political settlement of the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland and deepened Britain\u2019s economic ailment. Investment and exports are down as a result of Brexit. Now that similar countries are starting to recover from the pandemic, the scale of the damage is becoming more evident. Last week, a piece of analysis estimated that the economy is already 5% smaller than it would have been had the UK not left the single market and customs union. These impacts are not unexpected but there was simply not the slack in the lethargic British economy to absorb them. Even media publications that supported Brexit at the time are recognising that Brexit is costing British voters day in, day out, in the form of higher business costs, particularly for exporting SMEs, lower wages, and more poorly funded public services, a cost we can ill afford. Brexit has also affected the price of sterling; a decline in the value of the pound has increased the cost of imports even as British exports have fallen, contributing to the cost of living crisis. Economic forecasters predict the pound could drop further against the dollar and euro, particularly if UK-EU relations over the Northern Ireland protocol become even more fractious. This hopeless government, mired in incompetence and scandal, has no answers. There is no industrial strategy, no plan to boost growth outside London and the south-east, no alternative ideas for exporters in the wake of Brexit. Ministers have no idea what to do about the UK\u2019s dysfunctional housing market; last week, the prime minister said he would expand the right to buy for housing association tenants with an announcement so lacking in substance it would make the back of an envelope seem robust. Johnson seems determined to continue to pick fights with the EU over the Northern Ireland protocol in a way that will only prolong the economic pain and drive a further wedge between Britain and its largest export market. Rising inflation will not just force real wage cuts on many workers; it will also erode the true value of spending on public services, imposing further austerity on schools and hospitals. The prime minister and chancellor cannot even agree on the fundamentals of what the government\u2019s approach should be, and a joint speech they were due to give this week has been postponed. The OECD has criticised the chancellor for his fiscal policy, which, even with the multibillion-pound package of support he announced last month, is contractionary overall, just as the economy is in desperate need of a stimulus. The Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood was right to advocate for Britain rejoining the EU\u2019s single market a week ago. Brexit ideologues can rail against this all they want. But as Britain looks set to rediscover its role as the sick man of Europe, a closer economic relationship with the EU is starting to feel like an inevitability, no matter how long it takes."

            "title": "Strikes, inflation, slump... back to the 70s? More like the unwinding of Thatcherism | Will Hutton",
            "date": "2022-06-19T08:30:03Z",
            "content": "This is not the 1970s all over again, notwithstanding the apparent similarities \u2013 oil shocks, recession, seasons of discontent, inflation. What we are living through is something more profound. It is the painful unwinding of the dysfunctional Thatcherite economic model, driven by credit, consumption and property prices, so careless of investment, productivity and good, high-performance workplaces. Its end started with the financial crisis, accelerated with Brexit and is now sealed by the economic fallout from Ukraine. What is not obvious, given the backward-looking national economic conversation dominated by Thatcherite shibboleths and myths about the horrors of public debt, is what is going to succeed it. With the right leadership, it could be a moment for developing new modes of growth, 21st-century business models and high-wage employment, an attack on regional inequality and a reframing of our relationship with Europe. What is more likely, given the directionless, principle-free Boris Johnson government, is descent into the most difficult economic circumstances since the Second World War \u2013 with unparalleled social distress, bitter division and economic stagnation. The challenges have rarely been so acute, the future never been more up for grabs. This week\u2019s rail strikes are the latest trigger for fears that Britain is revisiting the 1970s and its trials of union power. But there is now no single industry such as coal-mining on which the country depends that can be used by a union for wage-bargaining leverage; there are no huge sites of mass employment vulnerable to strikes; above all, rates of unionisation have halved. This week will be inconvenient for many but the three strike days will resemble three miniature lockdowns rather than a three-day week with families huddling around guttering candles. Indeed, knowing that the inconvenience is survivable has meant that public support for the action is surprisingly high. People may not know the detail of the statistics \u2013 total pay growth in the public sector is running at 1.5% compared with 8% in the private sector (including bonuses) \u2013 but they smell the rank unfairness, meanness and readiness to embrace partisanship associated with everything Johnson touches. Why shouldn\u2019t public sector workers resist swingeing cuts in real pay and large-scale job losses? This represents a wider mood swing. Whether it\u2019s homeowners struggling to fix their mortgage rate as rates jump higher or people walking miles to a food bank because they can\u2019t afford to drive, there is a widespread sense that not only is life suddenly tough and getting tougher but no one has our backs. The institutions that could be turned to for support have been weakened and hollowed out by 12 years of Toryism. Civil society must fight back. Sharon Graham\u2019s election last year as general secretary of Unite, with her commitment to focus on the core of trade unionism \u2013 fighting for better pay and conditions \u2013 rather than the dead end of Corbynite politics, was a tribute to this mood. So, too, are the millions of savers insisting that they want their retirement incomes to flow from investments that make the world better: an astonishing third of all the \u00a39tn funds under management in the UK are earmarked to be invested in properly governed companies committed to environmental and societal betterment \u2013 and growing exponentially. The over-50s resigning from the increasingly unpleasant world of high-stress work in their hundreds of thousands are yet another dimension of this quest for better. Taken together with EU nationals returning home, this means that the labour force has shrunk by nearly a million. As the Bank of England noted in the minutes of its monetary policy committee meeting last week, 1.3m unfilled vacancies broadly match the numbers unemployed, an indicator of how tight the labour market has become (accentuated by the end of free movement of labour as EU members). The Bank also noted that core goods inflation is running at 8%, more than double the rate in the euro area. Veteran members of the monetary policy committee tell me the auguries are obvious if unpalatable: public sector pay must and will rise above the 2%-3% range pencilled in last autumn\u2019s spending review, if only to stop savage and unsustainable cuts in real pay. Against this background, if the Bank wants to be serious about getting inflation back to its target of 2% and stop inflationary expectations, already rising, from becoming embedded, it will have to raise rates close to 4% \u2013 and the sooner it acts the better. Recession, an investment strike, falling house prices, bitter pay disputes, real social distress, stubbornly high inflation and continued weakness in our trade with the EU stare us in the face \u2013 it\u2019s what happens when an economic model implodes. But just as Thatcherism emerged out of the 1970s, a new philosophy right for our times must emerge now. Its building blocks are still hazy but already apparent. The trillions of ESG (environmental, social and governance) savings need to be mobilised in partnership with government to pursue great national missions \u2013 levelling up, rebasing our energy system and grid to achieve net zero, opening up space, transforming our cities, building in new resiliencies, backing our science. A \u200anew ecosystem needs to be created to support the growth of our companies of tomorrow \u2013 it\u2019s important that the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has just announced a review into just that \u2013 and 21st-century great companies in turn need to be organised around the pursuit of purpose rather than short-term profit. There must be a new settlement of rights and obligations at work, better relationships with empowered trade unions and serious commitment to developing our human capital. We need a social security system that protects us. The priority of the state must be to proactively mastermind all this, rather than the Pavlovian pursuit of tax cuts and debt reduction. There needs to be a constitutional settlement that embeds the rule of law and integrity in government and guarantees freedoms and democracy. No more ethics-free, law-breaking King Boris and his court of sycophants. There are a very rough few years ahead but those responsible for it will be punished electorally. The road is open for those who dare. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"

            "content": "The global rout in stock markets, cryptocurrencies and other risky assets has gathered pace amid growing concern that out-of-control inflation, rising interest rates and slowing growth could combine to tip the world into recession. Share prices fell in Asia on Friday at the beginning of what was likely to be another torrid day for investors spooked by the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision this week to raise interest rates by the largest margin for almost 30 years. Other leading central banks such as the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank have followed suit \u2013 the latter in its first hike for 15 years \u2013 sending economists scrambling to revise their forecast for growth downwards. Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management in Hong Kong said: \u201cNo central bankers worth their weight would put inflation-fighting credentials on the line and import higher energy inflation via a weaker currency. Despite the Bank of Japan announcing on Friday that it was sticking to its ultra-loose monetary policy, he added the rate rises eleswhere were a \u201chighly ominous signal for stock market investors... the global race to hike rates is nowhere near the finishing line\u201d. Many believe that the United States may be in recession by next year, raising the prospect of a wider global slump. Shares in the world\u2019s biggest economy have suffered their worst start to a year for 60 years with the S&amp;P 500 benchmark index down 23% since January after losing another 3.25% on Thursday. Analysts at JP Morgan said the state of the S&amp;P 500 \u201cimplies an 85% chance of a US recession\u201d. The falls \u2013 mirrored on the Dow Jones average, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and UK and European markets \u2013 did nothing to boost confidence in Asia Pacific. The Nikkei in Tokyo was off 1.65% and was on track for its worst week of losses for two years, as was India\u2019s main Nifty index. In Sydney, the ASX200 was down 2% on Friday afternoon. The cryptocurrency rout also shows no sign of abating with bitcoin down 7.8% and ethereum 8.45% worse off. In addition, the Financial Times reported that the Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital \u2013 which has $10bn under management \u2013 failed to meet margin calls this week amid the slide in crypto values. The outlook is worsened by the likelihood of the conflict in Ukraine dragging on and the west\u2019s economic war on Russia leading to even higher energy prices ahead of the northern hemisphere winter. \u201cThe speed and degree of policy tightening may prove too much for economies to handle, particularly given the commodity price shock currently in play,\u201d economists at NAB bank in Australia said in a note on Friday. \u201cAs a result, recession risk for several of the major advanced economies, including the US, is uncomfortably high.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist of Betashares in Sydney, went further and predicted a US recession \u201cwithin the next 12 months\u201d due to persistent inflation and the Fed\u2019s pledge to raise rates until the inflation genie is back in the bottle. As a result, he said that share markets in the US had further to fall. \u201cThere seems scope for equity markets to fall further. My base case is the ultimate peak-to-trough decline in the S&amp;P 500 will be 35%, implying a decline to 3,100 from its closing peak of 4,796 on 3 January.\u201d It closed at 3,667 points on Thursday. The ongoing coronavirus lockdowns in China are causing further problems for the global economy. Supply chain snarl-ups in the world\u2019s second largest economy that started during the pandemic are predicted to continue into next year at least thanks to the shutdown of Shanghai and other key regions. The bigger picture is that China was already facing problems ranging from the decoupling from the west amid geopolitical tensions, a faltering, hugely indebted property market, and the uncertainty caused by president Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on large tech companies. As the west increases rates, China\u2019s central bank has been cutting them and the government in Beijing has been throwing more stimulus at the economy. It helped mainland shares and the Hong Kong market buck the downward trend in Friday\u2019s trading, but may not be enough to refloat the global economy as its massive $4tn stimulus did after the global financial crisis of 2008-09. The Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise rates by 0.25% on Thursday was criticised by some as too little too late to stop inflation in its tracks. One forecast says prices will be rising by 11% by October and another report said food price rises could top 15% in the autumn. The British economy shrank by 0.3% in May, according to figures released on Monday, and after a 0.1% decline it \u201cincreased\u201d the chances that the economy will slip into recession, according to Paul Dales, the chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The eurozone is also limping badly and is riven by doubts over how to deal with the diverging real borrowing costs between different countries which mean Italy has to pay more than Germany despite having the same currency. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) says in a report that although the US rebounded from the pandemic slump more quickly than other economies, there were signs that consumer spending was weakening. Its base view is that US growth will stop short of a recession, but it could be a close call. \u201cEIU\u2019s core forecast is that economic growth in the US will slow sharply over the course of 2022 and 2023, owing to stubbornly high inflation, rising interest rates and stalling growth elsewhere,\u201d it said. \u201cWe expect consumer demand to be resilient enough to avoid an outright recession, thanks in part to the tight labour market and strong household balance sheets. However, this does not mean that a recession is completely off the cards.\u201d"

            "content": "A quick round-up. Global stock markets are on track for their worst week since 2020, as fears of a global downturn intensify. World shares have lost around 5.5% so far this week, as a succession of central banks have tightened monetary policy. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Huw Pill, has defended the BoE\u2019s failure to better forecast inflation -- blaming unexpected shocks such as the Ukraine war. Supermarket chain Tesco has reported that shoppers are changing their behaviour, as customers face \u2018unprecedented\u2019 cost of living pressures. The cost of living crisis is damaging many people\u2019s physical and mental health, as the prices of necessities continue to soar, a survey found. Gatwick airport is reduce its summer capacity to ward off potential chaos, after dozens of last-minute cancellations wrecked the travel plans of holidaymakers over the platinum jubilee and half-term holiday. M&amp;C Saatchi has withdrawn its support for a \u00a3310m takeover bid from the digital marketing group Next Fifteen, saying it no longer regarded the terms as \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d amid pressure from another bidder. Retailers across the fitting-room-free world of fast fashion are processing a deluge of unwanted items, as the cost of living squeeze leads to more customers returning clothes. Boohoo will be challenged by campaigners over paying \u201cvery low\u201d prices to suppliers and a lack of compensation for underpaid workers at UK factories making its clothing. Thc chances of Britain heading into a recession over the next year or two have increased amid soaring inflation due to the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks, J.P.Morgan economists have warned. Reuters has the details: \u201cIf the (U.S. Federal Reserve) engineers a sharp growth slowdown or recession, this would spill over to the UK and, combined with a tightening in domestic financial conditions, likely produce a UK recession,\u201d JPM said, adding that: \u201c... given the nature of the UK economy, we see high vulnerability to external shocks beyond the near term and see increasing chances of a recession over the next one to two years.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has defended the central bank for underestimating inflation over the last 18 months. Huw Pill told Bloomberg TV that the UK economy had been hit by a series of \u201cvery big\u201d and unanticipated shocks, such as the Ukraine war and the rise in energy prices. These new shocks are a large part of why the Bank\u2019s inflation forecast has been revised up through time, says Pill (inflation is now expected to hit 11% in October), adding: Shocks, by nature, we couldn\u2019t anticipate. Monetary policy also can\u2019t act quickly enough against such shocks to get inflation down fast, Pill adds. World stock markets are on track for their worst week since the pandemic crash of 2020. Global shares have slumped this week, falling into a bear market, as investors fear that central banks will derail the economic recovery by tightening monetary policy. A series of interest rate rises in recent days have heightened concerns that some economies could fall into recession in the coming months. MSCI\u2019s All-Country World Index of global shares has tumbled by over 5.5% so far this week, with heavy losses across world markets. It is on track for its worst week since March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic sent markets slumping. Global stocks are now more than 20% off their record high, and have hit their lowest level since November 2020, when the first successful Covid-19 vaccine trials triggered a global rally. This week has seen the biggest increase in US interest rates since 1994, a surprise hike in Switzerland, and the fifth increase in UK interest rates since December, as central bankers stepped up their attempts to cool red-hot inflation despite the risk of recession. Economists predict that UK interest rates will continue to rise; August could bring the first 50-basis-point rise since 1995, which would take rates from 1.25% to 1.75%. On Thursday the Bank of England pledged to act \u2018forcefully\u2019, if needed, to subdue inflationary pressures. Analysts at BNP Paribas Markets 360 say: We now expect a more frontloaded path of tightening than we did before and a slightly more restrictive terminal rate. We see 125bp of further tightening this year, including 50bp in August, taking Bank Rate to 2.5% by year-end. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, explains that central banks have got tough on inflation this week, increasing the risk of an economic downturn. The more aggressive line by central banks adds to headwinds for both economic growth and equities. The risks of a recession are rising, while achieving a soft landing for the US economy appears increasingly challenging.\u201d Investors have become increasingly concerned by the potential for further disruptions of energy supplies from Russia, Haefele adds. Gazprom cut supplies through a critical Baltic Sea pipeline bringing gas to Europe this week. Haefele explains: \u201cThe expected fall in inflation has been delayed by the surge in energy and food prices resulting from the war in Ukraine, while disruptions arising from the pandemic are also lingering longer than forecast.\u201d Heavy losses in many Asia-Pacific markets today, following a rout in Europe and Wall Street yesterday, showed recession fears were rising. The ongoing coronavirus lockdowns in China are causing further problems for the global economy too, my colleague Martin Farrer writes: Supply chain snarl-ups in the world\u2019s second largest economy that started during the pandemic are predicted to continue into next year at least thanks to the shutdown of Shanghai and other key regions. The bigger picture is that China was already facing problems ranging from the decoupling from the west amid geopolitical tensions, a faltering, hugely indebted property market, and the uncertainty caused by president Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on large tech companies. Bond markets have been volatile this week, with the yields (a measure of borrowing costs) on UK, German and Italian government debt hitting eight-year highs, before dropping back today. US 10-year Treasury bond yields hit their highest since 2011 this week, after the US Federal Reserve hiked interest rate by 75 basis points, in a hawkish attempt to cool prices. Weak economic data has also worried investors, with the UK economy contracting 0.3% in April, and new housebuilding projects in the US hitting a 13-month low in May. Recession worries hit commodity prices. Copper, a bellwether of the global economy, has dropped 3% this week to a one-month low. Bill Blain, market strategist and head of alternative assets at Shard Capital, says central bankers are struggling to get to grips with the inflation shock of the Ukraine War, following the shock of the pandemic. The UK is now predicting Q3 inflation of 11%. And, raising rates is a massive problem for markets \u2013 as the downside volatility has shown this week. Reading through acres of market research, the credibility of Central Banks is being questioned around the globe. They face a devil or the deep blue sea choice \u2013 how to a) preserve jobs and economic stability by avoiding a market crash, or b) slashing inflation? And/or is not an option. It\u2019s a thankless task, made more complex by the consequences of the last 13 years of monetary experimentation. Cryptocurrencies have crashed this week. Bitcoin has slumped by almost 30% since last Friday to around $20,900 this morning, down from $29,000 a week ago. The Financial Times reported that the Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital \u2013 which has $10bn under management \u2013 failed to meet demands from its lenders this week amid the slide in crypto values. A market trends indicator by BofA Securities has fallen to zero for the first time since the pandemic-induced mayhem in financial markets in 2020, Reuters reports. This signals \u201cextreme bearishness\u201d as investors dumped credit and crypto assets. A global recession is on the way, warns Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. He points to the slowdown in manufacturing activity in the US: European stock markets are pushing higher, with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 now up 56 points (+0.8%) at 7101 points. But that still leaves the blue-chip indx down almost 3% this week, after heavy losses yesterday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 has now gained 1%, but also down over 3% since the start of trading on Monday. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says it has been a very chaotic week. The sun is shining bright, the weekend is here, yet all investors can think about is medicine to calm the motion sickness after one of the most chaotic five days for stocks and shares in a long time. \u201cRising inflation, rising interest rates and a rising chance of a recession have all served to turn stomachs in equity-land. So far this year, the FTSE 100 has lost around 4%, while the US S&amp;P is down 24%, and the Nasdaq has slumped by almost 33%. Mould adds: This is a shock to the system for many investors who are relatively new to the game and haven\u2019t seen a proper market correction before. The big travel news of the morning is that Gatwick airport is reducing its summer capacity to ward off potential chaos. The move follows major disruption over the platinum jubilee and half-term holiday, when dozens of last-minute cancellations wrecked the travel plans of holidaymakers. London\u2019s second busiest airport will limit the number of daily take-offs and landings to 850 in August \u2013 about 50 more than the average in early June, but more than 10% below its pre-pandemic maximum. The airport is the biggest base for easyJet, which operates more than half of Gatwick slots, and the airline said it would be reviewing the details. It is likely to have to trim its summer schedules after it made hundreds of last-minute cancellations, more than any other UK carrier, in recent weeks due to multiple problems. Here\u2019s the full story: Shares in easyJet are up 1.4%, while British Airways owner IAG is 2% higher. Tesco\u2019s shares have dipped a little in early trading, down 0.2%, after this morning\u2019s trading update. Tesco\u2019s CEO Ken Murphy says shoppers are buying less and trading down to cheaper products. On a call with reporters, Murphy explained that customers are seeking out cheaper products in areas where prices have risen significantly, including bread, pasta and baked beans. People are also making more shopping trips, but buying less each time, as they try to manage their budgets as inflation eats into disposable incomes. Murphy says: \u201cWe are seeing higher frequency shopping trips, so there\u2019s an elevation in the number of shopping trips, we are seeing basket sizes coming down a little bit.\u201d Here\u2019s Matt Britzman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, on Tesco\u2019s trading statement and cost of living warning: \u201cAfter a slew of retailers warned on profits it\u2019s encouraging to see Tesco keeping guidance unchanged. That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re immune to the current pressures, back in April we heard consumer spending wasn\u2019t showing signs of weakness yet, but it always felt like it was round the corner. Those cost pressures are now starting to take their toll and management called out changing behaviours today, that puts more emphasis on grocers offering a strong value proposition which is an area Tesco deliver well on. Aldi Price Match and Low Everyday Prices are being rolled out further, with distribution up shy of 20% from last year, that\u2019s helping keep prices at a level consumers can stomach and the group\u2019s snapping up market share as a result.\u201d The UK stock market has opened cautiously as recession fears grip investors. The FTSE 100 index is up just 8 points at 7053 points, having hit a three-month low last night as markets tumbled. Oil giants BP (-2.3%) and Shell (-2%) are the top fallers, along with mining companies such as Rio Tinto (-1.3%) and Anglo American (-0.7%), on concerns that slower growth will mean less demand for oil and commodities. European markets have crept a little higher, with Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC up 0.2% each. Tesco faces a growing threat from discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, says Freetrade senior analyst Dan Lane, as customers seek out cheaper options. Lane predicts that inflation-induced belt tightening will lead more households to head to a German discounter, who have already been growing their market shares this year. Describing a \u2018changing customer behaviour\u2019 is as far as Tesco will go today but that almost certainly means shoppers are trading down and tackling the cost of living in the supermarket. Ken Murphy will hope his cocktail of Aldi Price Match, Low Everyday Prices and Clubcard Prices will keep customers around but it\u2019s the first of that list that\u2019s key now. Aldi Price Match will become even more important as long as customers are forced into real discount mode. Tesco experimented with its own cheap chain in Jack\u2019s and it just didn\u2019t work, so it\u2019s clear that keeping its ranges wide and its prices low has to be the strategy now. The cost of living crisis is damaging many people\u2019s physical and mental health, as the prices of necessities continue to soar. A new poll, for BBC News, also found that households across the UK are reducing the amount of food they are buying, socialising less, turning off lights, travelling less and expecting to work more, as they try to deal with rising prices. Here are the key points: More than half (56%) of UK adults say they reduced the amount of food they\u2019ve bought to save money Eight in ten (81%) UK adults report being worried about the cost of living -- with adults aged 35-54 most concerned. Of UK adults worried about the cost of living, two thirds (66%) say this is having a negative effect on their mental health. Young adults are significantly more likely to say they have experienced negative mental health effects, with five in six (83%) saying this. 45% of people report that worrying about the cost of living has had some negative effect on their physical health 49% of UK adults expect their personal financial situation to worsen in the next 6 months and 52% expect to work more hours. Approximately two in five UK adults say they expect to be able to save for Christmas in the next six months One quarter (24%) of UK adults say the support recently announced by the Government is enough to help people with the rising cost of living. Tesco\u2019s online sales in the UK have dropped by 14.5% compared with a year ago, today\u2019s trading statement shows. Sales at large stores are down slightly, while takings at convenience store are up 6.2%, as the relaxing of pandemic restrictions sees more people return to work, and less demand for home deliveries. Here\u2019s Steve Dresser, CEO of Grocery Insights, with early reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Customers are facing \u201cunprecedented increases in the cost of living\u201d as rising prices hammer households. That\u2019s the verdict from Tesco this morning, the day after the Bank of England warned that inflation will hit 11% this October, in the worst squeeze on households in decades. Ken Murphy, Tesco\u2019s chief executive, warns that the market environment \u201cremains incredibly challenging\u201d, with signs that customers are changing their shopping behaviour as inflation bites. The UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain has reported that its underlying UK sales dropped by 1.5% in the three months to 28th May (excluding fuel sales and VAT). That\u2019s compared with a year ago when the pandemic lockdown boosted demand for grocery. Murphy explains: Although difficult to separate from the significant impact of lapping last year\u2019s lockdowns, we are seeing some early indications of changing customer behaviour as a result of the inflationary environment. Customers are facing unprecedented increases in the cost of living and it is therefore even more important that we work with our supplier partners to mitigate as much inflation as possible.\u201d Tesco is also sticking to its profit forecasts, and says it has grown market share over the quarter against rivals. Like-for-like sales fell 2.4% in the Republic of Ireland over the quarter. As Tesco has over a quarter of Britain\u2019s grocery market, it has a very good view of the state of the economy. And Murphy\u2019s concerns come just a day after a report warned that food price rises in the UK could hit 15% this summer \u2013 the highest level in more than 20 years, with meat, cereals, dairy, fruit and vegetables are likely to be the worst affected. Anothe survey has found that more Britons are now skipping meals or using a food bank, due to rising inflation. Also coming up today Recession fears are gripping markets, after a raft of rate hikes this week from the Federal Reserve - its biggest in 28 years, the Swiss National Bank (unexpectedly), and the Bank of England to get a grip on inflation. Stocks slumped yesterday, with London\u2019s FTSE 100 racking up its worst fall in three months (down over 3%), as the blue-chip index fell to its lowest since March. Wall Street was hammered again, wiping another 3.25% off the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. Shares in Asia are now sliding today, on worries that these tighter monetary policies from central banks could undercut a global economic recovery. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is down 1.5%, while Australia\u2019s main index has shed almost 2%, The outlook is worsened by the likelihood of the conflict in Ukraine dragging on and the west\u2019s economic war on Russia leading to even higher energy prices ahead of the northern hemisphere winter. \u201cThe speed and degree of policy tightening may prove too much for economies to handle, particularly given the commodity price shock currently in play,\u201d economists at NAB bank in Australia said in a note on Friday. \u201cAs a result, recession risk for several of the major advanced economies, including the US, is uncomfortably high.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist of Betashares in Sydney, went further and predicted a US recession \u201cwithin the next 12 months\u201d due to persistent inflation and the Fed\u2019s pledge to raise rates until the inflation genie is back in the bottle. European stocks are expected to open higher today after Thursday\u2019s rout.

            "date": "2022-06-19T17:30:14Z",
            "content": "Coal- and gas-fired power plants could be paid to stay in business to bolster the stability of the main electricity grid and attract enough investment to build the equivalent of 50 times the original Snowy Hydro scheme by 2050, according to a high-level design paper released by the Energy Security Board. The fossil fuel generators would be required even as Australia continues to decarbonise the electricity sector, the paper released on Monday said. The report by the ESB backs payments for not just supplying power but also retaining the capacity to do so, as one of the most viable options to reform the faltering energy market after 2025. It also recommends that states be able to pick technologies suited to their carbon-cutting ambitions, in a bid to mollify anticipated opposition from some regions to the inclusion of fossil fuel plants in a new capacity market. The imperative, though, would be to improve investor certainty and incentives to fund a major revamp of the market. \u201cDesigned well, the capacity mechanism will enable a swifter, less risky and more orderly transition to a net zero emissions energy system,\u201d the paper argues. It says that to retain the \u201cenergy-only\u201d market would risk future supply gaps, particularly if more ageing coal or gas units abruptly exit, such as Victoria\u2019s Hazelwood coal plant did in 2017. The timetable for the market overhaul was already tight, even before soaring energy prices, blackout threats in five states and the suspension of the wholesale electricity market. The energy proposal will likely intensify the debate over whether a capacity market is needed \u2013 and how much it will cost consumers, who will ultimately pick up the tab. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, wants to discuss the ESB\u2019s proposal at a meeting next month with state and territory energy ministers. A final design plan is to be agreed on by February. Bowen told the energy ministers meeting earlier this month that he \u201csupported the principle of a capacity mechanism [while in opposition], provided it was consistent with net zero and encouraged new technology\u201d. Victoria and the ACT have explicitly opposed paying fossil fuel generators to stay open, and it remains to be seen whether they will accept the flexibility offered in the design plan as adequate in order to avoid them vetoing the changes. However, with the threat of recurring energy crises over the next few months, state governments will be under increasing pressure to act \u2013 particularly Victoria, which will hold an election in November. The electrification of transport, heavy industry and household heating adds to the urgency of building new electricity generation assets, the ESB said. \u201cOur electricity sector is undergoing a once-in-a-century transformation, as ageing fossil fuel generators are replaced by modern, clean energy sources,\u201d the paper said. In a statement to the media, the ESB said: \u201cThis transition needs to be carefully managed. The stakes have never been higher.\u201d According to the \u201cstep change\u201d scenario that the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) considers the most likely, the country will need about 122GW of new wind and solar, backed up by 45GW of new storage capacity, by 2050. It will also need 7GW of existing hydro and 9GW of gas-fired generation as all coal plants exit by 2043. \u201cThe new capacity required over the next 28 years is more than seven times that built over a similar time frame since the [national energy market] commenced 24 years ago and around 50 times the amount built by the Snowy Hydroelectric Scheme,\u201d the paper said. It adds: \u201cWhile 5GW of coal capacity has already announced it will close by 2030, as much as 14GW may become uneconomic by that time\u201d \u2013 or one-third of the Nem\u2019s existing readily dispatchable capacity. \u201cReplacement would require the equivalent of another Snowy 2.0 [pumped hydro plant] to be connected every year from now until 2030.\u201d The ESB \u2013 made up of Aemo, the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Markets Commission \u2013 indicated it backed a capacity market, based on the market in the UK. Aemo would control the market and hold twice-yearly auctions. The ESB argued keeping some existing capacity would allow for \u201cthe most efficient mix of resources to ensure reliability, avoid over-building new capacity before it is required [and] discourage premature exit of existing capacity before alternative resources are in place\u201d. It favoured \u201ctechnological neutrality\u201d, rather than picking winners. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The final design of the market could allow for some jurisdictions, like Victoria, to exclude fossil fuel generators from being eligible to receive revenue from the capacity mechanism. \u201cAny emissions reduction guidance and operationalisation in the capacity mechanism will not alter, or limit, the principle that jurisdictions must be able to determine which technologies are eligible for participation in a capacity mechanism in their region,\u201d the paper said. It added that since new power lines will be required to support the expansion of renewables and allow regions to better meet demand elsewhere in the grid, any new scheme should include payments to help expedite transmission projects. Submissions are open until 25 July. The ESB will put its final recommendations to the minister by the end of the year."

            "date": "2022-06-28T15:11:48Z",
            "content": "\u201cUnited against megalomania\u201d was how one German newspaper succinctly put it. Sanctions on Russian gold exports, the enlargement of the Nato intervention force to six times its current strength, an air missile defence system for Ukraine, and a broad commitment that the Group of Seven will be with Ukraine for as long as it takes. None of these, secured at this week\u2019s G7 summit held high in the Bavarian Alps in weather that ranged from glorious sunshine to shattering thunderstorms, is a paltry achievement. But there was one idea that stood out, both because it is new, divided the G7 and told a bigger story about the dilemma the west faces as it tries to damage Vladimir Putin\u2019s war economy. It is the proposal of a global price cap on energy. The idea has a simple attraction as it deals with two problems. It would bring energy prices back under some form of control, quelling a consumer backlash about inflation. At the same time, it would slow the flow of western funds to Putin\u2019s war machine, which is largely dependent on gas and oil revenues supplied by western purchases. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, explained at one briefing that the west was facing a dilemma. It had through its own measures cut the amount of Russian energy it was purchasing, but due to the rise in the price of oil, the revenues reaching Putin had not correspondingly declined. Russia is, according to business intelligence company Rystad Energy, due to secure at least $180bn (\u00a3147m). That is 45% higher than in 2021 and 181% higher than in 2020. The solution is at one level disarmingly simple \u2013 to refuse to pay as much as Putin and the market demand. Such an idea, so antithetical to free-market principles, might seem like a Marxist magic bullet but it comes with the backing of Mario Draghi, the former president of the European Central Bank, and Janet Yellen, the head of the US Treasury. And it is the brainchild of Washington academics. Advocates are, however, touting slightly different but not necessarily conflicting versions of the idea. Yellen principally wants to impose a cap on the price of seaborne oil, which will disproportionately affect Russia. Draghi thinks it is possible to go further by putting a cap on piped Russian gas. In some ways, his idea has greater potential since European consumption is not due to trail off as quickly. Francesco Giavazzi, the economic adviser to the Italian prime minister, explained Draghi\u2019s plan to the Guardian. He said: \u201cRussia\u2019s gas pipelines essentially go in two directions: to Europe and \u2013 for the moment with much smaller capacity \u2013 to China. A gas producer can slow the flow of gas, but it cannot stop it. Ultimately, if there is no flow, one will have to start burning gas in the air \u2013 which means burning dollars in the air. Putin could do it, but it would be very expensive for Russia, also politically.\u201d Draghi, who tends to get a hearing at summits on economic issues, explained: \u201cWe must reduce the amount of money going to Russia and get rid of one of the main causes of inflation.\u201d The oil cap would in theory work through one lever \u2013 insurance. Nearly 95% of the world\u2019s oil tanker fleet is covered by the International Group of Protection &amp; Indemnity Clubs in the heart of the City of London, and some firms based in continental Europe. European nations already agreed to end insurance for Russian oil shipments. Western governments could try to impose a price cap by telling buyers their insurance is available, but only as long as they agree not to pay more than a certain price for the oil onboard. In the papers that have been circulating at the G7, no figure is mentioned. It was clearly a battle at the G7 for the US to get Germany to engage with this idea, and they ended up with a classic summit compromise to allow technical experts to go away and study the idea. There are multiple drawbacks to the oil plan. First, it is possible the insurers will say they are being deprived of legitimate business for no valid reason. Second, the EU might have to reopen painfully agreed existing oil sanctions packages to endorse the idea. That would require unanimity, and Hungary might again block progress in favour of cheaper oil. The EU is also due to phase out oil purchases by the end of the year. Third, Putin might say, if he is being required to sell the oil at marginal costs, that he will simply not sell. He has shown with gas he is prepared to forgo some revenue by slowing or turning off the taps to intimidate gas-dependent countries such as Germany and Moldova. It might not be an economically rational response by Putin, but the Kremlin is not currently seen as a paragon of reason. Finally, and most importantly, is the question of whether oil-importing countries such as India that are less engaged in the war be willing to go along with the scheme. At one level they would have no choice if they had no shipping insurance. But India might also be positively disposed to the idea of getting an expensive commodity at a cheaper price. The pricing would be a matter of fine-tuning. Oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia might also not welcome this piece of novel market manipulation fearing that if this worked it sets a precedent that puts oil-consuming nations in the driving seat. Mark Mozur, a market analyst for S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, says \u201cthe battle has already been lost, for this year at least\u201d as Russia has reported high revenues. \u201cRussia\u2019s brazen behaviour in reducing gas flows to Europe should be seen in this context: it can do just fine without the additional income.\u201d What seemed intriguing ideas in the meeting rooms high in the Alps may yet emerge to have been world leaders clutching at straws. On the other hand, the belief that oil markets are free is drivel. They are riddled with cartels, and perhaps it is time for the consumers to have one as well."

            "date": "2022-06-13T16:39:42Z",
            "content": "The cryptocurrency market has endured another day of volatility as the Binance exchange temporarily suspended bitcoin withdrawals and the total value of the digital asset market dipped below $1tn (\u00a3820bn), after a cryptocurrency lender stopped customers from taking back their funds. The cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network halted withdrawals because of \u201cextreme market conditions\u201d, prompting a selloff. Bitcoin dropped to a 17-month low of $23,629 after the Celsius announcement, while ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, dropped more than 15% to $1,237, its lowest since January 2021. Meanwhile, Binance announced it had \u201ctemporarily paused\u201d bitcoin withdrawals owing to a \u201cstuck on-chain transaction\u201d, before announcing a resumption several hours later. The total value of the cryptocurrency market fell below $1tn after the sell-off, according to the data site CoinMarketCap, which had valued the market at almost $3tn in November. Celsius said in a blogpost it was \u201cpausing\u201d all withdrawals and transfers between accounts for its 1.7 million customers. The company offers customers high interest rates \u2013 as much as 18% \u2013 on their cryptocurrency deposits and pays the interest in crypto assets, which includes its own token, called CEL. \u201cDue to extreme market conditions, today we are announcing that Celsius is pausing all withdrawals, swap, and transfers between accounts,\u201d the platform said. \u201cWe are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honour, over time, its withdrawal obligations.\u201d Binance said in a statement that bitcoin withdrawals had been suspended shortly after midday in the UK \u201cdue to an earlier batch of transactions getting stuck from low transaction fees submitted\u201d. As a consequence there had been a backlog of bitcoin network withdrawals, Binance said. It then announced at 4.30pm BST that withdrawals had resumed. On 7 June, Celsius had published a blog seeking to reassure customers amid volatile conditions in the cryptocurrency markets, triggered initially by a collapse in the crypto project Terra. Headlined \u201cDamn the torpedoes, full speed ahead\u201d, the blog said the company had not had \u201cany issues meeting withdrawal requests\u201d. Celsius has offices in London, New York and Lithuania. Celsius\u2019s website tells customers they can \u201cborrow like a billionaire\u201d. It has $11.8bn in assets, down from more than $24bn in December last year. In November, it said it had raised $750m from investors including Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, one of Canada\u2019s largest pension funds. Like a bank, Celsius also has a retail loan operation, with customers able to borrow money, denominated in US dollars, from the service. Because of the impossibility of sending debt collectors after a crypto wallet, however, Celsius loans are \u201covercollateralised\u201d: customers need to deposit bitcoin or ethereum worth at least twice the value of the money they are borrowing. That can be useful if, for instance, a bitcoin millionaire needs some hard cash to buy a house but does not want to liquidate their bitcoin holdings because they are gambling the coin will go up again. However, unlike a bank, Celsius\u2019s loans charge a lower interest rate than it pays on deposits. The company makes up the difference through an opaque investment strategy that has in the past included investing $300m in bitcoin mining, offering more traditional loans to unnamed \u201cinstitutional investors\u201d at higher rates of interest, and taking large stakes in other cryptocurrency projects. Occasionally, that strategy has resulted in large losses: a hack of the decentralised investment platform BadgerDAO that wiped out that project was revealed to have cost Celsius $50m in bitcoin. The company also had a close relationship with the defunct stablecoin project Terra, at one point investing $500m of funds in the Anchor Protocol, Terra\u2019s own saving and lending service. Celsius also offers customers higher returns if they accept their interest payments in the project\u2019s own crypto token, CEL, which was trading at $7 last year and has fallen to less than $0.20. Cryptocurrencies have also been swept up in a market panic over rising inflation and higher interest rates, which has dulled the appetite for higher-risk assets. \u201cAs inflation proves to be an even trickier opponent to beat than expected, bitcoin and ether are continuing to get a severe bruising in the ring,\u201d said Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at the investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThey are prime victims of the flight away from risky assets as investors fret about spiralling consumer prices around the world.\u201d"

            "title": "Fight against inflation raises spectre of global recession",
            "date": "2022-06-17T16:00:43Z",
            "content": "The fight against inflation intensified this week as central banks stepped up their efforts to cool rising prices, and a global recession could be the price we pay. Investors reeled from the biggest rise in US interest rates in almost three decades, before Switzerland piled in with a shock increase in its borrowing costs, topped off by the fifth rise in a row from the Bank of England. This flurry of rate hikes showed that central bankers are deeply worried by the threat of red-hot inflation, and prepared to plunge the world economy into a downturn to cool it. This hawkishness sent global stock markets tumbling to their lowest point in over 18 months, in the biggest weekly drop since March 2020 as markets entered \u201cextreme bearish\u201d territory. America\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P 500 index fell into a bear market, 20% off its peak, hammering home that markets are in a steep, sustained downturn that could signal a recession. \u201cThe more aggressive line by central banks adds to headwinds for both economic growth and equities,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cThe risks of a recession are rising, while achieving a soft landing for the US economy appears increasingly challenging.\u201d Currency and bond markets were also rocked this week, while oil and copper prices were hit by slowdown fears. America\u2019s central bank dramatically hardened its resolve with a 75-basis-point hike on Wednesday, after an unexpected surge in US consumer prices showed that inflation had still not peaked. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, denied trying to induce a recession, but said demand had to be reduced to cool wage rises. Inflation is \u201cvery painful for people\u201d and many are only experiencing it seriously for the first time, he told reporters. Richard Hodges, manager of the $3.6bn (\u00a32.9bn) Nomura Global Dynamic bond fund, said the Fed was orchestrating a recession as it focused solely on reducing US inflation from its 40-year high of 8.6% in May. The Fed aims to rebalance the differential between post-pandemic, pent-up demand and Russia-Ukraine, Covid-hampered supply by reducing demand, said Hodges, who predicted that higher borrowing costs would hit the US economy fast. \u201cIn the latter part of this year, the economy will slow as the US consumer becomes increasingly squeezed by higher prices, a weak housing market and, to an extent, reduced employment certainty,\u201d Hodges added. Switzerland\u2019s central bank, the Swiss National Bank (SNB), sent shockwaves through global markets on Thursday with its first interest rate rise since 2007. The measure triggered a surge in the Swiss franc, and volatility through the foreign exchange markets, with the SNB saying it would hike further if needed. \u201cIt was probably the SNB that broke the camel\u2019s back, because if the Swiss are worried about inflation, we all should be,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at the financial trading firm Oanda. Compared with the drama in Washington DC and Zurich, the Bank of England\u2019s quarter-point rate rise on Thursday looked relatively tame. But Threadneedle Street also pledged to act \u201cforcefully\u201d if needed, prompting many economists to predict borrowers could be hit with a half-point hike in August. That would be the biggest rise in UK interest rates since 1995. Recession fears pushed the pound to a two-year low this week, leaving sterling down about 10% against the US dollar so far this year. Only the Bank of Japan bucked the trend. It stuck with its ultra-accommodative stance on Friday morning \u2013 and saw the yen promptly tumble 2% back towards this week\u2019s 24-year low against the US dollar. A global recession is already coming, warned Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. He said the US faces a downturn in manufacturing and housing. Despite the tumble in equities this year, shares may not yet be good value. BlackRock said it was resisting calls to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d as valuations had not really improved, there was a risk of the Fed overtightening, and profit margin pressures were mounting. Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, said: \u201cStock are looking quite cheap on measures such as price-earnings multiples on a historic basis, but the worry now is that a recession is imminent and earnings which are the denominator in P/E ratios may decline quite sharply. Memories of the eurozone crisis came flooding back this week, as the gap between Italian and safe-haven German government debt hit its highest level since 2014. Fears that heavily indebted Italy was heading back to the \u201cdanger zone\u201d prompted the European Central Bank (ECB) to hold an emergency meeting to find ways to cool the bond market rout. The ECB vice-president, Luis de Guindo, said a new anti-crisis tool would deal with \u201cunwarranted fragmentation\u201d in the borrowing costs of eurozone members. However, the ECB could struggle to keep bond spreads under control while also tightening monetary policy. It could also provoke the ire of Germany if it provided government financing to some eurozone countries without conditions. \u201cA greater sense of crisis will be required before policymakers act to address weaknesses within the fabric of the monetary union,\u201d predicted Mark Dowding, CIO of BlueBay Asset Management. Dowding said trust in central banks would be needed before markets could stabilise, along with data showing that inflation concerns have been addressed. He compared the current rate rise cycle to a trip to the dentist. \u201cFrom that point of view, it may be preferable to take the pain quickly and get the hiking cycle done, rather than drawing it out. In this way, the peak may end up being lower than otherwise may be the case,\u201d he said. Cryptocurrency investors were certainly left feeling numb, after Bitcoin tumbled by 30% in a week, crypto lending platform Celsius Network halted withdrawals, and the cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital reportedly failed to meet margin calls from its lenders. Having boomed during the days of easy money, crypto assets may not have hit the bottom yet. \u201cWe\u2019re plummeting into a cold crypto winter, and we haven\u2019t hit the freezing point yet. Rumours and fears are swirling that bitcoin will drop below $20,000 amid wider volatility in financial markets and sell-offs in other asset classes,\u201d said Dr Lil Read, senior thematic analyst at GlobalData."

            "date": "2022-06-27T23:01:03Z",
            "content": "Council leaders in England have said a multibillion-pound financial crisis caused by rising inflation could make local services unviable and even lead to local authorities going bankrupt, unless the government offers emergency funding. The cross-party Local Government Association (LGA) said local services that were seemingly secure just three months ago were now at risk of closure or cuts as councils scramble to manage an unforeseen \u00a32.4bn rise in energy and pay costs. The Tory chair of the LGA, James Jamieson, said the impact on services would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d and hamper councils\u2019 efforts to support people through the cost of living crisis at a time when demand for services was rising, especially in areas such as adult and children\u2019s social care, and homelessness. \u201cSoaring inflation, energy prices and \u2018national living wage\u2019 pressures are putting council services at risk. Budgets are having to be reset, with potential cuts to the essential services people rely on, in the middle of a cost of living crisis,\u201d Jamieson said. The LGA estimates that without adequate long-term funding \u2013 in effect a revisiting of the spending review settlement agreed last autumn \u2013 the collective increase in inflationary costs faced by English councils this year will be \u00a32.4bn, growing to \u00a33bn in 2023-24 and \u00a33.6bn in 2024-25. It argues that these pressures, coming on the back of more than a decade of austerity cuts to local authority funding, pose a \u201cserious risk to the future financial viability of some services and councils\u201d. Jamieson added: \u201cInflation is not going to come down overnight. As our analysis shows, the impact on our local services could be disastrous. This will stifle our economic recovery and undermine government ambitions to level up the country.\u201d The Guardian revealed earlier this month that councils were anticipating a collective and unexpected \u00a31.7bn shortfall this year as a result of inflation. The LGA has updated this to include estimates from England\u2019s 181 district councils, as well as additional analysis of the impact of increases in the national living wage. When budgets were set earlier this year, councils were typically factoring in average pay and inflation costs of about 3%. However, inflation is now at 9%, with the Bank of England predicting it will hit 11% by October. Councils are required by law to balance their books each financial year, meaning that fixing financial shortfalls cannot be put off. This is likely to lead to job losses, and the abandonment or delay of building projects such as new schools or regeneration schemes. It could also result in service cuts, from libraries and leisure centres to road repairs. John Boyce, the Liberal Democrat leader of Oadby and Wigston borough council in Leicestershire and an executive member of the District Councils\u2019 Network, said: \u201cThis could push some councils over the edge, or they will have to make radical cuts. That\u2019s difficult because we are already cut to the bone. Cuts means staff, and staff equal frontline services.\u201d Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up, housing and communities secretary, said: \u201cThere is a crisis on the horizon. The cleaners, carers, bin collectors and other council workers that kept this country going during the pandemic and are now struggling to feed their families deserve a pay rise. \u201cBut councils have seen billions cut from their budgets in the last decade and are now facing billions more in extra costs due to soaring inflation. They cannot square this circle alone. \u201cMinisters are the only people who can get everybody round the table and find a solution to protect vital council services. They must urgently do their job to prevent yet more chaos.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis year, we made an additional \u00a33.7bn available to councils so they can continue to deliver key services, and we are working with the sector to understand the impact of emerging challenges.\u201d However, the LGA, which hosts its annual conference in Harrogate this week, said that inflation had already eaten through this year\u2019s increase, and with the lion\u2019s share of the three-year spending review increase falling in 2022-23, councils would be even more exposed in future years. It estimated a net funding gap of \u00a31.4bn this year and \u00a33.4bn next year, rising to \u00a34.5bn in 2024-25."

            "content": "Government borrowing was higher than expected in May at \u00a314bn as soaring inflation sent interest payments on the UK\u2019s debt to a monthly record. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said debt interest payments leapt 70% on a year ago to \u00a37.6bn, the third highest debt interest payment made by central government in any single month and the highest payment in May on record. Some economists said the increase in borrowing and the UK\u2019s slowing economy was likely to push government borrowing \u00a320bn higher this year than the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster, expected at its last estimate in March. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cWith the economy weakening and interest rates rising, the public finances will probably perform worse this year than the OBR forecast.\u201d Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the extra \u00a314bn spending by the government to protect low-income families and pensioners from inflation would also dent the public finances in the second half of the financial year. \u201cAccordingly, we think that public borrowing will total about \u00a3130bn this year, well above the OBR\u2019s \u00a399bn forecast,\u201d he said. Rishi Sunak said the increase in debt interest made him circumspect about allowing the UK\u2019s spending deficit to rise over the coming years. The chancellor plans to cut the government\u2019s annual spending deficit more severely over the next four years than many European counterparts to limit the rise in the UK\u2019s debt-to-GDP level to 90%. He said: \u201cRising inflation and increasing debt interest costs pose a challenge for the public finances, as they do for family budgets. That is why we are taking a balanced approach \u2013 using our fiscal firepower to provide targeted help with the cost of living, while remaining on track to get debt down.\u201d Borrowing was \u00a34bn less than in May last year, but was still the third-highest May borrowing since monthly records began in 1993 and \u00a38.5bn more than in May 2019, before the pandemic struck. The ONS said the jump in UK debt interest payments is down to the recent surge in the retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, which determines payouts on index-linked gilts. So far this financial year, debt interest payments have totalled \u00a314.1bn, up \u00a34.7bn year on year, the ONS said. The consumer prices measure of inflation, which is targeted by the Bank of England, hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in May."

            "date": "2022-06-19T10:00:05Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s no secret that workers\u2019 income is not keeping up with inflation. Analysis from the Brookings Institution thinktank found that although some big companies had increased total compensation, those increases were less than half the going rate of inflation. And inflation at that time was about 7% \u2013 it\u2019s since jumped to 8.6%. Other studies have shown that one in five American workers are living paycheck to paycheck. Overall hourly wages, according to the US government, have increased about 6% over the past year, a healthy rise, but still not enough to keep up with the cost of living. Now, a new study released in Pride month from the insurance company Nationwide finds that one group of workers appears to be hit harder by inflation than others. That group are members of the LGBTQ+ community. According to the report \u2013 which surveyed 1,000 nationally representative adult US consumers and 1,000 members of the LGBTQ+ community in late April \u2013 almost two-thirds of LGBTQ+ Americans said that they were living paycheck to paycheck \u201cmost of the time\u201d and that figure jumped to 72% for Black LGBTQ+ people. LGBTQ+ survey respondents indicated they were less knowledgable than the general population about important financial topics, including retirement planning (by 13%), estate planning (12%) and investing in the stock market (8%). Nationwide says that as many as two-thirds of LGBTQ+ Americans reported facing \u201cunique\u201d financial challenges that most non-LGBTQ+ people do not. These challenges include having their careers being \u201cnegatively impacted\u201d by their gender identity or sexual orientation, as well as higher than average healthcare and health insurance costs than non-LGBTQ+ workers. These individuals also report higher healthcare costs and more difficulty starting a family and finding housing. The country has come a long way in protecting the rights of people who identify as LGBTQ+, but obviously there\u2019s still more progress to be made. All this affects small business owners. Why? Because small businesses employ more than half of the workers in this country. And \u2013 besides inflation \u2013 our biggest challenge is finding and retaining good workers. Being more sensitive to the needs of this demographic can have a big impact on our workforce, if only we were to pay more attention. So what steps can we take? The first, and most obvious, is offering higher and more competitive compensation. This is easier said than done. Most of my clients are struggling to stay profitable in these times of higher material costs and a slowing economy. But one of the main reasons why so many businesses have been hit by the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d is that workers are shifting jobs simply for higher wages, not only because they need to in order to keep up with inflation but also because \u2026 they can. Larger companies and smart business owners have realized this need, shifted their compensation levels up, made other changes in their cost structures to accommodate (including raising prices) and have benefited for the long term by being able to attract and retain better workers. Second, if your company hires hourly workers \u2013 and if your cashflow can accommodate \u2013 consider offering same-day pay. This type of compensation arrangement has seen significant growth over the past few years and it\u2019s no wonder, considering how many workers are living paycheck to paycheck. With a same-day pay program you can offer as much as 50% of a worker\u2019s earnings on the day they work, with the balance being paid at the end of the payroll period. The calculations are complex thanks to taxes and other withholdings, so it\u2019s best to use a service like Paychex or DailyPay to help administer the program. But once set up it can be a great recruitment tool and a big help towards keeping your existing employees happy. The Nationwide survey does make us aware of the particular issues surrounding our LGBTQ+ workers, who make up approximately 7% of the population as a whole (about 23 million people). That\u2019s a big number. And a big concern. Some of my very best clients know that the happiness of their workers is essential to the success of their business, so they make a special effort to pay attentionwhen there are potential problems. This is not just an LGBTQ+ issue. It\u2019s a profitability issue."

            "content": "Janet Yellen told Congress that the US is facing \u201cunacceptable levels of inflation\u201d on Tuesday as the treasury secretary defended herself from criticism of her previous comments that rising prices were \u201ctransitory\u201d. Although the hearing with the Senate finance committee was centered on Joe Biden\u2019s budget for 2023, Yellen was forced to answer questions on inflation, including some on how she once said that inflation would be \u201ctransitory\u201d, or temporary. In response to a question about how she had initially framed inflation, Yellen said: \u201cWhen I said that inflation would be transitory, what I was not anticipating was a scenario in which we would end up contending with multiple variants of Covid that would be scrambling our economy and global supply chains. \u201cI was not envisioning impacts on food and energy prices we\u2019ve seen from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u201d Yellen said she and the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, \u201ccould have used a better term than transitory\u201d. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we have huge inflation pressures, that inflation is really our top economic problem at this point and that it\u2019s critical that we address it. I do expect inflation to remain high, although I very much hope that it will be coming down now.\u201d Last week, Yellen drew headlines for making similar comments to CNN, during an interview in which she had been \u201cwrong then about the path inflation would take\u201d. At the hearing on Tuesday, Yellen said: \u201cWe currently face macroeconomic challenges, including unacceptable levels of inflation, as well as the headwinds associated with the disruptions caused by the pandemic\u2019s effect on supply chain and the effects of supply-side disturbances to oil and food market.\u201d The Biden administration has been delicately walking the inflation tightrope over the last few months as they try to push an aggressive response while also emphasizing other indicators that prove the economy is still improving, particularly in the jobs market. Biden celebrated the figures shown in May\u2019s jobs report, released last Friday, which showed that 390,000 new jobs were created that month. \u201cBecause of the enormous progress we\u2019ve made on the economy, Americans can tackle inflation from a position of strength,\u201d Biden said in remarks following the release of the jobs report. Republicans in Tuesday\u2019s hearing repeatedly pointed to the passing of the $1.9bn American Rescue Plan, which was passed in March last year and delivered further coronavirus aid, as a key driver of inflation. In response, Yellen noted that Biden \u201cinherited an economy with very high unemployment\u201d. \u201cWe had to address the possibility that this could be the downturn that could match the Great Recession,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the policy, there were various risks taken into account. Of course, inflation was one of them. But the overwhelming risk was that America would be marred by a deep and long recession.\u201d Yellen pointed to the expansion of child tax credit, which gave extra assistance to families, in the stimulus package that \u201cresulted in a dramatic reduction in childhood poverty and financial insecurity for American families and contributed little to nothing to inflation\u201d. She also said the US is \u201cnot the only country that\u2019s experiencing inflation \u2013 you can see that in virtually every developed country around the world\u201d."

            "content": "Stagflation has two elements to it: weak growth and rapidly rising prices. Britain already has the inflation; it is now getting the stagnation. To be sure, the main reason behind the 0.3% fall in gross domestic product in April was the scaling back in NHS Covid 19 testing and vaccinations, which alone shaved 0.5 percentage points off growth. Yet even taking into account reduced health output the economy would still have expanded only by 0.1% in April after a 0.1% decline in March. That\u2019s stagnation by any measure. What\u2019s more, all the main components of GDP \u2013 services, production and construction \u2013 contracted in April, the first time they have all negatively contributed to monthly GDP since the country was in lockdown in January 2021. The Office for National Statistics said some of the 1% drop in manufacturing output could be attributed to higher fuel prices, while the 0.4% fall in construction output followed an increase in repair work in March caused by February\u2019s storm Eunice. April brought an increase in national insurance contributions and although there was no immediate sign of consumers cutting back on spending in the shops or eating out, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macro says most workers won\u2019t have received their smaller pay packets until the end of the month. May\u2019s growth figures will reflect the tax hike and the impact of rising petrol prices, he predicts. In its May monetary policy report the Bank of England said it expected the economy to expand by 0.1% in the second quarter of 2022. Even this modest forecast now looks a stretch, since it would take growth of 0.4-0.5% in May and June to be achieved. On past form, the extra day\u2019s holiday to mark the Queen\u2019s platinum jubilee will alone reduce growth in the second quarter by 0.4 percentage points. It now looks odds on that the economy will contract in the second quarter, and despite the \u00a315bn of extra support provided by Rishi Sunak last month, the chances of a recession \u2013 two successive quarters of negative growth \u2013 have increased. Even so, the inflationary part of the stagflation scenario means the Bank of England will still raise interest rates for a fifth time in a row later this week. The weakness of GDP makes it more likely it will opt for a 0.25-point increase rather than the more aggressive 0.5-point jump some in the City had been expecting."

            "date": "2022-06-17T16:00:43Z",
            "content": "The fight against inflation intensified this week as central banks stepped up their efforts to cool rising prices, and a global recession could be the price we pay. Investors reeled from the biggest rise in US interest rates in almost three decades, before Switzerland piled in with a shock increase in its borrowing costs, topped off by the fifth rise in a row from the Bank of England. This flurry of rate hikes showed that central bankers are deeply worried by the threat of red-hot inflation, and prepared to plunge the world economy into a downturn to cool it. This hawkishness sent global stock markets tumbling to their lowest point in over 18 months, in the biggest weekly drop since March 2020 as markets entered \u201cextreme bearish\u201d territory. America\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P 500 index fell into a bear market, 20% off its peak, hammering home that markets are in a steep, sustained downturn that could signal a recession. \u201cThe more aggressive line by central banks adds to headwinds for both economic growth and equities,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cThe risks of a recession are rising, while achieving a soft landing for the US economy appears increasingly challenging.\u201d Currency and bond markets were also rocked this week, while oil and copper prices were hit by slowdown fears. America\u2019s central bank dramatically hardened its resolve with a 75-basis-point hike on Wednesday, after an unexpected surge in US consumer prices showed that inflation had still not peaked. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, denied trying to induce a recession, but said demand had to be reduced to cool wage rises. Inflation is \u201cvery painful for people\u201d and many are only experiencing it seriously for the first time, he told reporters. Richard Hodges, manager of the $3.6bn (\u00a32.9bn) Nomura Global Dynamic bond fund, said the Fed was orchestrating a recession as it focused solely on reducing US inflation from its 40-year high of 8.6% in May. The Fed aims to rebalance the differential between post-pandemic, pent-up demand and Russia-Ukraine, Covid-hampered supply by reducing demand, said Hodges, who predicted that higher borrowing costs would hit the US economy fast. \u201cIn the latter part of this year, the economy will slow as the US consumer becomes increasingly squeezed by higher prices, a weak housing market and, to an extent, reduced employment certainty,\u201d Hodges added. Switzerland\u2019s central bank, the Swiss National Bank (SNB), sent shockwaves through global markets on Thursday with its first interest rate rise since 2007. The measure triggered a surge in the Swiss franc, and volatility through the foreign exchange markets, with the SNB saying it would hike further if needed. \u201cIt was probably the SNB that broke the camel\u2019s back, because if the Swiss are worried about inflation, we all should be,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at the financial trading firm Oanda. Compared with the drama in Washington DC and Zurich, the Bank of England\u2019s quarter-point rate rise on Thursday looked relatively tame. But Threadneedle Street also pledged to act \u201cforcefully\u201d if needed, prompting many economists to predict borrowers could be hit with a half-point hike in August. That would be the biggest rise in UK interest rates since 1995. Recession fears pushed the pound to a two-year low this week, leaving sterling down about 10% against the US dollar so far this year. Only the Bank of Japan bucked the trend. It stuck with its ultra-accommodative stance on Friday morning \u2013 and saw the yen promptly tumble 2% back towards this week\u2019s 24-year low against the US dollar. A global recession is already coming, warned Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. He said the US faces a downturn in manufacturing and housing. Despite the tumble in equities this year, shares may not yet be good value. BlackRock said it was resisting calls to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d as valuations had not really improved, there was a risk of the Fed overtightening, and profit margin pressures were mounting. Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, said: \u201cStock are looking quite cheap on measures such as price-earnings multiples on a historic basis, but the worry now is that a recession is imminent and earnings which are the denominator in P/E ratios may decline quite sharply. Memories of the eurozone crisis came flooding back this week, as the gap between Italian and safe-haven German government debt hit its highest level since 2014. Fears that heavily indebted Italy was heading back to the \u201cdanger zone\u201d prompted the European Central Bank (ECB) to hold an emergency meeting to find ways to cool the bond market rout.

The world\u2019s richest man said a recession in the US was inevitable but would most probably come in the short term. \u201cA recession is inevitable at some point. As to whether there is a recession in the near term, that is more likely than not,\u201d Musk said in an interview via videolink at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha on Tuesday. Musk said Tesla was planning to reduce salaried staff numbers by 10%, confirming plans revealed in an internal email this month by Reuters. \u201cTesla is reducing its salaried workforce by roughly 10% over the next probably three months or so,\u201d Musk said at the event hosted by Bloomberg. \u201cWe expect to grow our hourly workforce. But we grew very fast on the salaried side, and we grew a little too fast in some areas.\u201d Tesla employs just under 100,000 people but Musk said the cuts would amount to a reduction of about 3.5% because salaried workers represent around one-third of the workforce, while Tesla is increasing the amount of staff it employs on an hourly basis, who account for about two-thirds of the workforce. Musk\u2019s outlook echoes comments from other executives, including JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, who warned this month that a \u201churricane is right out there down the road coming our way\u201d. The US president, Joe Biden, reiterated on Monday that he felt a US recession was not inevitable, even as the world\u2019s largest economy struggles to tackle high petrol prices and inflation, which is at its highest in 40 years. Former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers told NBC News on Sunday that he too expected a recession. Musk also spoke about his $44bn (\u00a336bn) bid to buy Twitter, which received a formal endorsement from the social media firm\u2019s board on Tuesday. Musk said there were unresolved issues, including the debt portion of the deal and the number of spam users. Lawyers representing the Tesla boss have warned he could walk away from the deal due to a dispute over how Twitter calculates the number of fake or spam accounts on its platform. \u201cWe\u2019re still awaiting resolution on that matter, and that is a very significant matter,\u201d he said, reiterating doubts over Twitter\u2019s claims that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its 229m daily active users. Musk also expressed doubt about the debt funding for the deal, which is being raised from a consortium of banks that have pledged $13bn. \u201cAnd then of course, there\u2019s the question of, will the, the debt portion of the round come together? And then will the shareholders vote in favour?\u201d Musk said he would like to get 80% of North America and half the world on Twitter. \u201cMy aspiration for Twitter is to be as inclusive as possible,\u201d he said."

She told ABC\u2019s This Week host George Stephanopoulous that her financial outlook results from how the economy has \u201cbeen growing at a very rapid rate, as the economy, as the labor market, has recovered and we have reached full employment\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s natural now that we expect a transition to steady and stable growth, but I don\u2019t think a recession is at all inevitable,\u201d Yellen added. Pressed on the issue of inflation, which polls indicate is a top priority for US voters as the midterm elections in November approach, Yellen said inflation causes are global, not local, and those factors are unlikely to diminish immediately. Yellen said some trade tariffs on China inherited from the administration of former President Donald Trump made \u201cno strategic sense\u201d. She added that Biden was reviewing them as a way to bring down inflation. \u201cClearly, inflation is unacceptably high,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIt\u2019s President Biden\u2019s top priority to bring it down.\u201d The US central bank\u2019s chairperson, Jerome Powell, has also said \u201cit\u2019s his goal to bring it down while maintaining a strong labor economy,\u201d according to Yellen. The comments from Biden\u2019s top economist came reflect the administration\u2019s ongoing push to change the national narrative around the economy. Yellen\u2019s comments were more in line with that push than they have been recently. Last month, she broke with the administration\u2019s preferred talking points when she admitted to the American public that she \u201cwas wrong\u201d about the path inflation would take. Recent economic confidence polling has shown sharp drops, with Gallup recording the lowest reading during the coronavirus pandemic, and it\u2019s likely the lowest confidence has been since the tail end of the Great Recession in early 2009. Dissatisfaction with Biden\u2019s handling of the economy could ricochet through the midterms elections. Central to those concerns are gasoline prices, which have surged during Biden\u2019s term. On Sunday, Yellen voiced measured support for temporarily pausing gasoline taxes, describing it as an idea \u201ccertainly worth considering\u201d. Separately, energy secretary Jennifer Granholm warned drivers against expecting quick relief in prices amid tight oil supplies worldwide. The US energy information administration has projected that prices at the pump will average about $4.27 per gallon in the third quarter \u2013 down from the current $4.98 \u2013 but that its forecast could be \u201ccompletely upended\u201d by world events. \u201cWe know this is going to be a tough summer because driving season just started,\u201d Granholm said. \u201cAnd we know that there will be continued upward pull on demand.\u201d Looking ahead to Biden\u2019s scheduled \u2013 and highly controversial \u2013 visit to Saudi Arabia next month, Granholm said the president \u201chas asked for all suppliers around the globe to increase production\u201d. The planned trip has become a lightning rod for criticism as it appears to be a reversal of the president\u2019s stated intent to make the kingdom a \u201cpariah\u201d over its human-rights record, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the CIA concluded was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Granholm said Biden is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about human rights in Saudi Arabia and surely will raise the issue, \u201cbut he\u2019s also very concerned about what people are experiencing at the pump and Saudi Arabia is head of OPEC\u201d. \u201cWe need to have increased production so that everyday citizens in America will not be feeling this pain that they\u2019re feeling right now,\u201d Granholm added. Yellen was not alone Sunday in presenting a more upbeat economic message than the recessionist narrative most US economists are presenting. A survey of economists published Sunday by The Wall Street Journal raised the probability of recession to 44% in the next 12 months \u2013 a level of probability that the newspaper wrote is \u201cusually seen only on the brink of or during actual recession.\u201d The director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese, told Margaret Brennan on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation that the US \u201cis in an uncertain moment and we face real challenges, global challenges.\u201d \u201cWe need to navigate through this transition in a way that gets us to stable growth without giving up all of the incredible economic gains that we\u2019ve made,\u201d he said. Pressed on how the administration plans to lower inflation, running at a 40-year high of 8.6% and projected by the congressional budget office to remain high into 2024, Deese said a package of legislative measures was being prepared in congress to lower prescription drug costs, utility costs and enacting tax reforms. \u201cIf we can do a package like that we can move forward in the near future,\u201d Deese said. \u201cIt will not only help in lowering prices, but it will send a signal to the markets and the global economy that the United States is really deadly serious about taking on this inflation.\u201d In a rare one-on-one interview last week, Biden set out his administration\u2019s public line. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s not inevitable,\u201d he said to the Associated Press. \u201cSecondly, we\u2019re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation.\u201d As clouds gathered over the US economic position during the past 18 months, administration economic officials and central bankers have reformed their inflation message from \u201ctransitory\u201d to an economy, as Deese said, that is \u201cin a transition.\u201d"

            "content": "The global rout in stock markets, cryptocurrencies and other risky assets has gathered pace amid growing concern that out-of-control inflation, rising interest rates and slowing growth could combine to tip the world into recession. Share prices fell in Asia on Friday at the beginning of what was likely to be another torrid day for investors spooked by the US Federal Reserve\u2019s decision this week to raise interest rates by the largest margin for almost 30 years. Other leading central banks such as the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank have followed suit \u2013 the latter in its first hike for 15 years \u2013 sending economists scrambling to revise their forecast for growth downwards. Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management in Hong Kong said: \u201cNo central bankers worth their weight would put inflation-fighting credentials on the line and import higher energy inflation via a weaker currency. Despite the Bank of Japan announcing on Friday that it was sticking to its ultra-loose monetary policy, he added the rate rises eleswhere were a \u201chighly ominous signal for stock market investors... the global race to hike rates is nowhere near the finishing line\u201d. Many believe that the United States may be in recession by next year, raising the prospect of a wider global slump. Shares in the world\u2019s biggest economy have suffered their worst start to a year for 60 years with the S&amp;P 500 benchmark index down 23% since January after losing another 3.25% on Thursday. Analysts at JP Morgan said the state of the S&amp;P 500 \u201cimplies an 85% chance of a US recession\u201d. The falls \u2013 mirrored on the Dow Jones average, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and UK and European markets \u2013 did nothing to boost confidence in Asia Pacific. The Nikkei in Tokyo was off 1.65% and was on track for its worst week of losses for two years, as was India\u2019s main Nifty index. In Sydney, the ASX200 was down 2% on Friday afternoon. The cryptocurrency rout also shows no sign of abating with bitcoin down 7.8% and ethereum 8.45% worse off. In addition, the Financial Times reported that the Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital \u2013 which has $10bn under management \u2013 failed to meet margin calls this week amid the slide in crypto values. The outlook is worsened by the likelihood of the conflict in Ukraine dragging on and the west\u2019s economic war on Russia leading to even higher energy prices ahead of the northern hemisphere winter. \u201cThe speed and degree of policy tightening may prove too much for economies to handle, particularly given the commodity price shock currently in play,\u201d economists at NAB bank in Australia said in a note on Friday. \u201cAs a result, recession risk for several of the major advanced economies, including the US, is uncomfortably high.\u201d David Bassanese, chief economist of Betashares in Sydney, went further and predicted a US recession \u201cwithin the next 12 months\u201d due to persistent inflation and the Fed\u2019s pledge to raise rates until the inflation genie is back in the bottle. As a result, he said that share markets in the US had further to fall. \u201cThere seems scope for equity markets to fall further. My base case is the ultimate peak-to-trough decline in the S&amp;P 500 will be 35%, implying a decline to 3,100 from its closing peak of 4,796 on 3 January.\u201d It closed at 3,667 points on Thursday. The ongoing coronavirus lockdowns in China are causing further problems for the global economy. Supply chain snarl-ups in the world\u2019s second largest economy that started during the pandemic are predicted to continue into next year at least thanks to the shutdown of Shanghai and other key regions. The bigger picture is that China was already facing problems ranging from the decoupling from the west amid geopolitical tensions, a faltering, hugely indebted property market, and the uncertainty caused by president Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on large tech companies. As the west increases rates, China\u2019s central bank has been cutting them and the government in Beijing has been throwing more stimulus at the economy. It helped mainland shares and the Hong Kong market buck the downward trend in Friday\u2019s trading, but may not be enough to refloat the global economy as its massive $4tn stimulus did after the global financial crisis of 2008-09. The Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise rates by 0.25% on Thursday was criticised by some as too little too late to stop inflation in its tracks. One forecast says prices will be rising by 11% by October and another report said food price rises could top 15% in the autumn. The British economy shrank by 0.3% in May, according to figures released on Monday, and after a 0.1% decline it \u201cincreased\u201d the chances that the economy will slip into recession, according to Paul Dales, the chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. The eurozone is also limping badly and is riven by doubts over how to deal with the diverging real borrowing costs between different countries which mean Italy has to pay more than Germany despite having the same currency. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) says in a report that although the US rebounded from the pandemic slump more quickly than other economies, there were signs that consumer spending was weakening. Its base view is that US growth will stop short of a recession, but it could be a close call. \u201cEIU\u2019s core forecast is that economic growth in the US will slow sharply over the course of 2022 and 2023, owing to stubbornly high inflation, rising interest rates and stalling growth elsewhere,\u201d it said. \u201cWe expect consumer demand to be resilient enough to avoid an outright recession, thanks in part to the tight labour market and strong household balance sheets. However, this does not mean that a recession is completely off the cards.\u201d"

            "content": "Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, has teamed up with direct action campaigners to form a new \u201cred/green\u201d climate and social justice movement which aims to stage a \u201cmajor wave of popular mass action\u201d later this year. Corbyn\u2019s Peace and Justice Project, which he set up in 2021, is joining forces with Just Stop Oil campaigners who have staged a series of disruptive climate actions over the past six months. The new movement \u2013 which also includes trade unionists, civil society organisations and leftwing activists \u2013 argues that the current \u201cdestructive economic model\u201d is the root cause of the cost of living crisis as well as the climate crisis. Ahead of the launch on Thursday, Corbyn said: \u201cMovements are the motor of change in history. When we come together, we can transform the world. And we must because those in power \u2013 the fossil fuel giants, the billionaires and the governments they own \u2013 are picking our pockets and stealing our future.\u201d Just Stop Oil, the direct action climate crisis group that developed out of Extinction Rebellion, has hit the headlines in recent months with its activists targeting oil refineries, petrol stations and high-profile events such as Premier League football matches. Its decision to work with Corbyn\u2019s group and leftwing trade unionists suggests many younger climate activists see the economic system as the root cause of the climate crisis and growing poverty and inequality. Lawrence Leather, 22, a spokesperson for Just Stop Oil, said: \u201cAs the climate breaks down, the cost of everything will rise. That\u2019s why we want to bring together the broadest coalition we can, including the trade unions, Britain\u2019s biggest social movement, around concrete demands that decarbonise and put money back in people\u2019s pockets.\u201d Under Corbyn\u2019s leadership, Labour offered a far-reaching climate justice agenda, including a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs. It also set out plans to upgrade the UK\u2019s housing stock, revitalise public transport and nationalise energy companies to reduce bills. The new campaign, called We All Want to Just Stop Oil, says it will stage its first major action \u2013 a march in central London \u2013 on Saturday 23 July. Leather said: \u201cIt\u2019s been over a year since Sir David King, the former UK chief scientific adviser, warned the \u2018next three to four years will determine the future of humanity\u2019. But still the government refuses to do anything \u2026 We are encouraging everyone to step up now and join the movement. The politicians won\u2019t save us. It\u2019s on us to change history.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-23T12:06:40Z",
            "content": "Climate justice groups have joined RMT picket lines across Great Britain to support the rail strike and argue the government must invest in public transport to avoid the worst impacts of global heating. Hundreds of activists from several groups including Just Stop Oil, War on Want, Extinction Rebellion [XR] and Friends of the Earth Scotland have joined striking workers on more than 40 picket lines in towns and cities, with more expected to turn out in the coming days. They argue that well-funded, publicly owned and affordable public transport will be essential to reduce the UK\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels, moving people away from cars to more energy-efficient trains. But they warn the cuts and redundancies proposed by the government will not only hit workers in the middle of a cost of living crisis but also weaken the rail network, locking in high carbon transport such as cars for decades to come. According to government figures, transport is the UK\u2019s largest source of emissions, responsible for 27% of greenhouse gases in 2019. Of this, 55% comes from cars and most of the remainder is from vans and lorries. Bruce Murphy, an organiser with Just Stop Oil, is one of scores of the group\u2019s activists who have been on picket lines in the past few days. \u201cYou can\u2019t separate the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis and I think more people are understanding that in both the green movement and the progressive labour movement,\u201d he said. Murphy, who was on a picket line in Manchester, said trade unions were Britain\u2019s biggest social movement and that strikes were \u201ca powerful tool of civil resistance for workers and communities being forced to pay for a crisis they didn\u2019t cause. \u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with trade unions because I know that together our collective power can take on the crisis we face in our cost of living, climate and our democracy.\u201d Asad Rehman, a leading climate justice campaigner and director at War on Want, said the root causes of the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis were \u201ccorporate profiteering that is pushing millions into poverty, and rolling back hard won rights that are critical to guaranteeing everyone a dignified life. \u201cNow more than ever we need to invest in cheap, green, low-carbon mass transport, such as railways, with decent pay and conditions for rail workers, low fares, and regular services. Cutting carbon and defending workers rights are essential to stopping the climate crisis.\u201d As the second day of strike action started, climate activists joined rail workers at picket lines across the UK from Glasgow to Manchester, Preston to Brighton, Sheffield to Bath. Finlay Asher, from the XR Trade Union group, said: \u201cClimate justice means social justice. The only way workers can fight for a fair low-carbon transition is by building union strength and the power of collective bargaining.\u201d James Schneider, from the Jeremy Corbyn-backed We All Want to Just Stop Oil group launched earlier this month, said it unequivocally backed striking rail workers who deserved \u201cto be paid fairly in a transport system that operates for the benefit of the people and the planet \u2013 not for private profit.\u201d He said that whether people were \u201ckept up at night by low pay, rising bills, climate breakdown or our broken politics\u201d they had to work together. \u201cIf we unite to take on our common enemy \u2013 the billionaires, the big polluters and the politicians they own \u2013 then we can win decent pay, stop new oil, tax the big polluters and billionaires, have energy for all, insulate our homes and enjoy cheap, green public transport.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-27T16:48:10Z",
            "content": "Mike George, a writer and campaigner on social justice and the environment, who has died aged 75 after contracting a rare form of tuberculosis, was instrumental in advancing ideas for socially useful manufacturing and in developing understanding of consumer vulnerability. George questioned the assumption in the regulation of essential services that there were fixed groups of vulnerable people whose interests needed protecting. He argued instead that vulnerability could potentially affect anyone at any time for a range of reasons, including income pressures or illness, and he devised a risk-factor approach that is now standard practice. His work for the Centre for Consumer and Essential Services at Leicester University heavily influenced the energy regulator, Ofgem, which in 2013 produced the first comprehensive vulnerability strategy in the essential services sector. Other regulators have since followed suit and it is now commonplace for providers of utilities and wider services to take proactive measures to identify people at risk, maintain registers and offer targeted help with bills and other forms of support. George had long had a scientific approach and vision that put him ahead of mainstream thinking. In the late 1970s he was already advocating the manufacture of solar cells, wind turbines and road-rail vehicles by workers being displaced from the motor and defence sectors. In 1978 he was appointed coordinator of the Centre for Alternative Industry and Technological Systems (Caits) at North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London). Caits was funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust to further the work of the trades unions\u2019 joint shop stewards committee representing workers at Lucas Aerospace, a major UK manufacturer, to consider how to manage the potential decline of their industry and avoid job losses. Under the radical \u201cLucas plan\u201d, the committee proposed switching production from military equipment to products such as kidney dialysis machines. George led the preparation of a 200-page report, Turning Industrial Decline into Expansion \u2013 a Trade Union Initiative, which set out detailed and costed proposals for the manufacture of 150 socially useful products. Although the report failed to win political or investor backing at the time, much of its thinking has since become orthodox and several of its ideas have been acted upon. There were no compulsory redundancies at Lucas. After running Caits for 11 years, George turned to freelance researching and writing. He was a regular contributor to the Guardian from the 1980s to the 2000s. His articles for Society Guardian would typically focus on emerging issues below the media\u2019s radar, and sometimes even beyond professional focus, such as hoarding, disabled refugees, the sex lives of people with a learning disability and rural mental ill-health. This concern for marginalised people led George and his wife, Linda Lennard, a consultant on consumer policy whom he had married in 1983 after they met through his work at Caits, to reappraise the concept of consumer vulnerability. Lennard was already a visiting fellow at the Leicester centre and he became a research associate after they set up a joint consultancy in 2006. George led development of the risk-factor approach, arguing that vulnerability could be caused not only by individual circumstances but also by actions or inaction on the part of a regulator or service provider, and could arise from a combination of economic, environmental and social factors, termed intersectionality, identification of which might require providers of different services to pool their knowledge of customers. In April this year, BSI, the business standards and improvement company, launched a new standard and kitemark for the energy, water and financial sectors that requires service providers to identify vulnerability through means including data collection and sharing. Born in Brighton, Mike was the only child of Catherine (nee Symonds), a shopworker, and Ronald George, an engineer. The family moved to Hampshire, where he attended Cowplain county secondary school, Waterlooville, and then Purbrook Park county grammar in Purbrook. Following a short spell working in the chemicals industry, he moved to London to study psychology and zoology at North East London Polytechnic, graduating in 1969. After a false career start in management with the Rochdale-based asbestos manufacturer Turner &amp; Newall, which convinced him he would be better suited on the side of the workers, George left after four years to go travelling across the US and he then took a master\u2019s degree in industrial relations at the London School of Economics. He joined Caits in 1978. George held fast to socialist principles throughout his life, but left the Labour party during Tony Blair\u2019s leadership. As a fervent environmentalist and a co-founder of the Socialist Environment and Resources Association (now Sera), he became involved in recent years with the Green party in St Albans, where he and Lennard had moved from north London. He campaigned particularly against air pollution. While living in London, George and Lennard helped found the Hornsey Vale Community Association, which secured substantial lottery funding to take over disused local school buildings and adjacent land to create a thriving community centre and the award-winning Stationers Park. George\u2019s later life was blighted by illness. He endured two years of lengthy hospital stays until he was finally diagnosed by specialists at the Royal Free hospital in north London as having contracted BCG-Osis, a rare side-effect of BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Typically, George used his experience to pen a series of insightful and challenging blogs about health and social care from the recipient\u2019s perspective. \u201cToo often,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpeople\u2019s actual experiences at the receiving end of services don\u2019t figure half as much as they should in policy-making or service design and provision.\u201d George co-edited three books: The Politics of Nuclear Power (1978), Japanese Competition and the British Workplace (1984) and Developing the Socially Useful Economy (1986). He wrote unpublished poetry and performed with the Pennine Poets when he lived in Rochdale, where he also developed his abiding love for tramping the English countryside and being in nature. He is survived by Linda. \u2022 Michael Christopher George, writer and campaigner, born 14 February 1947; died 3 June 2022"

            "content": "Amid news that only one in every hundred complaints against police officers have resulted in proceedings, we look at some recent misconduct cases that did lead to punitive action. Adnan Arib The Metropolitan police officer was jailed for two years in March after being found to have used his position to try to initiate sexual relationships with two vulnerable teenagers. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) was called to investigate Arib when he contacted the girls after meeting them while on duty. Using an unregistered phone, he invited them out, telling one of the girls that she was \u201cvery pretty\u201d. Arib pleaded not guilty and claimed that he had only got in touch with the children to offer them \u201ccareer advice\u201d, but this claim was rejected by the jury. Deniz Jaffer and Jamie Lewis The two Met officers were jailed for two years for taking and sharing photos of sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry after they were murdered. Jaffer, 47, and Lewis, 33, were ordered to guard the scene in a London park where the sisters were found murdered in June 2020. During a criminal trial, it was heard that they took photos, some showing the bodies, and shared them in two WhatsApp groups, calling the victims \u201cdead birds\u201d. The two officers pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office. Simon Hawxwell The former officer of Hampshire constabulary was found guilty of gross misconduct in 2021 after choking a fellow female officer. Hawxwell, who had been with the force for 18 years, also left his younger co-worker \u201cfearful that she would be sliced\u201d when he held scissors to her cheek in the office. He aimed highly sexualised insults at her, and asked her if she liked to be choked during sex. Hawxwell, who denied gross misconduct, said the incidents were \u201cjokes\u201d and that he would often \u201cuse humour to alleviate the stress and pressures of work\u201d. Darren Thorn The Wiltshire police officer was sacked in December after forming an inappropriate sexual relationship with a vulnerable woman who he met on duty. Thorn, who worked as a response officer in Swindon, was dismissed with immediate effect following a public gross misconduct hearing, the force said. The two-day hearing found Thorn guilty on six counts of gross misconduct. They included illegally accessing police computer systems to obtain personal information about members of the public and passing it on to the woman. The offences were committed between June 2016 and June 2018. Thorn admitted four criminal charges connected to the relationship during a hearing at Reading crown court on 29 November last year. He pleaded guilty to one charge of corruption, two charges of computer misuse, and one charge of misconduct in a public office."

            "date": "2022-06-14T15:58:29Z",
            "content": "Media freedom campaigners have criticised the conviction of a journalist in Zimbabwe for allegedly breaking immigration laws, describing the decision as \u201ca monumental travesty of justice\u201d that raises concerns for the press in the lead-up to elections next year. Jeffrey Moyo, a freelance correspondent for the New York Times, was given a suspended prison sentence of five years and fined $615 by a court in Bulawayo after being found guilty on Tuesday of helping to obtain press accreditation needed by two reporters from his news organisation to enter Zimbabwe. Prosecutors said the accreditation was fake \u2013 a charge denied by the New York Times. Moyo spent three weeks in jail last year and his trial started in January. The 37-year-old reporter\u2019s legal team said they would appeal against the decision. Angela Quintal, the Africa programme coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a US-based campaign group, said the court\u2019s decision showed that press freedom in Zimbabwe had deteriorated under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power after the fall of the veteran autocrat Robert Mugabe in 2017. \u201cThe fact that Moyo\u2019s prison sentence was suspended does not make it any less of a mockery of justice. Authorities must not contest Moyo\u2019s appeal, and ensure that he and other journalists can work in Zimbabwe freely, especially with a general election scheduled for next year,\u201d Quintal said. The military takeover that ousted Mugabe led to a brief period of relative tolerance in Zimbabwe. Mnangagwa, a former spy chief known as the Crocodile, promised political and economic reform leading to major investment from overseas. But successive crackdowns led to hundreds of opposition activists being harassed, abducted and assaulted, dashing hopes of democratic reform. Repression has continued, with journalists and others who have criticised the government facing what many observers say are politically motivated charges designed to intimidate or obstruct their work. Reporters and campaigners who have made allegations of corruption against officials have been particular targets. Campaigners fear repression is likely to intensify in the coming months. Zimbabwe\u2019s ruling Zanu-PF party may be facing an uphill struggle to secure a clear victory in the 2023 presidential election, which is due after a new opposition party made significant gains in March byelections. The Citizens Coalition for Change, which was only founded in January, won 19 out of 28 parliamentary seats in polls widely regarded as a test run for next year\u2019s election. In 2018 a fractured opposition came within 1% of forcing Mnangagwa into a runoff. The vote was marred by allegations of rigging."

A Democrat, Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, interjected and said: \u201cI hope the gun is not loaded.\u201d But Greg Steube replied: \u201cI\u2019m in my house, I can do whatever I want with my guns.\u201d The hearing on the Protecting Our Kids Act, an omnibus bill backed by House Democrats, was held amid calls for meaningful reform after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York (10 dead); Uvalde, Texas (21 dead, including 19 children); and Tulsa, Oklahoma (four dead). Joining the hearing from his Florida home, Steube complained about proposals to ban high-capacity magazines. \u201cThe Glock 19 was the highest-sold handgun in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes with a 15-round magazine. That gun would be banned.\u201d Then he held up a weapon. \u201cRight in front of you I have a Sig Sauer P226. Comes with a 21-round magazine. This gun would be banned. Here\u2019s a 12-round magazine. This magazine would be banned under this current bill, it doesn\u2019t fit as this gun was made for [a] 21-round magazine. This gun would be banned under this bill.\u201d He showed another gun. \u201cHere\u2019s a Sig Sauer P320. It takes a 20-round magazine. Here\u2019s a 12-round magazine that would be banned. It doesn\u2019t fit. Because it would be banned. This gun would be banned under this bill.\u201d And another. \u201cHere\u2019s a gun I carry every single day to protect myself, my family, my wife, my home. This is an XL Sig Sauer P365, comes with a 15-round magazine. Here\u2019s a seven-round magazine which would be less than what would be lawful under this bill \u2026 it doesn\u2019t fit. So this gun would be banned.\u201d Steube is a former US army lawyer who supported Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. He voted against awarding the congressional gold medal to police officers who defended the Capitol from rioters on 6 January 2021. On Thursday, he refused requests to yield from the Democratic committee chair, Jerry Nadler of New York. The shootings in Buffalo, Uvalde and Tulsa happened within two weeks. More mass shootings, widely defined as events in which four or more people not including the shooter are injured or killed, occurred around the US during the Memorial Day weekend. The Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit, says there have been 232 mass shootings in the US this year \u2013 substantially more than one a day. Republicans remain opposed to gun reform, although senators from both parties have said talks initiated after the Uvalde shooting have shown promise. On Thursday, two Democrats on the House judiciary committee, Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, read the names of the 19 children killed in Uvalde. Garcia argued Republicans were \u201ccomplicit\u201d in such mass shootings because they have refused to countenance gun reform. Her voice shaking, Dean asked: \u201cWhere is their outrage over the slaughter of 19 fourth-graders and their two teachers? Why don\u2019t they feel an urgency to do something? \u201cThis is on our watch.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-12T12:00:48Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson\u2019s former anti-corruption tsar, who resigned last week, has called for urgent reform of the standards rules around lobbying, as well as more scope for the independent adviser to hold the prime minister to account. John Penrose, a Conservative MP and former minister, said it was extremely important for democracy to fix problems with the UK\u2019s standards regime affecting ministers, MPs, advisers and civil servants. In particular, he called for tougher anti-lobbying rules, as recommended in a report by Nigel Boardman over the Greensill scandal and the Committee on Standards in Public Life (CSPL). Johnson\u2019s anti-corruption champion since 2017, Penrose stood down from his role last Monday after objecting to Johnson\u2019s perceived failure to address the Sue Gray report\u2019s finding that he showed a lack of leadership over lockdown-breaking parties in No 10 and concluding that this appeared to be a breach of the code. Johnson\u2019s independent adviser on ministerial interests, Lord Geidt, had said he felt unable to offer his opinion on whether Johnson had broken the code, because he might have felt compelled to resign if his advice were not followed. This would have placed the code in a position of \u201cridicule\u201d, he claimed. Speaking afterwards, Penrose said he thought the government\u2019s most recent changes to the adviser\u2019s role, allowing him to recommend initiating an investigation were \u201ca lot stronger than before and I think in practical, pragmatic British terms, we should give it a chance to work\u201d. However, he said there were \u201cnew problems which have only just appeared in the last couple of days\u201d around the adviser feeling unable to pass judgment on whether the prime minister has broken the rules. Penrose suggested that the adviser should not have to resign if his advice were not followed, in the same way that Sir Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, was not expected to stand down if politicians took a different view to him. But he said: \u201cThe adviser should be expected to advise on whether any prime minister has broken the ministerial code or not, just like they do for any other government minister already. At the moment the prime minister has an exception, and that means there\u2019s no public advice for parliament and everyone else to see, which isn\u2019t fair at all.\u201d On wider changes to the standards regime around lobbying, Penrose said ministers should have to sign legally binding declarations that they would not lobby the government for fixed periods after leaving office \u2013 making mandatory the advice given out by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). \u201cAcoba isn\u2019t fully legally binding at the moment, and it ought to be. So what Boardman has suggested is that civil service contracts should make Acoba\u2019s decisions binding and, because ministers aren\u2019t technically employees, the equivalent for them is that they sign a legal deed that says: \u2018I will be bound by the decisions of Acoba.\u2019 It\u2019s a nice, simple way of giving Acoba the teeth and claws it needs,\u201d he said. Secondly, Penrose called for a more detailed, transparent and easily searchable record to be published of meetings between companies or lobbyists and members of the government. He said not just ministers but political advisers and senior civil servants should be subject to such scrutiny. \u201cThese are low-cost and easy steps that don\u2019t need new legislation, and would be a huge boost to transparency and confidence in our institutions,\u201d he said. Urging the government to respond to the Boardman report, which was published in the middle of last year, as well as addressing more of the CSPL\u2019s recommendations, Penrose added: \u201cFixing these problems is probably more important now than it has been for years, not just for our current government, but for our entire democracy too. \u201cMinisters have promised to respond to these reports, so let\u2019s just get on with it. It\u2019s an opportunity to do the right thing, and \u2018do well by doing good\u2019, and it won\u2019t cost the taxpayer a bean either.\u201d Parliament has been hit by numerous lobbying scandals in recent years including the Greensill scandal, which involved the former prime minister David Cameron lobbying former colleagues by text message on behalf of his employer, a finance firm which has since collapsed. The government was also drawn into a controversy over Owen Paterson, a Tory former cabinet minister, who was found to have lobbied government ministers on behalf of two companies. No 10 tried to orchestrate against Paterson being suspended from the Commons, which backfired and led to Paterson\u2019s resignation and the loss of his safe seat in a byelection."

            "content": "Hundreds of people crossed the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan on Saturday, in support of March for Our Lives. It was one of dozens of rallies across the US to protest political inertia on gun control. The New York march kicked off at Cadman Park Plaza, where a huge memorial honors Brooklynites who served in the second world war. Some marchers said they felt they were in a war, to protect themselves and their families from gun violence. \u201cAnything we can do to protect our children and get attention is significant,\u201d said Betsy Malcolm, 66. Surveying the large number of women, many with children, attending the rally, she said the anti-gun violence movement was taking on aspects of a gender issue. \u201cI think more women are becoming engaged than men. None of these mass shootings are perpetrated by women.\u201d Nancy Hagans, president of the New York State Nurses Association, said she had witnessed an increase in gun crime victims in emergency rooms. Part of the problem, she said, was the surge in the availability of inexpensive \u201cghost guns\u201d. \u201cAs nurses we see 13-year-olds sitting in their living rooms getting caught up in it. My daughter is in high school and sometimes she\u2019s afraid to go to class. \u201cPeople say this is politics but it\u2019s not politics, it\u2019s life. This is us, in the ER, taking care of children and parents. These are our children, they are our future, and right now we are destroying our future.\u201d Sophie Breslauer, 19 and from Chicago, said her school had lost three students to gun violence in the past year. \u201cOur campus has become so unsafe that we get free Lyft rides starting at 5pm. It\u2019s scary to walk to the library. That\u2019s insane. It shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d Her friend, Noa Gilad, said it was important to keep marching. \u201cWe need to be grounded in what\u2019s happening because we\u2019re losing lives. It\u2019s important that people know what\u2019s going on.\u201d The situation, she said, had begun to make it feel like it would be negligent to raise a child in America. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad to say that but at this point I think it may be true,\u201d she said. March for Our Lives was born out of the massacre of 14 students and three adults on 14 February 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida by a former student. In New York City on Saturday, makeshift tributes had been set up for victims of recent mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde, Texas. In both instances, 18-year-old males who had recently purchased assault-style rifles carried out the shootings. Organizers of the marches in response said the time was right to renew the push for national gun control reform. Kathryn Colglazier said she had age-appropriate conversations around safety with her three-year-old daughter. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s important to be out here so she knows that guns are bad and they need to go. It\u2019s important for us to be out here and not allow this to be forgotten until the next time it happens.\u201d Tim and Sara Erickson, both teachers, said the starting point at Cadman Plaza was significant because it held a memorial to people who inspired change. Like others, they said they were frustrated with discussion on guns within a standard political framework. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a women\u2019s issue and one of the reasons that there is not more care given to schools and teachers is because it\u2019s a predominantly female, care-taking position,\u201d said Sara Erickson. \u201cThose are the people that tend to be ignored, or belittled and not made to be as important.\u201d When the make-up of power looks like the make-up of America, she said, people will be truly represented. \u201cUntil that time, it\u2019s about people who want to wield power instead of people wanting to protect who they are supposed to serve.\u201d"

            "title": "High-stakes California races will decide LA mayor and San Francisco recall ",
            "date": "2022-06-07T23:01:09Z",
            "content": "High-stakes primary races taking place on Tuesday in California are expected to have major consequences for police reform, incarceration and the state\u2019s growing homelessness crisis. The most closely watched race is the mayor\u2019s contest in Los Angeles, where voters are deciding between a tough-on-crime real estate developer, Rick Caruso, who has already poured nearly $40m of his own fortune into his primary campaign, and the former community organizer and Democratic congresswoman Karen Bass. In San Francisco, the city\u2019s progressive prosecutor, Chesa Boudin, is facing a recall election that could have a major impact on movements for criminal justice reform across the US. Midway through a tense midterm elections year, the races are likely to serve as a litmus test for Democrats and progressives. Analysts are watching to see if the majority of voters in some of America\u2019s most ostensibly liberal cities decide to reject attempts to reduce mass incarceration and address the stark racial disparities in the criminal justice system. But one of the starkest takeaways so far is that voters simply are not very engaged in California\u2019s primary election, despite multiple measures designed to make it easier for them to participate. Early turnout so far has been abysmal, even though every registered voter in California was mailed a ballot. \u201cEven if you make it extremely easy to vote, like in California, but the political culture, candidates and issues aren\u2019t there, you aren\u2019t going to increase the turnout,\u201d political scientist Fernando Guerra said. \u201cWe have extreme generational issues, with homelessness and crime and the cost of housing, and I think we have the candidates. There\u2019s a lack of political culture.\u201d Lower turnout is likely to be a particular challenge for \u201ca lot of the young progressive candidates\u201d, who might end up losing to an incumbent by a small margin of votes, Guerra said. Turnout was reportedly lagging in other states also holding primaries on Tuesday, including New Jersey and New Mexico. Voters in California and nationwide are concerned about gas prices and the cost of living. A recent poll found that only a third of Los Angeles voters approved of the city\u2019s police department, a lower approval rating than in 1991, after the police beating of Rodney King, but that nearly half of voters surveyed wanted to increase the size of the force. The role of the police in public safety is one of the key issues up and down the ballot, with younger progressive candidates who support defunding the police challenging older centrist Democrats in several Los Angeles city council races. Bass, the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, supports police reform and a modest increase in Los Angeles police department staffing; Caruso has pledged to put an additional 1,500 officers on the street. Both Bass and Caruso have promised to put an end to people sleeping on the street in Los Angeles. Caruso has expressed willingness to arrest unhoused people who refuse to move to a city-provided shelter bed, and has also praised an army camp for undocumented children at the Texas border as a good model for how to deal with the city\u2019s homelessness crisis. For some Los Angeles progressives, Bass\u2019s more centrist positions on policing and homelessness have been a disappointment. Two years after George Floyd\u2019s murder by police sparked worldwide protests, some activists see Bass\u2019s endorsement of putting more police on the street as a step backwards. \u201cShe\u2019s losing the enthusiasm of folks on the left, and I think that is a miscalculation,\u201d said Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, Los Angeles, who endorsed Gina Viola, a local activist running to Bass\u2019s left, for mayor. Progressive groups in LA have also organized to oust the incumbent LA county sheriff, Alex Villanueva, who has been at the center of multiple scandals related to abuse and misconduct cases within the department. His critics, however, have not rallied behind one opponent among his eight challengers. The role of massive personal fortunes in public elections has also become a central issue in California\u2019s primary campaigns. The attempt to recall Boudin, a central figure in the movement to elect prosecutors who want to make the legal system less punitive and racist, is reportedly being funded by ultra-wealthy donors, many of them in the tech industry, including: Ron Conway, an early DoorDash investor; Garry Tan, an Instacart investor; and David Sacks, a former PayPal executive. The result of the attempt to recall Boudin in San Francisco will \u201caffect whether prosecutors elsewhere feel emboldened to take new approaches or whether they will perceive that as a political risk\u201d, said Sandra Mayson, a University of Pennsylvania law professor. Boudin has reduced the jail and prison population, prioritized alternatives to incarceration, and filed charges against officers for misconduct. He said in a recent interview that the recall campaign was using a \u201cRepublican- and police union-led playbook\u201d. The city\u2019s mayor, London Breed, a moderate Democrat who has been critical of Boudin\u2019s policies, would appoint his successor if he is recalled, though she has not announced a choice. Possible appointees, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, include former prosecutors and DA candidates who have supported the recall and have advocated for a return to harsher punishments and tough-on-crime policies. Early ballot data on Tuesday suggested low voter turnout in the city. Political spending on the Los Angeles mayoral primary has already topped $50m, with Caruso\u2019s campaign spending more than $40m of that. Bass\u2019s campaign has spent $3m, in contrast, and a local police union has spent a similar amount on advertisement opposing her candidacy. On Friday, Elon Musk, one of the richest men in the world, tweeted his public endorsement of Caruso, who himself is ranked No 261 on Forbes\u2019 list of richest Americans. \u201cHe\u2019s awesome,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cExecutive competence is super-underrated in politics \u2013 we should care about that a lot more!\u201d Caruso, a real estate developer with an estimated net worth of $4bn, has used at least $38m of his own money to move to the front of a crowded non-partisan primary field, a number that has already broken every previous record for mayor\u2019s races in Los Angeles, local experts said. The billionaire\u2019s personal fortune has funded a barrage of attractive television ads and mailers touting his candidacy, even as Caruso has skipped some mayoral debates, and largely avoided engaging with the press or holding open public events. Bass and then Caruso took an early lead in mayoral polls, leading other mayoral primary contenders to drop out of the race, though some, such as Kevin de Leon, a current city council member, fight on. Heading into Tuesday, polls showed Bass and Caruso closely matched in terms of voter support, setting up the possibility that neither would surpass the 50% vote threshold needed to win outright. In that case, the top two candidates will advance to a runoff election in November, a result that is expected to generate millions more in political spending from Caruso and from Bass\u2019s progressive backers in Hollywood."

            "date": "2022-06-01T08:51:34Z",
            "content": "The process for reforming gender recognition law in Scotland has so far been \u201cexceptionally poor and a recipe for bad law\u201d, opposition campaign groups and policy analysts have told a Holyrood committee. Addressing the committee taking evidence on a draft bill that aims to streamline the process by which an individual can change their legal sex, the groups raised concerns about cis women excluding themselves from women-only services over fears of encountering a transgender individual, and suggested that young people were being \u201cconfused\u201d by celebrities who came out as queer or non-binary. However, the criticisms of the proposed gender recognition reform \u2013 which is supported by every party in Holyrood bar the Scottish Conservatives \u2013 were made as other groups, including Rape Crisis Scotland and Amnesty Scotland, said the bill would not affect the way that women accessed services. Sandy Brindley, the chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland, told members of the Scottish parliament\u2019s equalities, human rights and civil justice committee that the service had been trans inclusive for 15 years and that \u201cin all this time there has not been a single incident of trans people abusing this\u201d. Naomi McAuliffe, Amnesty\u2019s Scotland programme director, said she did not see in evidence from other countries that had introduced similar systems that it would result in a significant increase in the pool of people applying. She referred to Ireland, which has a similar population to Scotland and has had fewer than 900 applications for a gender recognition certificate since it introduced \u201cself-identification\u201d in 2015. Earlier, Lucy Hunter Blackburn, of policy analysts Murray Blackburn Mackenzie, raised concerns that the bill would open the application process to a \u201clarger, more diverse group\u201d, including \u2013 by removing the requirement for a medical diagnosis \u2013 those who were not gender-dysphoric, warning that the previous 2004 act was \u201cbeing repurposed to do a different job\u201d. Hunter Blackburn said the committee could not ignore how changing the law around obtaining a gender recognition certificate would affect policy. \u201cThe process leading to the introduction of the bill has been exceptionally poor and a recipe for bad law. I hope that the committee will now correct rather than repeat these mistakes,\u201d she said. Susan Smith, of the campaign group For Women Scotland, said: \u201cIf [parliamentarians] are saying to people: \u2018We believe that the only criteria as to whether you\u2019re a man or a woman is self-identity,\u2019 it becomes increasingly harder for individual organisations to have a policy that is in opposition to that \u2026 the reality then becomes [that] the person making these decisions is often a lowly paid receptionist at the sports centre who is trying to tell somebody they can\u2019t go into a woman-only session.\u201d Urging the committee to expand its evidence base, Smith and Hunter Blackburn both said MSPs should speak to the paediatrician Hilary Cass, who is undertaking a review of gender identity services for children in England and Wales. Malcolm Clark, of the UK-wide gender-critical campaign group LGB Alliance, said young people were being influenced \u201cthrough celebrity, through peer pressure, through loads of social media nonsense\u201d and that MSPs should also seek evidence from those who had subsequently de-transitioned. Asked by the SNP MSP Karen Adam whether he could see similarities in his rhetoric with warnings about educating children about LGBT issues during the 1980s, at the time of section 28, Clark said he did not see any comparison, claiming that pro-reform groups like Stonewall were taking \u201cthe good name of the gay rights movement to make this set of demands acceptable\u201d. Hunter Blackburn also suggested there was consensus between critics and proponents over the \u201creally problematic\u201d requirement in the bill for applicants to live in their acquired gender for three months, something she described as \u201cregressive and reinforcing stereotypes\u201d and which the Scottish Trans Alliance described as \u201carbitrary\u201d during a previous evidence session."

            "content": "Saleem Ali \u2013 whose Twitter bio begins \u201cMercurial Professor\u201d \u2013 is not trying to be the new Stephen Hawking. \u201cPeople buy all these theoretical physics books in droves because they think having them on the shelves will make them look smart,\u201d opines the distinguished professor of energy and the environment at the University of Delaware. \u201cA Brief History of Time is a very difficult book to read.\u201d Ali believes his own, anecdote-filled book is far more accessible. Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life is an ambitious effort to bridge the gap between politics and science, drawing on his experience as a National Geographic field explorer who has worked in more than 150 countries. Ali has three passports, having been born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, moved to Pakistan aged nine and lived in Australia for several years. In a phone interview from Delaware, he happily ruffles feathers by defending nuclear power, suggesting that democracies can learn lessons from autocracies and attacking the last sacred space on television: the nature documentary. \u201cSome of these nature biodiversity documentaries can, in fact, create a problem because they lead to niche thinking,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are good for some things like biodiversity conservation but they are not making the connections often that you need to do.\u201d Indeed, the 48-year-old revels in complexity and loathes dumbing down \u2013 even if it means frustrating literary agents. \u201cWhen I was writing the book, agents would ask me, \u2018What\u2019s your one argument?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018You know, I\u2019m writing a book about earth systems, I can\u2019t have one argument. I have to approach the issues with nuance.\u2019 This is the problem we have, unfortunately, in terms of communication of environmental issues.\u201d To illustrate the point, Ali cites predictions that Dubai in the United Arab Emirates will soon be so hot that it will be uninhabitable. \u201cThat is such a ludicrous statement from the point of view of looking at how humans have interacted with the environment,\u201d he contends. \u201cMost cities in the western world are uninhabitable in winter without infrastructure, including New York City or London \u2013 if you didn\u2019t have heating you wouldn\u2019t be able to survive or you could have a very short existence with hypothermia. \u201cWe have developed adaptive mechanisms so to say that Dubai would be uninhabitable in summer without air conditioning makes no sense from the point of view of earth systems. But it makes a good headline because people immediately start panicking and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my goodness, it\u2019s becoming so bad.\u2019\u201d Humanity will have to adapt, he argues, for example through different types of architecture and more subterranean dwellings. He believes this is the pragmatic way forward in responding to some climate crisis thresholds that are now irreversible \u2013 while still aggressively reducing dependence on fossil fuels and refusing to surrender to the worst-case scenario. \u201cIf we frame the conversation as, look, this is going to be a future which is not ideal, we wish we had not gone that pathway, we wish we had reduced emissions, but now we need to figure out what\u2019s the best way to adapt to this new future, that would be much more constructive and realistic to work through with some of the people who have been climate deniers. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t mean complacency. You still need a lot of action around it. That\u2019s where I feel as though we\u2019ve been remiss in attacking this issue.\u201d Ali is among the voices who contend that nuclear power, long anathema to many on the left, deserves a second look. It currently provides about a fifth of electricity in the US, accounting for about half the country\u2019s carbon-free energy, and some companies \u2013 including one started by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates \u2013 are developing smaller, cheaper reactors that could supplement the grid. But the US has no long-term plan for managing or disposing of radioactive waste that can persist in the environment for thousands of years. Nuclear disasters at Pennsylvania\u2019s Three Mile Island, Chernobyl in Ukraine and Fukushima in Japan have cast a long shadow. Although countries such as France are sticking with the technology or planning to build more plants, others, including Germany, are phasing out their reactors. Ali argues: \u201cThere has been a completely emotional kneejerk response to Fukushima, especially in Germany, which they are realising now was a mistake. If you look at the actual science in terms of the natural order of how energy is extracted from materials, nuclear energy is the most energy-dense resource. \u201cIf you look at the data in terms of the the morbidity and mortality of Fukushima, you had not a single person die of radiation exposure; they died of the tsunami. The International Atomic Energy Agency published a report last year which showed that there were no cancer clusters around there either. And yet you had an entire energy policy recrafted. That is why Germany is in this dependency situation.\u201d Indeed, Ali does not believe that western democracies have all the right answers. He suggests that for decades their leaders have been talking about climate in a fashion that is too narrow, failing to join dots in the public imagination. He is donating all royalties from the book to environmental literacy programmes in developing countries. \u201cThere was a strategic mistake made in terms of framing it just as climate change. I always like, with my students, to talk about global environmental change. We\u2019re talking about many aspects of the global system which are changing. When people think of climate change, immediately it is just resonating as, \u2018Oh, are we getting more heat or cold?\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re talking about water scarcity. We\u2019re talking about the ways in which energy is going to be delivered. If we had framed the conversation around global environmental change, it would have been easier to be able to figure out all of these interconnections.\u201d Ali, who has a PhD in environmental planning, continues: \u201cWe assume that democratic systems are going to be able to deliver efficient outcomes but the reality is democratic systems are often very short-term-oriented because they are driven by election cycles. \u201cWe have the same problem with reference to even business decision making, especially publicly traded companies which are driven by quarterly earnings reports. When you\u2019re talking about long-range impacts, there is definitely a disconnect between both aspects. \u201cWe threw the baby out with the bathwater when we started to lobby against planning. \u2018Planning\u2019 had these connotations that it was going back to somehow centrally planned economies but you need a certain bureaucracy to continue the planning programmes and we needed to have planning independent of the political apparatus. That\u2019s been another reason why, unfortunately, we have ended up in this current impasse with climate change.\u201d Do autocracies, which Joe Biden warns are locked in a global struggle with democracies, do it better? Ali, whose book draws a contrast between China and India, says: \u201cChina is going to have problems in terms of their dependence on coal but there is definitely a much more technically oriented approach to decision making in China. Even if you take out the part about the central planning, the Confucian approach has been much more around let\u2019s bring technocracy to the mix.\u201d Public transport in a classic example, he believes, with China deciding to switch from planes to trains as the dominant mode between major cities and getting it done within a decade. \u201cHere in the US we\u2019re stuck with Amtrak, which they have still not been able to change because there isn\u2019t this sense of let\u2019s work through all of the technical details and make it happen based on those decisions. \u201cThat\u2019s also linked to the fact we have a very litigious culture that makes it very challenging to be able to develop new projects. Unfortunately, in current democracies the actual process of getting feedback and stakeholder engagement and litigation becomes an end in itself. There is just no point at which you draw the line and say, OK, now we have to move forward.\u201d This, he continues, is one of the reasons that the outsider businessman Donald Trump was an attractive proposition to millions of frustrated voters in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cPeople saw that at least there was this willingness to make a decision. Much as I lament many aspects of his policies \u2013 building the wall \u2013 there was a decision. \u201cIn environmental discourse, we often talk about the precautionary principle, that you have to be careful about things, but if you go to the extreme, it becomes paralysis because you can\u2019t make any kind of forward movement. That\u2019s the main problem we have had.\u201d But no, Ali is not calling for dictatorship in America, as he insists: \u201cDemocracies can correct that. I don\u2019t see this as being something that only autocracies can do. We just need democracies to be made more efficient and form processes where decisions are based on technical knowledge and, after a certain point, that technical knowledge should trump \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 negotiations.\u201d By Ali\u2019s lights, environmental awareness is no longer enough; environmental literacy is critical to the survival of the planet. Or as he puts it: \u201cDepth in understanding of complexity is essential for functional order on Earth.\u201d Earthly Order: How Natural Laws Define Human Life is out on 15 July"

            "date": "2022-06-07T23:47:44Z",
            "content": "Farming leaders in New Zealand have recommended that the government impose a price on agricultural greenhouse gas emissions for the first time, as the rural sector comes under significant political pressure over its disproportionate contribution to climate change. The recommendation by He Waka Eke Noa, a partnership between farming leaders and the government, is likely to widen an emerging schism between agricultural representatives and grassroots farmers, who have taken to the streets in recent years to protest against the introduction of environmental regulations and criticise industry leaders for being too friendly with the government. However, farming leaders felt they had little choice but to make the proposal. Jacinda Ardern\u2019s centre-left government had legislated that if farmers did not come up with an emissions pricing system, agriculture \u2013 which generates over half of New Zealand\u2019s industrial and household emissions \u2013 would automatically enter the country\u2019s emissions trading scheme, from which it is currently exempt. \u201cWe believe that would be disastrous and that\u2019s what drove us to finding a better solution,\u201d said Andrew Morrison, the chairman of Beef + Lamb NZ, which represents beef and lamb farmers. \u201cThe old days of stomping our feet and saying, \u2018This is how it\u2019s gotta be and we don\u2019t care what anyone in town thinks\u2019? They\u2019re long gone,\u201d said Andrew Hoggard, the president of farmer advocacy group Federated Farmers, of his involvement in He Waka Eke Noa. While the group did not propose a specific price for agricultural emissions, they emphasised that it should be \u201cas low as possible\u201d. In their modelling, they used an initial price of 11 cents per kilogram of methane and 0.4 cents per kilogram of carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide. The group estimates that by 2030, these prices would reduce agricultural emissions of methane by approximately 4.5% and of nitrous oxide by approximately 3%. They say that when combined with existing climate policies these reductions will be sufficient for New Zealand to meet its statutory targets of a 10% cut in methane by 2030 and net zero nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide by 2050. The proposal was met with derision from some climate advocates. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic,\u201d says Mike Joy, a leading freshwater ecologist. \u201cIt\u2019s not ambitious, it is a cop-out that just puts more pressure on the other sectors of society.\u201d But it comes as New Zealand\u2019s once-powerful farming community begins to splinter. In March, Groundswell \u2013 an influential grassroots group of farmers \u2013 denounced Beef + Lamb NZ and Dairy NZ, both members of He Waka Eke Noa, as \u201cpet lobby groups\u201d for the government. Bryce Mckenzie, the co-founder of Groundswell, describes He Waka Eke Noa as \u201can attack on farming\u201d. Dr Hugh Campbell, a professor of sociology at the University of Otago, says that because of that internal political pressure, farming leaders \u201cknow where they have to go [on climate], but they see their role as slowing it down to the slowest possible uptake\u201d. The government has said it will decide by the end of the year whether to accept He Waka Eke Noa\u2019s recommendation."

            "content": "Greg Jackson starts each day by flicking on the radio and \u201cscrunching\u201d into his bath. The boss of Octopus Energy has a small tub, which pleases him as it is efficient and fills quickly. His morning routine echoes the tycoon\u2019s underprivileged childhood. \u201cYou can tell if someone grew up in a cold house: we often prefer baths \u2013 when you get out of the shower you get a real shock,\u201d he says. Jackson, 50, grew up near Middlesbrough. After his parents split, his mother worked as a barmaid and later studied while on benefits. He now runs Octopus, the green energy supplier founded in 2015 and valued at \u00a34bn, with more than 3 million customers in 14 countries and backers including former US vice-president Al Gore. He believes his thrifty upbringing allows him to empathise with struggling customers. \u201cIt\u2019s actually more than that: bringing down energy costs is one of the reasons I started the business,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s demoralising that we can\u2019t keep bills lower in the short term when we need it most, but we have done a tremendous amount up to now.\u201d Last month Octopus pledged \u00a350m to cut customer bills until October\u2019s price cap rise, part of a longer-term package worth \u00a3150m. \u201cWe\u2019ve never made a profit and were going to, but we\u2019ve ploughed everything we\u2019re going to make into customer support so we\u2019re not going to make one this year,\u201d he says. The mop-topped energy boss, dressed in grey T-shirt and jeans, has become the acceptable face of a pariah industry. As 31 energy firms went bust since the start of last year, public ire has been directed at the bosses of failed challengers. They\u2019ve been characterised as inexperienced and foolhardy for not hedging their energy far enough in advance. \u201cYou can\u2019t become a car dealer if you haven\u2019t got the money to buy cars,\u201d says Jackson, exasperated. He says it took years to find the \u00a310m he needed to launch Octopus. \u201cYou can\u2019t just enter this market by shaking your piggy bank.\u201d He believes suppliers with more than 10,000 customers should be subject to hedging checks. Fellow green energy group Bulb went bust last November and remains in \u201cspecial administration\u201d. It could cost taxpayers \u00a32bn. Could Octopus become another Bulb? \u201cWe\u2019ve raised 16 times more investment than Bulb did. We have a technology licensing business with big customers like E.ON and EDF, and we\u2019ve invested in generation and a heat pump centre. We\u2019re nothing like Bulb.\u201d Before Bulb\u2019s collapse, Octopus flirted with taking over its rival. Jackson said the size of the supplier \u2013 with 1.5 million customers \u2013 meant there was \u201cno viable route\u201d for the business to be taken on by a competitor before its collapse. Since our interview, Octopus has rejoined the race, submitting a last-minute bid. Jackson declined to comment on it. Octopus took on 600,000 customers from bust Avro Energy last year, and Jackson accuses the administrators of \u201carguing and quibbling over completely unimportant technical points\u201d. With the crisis that toppled so many suppliers continuing to rage, Jackson thinks the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is right to plough \u00a315bn into addressing the cost of living: \u201cIt makes economic sense for the government to find ways to bring bills and inflation down. I lived through rip-roaring inflation in the 1980s and double-digit interest rates. These are things we should do everything to avoid.\u201d He believes the energy crisis has underscored the need for Britain to move away from oil and gas. \u201cThe first nail in the coffin should have been climate change, then it should have been the fact that renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels. Now we see this as a national security issue as well \u2013 if that\u2019s not the final nail I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d As the Observer arrives at the headquarters near Oxford Circus, in central London, for our interview, Jackson cheerfully leaps up from his desk among the troops. There are bright pink octopus toys dotted around the half-full offices, and crisps and sweets on a communal table. Octopus\u2019s youthful workforce is poring over energy consumption charts and enthusing about that bespoke tech, called Kraken, which will now be licensed to other utility companies. One department looks after Electric Juice, a service that lets customers add car-charging payments to their electricity bill. Elsewhere, a vast screen displays the progress of Plots for Kilowatts, a scheme that matches areas where residents have said they\u2019ll put up with an onshore windfarm in return for lower bills with areas where landowners are keen to host one. Internally it\u2019s called Winder (wind-Tinder, geddit?). \u201cWe want a similar effort to the vaccine rollout,\u201d says Jackson, sweeping bags of Frazzles aside. \u201cIt takes seven years to get a windfarm through the planning process and connected to the grid. The engineering part only takes a year.\u201d Octopus\u2019s other renewables ventures include a huge push to replace gas boilers with heat pumps, and investment in what will be the world\u2019s longest subsea power cable, linking Devon to a vast solar farm in the Moroccan desert. The collection of projects reflects Jackson\u2019s entrepreneurial background. He began his career at consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble before running businesses including a coffee shop and a mirror manufacturer. In 2006, he sold a customer relationship tech business for \u00a34.5m. Now his mission is to turn Britain on to renewables, despite the efforts of a small noisy group, including Nigel Farage, attacking net zero goals. \u201cClimate change is no longer this vague thing: people are literally baking in India and Pakistan,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just gobsmacked anyone\u2019s opposing this.\u201d Does being a flag-bearer for green energy get him in hot water at dinner parties? \u201cI literally don\u2019t get invited to them. I think I\u2019m too opinionated. My mum is very, very politically opinionated and I have that.\u201d Jackson won\u2019t be drawn on how long the energy crisis will last: \u201cIt\u2019s a fool that predicts commodity markets. Europe is going to go into this winter with more gas storage than last year, but if Russia stops sending gas to Europe, prices will skyrocket.\u201d With that he dashes off to do the school run, ready to pass on his opinions to the next generation. *** CV Age 50 Family In a relationship; has two children from previous partners.

            "date": "2022-06-28T07:00:09Z",
            "content": "Climate change is to blame for the majority of the heatwaves being recorded around the planet but the relation to other extreme events and their impacts on society is less clear, according to a study. \u201cI think on the one hand we overestimate climate change because it\u2019s now quite common that every time an extreme event happens, there is a big assumption that climate change is playing a big role, which is not always the case,\u201d said Friederike Otto, a climate change and environment professor at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, who was one of the lead authors of the research. \u201cBut on the other hand, we really underestimate those events where climate change does play a role in what the costs are, especially the non-economic costs of extreme weather events to our societies.\u201d In the study published in the journal Environmental Research: Climate from IOP Publishing, Otto\u2019s team used \u201cattribution science\u201d to pore over available international data, literature and climate models \u2013 as well as the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports \u2013 and calculate how human-induced climate change is affecting the impact of five types of extreme weather events: heatwaves, heavy rainfall, drought, wildfires and tropical cyclones. They say that in the case of heatwaves, the role of climate change is unequivocal, and that the average and extreme heat levels in every continent across the globe are increasing specifically because of human-caused climate change. A heatwave with a one in 50 chance of happening in pre-industrial times is now almost five times more likely to happen and will be 1.2C hotter, according to an IPCC report. In the past 20 years there have been 157,000 deaths from 34 heatwaves, according to data from the EMDAT disaster database. Yet the impact of human-induced climate change on heatwaves and the repercussions are still largely underestimated. \u201cOne big reason why we underestimate heatwaves so dramatically is because no one\u2019s dropping dead on the street during a heatwave, or at least very few people do,\u201d Otto said. Most people died from pre-existing conditions suddenly becoming acute, Otto said, and this often did not show up in data. Wildfires were also one of the big climate impacts not talked about enough, she said. For other events such as droughts, floods and tropical cyclones, there is a more nuanced link to climate change. For example, there are some regions of the world where droughts are becoming worse because of human-caused climate change, such as southern Africa, Otto notes, while in other droughts the climate change signal is either not there or very small. \u201cBy focusing too much on climate change, it really takes the responsibility, but also the agency, away to address these local drivers of disasters such as high poverty rates, missing infrastructure, investment, missing healthcare system \u2026 all these aspects of exposure and vulnerability that make every drought a catastrophe,\u201d Otto said. \u201cThat will not go away even if we stop burning fossil fuels today. I think that that is why the overestimation of climate change \u2013 by basically blaming this all on climate change \u2013 is not very helpful for actually dealing [with] and for actually improving resilience to these threats.\u201d Much of the problem in figuring out exactly to what extent climate change was responsible for the impact of extreme weather events, Otto said, lay in the lack of reliable data around the globe. There is not enough information coming from lower- and middle-income countries, although these are the places more likely to be at risk of the repercussions of human-induced climate change. Already there\u2019s been substantial scientific progress in the last few years in attributing extreme events and their consequences to human-made climate change, said Frances Moore, a professor of environmental economics at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the study. \u201cBut an important caveat is that the consequences of climate change do not only operate through extremes,\u201d said Moore. Changes in \u201caverage conditions\u201d can also have large consequences for mortality, agriculture, worker productivity and safety. \u201cIt may well be that the aggregate consequences of these changing, \u2018non-extreme\u2019 conditions constitute a large fraction of total climate change impacts.\u201d Otto called for a broader definition of what was considered as \u201crisk\u201d in climate change modelling, rather than simply sticking to hazards and impact. Other factors such as the effects that extreme weather has on individuals, labour productivity, infrastructure, agricultural systems and property should be taken into account, she said. \u201cWe started at \u2018no one was ever talking about climate change\u2019 and now we\u2019ve sort of moved over to \u2018blaming a lot of things on climate change\u2019,\u201d Otto said. \u201c[This is] a plea towards realising that reality is somewhat messy, in the middle, and that we need to disentangle these drivers better in order to actually prioritise our adaptation and resilience building to really address climate change properly.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 29 June 2022. An editing error in an earlier version meant that Professor Otto was in one instance incorrectly referred to as \u201che\u201d."

            "date": "2022-06-02T08:00:33Z",
            "content": "At the end of February this year, the world\u2019s governments signed on to a statement that was startling in its strength and clarity. \u201cThe cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: Climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health,\u201d reads the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. \u201cAny further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.\u2019\u201d You might think that political leaders could have no higher priority than securing a \u201cliveable and sustainable future\u201d. Is that not what all of us, in every country, need and want for ourselves and for future generations? It is true that other issues are causing grave concern in many societies: governments worldwide are tackling poverty and hunger, wars and civil conflicts, the rising cost of food and energy, health systems and economies crippled by Covid-19. But as three former UN climate chiefs, let us be clear: as the world\u2019s first major environment summit - the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment - recognised, the crises in security, health, development and the environment are linked. They are loading stress upon stress, especially in the most fragile and conflict-torn parts of the world. The myriad reports of extreme weather we have witnessed in 2022 suggest there is no time to waste. The further climate change progresses, the more we lock in a future featuring more ruined harvests and more food insecurity along with a host of other problems including rises in sea level, threats to water security, drought and desertification. Governments must act against climate change while also dealing with other pressing crises. We recall the Barbados prime minister, Mia Mottley\u2019s words at Cop26: \u201cThe leaders of today \u2013 not 2030, not 2050 \u2013 must make this choice.\u201d The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted 30 years ago. In our time leading its secretariat, we have witnessed commitments and pledges that have not been fully honoured. While developed countries accepted the convention\u2019s principle of equity and thus their responsibility to lead climate action, their performance has been disappointing, not least in reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases and in mobilising financial support for developing countries that need it. In the 2015 Paris agreement, all governments agreed to \u201cpursue efforts\u201d to limit global warming to 1.5C (2.7F). We are entitled now to ask where their efforts have reached, where they are heading and how genuine they are. Science shows action this decade to reduce all greenhouse gases is critical. But the sum total of policies in place now will take us to a world hotter by 2.7C and perhaps a catastrophic 3.6C above pre-industrial levels. If science has not persuaded most governments to act, perhaps economics will. The IPCC provides clear evidence that societies will be more prosperous in a world where climate change is constrained, than in one left to burn. In the energy sector, evidence of the zero-carbon transition is all around us. Wind and solar generation shows compound growth of about 20% a year and is cheaper almost everywhere than the alternatives. Electric car sales doubled between 2020 and 2021. Unless one is invested in fossil fuels, there is now no reason not to take the clean energy path. Many corporate actors understand the need for early action on this front. But governments still need to incentivise the transition. The evolving Just Energy Transition packages may yet offer an investment pathway that can accelerate deployment in emerging and developing countries. Corporate action towards other targets such as reduction of methane emissions, also needs to be encouraged. If economics should give us hope for accelerating action despite the host of other issues menacing our times, then so should history. Fifty years ago the international community faced a similar litany of troubles: depletion of natural resources, desertification, the legacy of atom bomb testing, mercury contamination, cold war proxy conflicts. Geopolitics split the world. Yet at the 1972 Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, leaders agreed to cooperate on threats faced in common. Now, with geopolitics made frosty by superpower disagreements and with nations bleeding from Covid and conflict, the world\u2019s people need their leaders once more to work together. Governments have acknowledged that their window of opportunity to avert dangerous climate change is closing and have admitted the perils that failure will bring. Rapidly changing economics mean that a climate-safe future is also a more prosperous one. The will of the public \u2013 especially among young people \u2013 to see climate change constrained is clear. As we recall the Stockholm conference on its 50th anniversary this week, we need national leaders to recall what it demonstrated about the potential of cooperative action even in disturbed times. We need to see leaders delivering on their climate change promises, in the interests of people, prosperity and the planet. Christiana Figueres was executive secretary of UNFCCC from 2010 to 2016, Yvo de Boer was executive secretary of UNFCCC from 2006 to 2010, and Michael Zammit Cutajar was executive secretary of UNFCCC from 1991 to 2002 \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2022.

            "date": "2022-06-27T15:36:10Z",
            "content": "National Grid plans to reduce the risk of blackouts this winter by paying consumers to use less electricity at peak times, it has emerged. The electricity network operator is racing to set up a scheme that will enable households with smart meters to choose to cut how much energy they use when supplies are low. Initial proposals drawn up by National Grid\u2019s electricity system operator (ESO) say that households could be paid up to \u00a36 a kilowatt hour in credit instead of paying out 28.34p a kilowatt hour, The Times reported. The move comes as the government looks for ways to secure extra energy supplies this winter and limit usage by consumers. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, hopes to broker further deals to extend the life of Britain\u2019s last remaining coal-fired power stations through the winter, after keeping West Burton A in Nottinghamshire in operation. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has put further strain on already stretched energy supplies. Ministers are concerned that \u2013 in a worst-case scenario \u2013 Britain could experience rolling blackouts this winter. National Grid\u2019s plans could offer a cheaper and greener alternative to fossil fuels and cut bills for consumers. Annual bills in the UK have rocketed to \u00a31,971 a year and are expected to top \u00a32,800 a year in October, before hitting \u00a33,000 in January. National Grid\u2019s proposals follow a trial in conjunction with Octopus Energy. In the pilot about 100,000 customers were given a day\u2019s notice to cut their consumption during peak times such as 4.30pm to 6.30pm, when demand is highest in the UK. Octopus said that the average household saved 23p in each two-hour period, with some consumers saving as much as \u00a34.35. Sources close to the scheme said consumers had regularly followed the advice to cut their usage during the suggested periods. There had been concerns that National Grid would not be able to rely on consumers taking up the offer. National Grid has asked other suppliers to assess how much customers could cut back on their usage at peak times. It is also hoped that the initiative might encourage households to obtain smart meters after their faltering rollout over the past decade. The scheme would be paid for by a levy on household bills. However, the cost to pay power plants to maintain or increase supplies is thought to be greater. An ESO spokesperson said: \u201cDemand shifting has the potential to save consumers money, reduce carbon emissions and offer greater flexibility on the system, and some forms of demand management are already used today to help balance the system. \u201cInnovation that drives consumers\u2019 value and reduces carbon emissions will always be deployed as swiftly as possible, in a tested, safe and reliable way.\u201d Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus Energy, said: \u201cNational Grid has traditionally paid diesel generators huge sums at times of high demand \u2013 or paid big companies to turn down their usage. \u201cOpening this up to households who want to do so means that it won\u2019t just be big companies who benefit. And the more of this flexibility we have on the grid, the cheaper power will be for everyone \u2013 not just those who participate.\u201d"

Lee Dong-Hyun, who is pregnant with the foetus nicknamed Woodpecker and is also the mother of a six-year-old claimant, said: \u201cI am proud every time a 20-week-old foetus moves in my belly, but I feel sorry and regretful that this child who has not emitted even a gram of carbon dioxide has to live with the current climate crisis and disaster.\u201d The case was inspired by a landmark 2019 lawsuit in the Netherlands, where campaigners succeeded in ordering the government to reduce emissions. It sparked a wave of climate litigation around the world, from Ireland to India. Korean citizens have been active in bringing climate lawsuits against the state, with three cases challenging the constitutionality of the country\u2019s climate commitments awaiting a hearing. One claim, brought by a youth group, was updated in 2021 after the South Korean government passed a new net zero law that they argued was still not strong enough. In this latest case, the claimants say the country\u2019s 2030 target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% is unconstitutional and cannot guarantee basic rights for future generations. These include the rights to life, equality, property, and to live in a healthy and pleasant environment. Climate impacts in Korea are growing rapidly. Government statistics show the damage from natural disasters has risen since 1985, resulting in 162 casualties and costing 7.3tn won (\u00a34.6bn) between 2007 and 2016. According to reports, the country will in future face more frequent and heavy floods and forest disasters, loss of habitats and endangered species, and lower yields and quality of staple foods such as rice. \u201cAdults say they will protect the Earth for us, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have much to do with our future,\u201d said a 10-year-old claimant, Han Je-ah. \u201cInstead of passing it on to children, adults need to cut carbon emissions a lot more right now.\u201d Many young people have argued in court that the climate crisis violates their fundamental rights. Some high-profile cases, such as that brought by Anjali Sharma, a teenager in Australia, have failed. But Germany brought forward its climate goals after judges accepted arguments that the law in its current state jeopardised the freedoms of future generations. South American courts have also been sympathetic. In 2018 the Colombian supreme court found that deforestation in the Amazon caused serious damage to all Colombians of present and future generations and that the protection of fundamental rights extended to the unborn \u2013 although the ruling has proved problematic to enforce. However, a foetus has never before been listed as a claimant. Kim Young-hee, the president of an anti-nuclear lawyers\u2019 collective, Sunflower, who is leading the new case, told the Guardian: \u201cThe youngest foetus was designated as the representative claimant \u2026 because the foetus is the most important symbol alive for future generations.\u201d Kim pointed to a ruling in a previous case that acknowledged the ability of a foetus to file a constitutional petition, and said the Korean supreme court had long recognised that basic rights between generations should be guaranteed. Kim said the recognition of the foetus\u2019s right to life should not be interpreted in a way that contradicted women\u2019s reproductive rights, saying courts had confirmed that the criminalisation of abortion violates women\u2019s right to reproduce and self-determination."

            "date": "2022-06-29T08:19:19Z",
            "content": "The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, is poised to unveil a sweeping review into Australia\u2019s carbon credit system after an expert whistleblower characterised it as a fraud and a waste of taxpayer money. Bowen confirmed the imminent announcement of the review, which is expected on Friday, during a wide-ranging address at the National Press Club in which he outlined the Albanese government\u2019s initial reforms to climate and energy policy and signalled Labor could strengthen efforts to cut emissions from transport with new vehicle emissions standards. The review into credits follows the former head of the government\u2019s Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee, Prof Andrew Macintosh, going public with his concerns earlier this year. Macintosh said the growing carbon market overseen by the then Morrison government and the Clean Energy Regulator was \u201clargely a sham\u201d as most of the carbon credits approved did not represent real or new cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Bowen said on Tuesday he believed the concerns raised by Macintosh were \u201csubstantial and real\u201d and he took them \u201cvery seriously\u201d. Given the use of credits will be central in Labor\u2019s policies to achieve its proposed 43% cut in emissions by 2030, the minister said an independent review headed by credible experts was required to ensure confidence in the system. In addition to expediting the process to review the integrity of carbon credits, Bowen signalled that in August, consultations with Australia\u2019s large industrial polluters on Labor\u2019s telegraphed overhaul of the safeguard mechanism would kick off, with the scheme to be fully operational from July 2023. He said the government had a clear mandate to deliver the policy, under which a scheme introduced by the Coalition would be used to gradually reduce emissions from the country\u2019s 215 biggest industrial facilities. Government data released this week showed greenhouse gas emissions from heavy industry had risen 25.5% since 2005, largely due to an increase in liquified natural gas (LNG) exports. He said companies covered by the scheme would \u201chave options\u201d in deciding how they would meet emissions reduction targets set by the Clean Energy Regulator and the climate change department. \u201cOffsets will be an important part of that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important we get the governance of the carbon credits right.\u201d The minister said when the 47th parliament began at the end of July, the government would bring forward legislation enshrining the 2030 target and the commitment to achieve net zero commitment by 2050, and that bill would authorise the Climate Change Authority to report on progress in meeting the targets. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Bowen said the new legislative regime would also require an annual report to parliament by the minister, modelled on the annual Closing the Gap statement, outlining progress \u2013 a procedure that would force the opposition \u201cto share its views as well\u201d. He said he would produce a second piece of legislation in the opening parliamentary weeks cutting tariffs and fringe benefits tax on cheaper electric vehicles, and would start to roll out the government\u2019s electric vehicle strategy. Bowen on Wednesday left open the option of augmenting the strategy for reducing transport emissions including \u201cfurther policy options to add to and build on what we have already committed to\u201d. Asked whether that could mean the introduction of new vehicle emissions standards, which the Morrison government falsely claimed in 2019 was a \u201cwar on the weekend\u201d, the minister left that option open. \u201cWe\u2019ll consider all viable options to build on the policy announcements we made and are implementing,\u201d Bowen said. Vehicle efficiency standards, which would involve setting a target to lower the average emissions from the national vehicle fleet, were considered but rejected by the Coalition government despite a departmental analysis in December 2016 finding the benefits in savings on fuel and reduced emissions would outweigh the costs under all scenarios examined. Bowen rejected a suggestion that the leaders of G7 countries were slowing their ambition in addressing climate change due to the gas shortage triggered by responses to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. He said the big democracies had promised to do more to cut emissions while acknowledging gas, a fossil fuel, would \u201cplay a role\u201d. \u201cOur allies, whether it be G7 or EU, are also increasing their ambitions in relation to renewable energy, as they should,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re increasing their medium term targets, they\u2019re increasing their investment in photovoltaics.\u201d Asked whether Labor\u2019s pre-election claim that its policies would cut an average electricity bill by $275 by 2025 could still be delivered given the recent increase in wholesale power prices, Bowen said \u201cfigures will move around\u201d but it was \u201cmore important than ever\u201d that it accelerate the rollout of renewable energy as promised. He said having more renewables would put \u201cdownward pressure on prices\u201d."

            "date": "2022-06-30T03:56:45Z",
            "content": "Land clearing in NSW continues to exceed the long-term average, with more than 50,000 hectares of vegetation cleared for farming, forestry and infrastructure in 2020. The NSW opposition has described the situation as unsustainable. The shadow minister for the environment, Penny Sharpe, promised Labor would use a statutory review of native vegetation laws to consider what would be necessary to stop \u201cskyrocketing\u201d clearing, if elected in March. Justin Field, an independent member of the legislative council, warned the Perrottet government\u2019s failure to bring land clearing under control threatened the state\u2019s pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. The data, published Thursday, shows 51,400 hectares of woody vegetation was cleared across the state in 2020, a decrease on the previous year when 54,500 hectares was cleared. The amount of habitat destruction remains well above the 2009-17 average of 38,800 hectares, and the rate of clearing has climbed since the state government relaxed native vegetation laws in 2017. Clearing of woody vegetation for forestry \u2013 much of this in plantations \u2013 or infrastructure increased in 2020, but there was a decrease in the rate of vegetation loss due to agricultural activity, from 23,400 hectares in 2019 to 13,000 hectares in 2020. The amount of non-woody vegetation such as grasslands cleared on regulated rural land was 47,200 hectares. Factoring in woody vegetation cleared in those areas, the amount reached 68,200 hectares. Of this clearing, 75% was considered unexplained, meaning it either did not require a permit or was unlawful. Sharpe said the opposition believed the amount of clearing was too high and criticised the government for not undertaking a promised review of land-clearing codes three years after it relaxed the rules. A statutory review of native vegetation laws is also due. Sharpe said if Labor won the March election it would use this review to consider what needed to change, including whether regulations should be tightened. \u201cLabor believes that this situation is unsustainable and needs to be addressed. Ever since the laws were changed, clearing has continued to skyrocket,\u201d she said. \u201cLabor will use the statutory review to completely look at the changes that need to be made to bring land clearing to sustainable levels.\u201d Field said land use change was a major source of carbon emissions, but the government had been silent on how it would reverse trends in land clearing and deforestation. He said the amount of clearing that had been classified as unexplained raised serious questions about the adequacy of monitoring and enforcement of the state\u2019s land clearing and biodiversity protection laws. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe National party, enabled by a disinterested Liberal party, is turning our state into a dust bowl, ignoring consistent warnings that land clearing rates are too high and a threat to biodiversity,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is little point throwing hundreds of millions at the land sector for natural capital and carbon sequestration when nothing is being done about the thousands of hectares of potentially illegal land clearing.\u201d The NSW Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the government should investigate the unexplained clearing to determine the cause. \u201cThe total loss of vegetation on agricultural lands since the reforms is shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough there has been a reduction in 2020, the total lost since the reforms still adds up to a significant portion of the total land.\u201d Chris Gambian, the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said clearing had remained at \u201cdangerously high levels\u201d since the laws were changed. He said more than 1,040 plants and animals in NSW were considered threatened with extinction, about 40 more than when the changes were introduced. \u201cThe Coalition promised its new laws would enhance protections for bushland and wildlife,\u201d he said. \u201cThese figures, and the rising number of threatened species, shows the laws completely fail to deliver on that promise.\u201d A spokesperson for the NSW planning and environment department said the department had a program to monitor compliance with the laws, which were \u201cdeveloped to ensure a balanced approach to rural land management and biodiversity conservation\u201d. They said in the 2020-21 financial year the department had taken action on 273 occasions, including by issuing warning letters, fines and in five cases commencing prosecution. \u201cThe land management framework will be subject to a statutory five year review which is due to commence shortly and will report by August 2023,\u201d the spokesperson said. Comment has been sought from the NSW environment minister, James Griffin."

            "date": "2022-06-20T17:30:15Z",
            "content": "Transporting food from where it is produced to our dinner plates creates at least triple the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as previously estimated, a new study suggests. So called \u201cfood miles\u201d are likely responsible for about 6% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, the authors of the study found after calculating that 3bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent was produced in transporting food for human consumption each year. Scientists who carried out the research, which analysed 74 countries and regions and 37 different types of food, found richer countries accounted for 46% of the emissions from food miles but just 12.5% of the world\u2019s population. Fruit and vegetables had the highest food miles emissions because they often needed to be refrigerated and consumers demanded out-of-season foods. The University of Sydney\u2019s Prof David Raubenheimer, a co-author of the study published in the journal Nature Food, said research on making food production more sustainable had tended to focus on comparing plant-based diets to meat. \u201cWe tend to interpret information around us in simplistic terms, like \u2018meat is bad and vegetables are good\u2019 but we wanted a much more comprehensive picture,\u201d he said. \u201cOur study shows that in addition to shifting towards a plant-based diet, eating locally is ideal, especially in affluent countries.\u201d Study leader Dr Mengyu Li, also of the University of Sydney, said when food miles were added to emissions from land use, production and methane from cattle, about 30% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions were linked to food production. \u201cFood transport emissions add up to nearly half of direct emissions from road vehicles,\u201d she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While meat production emits 2.8bn tonnes CO2-e, which is seven times as much as fruit and vegetables, the emissions from food miles for meat was only 110m tonnes globally. This compared to 1.06bn tonnes for fruit and vegetables, with the second highest emitting food group being cereals and flour. The global total of 3bn tonnes of CO2-e related to food miles was between 3.5 and 7.5 times higher than previous estimates, the authors said. As well as calculating the emissions from moving the food to the consumer, the study also included the emissions from inputs used to produce the food. For example, the calculations would include emissions from grain that is grown and then transported to feed animals. About 1.7bn tonnes CO2-e of emissions came from moving food within countries, with 1.3bn tonnes coming from international transportation. Raubenheimer said supply of food was driven by demand and if consumer attitudes changed this could \u201creap environmental benefits on the grandest scale\u201d. \u201cOne example is the habit of consumers in affluent countries demanding unseasonal foods year-round, which need to be transported from elsewhere,\u201d he said. Total emissions from fruit and vegetables were high because of the higher distances travelled, and the fact that humans eat a lot of them. He said a next step was to use the study findings to build a more detailed picture of the impacts of different diets \u2013 on a societal and individual level \u2013 on food mile emissions. But he said a good rule was that if all the food you bought was produced locally, then less meat and more fruit and vegetables would be linked to less emissions. But if a plant-based diet included lots of imported and out-of-season produce, this would push emissions higher. \u201cEating local seasonal alternatives, as we have throughout most of the history of our species, will help provide a healthy planet for future generations,\u201d he said. Options for richer countries to reduce emissions included cleaner energy sources for vehicles and providing incentives to use production and distribution methods that cut emissions."

            "content": "Be careful what you wish for, is the abiding message of the first episode of Channel 4\u2019s new drama The Undeclared War. Be careful what you wish for if you are Saara Parvin (Hannah Khalique-Brown, doing fine work in her first major television role), a superbright graduate who begins her work experience alongside the even superbrighter computer analysts at GCHQ on the very day (in 2024) the country is hit by a cyber-attack from an as-yet unidentified source. \u201c55% of internet provision is down,\u201d says the boss, Danny (Simon Pegg, in a sort of non-cartoon version of his Mission Impossible role). It appears to have targeted non-essential online services and is deemed: \u201cCleverly targeted for maximum disruption and minimal risk to lives.\u201d Saara, however, proves superbrighterer than all of them and finds a second, hidden virus inside the first one that would have taken care of the other 45% and brought the country to its knees. She gets to sit in on a Cobra meeting \u2013 which feels unlikely, but no more unlikely than our own PM not turning up to most of his during a pandemic \u2013 but fails to make it to the hospital to see her father before he dies after an apparent suicide attempt. And you should be careful what you wish for if, like me, you were hoping The Undeclared War would deliver the perfect dose of quality hokum and escapism from the real world as it crashes and burns around us. A cyber-attack? What fun! It doesn\u2019t even come close to making the list of anxieties I work through these days. In fact, if that 55% included the transmission of daily headlines from around the globe, I would welcome it. \u201cBring on the temporary respite from the burden of awful knowledge!\u201d I would cry. Alas, The Undeclared War has taken the other route and is clearly designed to induct us all into a new field of worry. Created by the multi-award-winning Peter Kosminsky (who directed the brilliant Wolf Hall) after three years of research into modern intelligence and cybersecurity, the six-part series wears that research heavily and takes itself very seriously indeed. It moves at a glacial pace and the GCHQ staff have the air of reluctant office workers on data entry shifts, boredly tapping at their keyboards until it\u2019s time for a statutory tea break \u2013 rather than people frantically trying to hold off an enemy assault that could kill thousands and hurl the nation back to the middle ages, or at least the 1990s. While I\u2019m sure this is far more realistic than the bullet-sweating heroes Hollywood gives us (although would there really be such audible groans from codebreaking professionals when the boss tells them they have to go back over the malware code?), it doesn\u2019t provide much in the way of dramatic tension. Kosminsky\u2019s involvement presumably explains the appearance of such heavyweights as Adrian Lester (prime minister Andrew Makinde, who apparently ousted Boris 15 months ago), Alex Jennings (head of GCHQ, David Neal) and \u2013 still to come in later episodes \u2013 Mark Rylance (John Yeabsley, a former GCHQ asset brought back to help them deal with the attack). At the moment \u2013 and only one episode was available for review \u2013 they don\u2019t have much to do. The concentration on young Saara\u2019s discovery of the second virus banishes them to the sidelines in much the same way as the grownups were peripheral to an Enid Blyton adventure. It also brings to mind the gentle mockery of her setups by children\u2019s librarian Eileen Colwell \u2013 \u201cBut what hope has a band of desperate men against four children?\u201d The script, too is Blytonesque. People say \u201cWe\u2019re in!\u201d a lot, or \u201cWe\u2019re offline!\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s 70% reverse-engineered\u201d, without much in between. At the moment, The Undeclared War feels like it has aimed high and missed. But with five episodes to go, Kosminsky at the helm and a distinguished cast who, you would have thought, read the whole thing before they signed up, let us hope that drama and insight will both accrue. Maybe we will occasionally leave the static setting of GCHQ and find out how life is going for people without 55% of the internet? If not, it will feel like a rich premise squandered and we will be left hoping for a remake that leans into its potential as a fine contribution to the glossy tech nonsense genre \u2013 something we could all do with at this difficult time. The Undeclared War screens on Channel 4 in the UK, and is streaming on Stan in Australia."

            "content": "Malaysia\u2019s foreign minister, Saifuddin Abdullah, has said that his country\u2019s concerns about the Aukus nuclear submarine pact remain unchanged, after a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday with his Australian counterpart, Penny Wong. Saifuddin told reporters he communicated Malaysia\u2019s ongoing concern about the security deal between Australia, the UK and the US during a \u201cvery candid\u201d discussion with Wong on her first visit to the Malaysian capital as Australia\u2019s foreign minister. Regional objections to Australia\u2019s planned acquisition of nuclear-propelled submarines surfaced almost immediately after Aukus was unveiled by Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison. Saifuddin and Indonesia\u2019s foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, pointed to the risk of a regional arms race at a time of increasing tensions in the East and South China Seas. Last November, the Morrison government deployed then foreign minister Marise Payne to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia in an effort to smooth over tensions. Since being sworn in just over a month ago, Wong has embarked on a diplomatic offensive in the region to reset relationships disturbed by Aukus and to counter increasingly assertive regional outreach by China in the Pacific. Asked on Tuesday whether or not his negative view of Aukus had ameliorated since the unveiling of the pact last September, Malaysia\u2019s foreign minister said: \u201cMalaysia highly values regional peace and security of the Asean region.\u201d \u201cWe want to maintain the South China Sea in particular and the region as a whole as a region of peace, of commerce, of prosperity. \u201cWe had a very candid discussion on Aukus just now and I thank [Australia\u2019s] foreign minister for explaining the government\u2019s position. Malaysia\u2019s position remains the same. I have mentioned that to the foreign minister.\u201d Wong said she appreciated the opportunity \u201cto explain how we see Aukus to [Saifuddin] and to other counterparts in the visits I have made prior to this visit, which are obviously to Vietnam and to Jakarta\u201d. In early June Wong travelled to Jakarta with Australia\u2019s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, meeting her Indonesian counterpart during the visit. She also visited Vietnam before arriving in Malaysia for Tuesday\u2019s meeting with Saifuddin. \u201cIt is important that we listen to concerns, we respond to them respectfully,\u201d Wong said in Kuala Lumpur. \u201cThat\u2019s how the new government will seek to deal with some of the issues that have been raised and we hope that over time, people\u2019s concerns will be able to be allayed.\u201d Wong said Labor had taken the decision to support the Aukus pact while in opposition, and she said Australia had no nuclear ambitions. \u201cWe are not a nuclear power,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are nuclear powers in this region but Australia is not one of them.\u201d \u201cWhat we are doing is replacing an existing capability with a new capability, and that is nuclear-propelled submarines. We remain very clear that we do not seek and nor would we ever seek to have any nuclear capability on our submarines.\u201d In an implicit reference to China\u2019s growing assertiveness, Wong said Australia understood the region was being \u201creshaped economically and strategically\u201d and countries in the region, including Malaysia and others south-east Asia were attempting to \u201cnavigate this period of change\u201d. She said Australia\u2019s objective was not to meet aggression with aggression, but rather bolster the rules-based order. \u201cAustralia will always operate on the basis that we have this objective: a region that is peaceful, a region that is stable, a region that is prosperous, a region in which sovereignty is respected, and importantly, a region where rules enable some predictability to state behaviour and the way in which disputes are dealt with,\u201d Wong said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Tuesday\u2019s meeting was cordial apart from the pre-existing differences on Aukus and the two foreign ministers pledged to work together to bolster trade and bilateral cooperation on cybersecurity. While Wong is in Asia, Albanese has begun a series of meetings with foreign counterparts in Madrid as part of the Nato summit. The focus in Europe is on rising Russian aggression, but Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea have been invited to Madrid as part of efforts to build an Indo-Pacific focus. As Wong attempts to reset relationships in the region, Albanese will travel to France after Madrid to execute a rapprochement with Emmanuel Macron. Ahead of the visit, the Australian government agreed to pay \u20ac550m (A$830m) in a settlement with Naval Group over the former Morrison government\u2019s controversial decision to ditch the French attack class submarine project when it signed the Aukus pact."

The prime minister had been expected to address Conservative MPs at the Northern Research Group conference in Doncaster on Friday, but pulled out at the last minute. It later emerged he had travelled to Kyiv. Beset by challenges at home \u2013 including the resignation of his ethics adviser, Christopher Geidt, on Wednesday \u2013 Johnson is well-liked in Ukraine, where he is seen as having led western opposition to Russia\u2019s brutal invasion. In a statement released by No 10, Johnson said: \u201cAs Ukrainian soldiers fire UK missiles in defence of your nation\u2019s sovereignty, they do so also in defence of the very freedoms we take for granted. That is why I have offered President Zelenskiy a major new military training programme that could change the equation of this war \u2013 harnessing that most powerful of forces, the Ukrainian determination to win.\u201d The UK has provided \u00a31.3bn worth of economic and military support to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles and plastic explosives. But Ukraine\u2019s armed forces have been pressing for training on western military kit, as well as more heavy weapons. Kyiv wants a rapid influx of expertise and equipment so it can try to start pushing Russia back before the weather turns. The new training programme announced by Johnson will involve UK-led courses lasting three weeks, and include battle skills, basic medical training, cybersecurity and counter-explosive tactics. The courses will take place outside Ukraine, most likely in Poland. Zelenskiy\u2019s official spokesperson, Andriy Yermak, said that at the meeting with \u201cBoris\u201d, they had discussed \u201cthe much-needed heavy weapons and air defence systems supplies, economic support for Ukraine\u201d and \u201cincreasing sanctions pressure on the Russian Federation\u201d. Johnson said: \u201cTwo months on from my last visit, the Ukrainian grit, determination and resilience is stronger than ever, and I know that unbreakable resolve will long outlive the vain ambitions of President Putin.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s visit followed a meeting between Zelenskiy and key European leaders, including the French president and German chancellor, earlier this week. On Friday, the European Commission signalled its support for Ukraine to become a candidate country \u2013 the first step towards joining the EU.

Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, announced a vast extension of the tagging system at the Conservative party conference, saying more than 25,000 criminals would be fitted with ankle tags as part of a \u00a3183m plan. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said the HMPPS had once again allowed its ambition to outstrip its ability to deliver. \u201cAfter years of poor performance, missed deadlines and almost \u00a3100m of taxpayer money down the pan, electronic tagging has failed to become the modern and effective service intended,\u201d she said. \u201cDespite repeated warnings by my committee on the importance of good data and evaluation, the debacle means that robust information is simply not available. [The Ministry of Justice] is marching ahead with more electronic tagging but is flying blind on whether it\u2019s actually effective.\u201d There were more than 15,000 tagged offenders last year, including people on bail, those who have received community orders, those on licence after their release from prison, and foreign national offenders. Tags can be used to monitor whether the wearer is at home during set periods, to track movements or to monitor alcohol concentrations in sweat. In 2011 the MoJ set out to overhaul the tagging system to make it more efficient, but the report says this has been \u201cunsuccessful because HMPPS has failed to deliver a new case management system\u201d. It says: \u201cHMPPS has had to rely on old and outdated technology and fundamental inefficiencies in tagging services remain unresolved. The current system requires staff to re-enter information manually, which is slower and more prone to error.\u201d The Gemini case management system was \u201cintended to improve data, streamline processes and save money\u201d, but a decision was taken in August 2021 to terminate the contract with Capita. Without Gemini, information on journeys taken by offenders is limited, and \u201cthe poor quality data means that HMPPS still does not have evidence as to whether electronic monitoring is effective in reducing reoffending\u201d, the report says. According to the report, HMPPS and Capita \u201ccontributed to severe delays\u201d for the transformation programme. \u201cBy the time the contract for Gemini was terminated, the programme was already 18 months late against its original, over-optimistic timetable.\u201d Plans for HMPPS and the Home Office to monitor foreign criminals using smartwatches that capture biometric data have been delayed because the operating system \u201cdid not meet government cybersecurity standards\u201d, the report says."

            "content": "Donald Trump will \u201cfight even harder\u201d on the road to a possible White House run in 2024 because of the acquittal of a lawyer for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign on a charge of lying to the FBI. \u201cIf anything, it makes me want to fight even harder,\u201d the former president told Fox News Digital. \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, our country is ruined. We have bad borders, bad elections and a court system not functioning properly.\u201d Trump beat Clinton in 2016 but lost to Joe Biden in 2020, a defeat he refuses to accept, claiming it was caused by electoral fraud. That lie inspired the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, by supporters Trump told to \u201cfight like hell\u201d. A bipartisan Senate report linked seven deaths to the riot. More than 800 people have been charged, some \u2013 members of a far-right militia \u2013 with seditious conspiracy. A House select committee will soon hold public hearings. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted, leaving him free to run for office. In legal jeopardy over his attempt to overturn the election and his business affairs, he has said he will decide on a run after midterm elections this year. The strength of Trump\u2019s hold on the Republican party has come under question after primary defeats for candidates he endorsed. But he remains popular with the party base. Democrats and other observers have raised the alarm about Trump loyalists moving to take over crucial elections posts in swing states. The Clinton lawyer, Michael Sussmann, was charged with lying to the FBI when he pushed information meant to cast suspicions on Trump and links to Russia. He was acquitted on Tuesday. The case was the first test of the special counsel John Durham since his appointment three years ago to search for misconduct in the investigation into Russia and Trump. Trump supporters have looked to Durham to expose what they say was FBI wrongdoing. The trial focused on whether Sussmann, a cybersecurity attorney and former federal prosecutor, concealed from the FBI that he was representing Clinton\u2019s campaign when he presented data he said showed a possible backchannel between the Russia-based Alfa Bank and the Trump Organization. The FBI determined that there was no suspicious contact. The bureau\u2019s then general counsel, James Baker, testified that he was \u201c100% confident\u201d Sussmann told him he was not representing any client. Prosecutors said Sussmann was actually acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign and another entity. Sussmann\u2019s lawyers denied that he lied and said that even if he made a false statement it was irrelevant since the FBI was already investigating Russia and Trump. Trump claims a vast conspiracy. Speaking to Fox News Digital, he said: \u201cThey spied on my campaign. They got caught. If a Republican would have done that, and the obvious steps forward, it would be a virtual death penalty.\u201d He also said: \u201cThis was totally illegal. What they did was treason, and it also put our country in a lot of danger with Russia.\u201d Robert Mueller, the special counsel who investigated Trump and Russia, did not find evidence of direct collusion. He did lay out extensive evidence of contacts between Trump aides and Moscow, and he indicted or received guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies, and detailed 11 incident of possible obstruction of justice by Trump or his campaign. Trump asked: \u201cWhere do you get your reputation back?\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-19T17:33:45Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden\u2019s treasury secretary Janet Yellen says she expects \u201cthe economy to slow\u201d but continued insisting that a full-blown recession is not \u201cat all inevitable\u201d. Yellen\u2019s remarks on Sunday came days after the US central bank moved to sharply raise interest rates in an effort to contain soaring inflation. She told ABC\u2019s This Week host George Stephanopoulous that her financial outlook results from how the economy has \u201cbeen growing at a very rapid rate, as the economy, as the labor market, has recovered and we have reached full employment\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s natural now that we expect a transition to steady and stable growth, but I don\u2019t think a recession is at all inevitable,\u201d Yellen added. Pressed on the issue of inflation, which polls indicate is a top priority for US voters as the midterm elections in November approach, Yellen said inflation causes are global, not local, and those factors are unlikely to diminish immediately. Yellen said some trade tariffs on China inherited from the administration of former President Donald Trump made \u201cno strategic sense\u201d. She added that Biden was reviewing them as a way to bring down inflation. \u201cClearly, inflation is unacceptably high,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cIt\u2019s President Biden\u2019s top priority to bring it down.\u201d The US central bank\u2019s chairperson, Jerome Powell, has also said \u201cit\u2019s his goal to bring it down while maintaining a strong labor economy,\u201d according to Yellen. The comments from Biden\u2019s top economist came reflect the administration\u2019s ongoing push to change the national narrative around the economy. Yellen\u2019s comments were more in line with that push than they have been recently. Last month, she broke with the administration\u2019s preferred talking points when she admitted to the American public that she \u201cwas wrong\u201d about the path inflation would take. Recent economic confidence polling has shown sharp drops, with Gallup recording the lowest reading during the coronavirus pandemic, and it\u2019s likely the lowest confidence has been since the tail end of the Great Recession in early 2009. Dissatisfaction with Biden\u2019s handling of the economy could ricochet through the midterms elections. Central to those concerns are gasoline prices, which have surged during Biden\u2019s term. On Sunday, Yellen voiced measured support for temporarily pausing gasoline taxes, describing it as an idea \u201ccertainly worth considering\u201d. Separately, energy secretary Jennifer Granholm warned drivers against expecting quick relief in prices amid tight oil supplies worldwide. The US energy information administration has projected that prices at the pump will average about $4.27 per gallon in the third quarter \u2013 down from the current $4.98 \u2013 but that its forecast could be \u201ccompletely upended\u201d by world events. \u201cWe know this is going to be a tough summer because driving season just started,\u201d Granholm said. \u201cAnd we know that there will be continued upward pull on demand.\u201d Looking ahead to Biden\u2019s scheduled \u2013 and highly controversial \u2013 visit to Saudi Arabia next month, Granholm said the president \u201chas asked for all suppliers around the globe to increase production\u201d. The planned trip has become a lightning rod for criticism as it appears to be a reversal of the president\u2019s stated intent to make the kingdom a \u201cpariah\u201d over its human-rights record, including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the CIA concluded was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Granholm said Biden is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about human rights in Saudi Arabia and surely will raise the issue, \u201cbut he\u2019s also very concerned about what people are experiencing at the pump and Saudi Arabia is head of OPEC\u201d. \u201cWe need to have increased production so that everyday citizens in America will not be feeling this pain that they\u2019re feeling right now,\u201d Granholm added. Yellen was not alone Sunday in presenting a more upbeat economic message than the recessionist narrative most US economists are presenting. A survey of economists published Sunday by The Wall Street Journal raised the probability of recession to 44% in the next 12 months \u2013 a level of probability that the newspaper wrote is \u201cusually seen only on the brink of or during actual recession.\u201d The director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese, told Margaret Brennan on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation that the US \u201cis in an uncertain moment and we face real challenges, global challenges.\u201d \u201cWe need to navigate through this transition in a way that gets us to stable growth without giving up all of the incredible economic gains that we\u2019ve made,\u201d he said. Pressed on how the administration plans to lower inflation, running at a 40-year high of 8.6% and projected by the congressional budget office to remain high into 2024, Deese said a package of legislative measures was being prepared in congress to lower prescription drug costs, utility costs and enacting tax reforms. \u201cIf we can do a package like that we can move forward in the near future,\u201d Deese said. \u201cIt will not only help in lowering prices, but it will send a signal to the markets and the global economy that the United States is really deadly serious about taking on this inflation.\u201d In a rare one-on-one interview last week, Biden set out his administration\u2019s public line. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s not inevitable,\u201d he said to the Associated Press. \u201cSecondly, we\u2019re in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation.\u201d As clouds gathered over the US economic position during the past 18 months, administration economic officials and central bankers have reformed their inflation message from \u201ctransitory\u201d to an economy, as Deese said, that is \u201cin a transition.\u201d"

            "content": "As he celebrated the impressive May jobs report on Friday, Joe Biden went to great lengths to paint a rosy picture of the US economy. While acknowledging the difficult reality of high prices caused by near record-high inflation, Biden pointed to the 390,000 jobs created last month to argue that the US is in a strong economic position. \u201cI know that even with today\u2019s good news, a lot of Americans remain anxious, and I understand the feeling,\u201d the US president said. \u201cBut there\u2019s every reason for the American people to feel confident that we\u2019ll meet these challenges.\u201d But as of now, much of America does not seem to be buying the optimistic vision that Biden and his team are selling. Polls show Americans are viewing the US economy with a growing sense of pessimism, as experts warn of a potential recession. Despite the White House\u2019s renewed efforts this month to allay Americans\u2019 concerns, high prices and economic uncertainty are weighing heavily on the minds of many voters. With less than six months to go until the midterm elections, the odds of a Republican rout in November appear higher than ever. Americans who started taking notice of rising prices last year are now feeling the brutal impact of inflation on their family budgets. Gas prices are at record highs and continuing to climb, partly due to the war in Ukraine. Wages have gone up in the past year, but those gains have been wiped out by inflation. While average hourly earnings increased by 5.2% over the past 12 months, the latest US inflation report showed prices rose by 8.3% from a year earlier. That sticker shock has marred Americans\u2019 views of the economy. A Gallup survey taken last month found that only 14% of American adults consider economic conditions to be \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, marking the lowest rating during the pandemic. The cost of living ranks as one of Americans\u2019 top concerns, with a recent Pew Research Center survey showing that 70% of US adults view inflation as a very big problem for the country. Biden and his advisers are clearly aware that concerns about the economy could be a heavy liability for Democrats in November, and they are taking steps to improve Americans\u2019 outlook. The White House announced this week that it was launching a month-long campaign to highlight Biden\u2019s economic accomplishments since taking office. To kick off the new effort, Biden wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed highlighting his plan to combat inflation. The president also met Tuesday with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and White House officials have made dozens of television appearances in the last week to highlight the best elements of the US economy. One of those television appearances included a mea culpa from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who acknowledged the White House\u2019s previous claims that inflation would be \u201ctransitory\u201d had been proved wrong. \u201cI think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,\u201d Yellen told CNN last week. \u201cAs I mentioned, there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I didn\u2019t, at the time, fully understand. But we recognize that now.\u201d The Federal Reserve is now taking aggressive steps to slow the pace of inflation. The central bank announced last month that it would raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points, marking the sharpest increase in more than 20 years. Several more rate hikes are expected in the coming months. Increased interest rates often foreshadow a recession, and more economists are now warning of that possibility. Lloyd Blankfein, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, said last month that the country now faces a \u201cvery, very high risk\u201d of a recession, although he added that it was not inevitable at this point. Amid this escalating anxiety, Biden has made a point to emphasize the independence of the Federal Reserve, saying he will not criticize or interfere with Powell\u2019s efforts to tame inflation. \u201cThe Federal Reserve has a primary responsibility to control inflation,\u201d Biden wrote in his oped. \u201cMy predecessor demeaned the Fed, and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation. I won\u2019t do this. I have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution.\u201d Biden\u2019s oped seemed to reflect how his hands are tied when it comes to inflation. After all, the Federal Reserve has the power to set interest rates, and Congress has the ability to pass legislation that could help Americans weather the storm of high inflation. In his oped, Biden again called on Congress to pass a bill to lower the cost of utility bills, prescription drugs and childcare. But Biden\u2019s Build Back Better Act, which included many of those proposals, failed in the evenly divided Senate, and progress to pass a slimmed-down version of the legislation has been slow. \u201cI think it does reflect his limited options. Inflation is caused primarily by monetary policy, and he cannot control the money supply,\u201d said Henry Olsen, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative thinktank. \u201cMost of what he could do is provide more leadership and push for Congress to act.\u201d Faced with that difficult reality, Biden and his team have instead pursued a strategy of trying to convince Americans that the economy is in better shape than it seems by looking at gas prices and grocery bills. The president takes every opportunity to remind Americans that the unemployment rate is just 3.6%, which is near a half-century low. Of course, the job market has been strong for months, and in that time, Americans\u2019 views on the economy have only worsened. Biden\u2019s strategy to persuade Americans that they are better off than they think \u2013 even as many people are being forced to make difficult financial decisions \u2013 could be quite risky. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing every day is things that you have to purchase going up in price,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cThere\u2019s kind of a presidential strategy of, \u2018Be grateful for what you have, rather than what you don\u2019t.\u2019 That\u2019s just not going to work politically.\u201d Looking ahead to November, Biden is running out of time to change voters\u2019 minds about his economic accomplishments. Biden\u2019s approval rating has been mired in the low 40s since the fall, and for more than 70 years, no president has substantially improved his approval rating in the six months before a midterm election. Given the political environment, election forecasters are increasingly confident about the likelihood of a Republican wave in November. The Cook Political Report updated its prediction for the House last week, saying Republicans are now expected to gain a net of 20 to 35 seats, which is far more than the party needs to regain control of the lower chamber. To Olsen, the Cook Political Report\u2019s latest prediction seems too optimistic for Biden and his party. \u201cDemocrats should be lucky if that\u2019s all it is,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory strongly suggests that we\u2019re looking at a historic shellacking.\u201d"

            "content": "Ride-sharing giant Uber and the Transport Workers\u2019 Union have struck a landmark agreement on proposed employment standards and benefits ahead of expected new gig economy regulation from the Albanese government. The union and Uber have also agreed to jointly support the creation of a new independent government-funded regulatory body to create industry-wide standards for ride share and food delivery gig workers following months of negotiations. Under the agreed standards, the body will be responsible for creating minimum and transparent enforceable earnings, benefits and conditions for people who work on the ride-share platform. The body will also act as a means for resolving disputes over platform employment issues, such as when a worker\u2019s account is deactivated. The standards also outline that the rights of workers to join and be represented by a union will be respected. \u201cIt is quite a remarkable document. It\u2019s a remarkable set of principles,\u201d the Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary, Michael Kaine, told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s something that identifies that we need change, and there is a pathway to change, and we\u2019ve got a new federal government that\u2019s indicated that it wants to act in this area as well. So the stars are aligning for us all.\u201d Uber\u2019s general manager in Australia, Dominic Taylor, said the new standards would still retain flexibility for drivers and delivery drivers. \u201c[That] flexibility [is] why, we hear from our drivers, they come back time and time again. However, what we are announcing today is how do we work towards a system that allows us to also overlay benefits that are more commonly associated with an employment-like contract, in the form of benefits, guarantees, safety nets,\u201d he said. Labor promised ahead of the May election to update the Fair Work Act to account for the rise of the gig economy, including expanding the Fair Work Commission to cover \u201cemployee-like\u201d forms of work like gig economy work, allowing it to set minimum standards. Guardian Australia has previously reported on the difficulties drivers face when they have their accounts deactivated as a result of false customer complaints. Lorna Berry, an Uber driver based in Melbourne, told a Senate inquiry last year her account had been deactivated after someone had reported her for being \u201cviolent\u201d after informing the customers of the mask requirement. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said at the time there was no phone line to contact the company, meaning she had to deal with them over email. It took four or five days until her account was reactivated. Phone support has since resumed. Kaine said the new dispute mechanism should be designed so that workers have confidence that if they do the right thing, they will get a decent wage, be taken care of when things go wrong, get access to a workplace health and safety system, and they won\u2019t be arbitrarily terminated. \u201cAll of that\u2019s a package and it all goes towards industry sustainability. How it will look at the end of the day, that\u2019s something for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the intention is that we build a sustainable system that has [an] industry-wide set of standards so we can get a level playing field.\u201d Taylor said Uber wanted to see other ride-share and delivery companies participate and for the changes to apply industry-wide, but said it was important for Uber to take the leading role. \u201cAs the market leader in both ride-share and online food delivery sector with over 100,000 drivers and delivery people making money from Uber every month, quite frankly, we need to take a position of leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are excited to work with [the TWU] in going to Canberra to lay out our vision for what it looks like to improve the quality of independent work in Australia.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-23T15:57:05Z",
            "content": "Germany has moved one step closer to gas rationing, after the country\u2019s economic ministry on Thursday warned of a high risk of long-term supply shortages due to Russia systematically choking off gas deliveries. Economy minister Robert Habeck announced the second of three energy emergency plan phases, which enables utility firms to pass on high gas prices to customers and thereby help to lower demand. The ministry said the reason for the warning was a reduction in Russian gas deliveries since 14 June amid continued high prices on the gas market. Should Russian gas deliveries via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline continue to remain at the low level of 40%, the ministry said in a statement, \u201ca storage target of 90% by December cannot be reached without additional measures\u201d. Habeck said there would \u201chopefully never\u201d be a need to ration gas, but added: \u201cOf course, I cannot rule it out. The plan was to making savings, expand infrastructure and switch to alternative sources of energy during the hot summer months to avert a rationing scenario in the winter. Germany\u2019s plans to replenish its gas reserves face another obstacle next month, when the Nord Stream 1 pipeline is closed for its annual inspection on 11 July and will be unable to carry any gas. The inspection usually lasts around 10 days, but Habeck indicated concerns that Russia\u2019s president could use the opportunity to stop deliveries completely under some technical pretext. \u201cThere\u2019s no point pretending \u2013 the throttling of gas deliveries amounts to an economic attack on us by Putin,\u201d the minister for economic and energy affairs said. \u201cPutin\u2019s strategy is blatantly to stir insecurity, to drive up prices and to drive a wedge through our society. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t feel like it yet, we are in a gas crisis,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom now on, gas is going to be a scarce good.\u201d The Green party politician said the current crisis was also a result of preceding German governments having allowed themselves to become too reliant on Russian gas and not sufficiently diversified its energy sources. \u201cThat is now coming back to haunt us and must be rectified at great speed,\u201d Habeck said at a press conference on Thursday morning. Germany has been racing to fill its gas storage facilities in time for the winter, as Europe\u2019s largest economy scrambles to wean itself off Russian energy supplies in the face of a possible European embargo or a potential decision by Moscow to completely cut off supplies. In a move controversial with the Green party\u2019s voter base, the German government is planning to build two new liquified natural gas terminals on the North Sea coast and restart some coal-fired power plants that were due to be phased out. On 14 June, Gazprom announced it was reducing deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline by 40%, citing delayed repairs of technical parts by German company Siemens. Habeck said on Thursday the technical reasons given were \u201conly a pretext\u201d. The economic minister rallied German industry leaders around his emergency plans on Tuesday, warning them that large companies could face not just days but months of gas shortages in the coming winter. \u201cIf the plan works out, the storage units will be full in winter,\u201d he said at a meeting of German DAX companies in Berlin. \u201cThere is a certain degree of hope that we can manage this. But make no mistake, we are not there yet, the units are only at 60%.\u201d"

            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy is starting to \u201crun on empty\u201d as post-pandemic order books dry up and the highest inflation in 40 years affects confidence, the latest snapshot of the private sector has shown. Flash estimates of the economy\u2019s performance in June showed business optimism at its lowest since the early months of the Covid pandemic in the spring of 2020 and the sharpest drop in new order volumes for a year. The monthly survey of purchasing managers produced by S&amp;P and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) said overall business activity across the services and manufacturing sectors was unchanged on the 15-month low of 53.1 reached in May. A reading above 50 suggests private sector activity is expanding while a reading below 50 points to contraction. Demand for labour remained strong despite weaker new business growth, with job creation the highest in three months. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said: \u201cThe economy is starting to look like it is running on empty. Current business growth is being supported by orders placed in prior months as companies report a near-stalling of demand. \u201cManufacturers, in particular, are struggling with falling orders, especially for exports, and the service sector is already seeing signs of the recent growth spurt from pent-up pandemic demand move into reverse amid the rising cost of living.\u201d Meanwhile, the monthly survey of high street spending from the CBI showed the Queen\u2019s platinum jubilee celebrations failed to boost the fortunes of Britain\u2019s struggling retailers as mounting cost of living pressures curbed spending power. Retail sales fell for a third month in June and retailers predicted another tough month in July. Although the employers\u2019 organisation\u2019s distributive trades survey did not include spending in bars and restaurants over the bank holiday weekend, separate snapshots of the economy provided further evidence of the UK\u2019s cost of living crisis. Separately, the monthly barometer of consumer confidence from the data firm GfK found pessimism had hit a record low in June, with gloom even deeper than during the pandemic, the 2008 global financial crisis or the aftermath of the Brexit referendum vote. The CBI\u2019s health check of retailing followed comments in the Daily Telegraph by the organisation\u2019s outgoing president \u2013 Lord Karan Bilimoria \u2013 in which he said the UK was \u201cdefinitely\u201d heading for recession. Ben Jones, a CBI economist, said: \u201cRetail volumes are struggling as high inflation eats away at consumers\u2019 budgets. The squeeze on household incomes appears to have offset any boost to activity from the extended platinum jubilee bank holiday earlier this month. \u201cThere are also clearer signs that a downturn in consumer spending is beginning to ripple out across the wider distribution sector, with wholesalers seeing a 14-month period of robust sales growth come to a grinding halt this month.\u201d The annual inflation rate rose to 9.1% in May, and the flash estimates of the economy\u2019s performance in June from S&amp;P/Cips showed business optimism at its lowest since the early months of the pandemic in the spring of 2020 coupled with the sharpest drop in new order volumes for a year. A similar PMI for the eurozone showed a sharper slowdown than in the UK, with the composite measure of services and manufacturing dropping from 54.8 to 51.9 in June. Williamson said that apart from months affected by pandemic-induced lockdowns it was the sharpest decline since the global financial crisis in 2008. He said business confidence in the UK had now slumped to a level that in the past typically signalled imminent recession. \u201cThe weakness of the broad flow of economic data so far in the second quarter points to a drop in GDP which the forward-looking PMI numbers suggest will gather momentum in the third quarter.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-09T06:26:18Z",
            "content": "Labor has accused Peter Dutton of \u201crank politics\u201d and undermining the Aukus agreement for revealing he planned to buy US nuclear submarines to fill a looming capability gap. The deputy prime minister and defence minister, Richard Marles, made the comments in response to Dutton calling on Labor to implement a plan he devised before the election to buy two Virginia-class submarines by 2030. In September 2021 Australia tore up a $90bn submarine contract with France to instead acquire nuclear submarine technology from the US or the UK as part of the new Aukus alliance. The deal created a looming capability gap, requiring the Collins class submarines to be upgraded and their life extended until the first nuclear-propelled submarines could be made in Australia by the late 2030s. On Thursday Dutton wrote in the Australian newspaper that he \u201cbelieved it possible to negotiate with the Americans to acquire, say, the first two submarines off the production line out of Connecticut\u201d. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t mean waiting until 2038 for the first submarine to be built here in Australia,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe would have our first two subs this decade. I had formed a judgment the Americans would have facilitated exactly that.\u201d The comments are controversial because Australia is yet to decide whether to opt for US or UK nuclear submarines. Marles said Dutton\u2019s intervention was \u201crank politics and is completely inconsistent with everything Peter Dutton was doing and saying in government\u201d. \u201cThis outburst today, from someone so recently in the [defence minister\u2019s] chair, is damaging to Australia\u2019s national interest,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe comments are loose and undermine the Aukus agreement.\u201d \u201cThe government has made no decision on the preferred submarine. All options remain on the table.\u201d Marles argued that the Coalition in opposition was highlighting its \u201cability to talk tough and beat their chest without delivering\u201d. Earlier, Dutton confirmed on 2GB radio that he believed the Coalition would have been in a position by July or August to announce the conclusion of consultation about which submarine to buy. Dutton said he was \u201cworried\u201d that Labor were \u201cwalking away from Aukus, from the submarine deal\u201d. Dutton accused the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, of \u201cill-informed\u201d language that didn\u2019t reflect advice to government \u201cthat you couldn\u2019t have diesel-powered submarines really working in some parts where it needs to work off the shores of our country \u2026 beyond 2035\u201d. \u201cIf Labor thinks there\u2019s a cheap option here to build a new diesel electric submarine \u2026 then I think that\u2019s folly and it just worries me.\u201d Dutton also weighed in on the high court\u2019s decision that the home affairs minister\u2019s power to strip dual nationals of Australian citizenship for engaging in suspected terrorist activities was invalid. The Liberal leader said the Albanese government had to respond \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d and the opposition would support recalling parliament earlier than 26 July if changes to legislation were needed. Labor has played down the need for any changes, as only two people will get their citizenship back as a result of the decision, the plaintiff Delil Alexander, and one other. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has also cited other powers to prevent risks from Australian citizens suspected of terrorism including temporary exclusion orders and control orders. Dutton also warned ahead of New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s trip to Australia that Labor\u2019s election victory could result in a decrease in the number of visa cancellations on character grounds. The Coalition in office \u201cdeported about 10,100 people of these criminals and we know that when Labor was in government \u2026 they did about 1,100\u201d, he told 2GB radio. \u201cNow the numbers will drop off again, no doubt under this government. \u201cI understand why New Zealand wouldn\u2019t want them back, but they\u2019re citizens of New Zealand, the UK and elsewhere \u2026 If Anthony Albanese tries to wind [deportations] back, I think that would be a devastating outcome.\u201d"

            "title": "Secret City: behind the untold gay history of DC politics",
            "date": "2022-06-09T07:02:12Z",
            "content": "LGBTQ+ people have always existed, although they have largely been erased from historical narratives and even forced to participate in their own erasure. This is true of American politics, where the 20th century saw numerous gay and lesbian individuals participating at the highest levels of power, yet almost wholly effaced from the telling of our nation\u2019s history. In the new book Secret City, historian James Kirchick attempts to inscribe into the historical record the homosexual men and women who have served and contributed to their country in Washington DC, throughout the 20th century. \u201cI want to intertwine these two threads \u2013 the mainstream thread of history that we all read about, and this gay history that\u2019s been sidelined and sequestered,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to bring them together to show they\u2019re connected stories, that they interact and complement each other. It\u2019s not overturning this established narrative, it\u2019s adding to it and complicating it.\u201d Kirchick first became intrigued by the idea of a gay history of American power politics in 2007, when he moved to DC and realized that it was suffused with a vivid gay cultural life and history. In fact, census data shows that DC has the highest proportion of gay people anywhere in the US. As he began working on the massive project, Kirchick started to believe that, as a gay man, he was uniquely equipped to write Secret City. \u201cIt needed a gay person to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cEven liberal straight historians would feel uncomfortable about writing this kind of a book. It\u2019s important that we have these stories. My being gay informs my ability to say that.\u201d Starting with the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and continuing up through Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, Kirchick has spent a decade uncovering long-hidden stories that have been lost from history. At 800 pages, including well over 100 just for notes and sources, the scope of Secret City feels momentous. Although Kirchick found that writing the book could be overwhelming as he worked to piece together all of the information he discovered, and while at times he became angry at the historical wrongs he found, his dominant emotion while working on the project was gratitude. \u201cI feel enormous gratitude for the people who came before. For the people who went through this suffering so I wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d Kirchick astutely points out that the fear of homosexuality has been a driver of presidential politics, functioning similarly to other historically recognized forms of prejudice like antisemitism and purges of so-called communists. This prejudice got kickstarted with the revelations of the Kinsey Reports in 1948 and 1953, when people suddenly realized that the gay population was far larger than anyone had guessed. Even more frightening, they could be anyone. This fear of \u201cthe gay next door\u201d fueled stereotypes of gays being disloyal to the United States, as well as the belief that they were inherently conspiratorial \u2013 \u201cif you have three homosexuals in the room, it\u2019s automatically a conspiracy,\u201d said Kirchick. A good example of this point is the bizarre story of Bob Livingston. Best-known for being forced to resign amid a sex scandal while on the brink of succeeding Newt Gingrich as Speaker of the House during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Livingston in 1980 became convinced that the gay men legitimately working for Ronald Reagan were in fact a sinister cabal secretly controlling him. Kirchick entwines this lurid tale, which fueled an effort to scuttle Reagan\u2019s 1980 presidential nomination, with a number of gay conspiracy theories attached to the Reagan administration (including one that Reagan himself had sex with another man). Although these allegations are absurd excess based on little more than rumor, Kirchick argues that they had the potential to have turned Jimmy Carter\u2019s landslide loss in the 1980 election to a win. Regardless of all the intrigue, Kirchick also reports that Reagan\u2019s administration proved to be \u201cthe gayest of any presidential administration yet\u201d, demonstrating two points central to Secret City: the growing acceptance of gays throughout the 20th century and their great value in government, even a macho, hard-right one like Reagan\u2019s. It is an irony common to stories of LGBTQ+ resilience that the very things that oppressed gay and lesbian individuals \u2013 such as the need to lead a double-life, or the isolation that came from not being permitted to marry \u2013 were made advantageous both to the pursuit of their liberation and their political careers. \u201cIn the period documented in this book,\u201d Kirchick said, \u201cclosets were good at producing gay people with skills that made them preternaturally equipped to function in Washington \u2013 they were good at keeping secrets, had no family life to distract them, and they were more loyal to people in power. This is the perverse set of skills that the closet could breed.\u201d Throughout Secret City, Kirchick does a masterful job of conveying the flavor of homophobia in each historical era, while using impeccable research to vividly characterize the dozens of various individuals at play in these stories. This is a book not just about how political power was brought to bear on the lives of gay men and women; even more, it conveys the texture of an ever-evolving world that constantly kept gay people in check. It shows how social forces shaped gay lives through constant implicit and explicit threats, the very language that homosexuals had to describe their identity and experience, and stern control over the ways they could access the sexual practices that were made so central to their identity as human beings. Because of this rich attention to detail, Secret City also offers a vivid chronicle of the waves of liberation and backlash that characterized the growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights in the 20th century. As Kirchick shows, the second world war became a national coming out of sorts, with gay people meeting in the armed forces in unprecedented numbers. This was followed by a wave of repression in the 1950s, then liberation in the sex-positive \u201960s, followed by more repression in the eras of Nixon and Reagan, followed by more freedom during the Bill Clinton presidency. Across the sweep of Secret City, we see homosexuality transform from an absolute career-ender to something politicians can be carefully open about. These waves continue today in Republican efforts to slander LGBTQ+ people as \u201cgroomers\u201d and erase the gains trans people have made in access to medical care and social inclusion. Although Kirchick is well aware of the ugly politics of the present, as well as the fragility of the gains LGBTQ+ people have made in society, he ends Secret City on a note of triumph, celebrating the transformative acceptance of gay people as a \u201cmassive accomplishment of the liberal society\u201d, and a quintessentially American success story. \u201cI can point to a Gallup poll that self-reported LGBT people have doubled,\u201d Kirchick said. \u201cAnd obviously there\u2019s been this explosion in visibility. I can\u2019t predict the future, you can never say never. But in my limited experience I\u2019m fairly sure that there\u2019s never been a better time to be gay in this country.\u201d Secret City is out now"

            "date": "2022-06-06T21:30:07Z",
            "content": "Concerns have been raised over the City\u2019s influence on Westminster, after a report found financial firms and individuals tied to the sector donated \u00a315m to political parties and gave \u00a32m to MPs during the pandemic. The campaign group Positive Money tallied the gifts, expenses and donations handed to MPs, peers and their parties, as well as the value of income from politicians\u2019 second jobs, saying it contributed to finance\u2019s \u201coversized influence\u201d on policymaking. It found banks, insurers and lobby groups held a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d amount of meetings with the Treasury, accounting for a third of minister meetings in 2020 and 2021, and argued that led to favourable policies such as deregulation, and an economy that was \u201cstructurally reliant\u201d on the City of London. The Conservative party was the largest recipient of City donations to political parties, accounting for more than \u00a311m or 76% of donated cash over the two-year period. \u201cOnce the scale of big finance\u2019s influence over government is laid bare, it becomes obvious how banks get bailouts and tax cuts while the rest of us get austerity and tax rises,\u201d said David Barmes, a senior economist at Positive Money. The report, titled The Power of Big Finance: How to Reclaim Our Democracy From the Banking Lobby, found 47 MPs received \u00a32.3m between them \u2013 an average of \u00a348,936 each \u2013 from the financial sector between January 2020 and December 2021. While 26 did no work in return for the payments, those who did were paid an average of \u00a32,738 an hour, 180 times the average UK wage of \u00a315.15. About \u00a31.2m of that total was collected by just five Conservative politicians, including former prime minister Theresa May, who was paid more than \u00a3200,000 for speeches at events run by JP Morgan and Amundi Asset Management, and the health secretary, Sajid Javid, who was paid a total of \u00a3175,000 for his former role as a senior adviser for JP Morgan, as well as speeches for firms including HSBC. JP Morgan was the biggest spender among City firms in Westminster as a result, having paid \u00a3300,000 on salaries and speaker fees during the period. The Eurosceptic Conservative MP John Redwood was the highest City earner among his peers, receiving nearly \u00a3471,000 for roles including his position as chief global strategist at investment manager Charles Stanley, and an advisory role to private equity firm EPIC. In the House of Lords, the report found a fifth of peers registered paid positions at financial firms, including more than half of the peers on a committee responsible for investigating matters related to economics and finance. Positive Money also raised concerns about the revolving door between Westminster and the City. That issue of possible conflicts of interest became prominent during the recent Greensill scandal, after former prime minister David Cameron and ex-civil servants were found to have lobbied ex-colleagues on behalf of the now-collapsed lender Greensill Capital. \u201cAccess to public institutions isn\u2019t just the exceptional case of a few bad apples bending the rules \u2013 such as David Cameron\u2019s lobbying on behalf of \u2026 Greensill Capital \u2013 but represents a far wider systemic problem,\u201d Positive Money said. It is now recommending a ban on second jobs for MPs \u2013 aside from public service roles \u2013 and introducing longer cooling-off periods and bans on lobbying by ex-ministers, civil servants and regulators. It is also calling for a cap on political party donations and the amount that politicians can be paid for speeches, as well as requiring all party parliamentary groups to disclose sources of funding. TheCityUK and UK Finance declined to comment on the report, saying the issue was a matter for individual donors. The Treasury said that as the department responsible for the financial services sector, it was \u201centirely right that ministers and officials meet regularly with representatives from the sector, as is standard with policy engagement. \u201cThere is a clear policy in place on declaration and management of interests for those working in government, with steps being taken to avoid any conflict of interest.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-06-21T09:15:32Z",
            "content": "The would-be plot to topple the Rwandan government was supposed to have been hatched on the eighth floor of a Los Angeles hotel. Representatives of a shadowy Chinese mining company had taken over the whole floor, which was bustling with activity. A metal detector had been installed and anyone going in and out had to hand over their phones. One woman was walking up and down a corridor having a loud conversation in Chinese, and a delegation apparently from a Latin American country were just leaving as the Rwandans arrived accompanied by their newly-acquired financial adviser, a tall, blond Frenchman called Frank Corto. They trusted Corto because they trusted the person who had introduced him, an American lecturer in social work called Michelle Martin, who had been a volunteer for charitable foundations helping Rwandans. They would later discover that Martin, too, was not quite as she appeared. Corto had set up the meeting in November 2013. Waiting for them inside a conference room were a dozen executives, ten men and two women. One of the women and one of the men looked Asian. The rest seemed to be white Americans. At stake, the Rwandans were told, was half a million dollars \u2013 and that was just seed money. Ultimately, the Chinese venture was prepared to bankroll an armed uprising with $50m in return for mining concessions to be granted when President Paul Kagame had been deposed and a new regime was in power. There was just one problem. The conspiracy\u2019s would-be figurehead, the leader of the opposition Rwanda National Congress (RNC), was not on board. In fact, Theogene Rudasingwa was growing increasingly angry that he had been asked to Los Angeles in the first place. \u201cThey said to me: \u2018Do you honestly think that you can remove Kagame with simply political means?\u2019 They kept pushing harder and harder,\u201d Rudasingwa recalled. In the end, he got to his feet and said: \u201cI think we cannot continue, because I didn\u2019t come here to commit to violence, because I do not believe in it and my organisation does not believe in it.\u201d The meeting ended abruptly. Rudasingwa had once been Kagame\u2019s chief of staff, a major in the Rwandan Patriotic Front army that had swept to power in 1994, ending the 100-day genocide of Tutsis by Hutu extremists. Rudasingwa had also served as Rwanda\u2019s ambassador to Washington, but had become increasingly alarmed at Kagame\u2019s drift towards autocracy. In 2004 he went into exile in the US, and in 2010 founded the RNC, intended as a broad opposition movement including Tutsis and Hutus. Before the Los Angeles meeting, Corto had advised Rudasingwa to write a wishlist for the RNC. He had put down things like office supplies, vehicle costs and projected expenses from political and diplomatic campaigning. But in the hotel conference room, the supposed backers kept pushing him in another direction. As the meeting broke up acrimoniously, Rudasingwa strode out, followed by his RNC colleague, Providence Rubingisa, and an anxious, red-faced Corto, who urged Rudasingwa not to burn his bridges with such wealthy potential donors. But Rudasingwa had become convinced that there was something phoney about the whole situation \u2013 an impression which had been growing since Corto had unexpectedly handed him $5,000 in cash in the car on the way to the meeting, and the fact that before entering the conference room he was persuaded to hand over his phone to people he had never met before. \u201cIn my mind I was saying, \u2018This is a set-up,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI was actually very annoyed when I was talking to them and said: I wish I had known that it would come to this. I wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d Rudasingwa reproached himself for having been too easily led by promises of funding, promises that in retrospect were always too good to be true. But he could not initially understand who was behind the elaborate pantomime. The chain of events led back to Michelle Martin, an academic at Dominican University in Illinois, who seemed the last person likely to be involved in any intrigue. But it later transpired that Martin was registered with the justice department in 2013 as a consultant for the Rwandan government, paid $5,000 a month for research on the diaspora. Rudasingwa and Rubingisa immediately jumped to the conclusion she must have been coopted by Rwandan intelligence. It was an impression reinforced last year when she appeared in Kigali as the star witness in the trial of another Rwandan dissident, Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu former hotel manager in Kigali whose heroics in saving the lives of Tutsis from massacre from Hutu militias were portrayed in the Hollywood film Hotel Rwanda. In 2009, Martin had befriended Providence Rubingisa, who had introduced her to Rusesabagina, and she had volunteered for the latter\u2019s charity, the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation. In over three hours of testimony in Rwanda in March last year, Martin presented emails which she had downloaded from Rubingisa\u2019s computer, to which she said he had provided access when she was helping him with charitable work. Some of the emails suggested links between Rusesabagina and former members of the Interahamwe \u2013 the Hutu militia responsible for mass killings during the 1994 genocide \u2013 and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a rebel group based in the Democratic Republic of Congo which includes many former Interahamwe members. Martin, who has a doctorate in peace studies and international development from Bradford University and a master\u2019s from Bristol University, refused to provide any comment for this article, pointing instead to her testimony, in which she said that having stumbled on links to genocidaires she felt duty-bound to provide evidence. \u201cWhat I later discovered is overt genocide denial, and a clearly orchestrated plan to take their country back by any means possible,\u201d Martin told the court. Rusesabagina was sentenced last September to 25 years in prison, having been found guilty over terrorist attacks in Rwanda which killed nine people in 2018 and 2019, allegedly carried out by the armed wing of his political party, the Rwandan Movement for Democratic Change. In a 2018 video message, Rusesabagina had expressed his \u201cunreserved support\u201d for the armed wing, the National Liberation Front (FLN), and encouraged it to \u201cuse any means possible to bring about change in Rwanda, as all political means have been tried and failed\u201d. Rusesabagina\u2019s legal team denounced the proceedings in Kigali as a show trial, saying the prosecution had not even attempted to prove the FLN was behind the attacks \u2013 or that Rusesabagina had ordered them. Independent judicial observers described the trial as deeply flawed. Rusesabagina had been kidnapped by being lured onto a plane in Dubai, which he was told was going to Burundi, but which landed instead in Kigali, where Rwandan security forces were waiting to arrest him. Much of the trial was held without his presence, after he refused to participate in the early stages. His lawyers say he was held in solitary confinement and tortured. He was also denied regular access to his legal team, who were not shown Martin\u2019s emails or any other prosecution evidence ahead of the trial. Geoffrey Robertson, an Australian-British barrister and human rights expert, wrote: \u201cIt is clear that Mr Rusesabagina\u2019s fair trial rights \u2013 in particular his right to confidential communication, his right to the presumption of innocence, and his right to prepare his defence \u2013 have been violated, potentially to the irreparable prejudice of the defence, calling into question the fairness of any potential convicting verdict.\u201d Last month, the US state department formally deemed Rusesabagina to be \u201cwrongfully detained\u201d. Martin\u2019s participation in the trial, coupled with her past paid consultancy for the Rwandan government, led to opposition allegations she was a spy for the regime in Kigali. Rudasingwa, from the RNC, became convinced that Frank Corto and the 2013 meeting with the would-be business executives in Los Angeles were all part of an elaborate trap laid for them by Kagame. However, the Guardian has seen evidence that it was instead an intricate but abortive sting operation by the FBI. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment, but Martin said at the Rusesabagina trial she had been an informant in a US investigation. An official source confirmed the cooperation with the US government began in Kigali where Martin attended a conference on reconciliation in December 2011, and decided to hand over the emails and other material she had downloaded from Rubingisa\u2019s computer to a diplomat from the US embassy. On her return to the US she was approached by the FBI and persuaded to help gather further evidence. She ceased active cooperation in 2012. Martin began her consultancy with the Rwandan government in 2013. According to a source close to her, it was for a year-long macro-level review of the available literature on the Rwandan diaspora, and never involved reporting on individuals. In all, the Los Angeles charade involved up to 20 agents playing different roles. There is a real Frank Corto, who has his own financial consultancy and lives in Pennsylvania and Florida, but he is not the tall Frenchman who posed as his namesake. The real Corto did not respond to an email, and a woman who answered his listed number said he was not interested in talking. The whole operation appears ill-conceived from the start. By Rudasingwa\u2019s account, at least, the fake investors overplayed their hand, trying to browbeat him into accepting money for armed struggle. While many members of the Rwandan exile community supported military action against Kagame\u2019s regime, Rudasingwa was not one of them. He said differences over the use of violence ultimately triggered a split in the RNC in 2016 and his subsequent formation of a splinter group. Providence Rubingisa, who stayed on in the old RNC under a former Rwandan army general Kayumba Nyamwasa, disagreed, claiming the cause of the split was the former leader\u2019s unwillingness to relinquish hold of his post. He said that some of the emails from his computer which Martin produced at the trial in Kigali were genuine, but insisted others had been fabricated. He also denied the existence of an armed wing of the RNC, saying the DRC-based rebels operating under that banner were mainly provocateurs orchestrated by Kagame. Michela Wrong, author of a book about Kagame\u2019s regime and its opponents called Do Not Disturb, said the RNC\u2019s military effort is real but ineffective. \u201cThere\u2019s very little doubt the RNC has got an armed wing, but the military side of things is doing very badly on the ground,\u201d Wrong said. \u201cMy sources say they\u2019re struggling, [and] attempts to unite with other groups active in eastern Congo have failed. It costs money to keep people in the field, and that\u2019s in short supply.\u201d Although the two Rwandan exiles have become estranged since the attempted sting operation in Los Angeles, Rubingisa largely confirmed Rudasingwa\u2019s account. Both said they had not been formally approached or cautioned by the FBI. After a more than 17-year wait, Rudasingwa was finally granted permanent resident status a few months ago. Michelle Martin is now an associate professor in the department of social work at California State University, Fullerton. Meanwhile, Rusesabagina, the erstwhile hero of Hotel Rwanda, is serving a 25-year term in a Kigali prison, in worsening health \u2013 and an increasing source of friction in US-Rwandan bilateral relations."

Greens have high-income earner tax cuts in their sights From AAP: The Greens have warned of a looming war in the Senate unless tax cuts for high-income earners are axed in the new Labor government\u2019s first budget. Leader Adam Bandt says his party will use its balance of power in the Senate to force Labor to draft a socially responsible budget, not one focused on tax cuts for the rich, and handouts to coal and gas companies that pay no tax at all. \u201cThe Greens will not support a Labor budget based on cuts that hurt everyday people while continuing the handouts to billionaires,\u201d he told the Queensland Medical Club on Friday. He later said that would not involve blocking supply but warned the Greens would demand amendments if Labor presents a budget that seeks to cut its way out of trouble, while keeping tax concessions signed off by Scott Morrison in 2018. \u201cBudgets require several pieces of legislation to get passed. We have the right to move to amend those, or to even not support some of them,\u201d Mr Bandt said. \u201cThe government is going to find it very hard to persuade us that we should be cutting public spending at the same time as they want to give billions of dollars to help fund tax cuts to people like Clive Palmer.\u201d Same-sex parents unhappy about marriage statement at Sydney school Parents at Sydney Anglican school St Catherine\u2019s are preparing for a fight after publicly rejecting a new requirement for incoming principals to sign a statement that marriage is between a man and a woman, with some same-sex parents saying the statement is deeply hurtful. Queensland is adding 13 new batteries to its electricity system to store and then release renewable energy when it\u2019s needed, the state\u2019s treasurer, Cameron Dick, has announced. State ministers and energy bosses said the batteries \u2013 one of which will be the largest ever built in Queensland \u2013 would help integrate more renewable energy into the network. The announcement would see the capacity of all the batteries across the state \u2013 that is, the amount of electricity they can release at any one time \u2013 increase from 430MW to 720MW. Alongside 12 small batteries to be placed around the state is one large battery at Greenbank, in the city of Logan, that will be able to store 400MWh of electricity. This compares to a 450MWh battery at Geelong, currently Australia\u2019s biggest. Dick said the new Queensland batteries would help the state reach its target of 50% renewable electricity by 2030. Mick de Brenni, the minister for energy, renewables and hydrogen, said there had been a consensus among state and federal energy ministers that met earlier this month that more renewables and storage was needed. He said: The Greenbank battery will be a game-changer in the way we operate the grid and will be critical for soaking up our sunshine and wind to feed into the system when Queenslanders need it. The announcement comes as the east coast emerges from an electricity crisis where regulators had to take unprecedented steps to make sure enough electricity was being provided to meet demand. The Greenbank battery will be added to the electricity assets of state-owned power company CS Energy. Andrew Bills, the CS Energy chief executive, said: Adding firm, fast-start generation assets to our portfolio will enable us to more effectively respond to changing demand in the national electricity market. Jason Lyddieth, a Brisbane-based clean energy and climate campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said adding batteries would help keep prices lower. This is a key part of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Building these storages is going to be crucial in that transition. Flag-gate continues ... Liberal MP Andrew Hastie accuses the Greens of having \u201cdisdain\u201d for Australia: The point is that the Greens do not accept the legitimacy of the Australian nation. They are ashamed of Australia. And they wish to divide us and destroy the things that hold us together. So you know exactly where I stand on this: I\u2019m proud of the Australian flag and what it represents. It\u2019s the only flag that I wore on my left shoulder in the Australian Defence Force. It\u2019s the only flag that I was prepared to fight and die for on operations. And it\u2019s the only flag that I serve as a commonwealth parliamentarian. What about everyone just gets over it and goes and enjoys the weekend? Queensland coal and gas not required to cut fugitive emissions for five years From AAP: Queensland\u2019s coal and gas miners won\u2019t have to cut any fugitive carbon emissions for another five years. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has pledged to slash carbon emissions by 30% below 2005 levels and to net zero by 2050. Methane leaking from coal mines and gas fields accounts for about 8.7% of state emissions, according to federal government data. But methane pollution could be two to 10 times higher than that, according to a report by British environmental thinktank Ember last month. The government says it will work with miners on plans to slash emissions in the Queensland Resource Industry Development plan, released on Friday. It says a new policy will lead to \u201csubstantial and consistent\u201d pollution cuts with transparent and regular reporting. But it won\u2019t come into effect until 2027, meaning miners won\u2019t have to cut any fugitive emissions for another five years. Icac asked to investigate corruption allegations made by NSW Liberal MP New South Wales\u2019 anti-corruption watchdog has been asked to examine corruption allegations \u2013 made by a state Liberal MP under parliamentary privilege \u2013 against members of the party\u2019s executive over last year\u2019s shock gutting of a Sydney council. The Castle Hill MP, Ray Williams, on Thursday claimed in the NSW parliament that senior members of the Liberal party were \u201cpaid significant funds\u201d by a prominent property developer to install new councillors on the Hills Shire council to get development applications through. New federal MPs to attend \u2018pollie school\u2019 in Canberra From AAP: The newest members of Australia\u2019s lower house will be introduced to parliamentary life during a crash course on their upcoming venture. Ahead of the opening of the 47th parliament, 35 newly elected MPs will descend on Canberra for \u201cpollie school\u201d next week, led by outgoing Speaker of the house, Andrew Wallace. Described by Wallace as \u201clike drinking from a fire hose\u201d, the newbies will spend two days learning the parliamentary aspects of their roles. This includes the expectations placed upon them, parliamentary systems and procedures and how to navigate the 75,000 sq metre office that is Parliament House. Wallace wants the 47th parliament to be a place of mutual respect and vigorous debate in a way that is reflective of Australian society. \u201cA lot of people will think that what they see on question time \u2013 the argy-bargy in that hour and a half \u2013 constitutes what happens all day, every day in the parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth.\u201d Chris Dawson trial update The judge overseeing Chris Dawson\u2019s murder trial has questioned how he should use evidence in the case which the prosecution claimed implies a violent and abusive marriage. On Friday, justice Ian Harrison said that testimony and statements in the case claimed Dawson\u2019s wife, Lynette Dawson, had been seen with bruises or black eyes, but did not actually point to who caused those injuries. Chief medical officer considers e-cigarettes next biggest health issue after Covid From AAP: Vaping laws must be enforced by all levels of government as a matter of urgency to combat an epidemic of electronic cigarette use among young people, experts say. Cancer Council Australia is calling for stronger action from the federal government following the release of updated research by the National Health and Medical Research Council. The NHMRC statement on e-cigarettes released on Thursday said the devices are not only harmful but there is limited evidence they help smokers quit the habit. Australia\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly considers the use of e-cigarettes the next-biggest health issue after COVID-19. Leading expert in tobacco control Libby Jardine told AAP more must be done to enforce existing laws and stop unlawful imports of nicotine e-cigarettes at the border. Poor enforcement of laws at all levels of government has created an \u201cepidemic of e-cigarette use among young people\u201d, the Cancer Council\u2019s tobacco issues committee chair said. \u201cThe Australian government needs to say enough is enough, public health matters,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this mounting evidence of the harms of e-cigarettes ... now is the time to act.\u201d The NSW Greens have urged the state\u2019s police minister to pull officers into line, after more climate activists were arrested today, amid growing concern about \u201cdraconian\u201d anti-protest laws. The MPs, Sue Higginson and Abigail Boyd, said climate campaigners and supporters of Blockade Australia continue to be arrested and questioned in alarming circumstances. Higginson said: The police operation that is under way throughout NSW today in response to peaceful protestors is a clear warning of how far down the road we are towards a police state. The NSW Police should immediately cease using the methods that are on display across NSW today and there needs to be a full review of the processes and procedures that have allowed these oppressive policing tactics to occur. Protest is fundamental to a democracy and plays a vital role in giving people a peaceful voice outside of law. Removing the right to peaceful protest is a dangerous and draconian step for NSW to take. Boyd, the Greens spokesperson for attorney general, said: This is yet more evidence of the chilling effect that these new anti-protest laws are having on our democratic right to protest in this state. I know the people on the coast who have been subjected to this police overreach. These are peaceful residents going about their lives, with their only apparent crime being their desire to see climate justice on our planet. That the police now feel emboldened to interrogate people on their doorsteps and pull them over on their way to work simply because of their political opinions should send a shockwave of alarm through our society. This is an assault on the basic principles of our democracy. The NSW upper house on Wednesday passed Boyd\u2019s call for papers which will see the government forced to release all internal documents regarding the creation and operation of anti-protest laws. Higginson has called for an investigation into the police operation against Blockade Australia on a Colo property on 19 June. Update on Anthony Albanese\u2019s trip to Spain and France There\u2019s been an update this afternoon about Anthony Albanese\u2019s looming trip to Spain and France. The prime minister will depart on Sunday to participate in the Nato summit in Madrid and then will go on to Paris as part of efforts to repair relations with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. While on the sortie Albanese will meet fellow progressive, the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, on the sidelines of the Nato summit \u2013 as well as the leaders of Japan, Korea and New Zealand (who have been invited to Madrid alongside Australia as part of efforts to build an Indo-Pacific focus for Nato). Albanese will also meet the president of the European Union, Ursula von der Leyen \u2013 possibly to clear the path for the resumption of discussions about a free trade agreement between Australia and the EU, as well as the prime minister of Spain, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Albanese will also give an address to the council of the OECD (Mathias Cormann runs that these days) as well as meeting French business leaders when he gets to Paris for his rapprochement with Macron. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has also invited Albanese to visit the country. The prime minister has not confirmed his plans, but hinted on the ABC on Thursday night that the offer was still being considered, saying that he was \u201cgetting national security advice on that\u201d. Albanese leaves Australia on Sunday and will be gone for a week. Since the swearing-in a month ago, Albanese has been to Japan and Indonesia as well as hosting his New Zealand counterpart in Sydney. What does the Reserve Bank\u2019s 3.5% pay rise \u2018anchor\u2019 mean for workers? After an election fought on rising costs of living and stagnant wages, the Reserve Bank of Australia has put a figure on what most people should get for a pay rise: 3.5%. With inflation tipped to reach 7% by year\u2019s end, this amounts to a real pay cut for most workers, and less than those on the minimum wage and awards were recently given. Bluey State of Origin episode tells a relatable tale of a family divided Her neighbour Chucky must decide which state to back: his dad is from Queensland, and his mum from NSW. \u201cWhenever Dad\u2019s colour is happy, Mum is sad,\u201d Chucky says. \u201cBut whenever Mum\u2019s colour is happy, Dad is sad.\u201d James Merlino thanked for his service as minister for education Just back to Vic quickly, where the Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace thanked James Merlino for his service as minister for education over the last eight years. By driving significant investment in school buildings and facilities, leading important changes and delivering additional funding for students with disability and for mental health support, and addressing excessive teacher workload, among many other things, his positive impact will be felt well into the future. He played a pivotal role in early childhood education reform, cementing Victoria\u2019s place as a national leader in the early years at a time when the issue didn\u2019t enjoy the kind of profile it does now. The union welcomes new coordinating minister for education, Natalie Hutchins to the portfolio. We look forward to working with her on behalf of the teachers, principals and education support staff across early childhood, Tafe and public schools in Victoria. Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Friday, as the country records at least 46 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 1,038 In hospital: 99 (with 1 person in ICU) NSW Deaths: 14 Cases: 9,136 In hospital: 1,455 (with 54 people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 6 Cases: 4,520 In hospital: 522 (with 7 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 4 Cases: 2,311 In hospital: 200 (with 10 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,018 In hospital: 47 (with 3 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 20 Cases: 7,723 In hospital: 412 (with 27 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 1 Cases: 4,749 In hospital: 239 (with 8 people in ICU) WorldPride 2023 bid celebration draws over 1,000 participants at Sydney Opera House AAP reports: Over 1,000 excited and boisterous participants clad in colourful T-shirts gathered at Sydney\u2019s Opera House to launch next year\u2019s WorldPride. A global festival celebrating sexual diversity held in various cities since 2000, WorldPride has chosen Sydney as its 2023 host to mark 45 years since the city held Australia\u2019s first Mardi Gras march on 24 June 24, 1978. Surrounded by flamboyant drag queens hoisting flags, feathers and fans, the launch paid tribute to sacrifices made by previous activists. Dianne Minnis, a participant in the first Mardi Gras which ended with police arresting 53 people, on Thursday remembered her generation of activists who paved the way for mainstream LGBTQI acceptance. She told the crowd: \u201cWho would have thought we\u2019d still be here 44 years later?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s remember the huge upsurge of activism that followed the first Mardi Gras,\u201d she said, referring to NSW repealing laws criminalising homosexuality in 1984. Taking place in February, Sydney WorldPride will run for three weeks with 300 events scheduled. Victorian Ambulance Union general secretary Danny Hill has released a statement thanking the outgoing Vic health minister Martin Foley: AAP reports: Former Greens leader Bob Brown says contentious anti-protest legislation on track to become law in Tasmania cuts across the rights of Australians to peacefully demonstrate and could face legal challenges. The bill, brought forward by the state Liberal government, is expected to progress through Tasmania\u2019s Legislative Council in August after passing the upper house\u2019s second reading stage on Thursday. Under the new laws, people who obstruct a business face fines of up to $8,650, double the old amount, or a maximum one-year jail sentence. Penalties could be as large as $12,975 or 18 months\u2019 jail if offenders cause a serious risk to themselves or someone else, while organisations could be fined up to $103,800. The state government has faced hurdles in recent years in attempts to strengthen anti-protest measures, changes it says are needed to protect the safety of workers and rights of businesses to function without interference. Human rights campaigners have criticised the proposals and similar laws already in place in NSW as unfairly punishing those exercising their rights to peacefully protest. Queensland drops Covid vaccine mandates for teachers, with NSW to follow Queensland has joined Victoria in removing Covid vaccine mandates for public school teachers for term three, with New South Wales on track to do the same. On Friday, Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, revealed that from next Thursday, residents of the state would no longer require Covid vaccinations to work in schools, childcare, prisons and airports or to visit jails, aged care and disability facilities. Police confirm more arrests and charges for Blockade Australia protestors NSW police have released a statement, confirming more arrests and charges for Blockade Australia protestors. NSW police: Further charges have been laid by members of Strike Force Guard as part of ongoing investigations into illegal protest activity. Earlier this morning [Friday 24 June 2022], police attended public parklands in Ebenezer near Windsor where they arrested two people in relation to an operation that took place at Colo on Sunday 19 June 2022. A 29-year-old man was arrested and charged with breach of bail. He is expected to be bail refused to appear at Penrith local court later today. A 59-year-old woman was arrested and charged with wilfully obstruct police officer in execution of duty, and intimidate police officer. It is expected she will be granted conditional bail. Today\u2019s arrests follow the arrest of a 26-year-old woman on Monday 20 June at Springwood train station. She was charged with resist or hinder police officer in the execution of duty, and breach of bail. The NSW police force established Strike Force Guard in March this year to prevent, investigate and disrupt unauthorised protests across the state. Since Sunday 19 June 2022, 10 people have been arrested and charged under Strike Force Guard. They remain before the courts. Tasmania has recorded one new Covid death and 1,018 cases. There are 47 people in hospital, and of those three are in ICU. Western Australia recorded 4,749 new cases to 6pm last night. Sadly, today\u2019s report includes the death of a man in his 80s, dating back to 17 June, which was reported to WA Health yesterday. Active cases: 28,448 Cases in hospital: 239 Cases in ICU: eight Deaths recorded yesterday: one China\u2019s ambassador asked to address Xinjiang and detained Australians Periodic interjections from protesters aside, Prof James Laurenceson put some direct questions about Xinjiang and detained Australians to China\u2019s ambassador, Xiao Qian. Laurenceson, the director of the Australia-China Relations Institute at UTS, was moderating the event. He brought up two Australians who are detained in China facing national security related allegations: I think I had to nominate one area of most intense concern amongst Australians [it] would be the circumstances that a number of individual Australians find themselves in China. This would include, Mr Ambassador, UTS alumnus, Dr Yang Hengjun, and Cheng Lei, who like me, is a University of Queensland graduate. It would also include folks in Australia\u2019s Uyghur diaspora who have been saying for several years that they cannot reach friends and family members caught up in detention facilities in Xinjiang, or they don\u2019t want to contact them because they are worried they are being surveilled. Some of them themselves may have Australian permanent residency, if not citizenship. Laurenceson noted Cheng had been \u201ccut off entirely from communicating with her family, including her two young children\u201d. He asked the ambassador if he could understand why Australians would feel it was \u201cperfectly reasonable for the Australian government, for example, to not entertain an extradition treaty with China or to warn Australians visiting China about the risk of arbitrary detention.\u201d I mean surely if a Chinese citizen was subjected to the same treatment in Australia, I imagine Beijing and the Chinese public would be up in arms. What would your message to those Australians be? Or if I could go one step further: is there any message of hope that you can give to those Australians who are worried sick right now about their loved ones? The ambassador replied that national security related cases were not necessarily heard in open court in other countries, either. For the individual case of the Australians in China, first of all, there\u2019s been very intense communication between China and Australia through the diplomatic channels \u2013 in Beijing and in Canberra. And on these cases, these are individual cases and the Chinese relevant authorities are dealing with the cases according to Chinese laws and regulations. Xiao played down the risk of arbitrary detention in China, saying there were \u201cso many people from other countries\u201d who enjoyed life in China including diplomats, media, tourists, businesspeople, and other visitors. He said as long as people respected rules and laws, there was \u201cno reason for them to worry\u201d. Regarding Xinjiang, the ambassador repeated the Chinese government\u2019s argument that \u201cterrorism is a serious challenge\u201d and \u201cnecessary measures have been taken\u201d. Xiao went on to make a general remark that he would not comment on the domestic affairs of Australia, including the recent federal election. He said: \u201cI absolutely support the territorial integrity of Australia.\u201d Even though he conceded it may not be a good example, Xiao added: Tasmania is part of Australia \u2013 no one should ever challenge that. China\u2019s ambassador, Xiao Qian, was not impressed by the protesters who periodically interrupted his speech to raise human rights. He told the event at the University of Technology Sydney: Again, freedom of speech is different from absolute freedom. In this world, there\u2019s no such thing as absolute freedom. Freedom is freedom within rules and laws. Just like we\u2019re having a meeting today, we\u2019re having a public event, and those who are attending should respect the law and order: keep quiet while we\u2019re speaking. So, those number of people who are coming again and again to disrupt the process, that\u2019s not expression of freedom of speech in my views, so this should not be welcomed. South Australia has recorded four Covid deaths and 2,311 new cases in the past 24 hours. There are 200 people in hospital and of those, 10 are in ICU. Ita Buttrose puts Chris Kenny in his place as Sky News\u2019s ABC doco draws blanks Ita Buttrose singled out Sky News presenter Chris Kenny during her Andrew Olle address last week, scolding him for saying she was too old when she was appointed to chair the ABC, aged 77, in 2019. \u201cI know a bit about career obstacles,\u201d Buttrose said as she glared at Kenny, who was on the Sky News table at the ABC function. \u201cThere was always a reason for someone to say no. I was either too young or too old. When I was appointed chair of the ABC, too old. Thank you Chris Kenny.\u201d Hello everyone, this is Cait Kelly \u2013 I will be with you for the rest of the day. Let\u2019s get into it! I will hand over now to Cait Kelly, who will take you through the afternoon. Take care and be kind to airport staff. Actions taken by China against Australian exports were not sanctions, Xiao says China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, continues to defend the trade actions taken against a range of Australian export sectors on technical grounds. He objects to labelling these as \u201ctrade sanctions\u201d. The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said last night it was good the defence ministers had met this month, but repeated his call for Beijing to remove the trade sanctions, saying that would \u201cgo a long way towards restoring improved relations\u201d. Albanese told the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program he looked forward to \u201cfurther dialogue between ministers of our respective governments\u201d, while predicting that it would remain \u201ca problematic relationship\u201d. Beijing introduced steep tariffs, unofficial bans and higher screening requirements on Australian exports such as barley, beef, wine and coal in 2020, prompting Australia to denounce \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d. Some of those measures are now subject to challenges through the World Trade Organisation. Xiao argues Chinese authorities were acting on anti-dumping concerns, after complaints from Chinese business groups. He also cites \u201creaction from the Chinese public\u201d. Some Chinese businesses had become more cautious because they were worried it might be too risky to continue the trade relations. Xiao adds: But there\u2019s no government official sanction measures, per se. People urged to get booster shot amid rise in Omicron reinfections The Australian chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, has urged people to get their booster shot in the wake of a growing number of reinfections from the Omicron variant. Kelly told Sky News: We are seeing reinfection, we know that Omicron, having had a previous dose of one of the other variants of Covid-19, did escape that immune protection from both a previous dose and from only two doses of vaccine. Sub-variants of Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 have now become the dominant strain in the UK [and are] growing particularly on the east coast of Australia. But he said there had not been an uptick in the severity of the disease. We will see reinfections over the coming weeks and months, unfortunately with that one, but what we\u2019re not seeing is a large increase in severe disease. That\u2019s really due to the vaccine protection which can be boosted with a third and fourth dose. China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has urged Australia to respect China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. (That would tend to suggest not speaking out about Hong Kong and Taiwan.) Xiao says: First on the political front, is it important to respect each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, political system and development mode. These are just some of the basic principles for sound and healthy relationships between two sovereign states. Xiao went on to urge Australia not to see China as a security threat: China\u2019s development is an opportunity, not a so-called threat to Australia. And there\u2019s every reason for China and Australia to be friends and partners, rather than adversaries, or even the so-called enemies. Xiao stresses the need to \u201cproperly handle differences\u201d. He suggests the two countries should cooperate on areas of common ground, although \u201cthere are undeniably certain areas where China and Australia have different views\u201d. He suggests constructive dialogue to minimise the differences if possible, and enlarge the common ground if possible. He says Australia and China should handle \u201cdifferences even disputes\u201d so that they don\u2019t affect overall relationship between the countries or overall cooperation between the two nations. We\u2019re on to questions now from Prof James Laurenceson. He\u2019s asking about the 2020 deterioration, including the trade actions against Australia. Laurenceson says most Australians would view the Covid inquiry call as a fair and reasonable call. Xiao says the Chinese government has publicly supported the need for scientists to determine the origin of the virus. But he says for certain countries to be calling it the \u201cChina virus\u201d or that a Chinese laboratory deliberately or accidentally leaked the virus would be \u201cabsolutely unfounded\u201d. So if that happens, I think it\u2019s fair and reasonable for 1.4 billion Chinese people to be very angry about it. On the so-called \u201clist of grievances\u201d, issued by the Chinese embassy in late 2020, before Xiao\u2019s arrival, he blames \u201ctwisted reports\u201d in the media. He says it was wrong to present them as \u201cpreconditions\u201d or \u201cdemands\u201d for dialogue. He describes Australia\u2019s ban on Chinese telco in the 5G rollout as \u201cthe first shot\u201d that damaged normal business relations. Xiao says he doesn\u2019t have his own \u201clist\u201d of demands. ACT records no Covid deaths and 1,038 new cases The Australian Capital Territory has recorded 1,038 new cases of Covid-19 and no new deaths. There are currently 99 people in hospital with Covid, one in intensive care, and none on a ventilator. Six people have died with Covid in Queensland, the state\u2019s health department has reported. Queensland also reported 4,520 new cases. There are 522 people in hospital and seven in ICU. A brief word on Victoria, factions and the nomination of deputy premier A few words on the announcement from premier Daniel Andrews a short time ago, that he and his leadership team are endorsing Jacinta Allan as his deputy. To most people this probably makes sense \u2013 she\u2019s now one of the most experienced remaining ministers following today\u2019s resignations. But for those within the Labor party, it\u2019s quite significant. Allan, like the premier, comes from the left faction. If she becomes deputy, it will break with a tradition of having a leadership team consisting of both a member from the left and right of the party. Andrews told reporters he doesn\u2019t want to get into factional \u201cgames\u201d and that Allan is the best person for the role. But given the fractured relationship between factions it\u2019s worth watching to see what happens at Saturday\u2019s meeting. China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, says relations between the two countries \u201cenjoy greater potential for cooperation\u201d. The focus of his address is the state of relations between Australia and China \u201cand my personal views on what we could do in the immediate future\u201d. After the recent federal election, Australia has a new Labor government. This is a choice for the Australian people \u2013 and it\u2019s a domestic affair of this country. Nonetheless, it has provided with an opportunity of possible improvement of our bilateral relations. Australian government ministers were blocked from meetings or calls with their direct Chinese counterparts for more than two years as the relationship deteriorated, although lower-level diplomats and public servants kept in communication. The high-level freeze finally ended when the new deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, sat down for an hour with China\u2019s defence minister, Wei Fenghe, in Singapore earlier this month. Xiao says recent face to face contacts \u2013 including the meeting in Singapore \u2013 were \u201cobviously very significant for the bilateral relationship\u201d. The more important question, Xiao says, is: \u201cHow we can keep the momentum and put our bilateral relationship back on the right track?\u201d There continue to be interjections from members of the audience at the University of Technology Sydney, including about the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong. After one audience member was removed for interjecting, Xiao was met with applause after saying: I think I should continue. He went on to say there is \u201cno reason that we cannot coexist peacefully when we respect each other\u201d. Queensland is removing Covid vaccination mandates for teachers from next week and New South Wales is considering a similar proposal. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said that from 1am next Thursday, people will no longer need to be vaccinated to work in schools, childcare, prisons and airports or to visit jails, aged care and disability facilities. Individual employers will still be able to enforce their own mandates, she said. Restrictions that have protected us have eased in sensible stages, and today I announce with the advice of the chief health officer, we are removing some of the last remaining Covid restrictions. Mandates will remain in place for workers in healthcare, hospital, aged care and disability care facilities in Queensland. In NSW, the education department will take a proposal to key stake holders to remove the vaccine mandate for all but staff who work in schools for specific purposes. Staff in those facilities will be required to keep up to date with Covid boosters. If implemented, the policy change means that 965 casual staff who are currently not working due to vaccine mandates will be able to return to onsite teaching, and teaching staff who resigned due to the vaccine mandate will be able to reapply for advertised roles. A protester has interrupted the beginning of a speech by China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, in Sydney. Xiao, who arrived in Australia in January, had only started addressing the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney when an audience member started shouting \u201cStop the genocide\u201d and \u201cTibet remains colonised\u201d. The event includes an in-person audience \u2013 but the webinar was temporarily suspended. Two minutes later, when it resumed, Xiao said: \u201cObviously it is not a good start.\u201d An audience member shouted: \u201cHow about freedom of speech in China?\u201d Xiao resumed his speech. It\u2019s my pleasure really to be here for this event, although there are different views. And I respect the invitation from the UTS and ACRI. It is upon the invitation from UTS and ACRI that I come here it exchange views with you. He said he would also listen to audience views through questions. I think it\u2019s a good opportunity \u2013 we have different views but they should be expressed in a way that is appropriate. Daniel Andrews has announced that the new leadership team will recommend that Jacinta Allan be named deputy premier. That recommendation has to be confirmed by the Labor caucus. Allan and Andrews are both from the left faction of the Labor party, which breaks with a common practice of having the leader and the deputy be from different factions. But Andrews says it is not the first time the one faction has held both roles. My recollection is that while, for instance, Rob Hulls [deputy premier under John Brumby] did a very good impersonation of someone from the left, he was not from the left. Likewise, while John Thwaites was a progressively progressive member of that government, he was not a member of the left. So, let\u2019s not get into these sorts of games. I am very confident, just as my senior leadership team colleagues are very confident, that the caucus will make the right decision. Merlino continued: Time comes for everyone, and in politics sometimes that is beyond your control. You lose preselection, you lose your seat at the election. For some lucky ones, and I consider myself to be incredibly lucky, we get to call time on a career. There is never a right time. This is hard. It is hard to leave my beloved portfolio of education and mental health. It is hard to do it. But there does come a time for everyone ... For me it is 20 years. For others, they have more energy, more ideas. I know I can go 100 miles an hour, 100%, through to November, but I know deep in my heart I could not commit to another four years. The seat of Monbulk will always be a marginal seat ... I did not want to have a by-election in the seat of Monbulk [but] I did not have four years in me to continue as a member of parliament. He directed this comment at the press pack: Thank you to the media. There are times I won\u2019t miss you and times I will miss you. But thank you for the work that you do. Merlino then stood up to give his final statement. Thanks very much Dan. It is good to be here for the last time. \u2018No premier could ever have had a better deputy\u2019 than Merlino, Andrews says Daniel Andrews gave a personal send-off to deputy premier, James Merlino \u2013 who was standing right behind him, smiling awkwardly through the praise like it was a best man speech at a wedding. Andrews said: James and I came into the parliament at the same time. James is not only a trusted colleague, but a dear friend. No premier \u2013 no premier \u2013 could ask for a better deputy than James Merlino. He is a person of courage and conviction. He is defined not just by his work \u2013 and I will come to that in a moment \u2013 but he is defined by his character, decency, his hard work, his determination to stand up to his local community, and for everybody across our community who needs a champion. In each of the portfolio areas that he has been honoured to serve in, he has brought that sense of compassion, that sense of urgency, that effectiveness to bear ... More recently, James has, of course, taken on responsibility for the implementation of Australia\u2019s first and only royal commission into mental health, acknowledging, as I do, that that system is broken, and that we need to do more and that we need to do better. James leaves the ministry and will leave the parliament knowing that just yesterday, introducing the most profound rewrite of the Mental Health Act in the history of our state, leading our nation. Work has begun on a 90% of the recommendations of the royal commission. James can be very, very proud of that work as well. That will change lives. It will save lives. On a very personal note, I will never be able to repay James for his loyalty, for his friendship, for his care and comfort to me. No premier could ever have had a better deputy, and I don\u2019t believe Victoria could have had a better acting premier than we had for an extended period last year. To not doubt for one moment that the government, the cabinet and the state was in the safest of hands allowed me and my family to deal with almost a life-changing injury. Less than one millimetre \u2013 it would have been a life-changing injury. He allowed me to focus on them and I will never be able to thank him for stepping up like he did. He is an outstanding person, a great Victorian. He has been an outstanding deputy premier and while I am saddened by his decision, I understand. And if you look at, I think, almost the last line of this statement today where he indicates that his kids \u2013 three beautiful kids \u2013 are \u201csuper excited\u201d that he was not going to be in politics anymore, I think that says it all. When it is right, it is right. Daniel Andrews is speaking now, partly to announce those new appointments and partly to send off those who are leaving. He also headed off the inevitable questions about the impact of losing so many senior ministers, saying: \u201cThere is great depth in our cabinet, there is great depth in our caucus.\u201d The changes will mean that more than half of the leadership team is made up of women. Daniel Andrews appoints coordinating ministers to fill roles of resigning cabinet members Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has appointed a series of coordinating ministers \u2013 holding positions, basically \u2013 to fill the roles of the four senior cabinet ministers who have announced their resignation. There will be a caucus meeting tomorrow to confirm new cabinet appointments. Two-thirds of Australia\u2019s aged care providers are now operating at a loss, and the sector is warning the situation will only worsen in coming months. Late Thursday, aged care accountancy firm StewartBrown released its latest data on the financial situation of the sector. It showed 64% of residential aged care providers were operating at a loss in the nine months to March. Providers had an average operating loss of $12.85 per bed each day. Those figures continue a trend of deteriorating financial sustainability in the sector since 2018. The data forecasts that losses will worsen in coming months to $15.59 per bed each day. The sector has consistently warned it is facing financial crisis. Paul Sadler, head of peak body Aged &amp; Community Care Providers Association, said: Based on these figures, many providers could be forced to leave aged care unless there is additional funding to allow providers to meet the increasing costs of providing quality care and support. It is clear that aged care workers need a significant pay rise, but without additional support, aged care providers will be unable to attract more workers and to realise improvements in the quality of care. The sector has lobbied the new government to adjust the indexation arrangements to increase subsidies to aged care providers. It also wants the new government to create an independent pricing authority, to properly assess the cost of aged care services, as recommended by the royal commission. Arrow Energy withdraws from two coal seam gas leases in Queensland Arrow Energy has formally withdrawn from two coal seam gas leases in Queensland\u2019s Scenic Rim region after a decade-long campaign by locals against its plans, AAP reports. State resources minister, Scott Stewart, says the company has withdrawn its application to renew two exploration permits near the town of Beaudesert, south of Brisbane. \u201cMy department have accepted these withdrawal applications meaning these exploration permits no longer exist,\u201d he told parliament on Friday. Arrow halted operations at the two leases a decade ago following an 18-month community blockade of its drilling sites. The company quietly applied to extend the leases in 2018, and as part of those applications had to submit a plan for commercial gas extraction by 2033. The Scenic Rim mayor, Greg Christensen, community groups, activists, and state MP Jon Krause were deeply concerned when they found out about the applications earlier this year. Stewart spoke with Christensen over Zoom two weeks ago about Arrow Energy\u2019s applications and promised not to make a final decision until they had met in person. After Arrow withdrew the applications, the minister said the matter had been responsibly handled by all parties. \u201cI would like to place on record my thanks to all those who engaged with me in a respectful manner in relation to this matter, including Arrow Energy, the mayor of Scenic Rim regional council, Greg Christensen, and the member for Scenic Rim [Jon Krause],\u201d Stewart said. Aemo to return to regular operations of national energy market today As flagged by the energy minister, the Australian Energy Market Operator will formally end the suspension of the wholesale electricity spot market at 2pm today. In a statement, Aemo said: The current energy challenge in eastern Australia is the result of several factors across the interconnected gas and electricity markets. This includes periods of high electricity demand, coupled with a large volume of generation unavailable due to maintenance or unplanned events, planned transmission outages and high energy commodity prices. Returning to regular operations of the [National Energy Market] is now possible, as we are currently seeing more normal electricity bidding and dispatching through Aemo\u2019s automated resources, along with reduced electricity shortfalls and fewer manual interventions needed by Aemo. It added that it expects \u201cconditions to remain dynamic in the short term once the suspension is lifted\u201d. Asked if he could guarantee energy security through winter, Bowen said: I can guarantee the government is fully focused on the task at hand. I can guarantee that every single action that needs to be taken will be taken as it has been over the last three weeks. Every single action has been taken. Government has been \u2018very active\u2019 in working to avoid blackouts, Bowen says Bowen said the government had worked with both the energy regulator and Aemo to keep the lights on. The government has been very active and the fact that we have managed collectively, the regulators, the operator, working cooperatively with states and territories to avoid any load shedding to avoid any blackouts is a testament to all those who work so hard over the last three weeks. No help from the people who created the situation, in the previous government. The regulator, operators, state and territory governments [are] working very cooperatively with the commonwealth [and] have managed to keep the lights on, no load shedding, no blackouts. Asked by Guardian Australia\u2019s economics correspondent, Peter Hannam, if the Australian Energy Regulator has contacted retailers to seek more information about the financial stability of those retailers, Bowen said: It would be irresponsible of me to start speculating about liquidity matters. I remain in constant contact with the regulator. The government remains very alive to the issues to be considered as the market returns. I will not start commenting on financial viability. The energy minister, Chris Bowen, has told reporters in Sydney that the Australian energy market has returned to \u201cnormal market conditions\u201d after a bumpy few weeks. We are aware of the long term challenges, the need to get more renewables and storages into the system that work will continue and in the meantime we are managing very vigilantly a short term crisis. He dismissed criticism from the Coalition \u2013 who were very recently in government and therefore very recently responsible for the conditions that resulted in an energy crisis \u2013 saying the opposition party could either decide to be taken seriously as a credible alternative government, \u201cor they can be a laughing stock\u201d. They appear to be taking the latter approach by somehow claiming that the last 10 years of denial and delay don\u2019t count and somehow claiming that the government that\u2019s been in for four weeks is somehow, you know \u2013 by talking about renewables \u2013 is somehow spooking the coal fire generators to not working. That\u2019s apparently what Sussan Ley said yesterday, all the talk of renewables spooked the market. Renewables don\u2019t spook people and they don\u2019t spook coal-fired powered generators into not working. If the Liberal party wants to be taken seriously they might start being a bit more mature about the discussion. Three men arrested after 45kg of cocaine found in jukebox shipped from Greece Two Australians and a Greek foreign national have been arrested after $20m worth of cocaine was allegedly smuggled into Australia inside a jukebox, AAP reports. The 45kg consignment from Greece was detected by Australian border force officers and tracked to a home at Sunshine North in Melbourne\u2019s west. A 39-year-old Spotswood man, a 26-year-old Reservoir man, and a 66-year-old Greek foreign national were arrested by Victoria police and Australian federal police officers on Tuesday. Police searched the Sunshine North property as well as homes in Spotswood and Reservoir and commercial premises in Toorak and Kingsville. Two Mercedes-Benz vehicles, a Harley Davidson motorbike, luxury watches, jewellery, clothing, drugs, and a significant amount of cash were seized. The Spotswood and Reservoir men were each charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug, and attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug. They faced court on Wednesday and have been remanded in custody. The Greek man was released pending further inquiries. The men are believed to be significant members of a crime syndicate, AFP Detective Inspector Mark McKiernan said. \u201cWe also know drug trafficking can lead to drug wars in our streets and in source countries, and often law-abiding citizens can be the collateral damage to that violence,\u201d McKiernan said. Blockade Australia says 25 NSW police officers attended their campsite this morning and arrested two people. We have sought confirmation from NSW police. The environmental activist group says one of the activists arrested was a 62-year-old Aboriginal woman who was staying at the campground. We\u2019ll bring you more as soon as we can. Police minister, Lisa Neville, and minister for tourism, sport and major events, Martin Pakula, have also confirmed their retirement. That is the last of the expected resignations. Neville, who has been in parliament for 20 years, said she is resigning due to health issues: she was forced to take six months\u2019 leave last year to recover from surgery for Crohn\u2019s disease. Here\u2019s part of her statement: I have only known one way to approach public life and that is to invest every ounce of energy into it. Being an MP and a Minister is a unique privilege and one that demands your total focus. My recovery in 2021 allowed me to resume work in late 2021, but I know I cannot give another four years. I wish it were otherwise, but I must be honest with myself, the wonderful people I work with and the Bellarine community. She added: While it is no longer sustainable from a health perspective for me to commit to being Minister and local member for the next term, I am not finished with public service and look forward to finding other ways to continue to contribute to public life after the election in November. Daniel Andrews, who was elected the same year as Neville, said he had \u201clong admired Lisa\u2019s openness about her battle with Crohn\u2019s disease\u201d. Lisa has always tried to make things easier for others.She\u2019s also always put her responsibility to the people of Bellarine and Victoria first. She\u2019s put her job ahead of her health for a very long time \u2013 and now it\u2019s time for Lisa to put herself first. Pakula has been in parliament for 16 years. His lower house seat of Keysborough was recently abolished as part of an electoral redistribution but he was expected to make a move to the upper house. Instead, he\u2019s leaving. Politics, he said, was \u201ca job which often demands an unhealthy measure of emotional and mental commitment\u201d. As politicians, we are notoriously bad at appreciating when considerations for our own well-being demand that we stop and find something else to do with our lives. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m not one of them. Andrews is not expected to announce his new cabinet until next month. The writs for the 2022 election have now been returned. Writs for all 151 House of Representatives elections, and for the Senate elections in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, were returned to the governor general, David Hurley. Writs for Senate elections in all states have been returned to state governors throughout the week. Tom Rogers, the commissioner of the Australian Electoral Commission, said the return of the writs marks the completion of the \u201cmost complex and challenging election in Australia\u2019s history\u201d. Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, has also confirmed he is resigning and will not be seeking re-election in November. Foley, who is also minister for ambulance services and equality, thanked nurses, doctors, paramedics, allied health professionals and scientists for their work during the pandemic. He said working with them has been the \u201cgreatest revelation\u201d of his professional life. Here\u2019s part of his statement: Today I have informed the Premier that I will not contest the seat of Albert Park at the November state election. Consequently, I will also be stepping down as a Minister in the Andrews Labor Government... The past two years have been a tough time for all Victorians. Many of us have come to reflect on what we aspire to achieve. I am no different. I am looking forward to contributing to a better, fairer, sustainable Victoria in a different capacity. One that allows me more time to focus on my family and wellbeing and different interests. Foley took over from Jenny Mikakos as health minister after her resignation in September 2020, and has served in parliament for 15 years. Daniel Andrews said: From being a senior leader in the trade union movement organising on behalf of some of the lowest-paid workers, to being Victoria\u2019s first Equality Minister, nobody has fought harder than Martin to give a voice to those who needed it most. Those who, for too long, have been powerless, unsafe, persecuted. We often say that in Victoria, equality is not negotiable. And that\u2019s in no small part thanks to the community ally Victorians have had in Martin Foley. Martin has never been afraid to face difficult issues, and make difficult decisions, when he knew it was the right thing to do \u2013 and when he knew it would help people. Andrews said without Foley, there would be no royal commission into mental health or the establishment of Victoria\u2019s first medically supervised injecting room. You can read Merlino\u2019s full statement here: We have our first confirmed resignation from Victoria\u2019s cabinet in deputy premier, James Merlino. He\u2019s issued a statement this morning: Today I advised the Premier of my decision to resign as Deputy Premier of Victoria, Minister for Education and Minister for Mental Health. I will also not contest the seat of Monbulk at the election in November. A twenty-year journey is coming to an end. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve in the Victorian Parliament and represent my community of Monbulk. I leave with feelings of deepest gratitude, a little sadness and excitement for the future. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has also issued a statement: James Merlino \u2013 Deputy Premier, Minister for Education, Minister for Mental Health and Member for Monbulk \u2013 has advised me he will not seek re-election in November this year. He will also step down from Cabinet. While our Government is often referred to as the Andrews Labor Government, nothing we\u2019ve achieved in infrastructure, in health and education, in equality, in jobs and skills, in any area \u2013 would have been possible without the hard work, determination and leadership of the best Deputy any Premier could ever wish for. Victoria has also never had a better Acting Premier. In 2021, James seamlessly took over chairing the Cabinet and leading the Government at a difficult time for our state and a tough time for me and my family. I will forever be grateful for his care and concern but moreover, his competence \u2013 allowing me to focus on recovering from very serious injuries, confident, indeed certain, that the state was in the best of hands. Andrews said he has asked Merlino to stay on in the role of campaign chair ahead of the 26 November election. Merlino is one of four senior ministers in Victoria expected to announce their resignation today. People camping outside Sydney passport office to beat queues While we\u2019re on travel-related queues, people are reportedly camping outside Sydney passport office in order to beat the queues. There were five people, with sleeping bags, already lined up at midnight, according to journalist and queuer Barbie Dutter. By 7am, Dutter reported, the queues were snaking around the block. Travellers warned to expect long airport delays as school holidays begin Travellers have been warned to again prepare for lengthy delays at Australian airports, with millions of people due to jet off for the start of school holidays. Schools in Victoria, Queensland and the Northern Territory are on holidays from tomorrow, while NSW, WA, and the ACT have one week to go. Melbourne airport is expecting 2.1 million people to pass through the airport between today and 14 July, Nine News reported. That\u2019s compared to 1.7 million people at Easter. Nathan Currie, a reporter for Channel Seven\u2019s Sunrise program, reported that queues at Melbourne\u2019s T3 were out the door at 6.18am. Sydney is also expecting to see 2.1 million people between 27 June and 17 July, compared to 1.8 million over Easter. South Australia and Tasmania will break from 9 July. New South Wales has recorded another 14 deaths of people with Covid-19. There are also 1,455 people in hospital, including 54 in intensive care. There were 9,139 positive test results recorded in the 24 hours to 4pm yesterday. Victoria has recorded another 20 deaths of people with Covid-19, with 412 people in hospital, 27 in intensive care and 11 on ventilators. There were 7,723 new cases reported yesterday, with a total of 42,037 active cases. Qantas is forecasting a loss of up to $550m this year, despite strong demand for domestic and international flights allowing it to reduce its net debt to $4bn by the end of this financial year. That\u2019s a $1.5bn improvement in the past six months. In a market update on Friday, the airline forecast it would make a significant loss this year of between $450m and $550m, with Qantas group predicting it would return to underlying profit in the next financial year. It also announced that it will give 19,000 EBA-covered employees a $5,000 payment to share the benefits of its recovery. The payments will be made once the new enterprise bargaining agreements covering them are finalised. Qantas will spend about $87m on these $5,000 staff payments. Qantas will also further cut its domestic flying schedule in response to rising fuel prices. For July and August, it will cut a further 5% of capacity on top of the 10% it already announced. The 15% reduction in capacity will last through September, with capacity cut by 10% from October to March. The airline will contact customers booked on flights that are cut. While Qantas has not announced any reductions in its international capacity today, it said the group will be flying at 83% of pre-Covid levels by the fiscal quarter beginning in July \u2013 down from 90% in the current quarter. Ahead of the July holidays, Qantas has also sought to thank customers \u201cfor their patience and understanding\u201d during what has been \u201ca challenging restart for the industry globally\u201d. Qantas has been heavily criticised for delayed baggage and poor on-time performance this year, with the Transport Workers Union claiming the airline\u2019s decision to outsource baggage handling staff is contributing to the issues. Qantas said there will be a 15% increase in ground handling staff during the July holiday compared with staffing levels during the Easter holidays. Qantas group chief executive, Alan Joyce, also announced that budget carrier Jetstar\u2019s chief executive, Gareth Evans, will step down from his role in December. PM to receive national security advice on possible Ukraine visit Some more on Anthony Albanese\u2019s potential visit to Ukraine. The prime minister told ABC 7.30 last night that he was getting national security advice on whether to accept the invitation from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, saying: We don\u2019t want a circumstance whereby there\u2019s risk to Australian personnel by undertaking such a visit, but we\u2019ll take that advice and we\u2019ll act accordingly. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has urged Albanese to give the proposal serious consideration, telling AAP on Friday: We\u2019ve formed a special bond with Ukraine. President Zelenskiy is one of the century\u2019s great heroes, and he\u2019s provided inspiration not only to his people but to the rest of the world as well. I hope that we can visit in due course and if the prime minister is able to visit, if that\u2019s the security advice he\u2019s received, that it\u2019s safe for him and for his delegation to visit, then I think it\u2019s entirely appropriate that he would. Review of John Barilaro\u2019s appointment to trade commissioner role to be made public once completed The \u201clegitimate public concerns\u201d over the appointment of the former New South Wales deputy premier John Barilaro to a highly paid trade commissioner role will be dealt with in a review to be made public, according to the customer service minister, Victor Dominello. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, announced the review yesterday. Speaking on 2GB radio on Friday morning, Dominello said: The premier has acknowledged that there are some legitimate public concerns around this and that\u2019s why he\u2019s ordered a review from [Department of Premier and Cabinet secretary] Michael Coutts-Trotter. We wait for the outcome of that review, which the premier\u2019s indicated will be made public. Asked if he thought Barilaro would make it over the the US to start the job, Dominello said: I\u2019m not going to second guess the process. I\u2019ll wait and see what the review reveals. Peter Dutton says he will seek a unity ticket with Labor in the Pacific after tensions strained Australia\u2019s relationship with Solomon Islands. The opposition leader told reporters in Canberra on Friday that he will continue to build on the relationships the Coalition established while in office. I\u2019ve met with the leaders ... to the extent that we could over the course of Covid, most of it obviously virtually. I\u2019ve been friends and met with delegations and spoken with Pacific Island leaders over my time in parliament, and I\u2019m very, very keen to continue that relationship, to build that relationship, to offer bipartisan support. Dutton emphasised the importance of the region to Australia. We\u2019re talking about family and near neighbours that we need to work even more closely with. So I\u2019d be very happy to support the government in any way. Group of senior Victorian ministers set to retire, forcing cabinet reshuffle Four senior Victorian ministers are expected to announce their retirement from politics as early as today. The big names expected to announce their departure are the deputy premier, James Merlino; health minister, Martin Foley; police minister, Lisa Neville; and minister for tourism, sport and major events, Martin Pakula. Guardian Australia\u2019s Victorian state correspondent, Benita Kovolos, attempted to contact all four ministers but they\u2019re keeping mum. It continues the changing of the guard in the Andrews government, after the former attorney general Jill Hennessy and the planning minister, Richard Wynne, announced last year that they would retire at the state election in November. Youpla funeral fund collapse leaves 31 Aboriginal families struggling to pay for burials At least 31 Aboriginal families are struggling to pay for funerals for loved ones who died since the collapse of the ACBF-Youpla funeral fund, Lorena Allam and Ben Butler report. They write: Veronica Johnson, a financial counsellor with the Broome Circle community support group, says three of her clients have been left desperately out of pocket since the Youpla collapse in March. \u201cOne of them was buried, but it was a pauper\u2019s funeral that [was] funded by the government, just a very basic funeral. And the beautiful lady who passed away, she had paid religiously [into the fund] till the day that she died,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cShe was sitting in a morgue for nearly two months until eventually the family got the pauper\u2019s funeral from the WA Department of Communities. So, obviously, [the] family had to become financially stressed to pay for it. And that\u2019s not what she signed up for.\u201d Johnson said another family is seeking to raise $2,000 by asking people to collect tin cans so that they can cash them in to pay for their mother\u2019s funeral. \u201cWe want people to see this is the level of financial human disaster that this has caused,\u201d Johnson said. You can read the full story here: New design of points-based mutual obligation system for jobseekers to be announced shortly, Burke says Burke was also asked what tweaks he is planning to make to a controversial points-based mutual obligation system for jobseekers, which was introduced by the Morrison government and which Burke said it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to change. He says the full brief arrived at his home last night and he is still reading through it, \u201cso I\u2019m very close to being able to make a decision\u201d. He says he will be working to the following three design principles: People will have to move over to the new points-based system, but those who were meeting their points requirements by making 20 job applications a month will be able to keep doing so if that works for them. Everyone will start the new system with a blank slate, even if they had accrued penalties under the current system. People will be able to undertake skills training or other courses as part of their mutual obligations, and will not have to abandon that course if they are offered a job interview. \u2022 An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that the points-based system would be \u201copt-in\u201d. Tony Burke says real wages can and should rise while inflation is high Employment minister, Tony Burke, has told Radio National that he does not accept arguments from some economists suggesting that wages cannot rise while there is high inflation. Burke was asked about comments made by Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, who said that 3.5% was a \u201cgood anchor point\u201d for wage rises, and added that: \u201cIf wage increases become common in the 4\u20135% range, then it is going to be harder to return inflation to 2.5%.\u201d He said Lowe\u2019s comments had been taken out of context, because Lowe also said he wanted to bring inflation back to between 2 and 3% \u2013 which would put wage growth, at 3.5%, ahead of inflation. Burke said 3.5% was offered not as a cap but an \u201canchor point,\u201d meaning some workers may get higher wage increases: It\u2019s not like 3.5% is there as a cap, but he is issuing a warning that we are not currently in a wage crisis spiral and we should avoid being in one. The wage price index is currently running at 2.4%. Even that anchor point would require a significant increase in wages on where people are today ... I do agree that it would be very difficult to imagine a scenario where that wage price index gets up to 4s and 5s. Burke said Australia was not currently in a wage spiral because real wages are not rising, and he criticised economists who say Australia cannot afford wage increases with inflation heading to 7%. Real wages needed to rise, he said. We were told for a decade wages could not go up because inflation was low. Now some people are saying wages can\u2019t go up because inflation is high. We were told that wages could not go up until unemployment was low. Well now unemployment is low, and we\u2019re told that wages cannot go up. Asked which workplaces might have the highest wage growth, he said it would be those with the highest union density. I expect it will be the case that there are union agreements that are higher and non-union agreements that are lower ... There are two household truths: that is if you shop around you\u2019ll spend less and if you\u2019re in a unionised workforce you\u2019ll earn more. Greens to push Labor to ditch \u2018unfair\u2019 tax cuts The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, will address the Queensland Media Club today, outlining their strategy for the balance of power in the Senate: that they will be \u201cconstructive\u201d but not a \u201crubber stamp\u201d. In excerpts of the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Bandt renews his call for a gas company windfall tax: Australia already has a windfall tax, it\u2019s called the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. The only problem is it is completely broken. Gas corporations have figured out how to game it so they will never pay tax. Gas corporations have built a pile of $282bn in tax credits between them. That means they have to work through $282bn of profits \u2013 the GDP of Finland \u2013 before they would have to pay any tax. All we have to do is make a simple change to the law preventing the use of these tax credits and we can scoop up some of the windfall these gas companies are making off us. The money raised from closing this loophole and fixing the tax more broadly would raise $59bn over the estimates, which we can use to help homes and businesses weather the crisis and get off gas. Bandt will also reiterate his call for Labor to scrap the stage three income tax cuts. He says: In balance of power in the Senate, we will push Labor to ditch these unfair tax cuts that will rip $244bn out of the public purse. Labor must rethink these tax cuts for billionaires and save our progressive taxation system before it is too late. If these tax cuts for the very wealthy proceed, we will move a step closer to US-style inequality, where the government fails to provide the basic essential services people need to survive. Labor shouldn\u2019t give Clive Palmer a tax cut while people can\u2019t afford to get their teeth fixed. The Greens would rather get dental into Medicare than give Clive Palmer a $9,000-a-year tax cut. Two-thirds of these tax cuts will go to men, just one-third to women. The wealthiest 1% will pocket as much from these tax cuts as the poorest 50% of the population combined. These tax cuts haven\u2019t come into effect yet. We can reverse them without asking everyday people to pay a single dollar more tax than they are at the moment. Good morning, Anthony Albanese has admitted the government will have to place a cap on spending when it hands down its first budget in November, saying that while it will deliver on election commitments there is a difficult fiscal repair job ahead. The prime minister told ABC\u2019s 7.30 program: We\u2019re going to have to really put the brakes on some of the spending which is there. There are a range of things we would like to do that we won\u2019t be able to do in our first budget. Albanese also confirmed he will make a stop in France during next week\u2019s trip to Europe for the Nato summit to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and is considering also travelling to Ukraine. The detour to Paris around the meeting in Madrid is a bid to repair the relationship with Macron, damaged when Australia scrapped the submarine contract with French builder Naval Group in favour of the Aukus deal and Macron called Scott Morrison a liar. He told Leigh Sales: I\u2019ve been invited by president Macron to meet with him in France. I\u2019ll be doing that in a week\u2019s time. We do need to reset. We\u2019ve already had very constructive discussions. Speaking of Macron, a study by the Australian National University has found that Morrison and Barnaby Joyce were, at the time of the May election, the most unpopular party leaders since the study began in 1987. The Australian Electoral Study is a survey of 3,500 voters. On average, voters rated Morrison a 3.6 out of 10 on a scale of popularity, while Joyce was 3 out of 10. In other news, Ukraine has been given candidate status in its campaign to become part of the European Union, a move that the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has described as a \u201cvictory\u201d. The application usually takes years, but Ukraine\u2019s has been sped up due to the Russian invasion. Although as Zelenskiy noted, the country has been knocking at the door of the EU for years. He tweeted: \u201cWe have been waiting for 120 days and 30 years.\u201d Let\u2019s crack on. You can reach me at calla.wahlquist@theguardian.com or on Twitter at @callapilla."

            "date": "2022-06-20T10:20:46Z",
            "content": "Good morning. Colombia has elected a former guerrilla fighter as president, making him the South American country\u2019s first leftist head of state. Gustavo Petro beat Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez, a gaffe-prone former mayor of Bucaramanga and business mogul, with 50.47% of the vote in a runoff election on Sunday and will take office in July amid a host of challenges, not least of which is the deepening discontent over inequality and rising costs of living. Hern\u00e1ndez had 47.27% with almost all ballots counted, according to results released by election authorities. Petro\u2019s election marks a tidal shift for Colombia and follows similar victories for the left in Peru, Chile and Honduras. \u201cToday is a party for the people,\u201d tweeted the victorious candidate on Sunday night. \u201cMay so many sufferings be cushioned in the joy that today floods the heart of the homeland.\u201d What else did he say? During his victory speech, Petro issued a call for unity and extended an olive branch to some of his harshest critics, saying all members of the opposition will be welcomed \u201cto discuss the problems of Colombia\u201d. What has the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said? He congratulated \u201cthe people of Colombia for making their voices heard in a free and fair\u201d presidential election. \u201cWe look forward to working with President-elect Petro to further strengthen the US-Colombia relationship and move our nations toward a better future,\u201d he added. Liz Cheney\u2019s condemnation of Trump\u2019s lies wins over Democrats Liz Cheney voted for Donald Trump\u2019s agenda 93% of the time during his presidency. The Wyoming congresswoman has an A rating from the National Rifle Association, and she has called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood over the group\u2019s abortion services. She also comes from a Republican political dynasty, as her father, Dick Cheney, served as vice-president under George W Bush. In short, Cheney is no Democrat. But as the Republican vice-chair of the January 6 select committee, Cheney has played a crucial role in presenting the case against Trump and his lies about the 2020 election, which culminated in the deadly attack on the Capitol, and that has won her a legion of strange bedfellow fans on the left. Even Democrats who disagree with Cheney on almost every other policy have expressed admiration for her clear-eyed condemnation of Trump\u2019s antidemocratic crusade. What has she said to her colleagues who support Trump\u2019s allies? \u201cIn our country, we don\u2019t swear an oath to an individual, or a political party,\u201d she said. \u201cI say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible: there will come a day when Donald Trump is gone but your dishonor will remain.\u201d Kyiv residents take steps towards normality Walking in a small outdoor street market in a pretty Kyiv courtyard, one could be forgiven for forgetting for a brief moment that Ukraine is in the midst of a war that not long ago included some of its bloodiest fighting a few miles from the capital. Almost four months after Moscow invaded, signs of normality have begun to return to Kyiv. Anti-tank roadblocks have been moved aside, while families stroll around the city\u2019s many parks. Terraces have started filling up, with well-dressed locals drinking Aperol spritz. Valeriy Shevchenko, the manager of a small gallery, says his art space has been slowly coming back to life. \u201cKyiv was a ghost town but the gallery is finally filling up again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are simply tired of being scared. But, of course, no one is forgetting about the war.\u201d Is it still dangerous in Kyiv? Ukraine is very much still at war and there are many dangers including unexploded munitions. But the city has not been shelled for two weeks as Russia was forced to adjust its military goals dramatically. Most people now ignore the daily air raid sirens. In other news \u2026 Republicans exuded confidence this week at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority conference in Nashville, Tennessee, eager to regain power after a punishing few years during which they were shut out of the House of Representatives, Senate and White House. France\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, is facing calls for her resignation after Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance lost its absolute majority in parliament in the legislative election at the weekend. Borne, who was appointed only a month ago, said the result posed \u201ca risk for our country\u201d. Police investigating the murder of the British journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous advocate Bruno Pereira have identified five more people connected with the killings, bringing to eight the number of suspects in a crime that has shocked Brazil. A number of Republican-led states that are moving to ban abortion are, at the same time, extending health insurance benefits to new mothers, professing to support \u201cwomen in crisis\u201d. The bills do not counteract bans that would lead to higher risks for maternal mortality, say experts. Don\u2019t miss this: Unhoused in Phoenix\u2019s perilous heat Phoenix is accustomed to a desert climate but the heat season has expanded and the number of perilously hot days and nights is rising as a result of global heating. In this sweltering heat, keeping cool is the hardest thing for the rapidly rising unsheltered population. Since 2016, heat deaths have more than doubled in Maricopa county, which includes Phoenix, with unsheltered homeless people accounting for 40% of the death toll. \u2026 or this: how Grindr finally recognized gay men who are not tops or bottoms Every month, nearly 11 million gay men around the world go on the Grindr app to look for sex. Once there, they can scroll through an endless stream of guys, from handsome to homely, bear to twink. Yet when it comes to choosing positions for sex \u2013 a crucial criterion for most gay men \u2013 the possibilities have long been simply top and bottom. The only other choice available toggles between those roles: verse (versatile). Last month, however, that finally changed. Climate check: why are the world\u2019s heatwaves getting more intense? In March, the south poles temperatures were so high that scientists at first thought there may have been some mistake. At the north pole, similarly unusual temperatures were also being recorded, astonishing for the time of year. To induce a heatwave at one pole may be regarded as a warning; heatwaves at both poles at once start to look a lot like a climate catastrophe. In May in Delhi, it hit 120F (49C). Last week in Madrid, 104F. In the US, record-breaking temperatures left multiple people dead. Last Thing: the man who unwittingly became a meme Soon after the Covid pandemic plunged Spain into confinement, Josep Maria Garc\u00eda received a panicked call from his brother-in-law. \u201cHe told me not to worry but that I should Google the phrase \u2018the worst person you know\u2019,\u201d said Garc\u00eda. \u201cI put it in and there I was, everywhere. I scrolled down and it was my face, my face, my face. I thought what is going on?\u201d As he sifted through the internet he realised he had unwittingly become a global meme.

            "title": "QC to examine NUS president election in antisemitism inquiry ",
            "date": "2022-06-01T18:56:15Z",
            "content": "The QC leading an independent investigation into alleged antisemitism within the National Union of Students has announced she will examine the election of the organisation\u2019s incoming president as well as wider concerns. Rebecca Tuck, who was appointed to head the inquiry after consultations between the NUS and the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), said an internal investigation into Shaima Dallali, the president-elect, under the NUS\u2019s code of conduct would take first priority, with her findings to be announced within weeks. Tuck said the larger inquiry would include a month-long public call for evidence starting on 6 June, with her final report to be published by the end of October. The independent inquiry was called by the NUS after a series of allegations involving antisemitism within the organisation, culminating in the Department for Education (DfE) and the Office for Students (OfS) announcing they would break formal ties with the NUS until Jewish students had confidence that the organisation could represent them. The NUS represents 7 million students at universities and colleges, with 600 student unions affiliated. The suspension affects its relations with only the government in Westminster and not those in other nations. The election earlier this year of Dallali attracted controversy because of some of her past social media statements, including a tweet that included a reference to a historical attack on Jews. Other allegations have since emerged, including those involving her election campaign, which are now expected to be investigated by Tuck. Dallali has welcomed the investigation and denied she is antisemitic, and apologised for the tweet that was posted 10 years ago. Tuck said: \u201cI intend to publish a first draft of the final report by the end of September and a final draft by the end of October 2022. This will be a thorough, open and transparent process. Regarding the internal investigation under the code of conduct, I will commence the process on 6 June 2022 and aim to conclude my investigation as a priority within the coming weeks.\u201d The NUS said it was \u201cprepared to take any and all actions that Rebecca Tuck QC\u2019s investigation may recommend\u201d. Jewish groups and civil servants have also raised concerns over the actions of James Wharton, the chair of the Office for Students, England\u2019s higher education regulator, in addressing a political conference in Hungary that attracted far-right and antisemitic speakers. Wharton also publicly endorsed the re-election of Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Hungarian prime minister. Wharton later said he had not been aware of the backgrounds of other speakers. \u201cIt goes without saying that I have no time for racist or antisemitic views of any kind,\u201d he told OfS staff in a message. However, the Public and Commercial Services Union representing OfS staff has made a formal complaint to the DfE, calling for an investigation into his behaviour. \u201cThe OfS has chosen to cease engaging with the NUS because of antisemitism, in the very same week that its chair spoke at this conference. James Wharton\u2019s behaviour undermines this strategic decision, damages the OfS\u2019s reputation and makes it harder for us to deliver our work with any credibility,\u201d the PCSU letter stated."

            "title": "Gustavo Petro: first leftist president faces tough challenge in Colombia",
            "date": "2022-06-20T14:31:09Z",
            "content": "He spent 12 years of his youth in the ranks of an urban guerrilla group, taking the alias of a revolutionary general from Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s One Hundred Years of Solitude. Later, he would serve as a progressive mayor of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\u2019s capital, and as a senator. He ran for president unsuccessfully twice, unable to overcome the conservative wall erected nearly two centuries ago around the Colombian presidency. But on Sunday, Gustavo Petro, 62, was finally able to topple that wall and was elected president, making history as the first leftwing head of state of the South American country. \u201cWe are not going to betray the electorate that has shouted at history,\u201d said Petro in a triumphant victory speech in Bogot\u00e1 on Sunday night to rapturous applause. \u201cIt is that starting today Colombia changes.\u201d Petro\u2019s journey from the ranks of the M-19 guerrilla movement to the presidential palace in Bogot\u00e1 also included an arrest for possession of weapons when he was younger. He has also said he survived torture. The M-19 demobilised in 1990, with some of its members signing Colombia\u2019s current constitution. Other members were killed including Carlos Pizarro, its presidential candidate, that year. Petro\u2019s victory over Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez, a business mogul and gaffe-prone former mayor of Bucaramanga who once referred to Hitler as a \u201cgreat German thinker\u201d, was met with partying in the streets from supporters across the country. He will take office in early August. \u201cPetro has a totally different vision because he has focused his attention on the most unprotected people in the country,\u201d said Andres Felipe Barrero, who voted for Petro, on Sunday night. \u201cAnd that includes the people who live in the marginal neighbourhoods of the big cities of Colombia, as well as black and Indigenous communities.\u201d As mayor of Bogot\u00e1 he accrued a reputation for high-handedness and a pugnacious attitude towards his critics, while also implementing a harm reduction programme for the city\u2019s homeless, as well as attempting to reform rubbish management. Petro\u2019s vice-president will be Francia M\u00e1rquez, the first black woman to hold the post. M\u00e1rquez, a single mother and human rights defender from Colombia\u2019s downtrodden Pacific region, won the prestigious Goldman environmental prize in 2018. \u201cAfter 214 years we\u2019ve achieved a government of the people, a popular government, of people with callused hands, a government of the people on their feet, of the nobodies of Colombia,\u201d M\u00e1rquez said at celebration. Despite the euphoria of Sunday night, Petro\u2019s time in office is likely to be extremely challenging. Not only does his 50.47% vote share give him a thin mandate, he is viewed with extreme suspicion by a significant part of the country, who equate him with rebel groups and leftist strongmen in the region. \u201cIn a traditional conservative rightwing country, some Colombians fear how much can change with a leftwing government,\u201d said Silvana Amaya, a senior analyst at the global risk consultancy Control Risks, ahead of the vote on Sunday. \u201cSome Colombians liken the left to Chavez and the socioeconomic misfortune in Venezuela. Others consider that a country that has lived through an internal conflict for more than 60 years led by leftist guerrilla groups should not allow such an ideology to rule Colombia.\u201d His plans to retool Colombia\u2019s economy away from fossil fuels and towards agriculture are likely to spook markets. Despite the trepidation about a Petro victory, polling day went ahead without violence or allegations of fraud, surprising some in a country that has long had a reputation for political bloodletting. \u201cToday, we celebrate Colombian democracy and their peaceful election,\u201d tweeted Brian A Nichols, the US assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs, on Sunday. \u201cWe look forward to working closely with the Petro administration to promote mutual goals for the Colombian and American people.\u201d Also high on Petro\u2019s agenda will be the country\u2019s fragile peace process with the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which was signed in 2016 and formally ended five decades of civil war that killed more than 260,000 people and displaced more than 7 million. That deal has been falteringly implemented by the outgoing government of President Iv\u00e1n Duque, who has been accused of deliberately slow-walking its rollout. Dissident Farc factions that did not demobilise and other rebel groups such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) continue to roil the countryside and profit from drug-trafficking and racketeering operations. \u201cThe candidate who promised the most, and in most detail, to implement the 2016 peace accord was elected,\u201d said Adam Isacson, the director for defence oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, a US-based thinktank. \u201cA key element of Petro\u2019s plan is to increase governance and basic services in the neglected countryside where armed groups and coca continue to thrive, and that\u2019s a core commitment of the peace accord. Much of his electoral base is in these historically conflictive areas, which voted for him overwhelmingly.\u201d Edinson Bola\u00f1os contributed reporting from Bogot\u00e1."
