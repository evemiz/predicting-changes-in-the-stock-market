We will be listening to how local people see a race that has already taken dramatic and unexpected turns. We are interested not only in how you might vote, if at all, but what you think the candidates should be talking about, whether or not they are doing so. Help us understand the issues that matter most in Saginaw and how to explain them to the rest of the US and the world. Where should we go and who should we speak to?"

            "date": "2024-08-30T14:36:39Z",
            "content": "The controversial Donald Trump biopic The Apprentice is set for a pre-election release in the US. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film which premiered at the Cannes film festival, will be released theatrically in the US on 11 October, less than a month before the election. In June, it was revealed that the 80s-set drama was purchased by Briarcliff Entertainment, a relatively small company whose previous films include the Liam Neeson thrillers Memory and The Marksman as well as Michael Moore\u2019s 2018 sequel Fahrenheit 11/9. The distributor is now reportedly planning a brief festival run before release along with an awards campaign. The film stars Sebastian Stan as Trump as he is mentored by Roy Cohn, played by Succession\u2019s Jeremy Strong, in 1980s New York City. It comes from the Danish Iranian director Ali Abbasi, whose violent serial killer thriller Holy Spider led to a backlash in his homeland with death threats aimed at lead actor Zar Amir Ebrahimi. \u201cWe have a promotional event called the US elections that we are hoping is going to help our movie,\u201d Abbasi joked in May. \u201cIf I\u2019m right, the second debate is going to be in October. So that would be a good release date for us.\u201d It was met with mixed reviews upon its premiere this May with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw criticising it as \u201cobtuse and irrelevant\u201d yet Variety\u2019s Owen Gleiberman praising it as \u201csharp and scathing\u201d. The film also made headlines for a scene where Trump rapes his wife at the time, Ivana, played by Maria Bakalova. A cease-and-desist letter was sent to the film-makers by Trump\u2019s legal team with a statement describing it as \u201cmalicious defamation\u201d. In 1990, during divorce proceedings, Ivana had accused him of sexual assault, something she later recanted. Since the 1970s, at least 26 women have accused Trump of sexual assault or harassment. He has denied all allegations. It was also reportedly criticised by its billionaire backer Dan Snyder who contributed toward the film believing it to be a positive portrayal. When asked about Trump\u2019s opinion on the film, Abbasi said at Cannes: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a movie he would dislike. I don\u2019t necessarily think he would like it, but I think he\u2019d be surprised. So I\u2019m happy to meet him, have a screening and then we can discuss it afterwards.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-09T14:10:27Z",
            "content": "Microsoft researchers said on Friday that Iran government-tied hackers tried breaking into the account of a \u201chigh-ranking official\u201d on the US presidential campaign in June, weeks after breaching the account of a county-level US official. The breaches were part of Iranian groups\u2019 increasing attempts to influence the US presidential election in November, the researchers said in a report that did not provide any further detail on the apparent official in question. The report follows recent statements by senior US intelligence officials that they had seen Iran ramp up use of clandestine social media accounts with the aim to use them to try to sow political discord in the US. The report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting US political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year. Iran\u2019s mission to the UN in New York told Reuters in a statement that its cyber capabilities were \u201cdefensive and proportionate to the threats it faces\u201d and that it had no plans to launch cyber-attacks. \u201cThe US presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere,\u201d the mission added in response to the allegations in the Microsoft report. The report said: \u201cA group run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence unit sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign\u201d and \u201canother group with assessed links to the IRGC compromised a user account with minimal access permissions at a county-level government\u201d. It said the activity appeared part of a broader push by Iranian groups to gain intelligence on US political campaigns and target US swing states. It said the county employee\u2019s account was breached in May as part of a wider \u201cpassword spray operation\u201d \u2013 one where hackers use common or leaked passwords en masse on many accounts until they can break into one. The hackers were not able to access any other accounts through that breach and the targets were notified, the report added. The report does not specify Iran\u2019s intentions besides sowing chaos in the US, though US officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes the former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump over his Democratic party rival, Kamala Harris. The researchers also said another Iranian group had been launching covert news sites that used artificial intelligence to lift content from legitimate news sites, and targeted US voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum. It named the two sites as Nio Thinker \u2013 a left-leaning site \u2013 and a conservative site called Savannah Time. When browsed on Friday, both websites had similar formats on their About Us page, and neither listed any contact detail. Nio Thinker calls itself \u201cyour go-to destination for insightful, progressive news and analysis that challenges the status quo\u201d, while Savannah Time says it is \u201ca reflection of the values that make Savannah unique\u201d and a place \u201cwhere conservative values meet local insight\u201d. The Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the US election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the US to try to raise US political tensions. Microsoft said it had continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.

            "date": "2024-08-02T13:28:32Z",
            "content": "The US has recognised Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of Venezuela\u2019s disputed election, claiming there is \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s defeat, as anti-government protesters prepared to return to the streets to demand political change. Maduro, under whose 11-year presidency Venezuela has taken an increasingly authoritarian tack and been plunged into economic chaos, has claimed victory in last Sunday\u2019s vote, despite a mounting body of evidence suggesting he lost. On Thursday night, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, rejected the incumbent\u2019s claims and recognised Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s president-elect. Blinken said tally sheets obtained by Venezuela\u2019s opposition indicated that Gonz\u00e1lez \u201creceived the most votes in this election by an insurmountable margin\u201d. The US called for \u201ca respectful, peaceful transition in accordance with Venezuelan electoral law and the wishes of the Venezuelan people\u201d. On Friday, Argentina followed the US\u2019s lead, with its foreign minister, Diana Mondino, declaring Gonz\u00e1lez \u201cthe legitimate winner and president-elect\u201d, with Uruguay and Ecuador doing the same soon after. On Thursday Brazil, Colombia and Mexico issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 urging Venezuela to release detailed voting tallies. Maduro has shown no sign of being prepared to concede defeat or relinquish power and has instead launched a major crackdown on political opponents he accuses of trying to launch a violent \u201ccounter-revolution\u201d against his rule. \u201c[We have] captured 1,200 people \u2013 and we are going after another thousand,\u201d he told supporters on Thursday from the balcony of the Miraflores presidential palace in the capital, Caracas. Speaking to the foreign media in the same building the previous day, Maduro said he wanted to see Gonz\u00e1lez and his most important backer \u2013 the opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado \u2013 jailed, calling them \u201cperverse and macabre\u201d terrorists. In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal published hours later, Machado \u2013 a conservative former lawmaker who has become a political sensation during this year\u2019s presidential campaign \u2013 said she feared for her life. \u201cI could be captured as I write these words,\u201d the 56-year-old politician wrote, vowing nevertheless to fight on. \u201cWe won\u2019t rest until we are free.\u201d Soon after, Machado called on opposition supporters to return to the streets on Saturday morning to intensify their campaign against a president widely blamed for one of the worst economic meltdowns outside a war zone in modern history. Maduro has called his own rally on the same day in an attempt to project strength. On Friday Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez said their campaign headquarters in Caracas had been ransacked by half a dozen masked assailants in a troubling sign of intensifying violence against government opponents. Blinken called Maduro\u2019s threat to arrest his two challengers \u201can undemocratic attempt to repress political participation and retain power\u201d. Andr\u00e9s Izarra, a former Maduro minister who has lived in exile since 2015 after falling out with the president, said he saw no immediate solution to Venezuela\u2019s latest political crisis, which follows a failed 2019 attempt to topple the president and months of anti-government street protests in 2017. Izarra was convinced Maduro would not voluntarily give up power. He said: \u201cThese guys have committed so many crimes \u2013 there\u2019s an investigation for crimes against humanity running against them in the international criminal court, the US is after them with bounties of $15m for drug trafficking,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know if they lose power they\u2019re going to go to jail \u2026 So for them, staying in power is a matter of life and death.\u201d If Maduro did succeed in clinging to power, he would never give it up, Izarra said. \u201cHe will be able to stay in power forever; he will become another [Papa Doc] Duvalier,\u201d the former minister said in reference to the Haitian dictator whose dynasty ruled for nearly 30 years. Observers see two major new factors favouring Venezuela\u2019s opposition in its latest attempt to remove Maduro from power. First, many of the country\u2019s impoverished barrios \u2013 once the lifeblood of the social-minded Chavismo movement Maduro inherited from his mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 have mobilised against the president, with thousands of residents joining anti-government marches from communities such as Petare and Ant\u00edmano in the capital. \u201cEveryone has come down [from the hills] because we\u2019ve been swindled. Everybody knows we have been swindled,\u201d said Rafael Cantillo, a 45-year-old dissenter from a favela called El Campito in Petare, who joined one of this week\u2019s demos. \u201cEveryone knows that we won, that we won with more than 70% of the vote.\u201d Second, the scale of the alleged fraud involved in Sunday\u2019s election has caused widespread public anger and international condemnation, even among leading members of Latin America\u2019s left traditionally supportive of Chavismo. Chile\u2019s president, Gabriel Boric, has called the official election result \u201chard to believe\u201d while Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, has said there are \u201cserious doubts\u201d over the ballot. The leftwing government of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in Brazil, which has been working behind the scenes for a peaceful political solution, has stopped short of criticising the result. But Lula \u2013 who enjoyed good relations with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez when both were in power at the start of the century \u2013 has not recognised Maduro\u2019s victory and has urged him to publish the data supporting his claim to victory. Maduro this week said he would hand the voting tallies to supreme court auditors but did not commit to their publication, something that routinely happened during previous votes. Izarra said he saw no chance Maduro\u2019s government would release the data. \u201cThey will never present the ballots \u2026 They are just saying it to gain time. They can\u2019t do it because if they do it, their crimes will be exposed,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-08-19T22:32:03Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris is in Chicago to formally accept the nomination for president of the Democratic party, less than two months after Joe Biden dropped out of the race. She will appear alongside her running mate, Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, at the party\u2019s national convention. The convention will also honor Biden\u2019s half-century career in politics as senator, vice-president and president, with Jill Biden among those paying tribute. He will give the keynote address Monday night and Harris is likely to join him on stage. Typically a party formally nominates their candidate at the convention \u2013 as the Republicans did for Donald Trump in July \u2013 however, Democrats changed the rules to put in place a virtual roll call. Harris and Walz were officially nominated earlier in August. Here\u2019s what else to know about next week\u2019s Democratic convention. Where and when is the Democratic national convention? The Democratic national convention will be held in Chicago from 19 to 22 August. Chicago previously played host to the convention in 1996, when Bill Clinton was nominated for re-election, and 1968 when Hubert Humphrey was nominated. Two venues in Chicago will host the convention: the United Center arena for evening programming, and McCormick Place convention center for daytime sessions. Who is speaking at the convention? Harris and Walz will both speak at the convention and Biden will give a speech on Monday night. The full lineup of speakers has not yet been released (Republicans only released the names of confirmed speakers the day of their July convention). However, several big names have been confirmed: Monday, 19 August: Biden will speak on the opening night, along with former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. Tuesday, 20 August: Former president Barack Obama will give an address on the second night. Wednesday, 21 August: Former president Bill Clinton will join Walz on the convention\u2019s third night. Thursday, 22 August: Harris will close out the fourth night of the convention. Who is speaking Monday night? Joe Biden will take centre stage 9.50pm CT on Monday evening. Speakers will include former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The speaking line-up also includes Chris Coons, a Delaware senator, and Raphael Warnock, a Georgia senator; Jamie Raskin, representative of Maryland, and Jasmine Crockett, representative of Texas; Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky; Shawn Fain, president of the UAW union; and \u201cwomen that have been subjected to cruel and dangerous abortion bans under Donald Trump\u201d. How can I watch the convention? The party will livestream the convention on its Democratic national convention website and on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The Guardian has a team of reporters in Chicago and will be covering the convention in depth, including live blogs each night. Major news networks are likely to carry prime-time programming. In the US, PBS will have live coverage beginning at 8pm each night. What happens at the Democratic convention? The primary functions of the convention is to formally nominate the party\u2019s candidate, adopt the party\u2019s platform, unify the party and boost enthusiasm for the ticket. The convention usually includes a roll call to formally nominate their candidate. However, the rule-making group for the Democratic National Committee established procedures for candidates to contest the primary nomination ahead of the convention. Harris was confirmed as the party\u2019s nominee after a virtual roll call vote earlier in August \u2013 the first time Democrats have used such a process. Harris and Walz will formally accept the nomination at the convention. The rest of the week will focus on the party\u2019s platform and speeches from notable figures. The party says that more than 5,000 delegates and alternates will be at the convention, with 50,000 total visitors in Chicago for the convention (which includes delegates and the media). Will there be protests? Yes. Organizers expect tens of thousands of people to protest outside the Democratic national convention to pressure the party to stop the war in Gaza. Inside the convention, uncommitted delegates plan to push anti-war demands in hopes of winning more allies to the cause and influencing the party platform. Chicago is home to the country\u2019s largest Palestinian population \u2013 with Bridgeview, Illinois, known as Little Palestine. More than 200 groups have joined together for the March on the DNC, with protests planned for the opening and closing nights of the convention. On Monday, organizers for the Coalition to March on the 2024 Democratic convention drew 172 local and national organizations together for the protest. Thousands of people gathered for the march, one of the main anti-war demonstrations this week. Protests are not unique to the Democratic convention; during the Republican convention in July, protesters led a demonstration against Trump and his party in downtown Milwaukee. What\u2019s ahead on the US election calendar? The next presidential debate is scheduled for 10 September, with both Harris and Trump confirmed. A debate between JD Vance and Walz has been confirmed for 1 October."

            "date": "2024-08-06T01:44:22Z",
            "content": "A Tunisian court has sentenced a number of potential presidential election candidates to prison and banned them from running for office, according to local media, politicians, and a lawyer, in a move critics say is aimed at excluding serious competitors to President Kais Saied in October\u2019s vote. A court decision was issued on Monday against prominent politician Abdel Latif Mekki, activist Nizar Chaari, Judge Mourad Massoudi and another candidate, Adel Dou, according to lawyer Mokthar Jmai who spoke to Reuters. All four were sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from running for office on a charge of vote buying. Another court late on Monday sentenced Abir Moussi \u2013 who is also a staunch critic of president Saied \u2013 to two years in prison, on a charge of insulting the election commission, local Mosaique radio reported. Moussi, a key opposition figure, has been jailed since October, according to Agence France-Presse. The ruling will reinforce the fears of opposition parties, candidates and human rights groups who have accused authorities of using arbitrary restrictions and intimidation in order to ensure the re-election of Saied in a vote set for 6 October. Ahmed Nafatti, the manager of Mekki\u2019s campaign, said they still planned to submit his candidacy papers on Tuesday. \u201cThe decision is unfair and unjust, and aims to exclude a serious player from the race,\u201d Nafatti said. \u201cIt is a shocking rule, it aims to keep us away from running for the race after a series of restrictions,\u201d Chaari told Reuters. Head of the Free Destourian Party and a former parliament member, Moussi had submitted her candidacy on Saturday via her lawyers, two days before her reported sentence. Moussi was sentenced under Decree 54, a law enacted by Saied in 2022 to combat \u201cfalse news\u201d. If the sentencing is upheld on appeal or later proceedings, Moussi will officially be barred from running for office as one of the candidacy criteria is that hopefuls must have a clean criminal record. Last month, a court sentenced Lotfi Mraihi, a potential presidential election candidate and fierce critic of Saied, to eight months in prison on a charge of vote buying. It also banned him from running in presidential elections. On Monday morning, Tunisian president, Kais Saied, submitted his official candidacy for the election October election. Upon registering his candidacy, Saied, 66, told reporters in the capital Tunis that his candidacy was part of \u201ca war of liberation and self-determination\u201d aiming to \u201cestablish a new republic\u201d. Elected in 2019, Saied dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree in a move the opposition described as a coup. He has said he will not hand over power to what he calls \u201cnon-patriots\u201d. Opposition parties, many of whose leaders are in prison, have accused Saied\u2019s government of exerting pressure on the judiciary to crack down on his rivals in the 2024 elections and pave the way for him to win a second term. Saied has denied placing any restrictions on rivals. \u201cThere are no restrictions on potential candidates for the presidential elections \u2026 this is nonsense and lies,\u201d Saied told reporters on Monday after submitting his official candidacy file. \u201cWhoever talks about restrictions is delusional,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not oppress anyone, and the law applies to everyone equally.\u201d Earlier on Monday, at least four other prominent potential candidates said the election commission had imposed a new restriction by demanding they submit their police record in order to register, but that the interior ministry had refused to provide those records. They accused authorities of seeking to return Tunisia to the years of dictatorship and farce elections that were the norm before the Tunisian revolution in 2011. The interior ministry was not immediately available for comment. With Reuters and Agence France-Presse"

            "date": "2024-08-25T05:00:06Z",
            "content": "Most Americans pay scant attention to foreign policy and national security issues when voting for president \u2013 or so pollsters say. Yet how Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, the two possible White House successors to Joe Biden, view the world is of considerable interest to foreign audiences, not least people in Britain who hope, for example, that Keir Starmer\u2019s government will not be faced with collapsing US support for Ukraine, a Russian victory and an existential crisis within Nato. Such destabilising, dangerous outcomes appear entirely possible should Trump, a neo-isolationist ultranationalist Republican and appeaser of dictators, secure a second term. But how does Harris, who accepted the Democratic party\u2019s nominationin Chicago last week, view the world and its many problems and challenges? If, as we hope, she prevails on 5 November, what Harris thinks and does as leader of the foremost global democracy, economy and military power will have profound, far-reaching impacts. Anyone glancing at the Democrat\u2019s CV might be forgiven for thinking this former Californian prosecutor and one-term US senator lacks requisite experience and knowledge. In barely disguised misogynistic terms, Trump is already querying her fitness to be commander-in-chief, calling her a \u201clightweight\u201d with a \u201clow IQ\u201d. Such characterisations are insulting \u2013 and plain wrong. Harris used her time in the Senate wisely. As a member of the intelligence committee, she gained expertise in the foreign policy challenges of the future such as AI, cyber-security and space. As vice-president, she led from the front at events such as the Global Summit on AI Safety and the Cop28 climate conference. In some ways, Harris is a continuity candidate, a bright apprentice who received her foreign policy schooling from the experienced Biden. Yet precisely because she still broadly adheres, for now at least, to his approach to many key global issues, a Harris presidency could yet disappoint the progressive left. This is already true of Gaza. Her public support for Palestinian self-determination last week, while welcome, lacked substance, detail or a time-frame. In contrast, her solidarity with Israel was unconditional and unflinching. Likewise, questions hang over how forcefully she will pursue the climate goals so important to younger voters. Harris regressed into too-familiar, ultra-patriotic rhetoric in her Chicago speech, insisting, somewhat chauvinistically, on America\u2019s unparalleled greatness. She vowed to ensure the US, not China, ruled the 21st century roost \u2013 an echo not only of Biden but also of Trump\u2019s confrontational zero summery. And she regurgitated easy talk about the triumph of \u201cfreedom\u201d, undefined, and the menace posed by the autocrats and tyrants so admired by Trump. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference earlier this year, long before she was catapulted into the presidential race, Harris offered a candid insight into her global outlook. The US faced fundamental questions about its engagement with the world, she said \u2013 about \u201cwhether it is in America\u2019s interest to fight for democracy or to accept the rise of dictators, to continue to work in lockstep with our allies and partners or go it alone\u201d. Her answer was clear. \u201cI believe it is in the fundamental interest of the American people for the US to fulfil our longstanding role of global leadership.\u201d That position, if sustained, will come as a relief to Britain, the EU and east European countries worried that the transatlantic alliance and dependable American backing are unravelling. It is a comfort to Ukraine, which has reason to fear Trump almost as much as it loathes Vladimir Putin. But will she back it up? And will she jettison, in time, Biden\u2019s simplistic overall narrative of a world divided between democracies and autocracies, good guys and bad guys? That offers no hope to people and countries in the middle, to reformers in Iran, for example, who want rapprochement with the west. How then might Harris make a positive difference, should she win? Michael Hirsh, a Foreign Policy columnist, observed last week that in distinct areas of future foreign policy importance, Harris was ahead of the game \u2013 thanks to her work on the Senate intelligence committee and her exposure to the classified details of Russia\u2019s 2016 US election interference. \u201cHarris represents the next generation of national security experts steeped in newer, hi-tech threats that the Cold War generation represented by Biden is less familiar with,\u201d Hirsh wrote. \u201cThese encompass an array of cyber threats, including election hacking and surveillance from abroad, allegedly including from state-run companies such as China\u2019s Huawei; threats from space, such as reported Russian or Chinese plots to disable GPS systems; and over-the-horizon risks from AI and quantum computing.\u201d These emerging threats add new dimensions to pre-existing struggles \u2013 principally the ongoing challenge to American hegemony posed by China, Russia and likeminded states. These challenges are unlikely to abate during a Harris presidency, and neither will bipartisan domestic pressure to adopt less ambitious, less costly international profiles. Among those rethinking America\u2019s post-1945 mission to \u201cmake the world safe for democracy\u201d is veteran diplomat Philip Gordon, Harris\u2019s national security adviser and a probable key figure in a Harris administration. In his 2020 book, Losing the Long Game, Gordon argued that decades of American regime change policies in the Middle East and elsewhere had been an abysmal failure. He and other top advisers are said to want a \u201cless messianic\u201d, humbler approach in future. Whether America continues to pull back internationally is the big 21st century question. Yet whatever else Harris may do in office, the world is probably safe from another Iraq-style catastrophe."

            "date": "2024-08-23T14:20:54Z",
            "content": "The independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr has filed paperwork to withdraw from presidential ballots in the state of Arizona, the Arizona secretary of state, Adrian Fontes, said. The withdrawal came as Kennedy was set to address the nation on Friday in Arizona amid reports that his presidential ambitions are coming to a close, with falling numbers both in fundraising and in the polls. A Super Pac supporting Kennedy told Reuters on Wednesday that Kennedy wanted a deal with Donald Trump in which he endorsed his Republican rival in exchange for a job in a potential Trump administration. Trump told CNN this week he would \u201ccertainly be open\u201d to Kennedy playing a role in his administration if the independent candidate dropped out of the race and endorsed him. The Kennedy and Trump campaigns are reported to have been in discussions for several weeks. \u201cIt would be so good for [me] and so good for you,\u201d Trump said in a recorded phone call to the former Democrat last month. Kennedy also reached out to the Kamala Harris campaign last week to discuss dropping out of the race and endorsing the Democratic candidate in exchange for a job in her administration, according to multiple reports. Harris did reportedly not respond. Kennedy, his vice-presidential running mate, Nicole Shanahan, and 11 of his presidential electors issued a voluntary withdrawal, Arizona\u2019s Fontes said in a post on X. Kennedy, 70, the son of the late Democratic politician and US attorney general Robert F Kennedy and nephew of the late president John F Kennedy, started his presidential campaign as a Democrat, challenging Joe Biden for the nomination. Kennedy is reported to be facing pushback from his wife, the Curb Your Enthusiasm star Cheryl Hines, over rumored plans to throw his support behind Trump. According to the Hill, Kennedy\u2019s negotiations with the Trump campaign to forge an alliance are not popular with Hines. A source told the publication that Hines \u201creally does not want him\u201d to back the former president. \u201cHe\u2019s contending with that.\u201d It is not clear that Kennedy supporters would necessary follow the independent candidate to the Trump ticket. Kennedy\u2019s polling has roughly halved \u2013 down to about 5% \u2013 since Biden dropped out and Harris took up the mantle of presidential hopeful. According to the Hill, Kennedy and Hines agree to disagree on some of the candidate\u2019s conspiracy-minded positions, including those around vaccine skepticism, which Trump sometimes appears to share. When Kennedy compared vaccine mandates to the Nazi Holocaust \u2013 a comment he later walked back \u2013 Hines posted on X: \u201cMy husband\u2019s opinions are not a reflection of my own. While we love each other, we differ on many current issues.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-08T00:34:17Z",
            "content": "Perched atop Port Vila, Vanuatu\u2019s seaside capital, sits a gleaming red and white building, gifted to the Pacific country by China last month. The new presidential palace has a coveted position in town, high on a hill and overlooking the prime minister\u2019s office, a building which was similarly renovated thanks to a hefty Chinese donation almost a decade ago. The multimillion dollar complex is the latest in a long line of gifts and infrastructure projects offered to Vanuatu by Beijing, transforming several towns and villages in the small island nation of just over 300,000 people. They include a suite of new government ministry buildings, the country\u2019s parliament house, road construction projects on several islands, the rebuilding of a sports stadium, a new wharf, and the donation of a massive convention centre that often sits empty in the middle of town. Vanuatu\u2019s financial minister, John Salong, whose new Chinese-built ministerial building was handed over to his government with the palace last month, says the projects have been a boon for the developing country, which often struggles to pay for building works itself. The Lowy Institute estimates the presidential palace and new government buildings cost $20m. \u201cWe use diplomacy as a means for us to leverage the resources we have so that we can build institutions that we need,\u201d Salong says. These large constructions have become visible monuments to China\u2019s deepening influence in the region, not only as a development partner but also as an emerging political player. Major Chinese-funded works have taken place in almost every Pacific Island country, coinciding with an expansion of China\u2019s security and policing deals in the region and the strengthening of diplomatic ties between Beijing and Pacific governments. Days after Vanuatu\u2019s prime minister, Charlot Salwai, attended the opening of the new presidential palace, he flew to China with a delegation of officials to meet with president Xi Jinping. In a joint statement released after the talks, China said it welcomed Vanuatu\u2019s \u201cactive participation\u201d in its belt and road initiative, Beijing\u2019s multi-billion dollar project to connect the world through a series of infrastructure builds. \u201cChina has provided assistance to Vanuatu with no political strings attached,\u201d China\u2019s ambassador to Vanuatu, Li Minggang, said in an address broadcast by Chinese state media shortly after the handover of the new palace. The Chinese embassy in Vanuatu did not respond to a request for comment. Yet, some Pacific Islanders have voiced criticism over the proliferation of Chinese-backed infrastructure projects in their countries. Jean Pascal Wahe, a community leader from the island of Tanna in Vanuatu, says though a Chinese-funded road network has given his people critical access to markets, health services and the local airport, he is also concerned about the more than decade-long presence of the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) on his island. CCECC is wholly owned by the Chinese government. Wahe says the CCECC \u201chas now won every other sub-contract for roadworks that weren\u2019t even part of the original road project.\u201d China\u2019s aid expenditure in the Pacific is dwarfed by other countries, estimated to make up only 9% of total development spending in the region according to the Lowy Institute\u2019s Aid Map. In contrast, the aid expenditure by Australia, who remains the region\u2019s biggest spender by a significant margin, makes up 40% of total Pacific development income \u2013 equivalent to around $15bn as of 2021. But Beijing\u2019s investment in prominent infrastructure builds, often unveiled to Pacific governments through lavish ceremonies, has skewed public opinion over the size of China\u2019s contributions. \u201cAustralia gives four times as much aid in the Pacific,\u201d says Graeme Smith, a senior fellow from the Australian National University who has investigated Chinese aid and infrastructure development throughout the Pacific. \u201cBut the perception in the Pacific, when you do these attitude surveys, people think that China is the main donor, because you have these physical symbols of their gifts.\u201d \u2018Scared about these loans\u2019 Of further concern is the heavy economic burden some of China\u2019s infrastructure projects have placed on developing Pacific countries. China is the region\u2019s largest lender, and though many of the Pacific\u2019s government buildings have been donated as gifts, the majority of its infrastructure builds are made possible by sizeable loans from its Exim Bank. \u201cI\u2019m scared about these loans and have doubts about how we\u2019ll pay it back,\u201d says Wahe, who knows the government has taken on a major loan from China to finance the works on his island. \u201cThe project is good, but I keep reminding our leaders that in this world, there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d Tonga has this year begun the difficult process of paying back its giant $119m loan to China, while there are concerns Vanuatu will face debt distress as it struggles to repay China for its extensive road and other infrastructure projects. \u201cIt may be that our debt sustainability will go from moderate to high debt distress,\u201d Salong says. \u201cWe have to check ourselves and make sure that it\u2019s not just infrastructure for the sake of infrastructure, it\u2019s infrastructure that\u2019s going to be helping expand the economic base so that we can continue to manage the country.\u201d As Chinese investment continues to change the landscape in many Pacific countries, other development partners are also ramping up assistance in the region. A couple of weeks after Vanuatu\u2019s Chinese-built palace was unveiled, the US opened its embassy in Port Vila. The US recently announced $10m in additional funding to the region through its Pacific Islands Infrastructure Initiative. Salong says such assistance is welcome, but his government will ultimately decide what projects will be approved. \u201cWe make our own decisions, and we know we decide our own priorities,\u201d he says."

            "date": "2024-08-19T19:42:37Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump shared several AI-generated images of Taylor Swift and her fans vowing their support for his presidential campaign on Sunday, reposting them with the caption \u201cI accept!\u201d on his Truth Social platform. The deepfakes are part of a slew of images made with artificial intelligence that the former president has disseminated in recent days straddling the line between parody and outright election disinformation. The AI-made images Trump shared over the weekend depict a series of young, smiling women in \u201cSwifties for Trump\u201d T-shirts, as well as one that shows Swift dressed as Uncle Sam encouraging people to vote for the Republican presidential nominee. Each image is a screenshot from X, formerly known as Twitter, and was originally posted by rightwing accounts with a history of sharing misinformation. Swift has not endorsed Trump. Trump\u2019s posts come days after he also shared an AI-generated image that depicted Kamala Harris holding a communist military rally at the Democratic national convention, as well as a deepfake video of him dancing with the X owner, Elon Musk, who has endorsed him. Trump\u2019s embrace of AI-generated imagery threatens to further cloud an already murky information ecosystem around the 2024 presidential election. The former president routinely promotes falsehoods and conspiracy theories. Concern over AI-generated content influencing elections has persisted throughout the recent boom in generative artificial intelligence, with researchers warning for years that the technology has the potential to make it easier to create disinformation campaigns and flood online platforms with low-grade content. AI-generated misinformation has circulated around elections all over the world, as video and images are used to troll opponents, fake endorsements and create deepfake audio intended to damage candidates. While Trump shared AI-generated images in the past week, he also falsely claimed that a genuine image of one of Harris\u2019s campaign rallies was the result of artificial intelligence and that the well-documented event never took place. His claim reflected a concept which disinformation researchers call the \u201cliar\u2019s dividend\u201d, in which an increase in manipulated content leads to general skepticism of all media and makes it easier for people such as politicians to dismiss authentic images, audio or video as fake. Although most AI image generators from industry mainstays such as OpenAI or Microsoft have put guardrails on what they can create, banning images of public figures and declining prompts for political imagery, some users have found workarounds for some AI models or turned to others that lack such safety measures. Musk\u2019s Grok image generator, which debuted last week, is able to create a range of images based on prompts that similar tools will reject and has led to a recent spike in AI content around the election. These include images of political leaders, celebrities and copyrighted works, as well as sexualized and violent content. Almost immediately after Musk released Grok\u2019s AI image generator, deepfake images of Trump and Harris proliferated on X. Many news outlets also reported that the tool could create images of Swift, which was notable given that earlier this year AI companies faced intense backlash after sexualized deepfakes of the pop star circulated widely on social media. Swift has not endorsed a candidate for president, but in 2020 harshly criticized Trump for \u201cstoking the fires of white supremacy\u201d and vowed to vote him out of office. Other Republican groups have also dabbled in sharing AI-generated imagery this election season, including Ron DeSantis\u2019s campaign during his failed bid for the GOP nomination. The Florida governor\u2019s campaign shared a fake image of Trump hugging Anthony Fauci, who is a frequent target for conservative attacks. The Republican National Committee also sparked controversy last year when it released a partially AI-generated attack ad against Joe Biden, depicting a hellscape following his hypothetical election win."

            "date": "2024-08-15T13:28:53Z",
            "content": "Sixth-formers in England are enjoying a bumper crop of top A-level results, surpassing previous pre-pandemic highs in the proportion of A* and A grades awarded, thanks in part to strong performances in maths and sciences. In maths, which had more than 100,000 A-level candidates nationally for the first time, 42% of 18-year-olds in England got A* or As, while a third of entrants got the highest grades in physics and chemistry. The rise in top grades meant one in every 11 entries received an A*, with a record 4,135 students celebrating three or more A*s \u2013 an increase of nearly 50% compared with 2019, when 2,785 received straight A*s. Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, said the increase had been achieved under a return to \u201cnormal\u201d grading, benchmarked on last year\u2019s results. Ian Bauckham, Ofqual\u2019s chief regulator, said: \u201cThere is no grade inflation this year. Standards have been maintained from 2023 and any change is largely due to the ability of the cohort.\u201d But there was a different picture in Wales and Northern Ireland, where the proportions of top grades awarded fell compared with last year after a return to pre-pandemic grade boundaries, although results in Northern Ireland remained better than those in England. In England, 9.3% of entries gained A* grades, while 27.6% got A and A*s. Other than in 2020, 2021 and 2022, when awards were distorted by Covid, this year\u2019s results are higher than any year since the A* grade was introduced in 2010. In Northern Ireland 30.3% of entrants got A or A*, down by seven percentage points compared with 2023, while in Wales the proportion fell from 34% to 27.6%. But both remained higher than the equivalent in 2019. Scotland has a different qualifications system and most students received their results last week. In 2020 and 2021, no A-level exams were held in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, with results instead assessed by teachers, leading to a spike in improved results. When in-person exams returned in 2022, the authorities took account of the disruption by more generous grade boundaries. England\u2019s increase in top grades this year was tempered by regional and social inequalities in how they were distributed, and by the lower proportion of pupils getting grades C or above compared with most pre-pandemic years. There was a slight widening in the gap in attainment between England\u2019s regions. London had the highest proportion of A* and A grades, at nearly 32%, compared with the lowest, the East Midlands, with 22.5%. At private schools \u2013 fees for which are soon to be subjected to 20% VAT \u2013 49.4% of entries were awarded A or A* grades, up from 45% in 2019. Grades at state grammar schools in England also soared, with A and A*s rising from 37% in 2019 to 41% this year. Meanwhile, academies in England increased their top grades to 26.5% of entries, while England\u2019s remaining comprehensives increased to 22%. Pepe Di\u2019Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThe staff in our schools and colleges also deserve great credit for all they have done to support these young people in their courses and exams. \u201cWhile the dark days of the pandemic are in the past, its legacy continues to haunt us, as many of these students experienced severe disruption to their education. In particular, this impacted upon young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, whose families were also adversely affected by the subsequent cost of living crisis.\u201d Universities reported that more applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds were being accepted on undergraduate courses this autumn. The Ucas admissions service said that 27,600 18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged backgrounds had accepted a place. Vivienne Stern, the chief executive of Universities UK, said: \u201cIt is heartening to see that a record number of disadvantaged students have gained a place at a university or college this year. We know that a degree has particularly strong benefits for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and this will boost earnings and career prospects throughout their lifetimes. \u201cUniversities are on hand to support anyone who has not received the grades they were hoping for, or any prospective student who needs advice. There are still a wide variety of courses available through clearing this year at a range of universities.\u201d Alongside A-levels, more than 250,000 vocational and technical qualifications were awarded, with more than 22,000 top grades awarded in England, according to Ofqual. More than 7,000 students also completed T-level courses in England, with nearly 89% gaining a pass or better. T-levels were launched in 2020 as a two-year vocational equivalent to A-levels, with courses including early years education and digital production, but so far interest from students remains subdued. Figures from the Department for Education showed that only 71% of the 10,000 who enrolled had completed their courses this year. Only 14 students \u2013 0.2% of those who completed a course \u2013 gained starred distinctions, the highest T-level grade, while 15.7% received a distinction."

            "title": "The Latin American left is smart not to pick a side over Venezuela\u2019s contested election result | Jordana Timerman",
            "date": "2024-08-05T09:00:08Z",
            "content": "When Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was declared the winner of the Venezuelan presidential election last week, there was an immediate outcry and accusations of fraud. Maduro had trailed significantly in many polls, and the National Electoral Council (CNE) didn\u2019t provide access to voting breakdowns as it is legally required to do. While much of the rhetoric from Maduro and opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia\u2019s supporters has been heated, left-leaning governments in the region haven\u2019t come down on either side \u2013 despite many longstanding connections with Maduro\u2019s administration. This marked shift within the remnants of the \u201cpink tide\u201d of leftist governments that dominated Latin American countries in the 00s may provide a way through the crisis, and achieve a democratic transition in Venezuela. The governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have led many other nations in demanding electoral authorities release voting tallies for each electronic voting machine, but they have abstained from accusing Maduro of wrongdoing \u2013 they have not used the term \u201cfraud\u201d or denounced the Venezuelan regime\u2019s unacceptable post-election human rights violations. They are apparently hoping to get Venezuela\u2019s government and opposition parties back to the negotiating table. This is perhaps the most high-profile example of the mediating role Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, seeks on the world stage, and a demonstration of what his \u201cactive nonalignment\u201d diplomacy looks like in practice. If Lula\u2019s strategy \u2013 taken on by the larger bloc \u2013 works, it will be a resounding affirmation of his much-misunderstood \u201cthird way\u201d diplomatic strategy, which seeks to further the economic concerns of developing countries without picking a side in the great powers conflict in the current global cold war 2.0. It will also be a moral compass in a region where democracy is threatened by backsliding driven by elected leaders. The strategy could serve as an important electoral bulwark against the rise of extreme-right movements that threaten Latin American democracy. This studiedly unhostile approach to Venezuela\u2019s crisis represents an alternative to the dominant approach of the past: with Latin American countries denouncing whichever side was ideologically convenient and the US bluntly deploying economic sanctions. While the Biden administration has strongly supported negotiation efforts in Venezuala, Washington unilaterally recognised the opposition candidate Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the election on Thursday. This kind of posturing has done little, and unreserved support from western states has often provided cover for governments to make authoritarian moves. Additionally, in a multipolar world where Venezuela can rely on the support of Russia and China \u2013 both of which have already congratulated Maduro on his re-election \u2013 it risks pulling the region into larger international conflicts. Leftists in the region have traditionally maintained a soft spot for Cuba, and have, for years, refrained from fully denouncing democratic backsliding in Venezuela. This tolerance reflects a cold war-influenced bilateral tradition in the region that has always tried, wrongly, to differentiate between leftwing and rightwing authoritarianism, allowing that violations committed in the name of an ideology could somehow be justified in the face of the larger battle between the two sides. The stance must be understood against the backdrop of cynical US intervention in Latin America that long supported violent military dictatorships. Statements this week by Lula, Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico\u2019s president-elect, Claudia Sheinbaum, Chile\u2019s president, Gabriel Boric, former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet and former Argentinian president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner are the most visible sign of a deep shift in the Latin American left, away from these ideological commitments. To have even former fellow travellers, such as Lula and Kirchner, push back against Maduro\u2019s election fraud lays bare the increasing gap between Latin America\u2019s leftist democracies and \u201cleftist\u201d dictatorships. The old leaders\u2019 new stance partially responds to generational turnover. Today\u2019s young voters were raised in the pink tide period and didn\u2019t live through the social devastation wreaked by Washington consensus neoliberal economic policies. In Chile, Colombia and Brazil, they have elected leaders whose platforms focused on climate crisis, social justice and reproductive health. The leftist leaders\u2019 statements also hint at a manifesto for Latin America\u2019s new left, with democracy and social justice as cornerstones, framed as historical continuity. Indeed, Petro and Kirchner invoked the legacy of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in calling for Maduro to publish detailed election results. They also emphasised the deleterious effect of US sanctions on Venezuelan democracy. The decades-long US embargo on Cuba is detested by the region\u2019s left, and the reference marks a ratification of their historical anti-imperialist stance. The region\u2019s rightwing leaders have rightly highlighted the crimes against humanity committed by Maduro. But few expressed the same concern for human rights abuses committed by ideological allies, such as the massacre of protesters under the interim government of Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez in Bolivia in 2019, or the electoral fraud that Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez leveraged into a second presidential term in Honduras in 2017. Argentina\u2019s president, Javier Milei, has called Maduro a \u201ccommunist dictator\u201d, but has cozied up to El Salvador, apparently unconcerned by the systematic human rights violations that form the backbone of President Nayib Bukele\u2019s controversial security policies. Thus, their outrage will carry little weight in this crisis. Leftist leaders\u2019 new stance represents a moral line that is consistent with the ideology they profess; how they respond to increasing government repression will be a test of this shift. In any case, the goal of bringing about a true accounting of the election results cannot be accomplished without engaging Maduro\u2019s government.

            "date": "2024-08-15T13:15:57Z",
            "content": "When Yasser Imlahi Iallouchen arrived to collect his BTec results on Thursday morning, he said he was so nervous he could barely breathe. \u201cI felt like I was going to cry, vomit, collapse. I was just so worried and scared because it\u2019s something that will affect my future,\u201d he said. Imlahi Iallouchen needed to achieve DDD in his BTec in biomedical science \u2013 which is the equivalent of three A grades at A-level \u2013 to get into Queen Mary University of London, where he hoped to study. \u201cI was scared, shaking. I didn\u2019t know what to do \u2026 but once I opened it and I saw what I was expecting, I was happy. I felt a huge sense of relief.\u201d In September, he will begin his course in marketing and management with one year in industry. Imlahi Iallouchen was one of more than 1,200 students at Luton sixth form college (LSC) collecting their A-level and BTec results, and one of thousands across the country celebrating top grades. At LSC, the oldest in the country, about 60% of the students do a combination of A-levels and BTecs. Mohammad Danyaal Asif, 18, could barely speak, he was so stunned at his triple A* grades in maths, chemistry and physics A-levels. \u201cI\u2019m just so shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than what I needed.\u201d He is now following in his older brother\u2019s footsteps and heading to the University of Hertfordshire, where he will study aerospace engineering. His mother, Adeeba Asif, said she was \u201cunbelievably proud\u201d of her son. \u201cHe deserves it because he really worked hard for two years, really hard. Even in his GCSEs he worked hard. We supported him throughout the time and it all paid off for him. He wants to be a pilot one day and we just couldn\u2019t be prouder.\u201d While many at the college were elated with their results, others were a little disappointed. Lina Bounab missed out on her initial offer at Queen Mary to study law and politics after achieving A*, A, C. She needed to get three As. \u201cWhen I logged on to UCAS, I had an unconditional offer [from Queen Mary], but with substantial changes. It made me think: what could it be? \u201cI felt a bit disappointed, I can\u2019t lie, but now I\u2019ve had time to think and I think this is a good pathway moving forward, so I am definitely happy,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery student that has got results today, be proud of yourself,\u201d she added. \u201cI am.\u201d Despite figures showing many young people achieved top A-level grades and vocational qualifications this year, the attainment gap between the least and most disadvantaged 18-year-olds in England has widened, as has the gap in regional entry rates. Luton sixth form college\u2019s principal and chief executive, Altaf Hussain, said he hoped the Labour government would reconsider its decision to defund BTecs, which he said would impact social mobility. \u201cNot everybody is geared to do A-levels, and many of our students mix and match, and they go on to university. So last year, we were in the top 15% of adding value for HE [higher education] progression. So that means BTecs and A-levels work and I\u2019m really disappointed that we still can\u2019t have three options, T-levels, A-levels, BTecs, so you give people a genuine choice based on their own particular needs and skills,\u201d he said. \u201cI think T-levels have an absolute good place in the economy, but they could have easily fitted alongside highly successful BTecs.\u201d The college will not know for sure what is going to happen with BTecs until December, but it will still welcome students for the new academic year in September. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a difficult information and advice guidance process for young people who want clarity in terms of decision-making,\u201d Hussain said. Asked how he was going to celebrate tonight, Imlahi Iallouchen said: \u201cSleep!\u201d His first priority was to tell his parents the good news, and then \u201cgoing home and sleeping. I haven\u2019t slept yet!\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-25T05:30:00Z",
            "content": "The young people who took their GCSEs this summer were in their first year of secondary school when the pandemic hit in 2020. For many, their results last Thursday were cause for celebration and a credit to their resilience during and after what was the most tumultuous time for the English education system in over 70 years. But dig beneath the positive headlines, and it becomes apparent that this set of grades demonstrates the growing socioeconomic attainment gap between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their more affluent peers, with pernicious consequences for their lifetime opportunities, and for society more widely. The regional gap in GCSE results has only got starker: this year, 28.5% of GCSE entries in London were awarded a grade 7, compared with 17.8% in the north-east and 18.3% in the East Midlands and Yorkshire. This is in large part accounted for by the socioeconomic attainment gap. The same can be said for the increasing gap in top GCSE grades between selective and independent schools on the one hand, and non-selective state schools on the other. Analysis by the Education Policy Institute shows that the socioeconomic attainment gap was already widening again in 2019, but Covid school closures accelerated this trend. By the end of key stage 4, 16-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2013 defined as being eligible for free school meals at any point in the previous six years \u2013 were 19.2 months behind their more advantaged peers in 2023, up from 18.1 months in 2019. This is underpinned by much higher absence rates for children from poorer backgrounds and with additional learning needs compared with other children in the wake of the pandemic. The gap is a product of both the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on poorer children, and the impact of 14 years of cuts to public services on children with additional needs. Rates of child poverty have risen in recent years; school funding remains 4% lower in real terms than it was in 2010, with schools serving the least affluent populations hardest hit; and funding for support for special educational needs has not kept pace with the rising numbers of children who qualify for it. Conservative ministers failed to invest adequately in the catch-up tuition, after-school enrichment and mental health services during and after the pandemic needed to minimise its impact on children from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is Labour\u2019s inheritance. There should be no greater priority for a Labour government than addressing the widening socioeconomic gap in education outcomes. But its embrace of fiscal conservatism is impeding its ability to do anything about it. Its commitment to free breakfast clubs is welcome, but they are unlikely to have more than a marginal impact. A more generous pay settlement will help address the recruitment crisis in teaching. But reducing educational inequalities requires far more ambition and resources: directly addressing child poverty through increasing financial support for low-income parents; reinstating Sure Start services for the early years and attracting highly qualified graduates into nursery education in poor areas; significantly boosting school funding in less advantaged areas through the pupil premium; and expanding the availability of mental health and other services for children with additional needs. Not investing in these things is a false economy that will not only hamper the lives of those young people who leave the education system without basic qualifications, but will scupper the long-term economic growth that ministers have promised to deliver. It would be a tragedy if this Labour government does not see that."

            "content": "Kamala Harris\u2019s entry into the presidential race has given a shot in the arm to Democratic voters, who are now expressing near-record enthusiasm levels, fresh polling data shows. While the figures from Gallup indicate rising enthusiasm among all voters \u2013 including Republicans \u2013 over the past five months, comparative figures show a much steeper increase among Democrats \u2013 indicating that Harris\u2019s replacement of Joe Biden as presidential candidate is the likely driving factor. The surging enthusiasm coincides with an improved general polling performance from Harris compared with Biden, who dropped out of the race last month after a poor debate performance that threatened to further depress his already stagnant numbers in survey match-ups against Donald Trump. A fresh Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed Harris leading Trump nationwide by 45% to 41% \u2013 a margin consistent with other surveys since last week\u2019s boisterous Democratic national convention in Chicago that confirmed the US vice-president\u2019s status as the nominee. Harris\u2019s figures since then have generally enhanced the small leads that she had accrued since her elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket in July, suggesting that her standing has been further boosted by the traditional post-convention bounce that presidential candidates customarily receive. The effect of Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s decision to suspend his independent presidential campaign and endorse Trump this week is unclear, since the Reuters/Ipsos and other recent surveys were still being conducted at the time of his announcement on 23 August. The Trump campaign claims the endorsement will boost the former president\u2019s chances, even though Kennedy\u2019s once-buoyant poll numbers had declined to about 5% before he pulled out. But it is the state of play in certain key battleground states that will decide the outcome of the 5 November election and here, too, Harris is showing a marked improvement over Biden before he left the race. A Fox News poll on Thursday showed the vice-president with narrow leads in three out of four southern Sun belt states; 48 to 47% in Arizona, and 48 to 46% in both Georgia and Nevada. In the fourth, North Carolina \u2013 which Trump won by just 1.4% in 2020 \u2013 the Republican nominee was ahead by a single point, 48 to 47%. The poll represented a big jump on recent numbers recorded by Biden, who trailed Trump by six points in Georgia in April and by five points in Nevada and Arizona as late as June. It also triggered an angry reaction from Trump\u2019s campaign, which lambasted the figures in a statement reflecting the stakes. \u201cIt\u2019s that time of year again. Fox is releasing atrocious polling,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cPresident Trump continues to outperform polling from past cycles.\u201d The statement claimed Trump\u2019s current support level was higher in Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina than at the equivalent point in the 2020 election, which he ultimately lost to Biden. Varying polls show the candidates neck and neck in three other crucial swing states, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, sometimes misleadingly called the Rust belt. In these knife-edge contests, Harris will hope to be helped by the newfound enthusiasm for her candidacy among the Democratic base, which according to the Gallup survey, outstrips that felt by Republican voters for Trump and may be an extra spur to voters to go to the polls. About 78% of Democratic voters told Gallup\u2019s pollsters that they felt enthusiastic about voting with Harris heading the party ticket, a dramatic leap from the 55% who said the same last March when Biden was the candidate, at a time when misgivings about his age were already commonplace. GOP voter enthusiasm for Trump in the same period has shown a more modest rise, from 59 to 64%. \u201cDemocrats and Democratic-leaning independents are largely driving the surge in enthusiasm nationally,\u201d Gallup\u2019s Jeffrey M Jones wrote in a commentary explaining the new figures. Democrats\u2019 current enthusiasm levels, Jones went on, are just one point short of Gallup\u2019s 21st-century high for the group, which was 79% in February 2008 when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were joined in a battle for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. High motivation does not necessarily mean Harris will win, however, since Trump\u2019s followers, too, are enthusiastic. What it may guarantee is a high turnout. \u201cAs a result of elevated election thought and enthusiasm in both parties, voter participation could surpass what it was in 2020, when two-thirds of eligible US adults cast ballots, the highest in over 100 years,\u201d Jones concluded."

            "date": "2024-08-06T15:06:02Z",
            "content": "As Kamala Harris named Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, as her running mate, recent polls showed the vice-president moving ahead of Donald Trump in the race for the White House. Among recent national head-to-head polls, SurveyUSA put Harris up three points ahead of Trump, 48%-45%; Morning Consult put her up four points, 48%-44%; YouGov and CBS News made it a one-point Harris lead, 50%-49%; and University of Massachusetts Amherst put Harris up three, 46%-43%. Those results were mostly within the margin of error. But Tatishe Nteta, provost professor of political science at UMass Amherst and director of its poll, pointed to a key finding: a seven-point swing to the Democrat since January, when Trump led Joe Biden by four. \u201cFor weeks after the first presidential debate in June,\u201d Nteta said, \u201cDemocratic donors, prominent Democratic elected officials and members of the news media made the case that President Joe Biden faced long odds to defeat former President Donald Trump and called for Biden to step down. \u201cIn the aftermath of Biden\u2019s historic decision to forgo his re-election campaign, it seems as if Biden\u2019s critics were indeed correct as his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, has emerged as the frontrunner in the race for the White House. \u201cWhile there are still three months to go, the Harris campaign and the Democratic party must like their chances to maintain control of the White House and to send former President Trump to his second consecutive defeat in his quest to return to Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201d There was also good news for Harris from the Hill, as the site\u2019s \u201cultimate hub for polls, predictions and election results\u201d showed the Democrat with a positive favourability rating for the first time, after a steep climb since mid-July, when Biden stepped down. As to be expected, August polls in the seven battleground states where the election is expected to be decided presented a more mixed picture. In polls concluding in August, Public Policy Polling, a Democratic firm, found Harris up one in Georgia but down two on Trump in Arizona and down one in Pennsylvania. Trafalgar/Insider Advantage, a right-leaning operation, put Trump up two in Georgia. According to battleground averages maintained by the polling site FiveThirtyEight, Trump led Harris by two points in Arizona and one in Georgia, with Harris up by two points Michigan, one in Pennsylvania and one and a half in Wisconsin. North Carolina polls collected by FiveThirtyEight but not averaged showed Trump up but with a shrinking lead, down from nine points in mid-July to two points in early August. There was also good news for Harris in a solidly Democratic state, New York, where Trump showed signs of progress while Biden led the blue ticket. With Harris in place, Siena College found her up 14 points, 53%-39%. On Monday, Nate Silver, founder of FiveThirtyEight and an influential voice among polling analysts, said Harris \u201cnow has a real lead in national polls \u2013 about two points \u2013 and has also been ahead in most recent polls of\u201d Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Concerns about economic conditions should not be counted out, Silver said, on a day of Wall Street sell-offs and reports of recession fears. \u201cBut the momentum in the polls outweighs it for now.\u201d This article was amended on 6 August 2024 to clarify the FiveThirtyEight poll findings in Georgia."

            "content": "Kamala Harris continues to gain strength in the US presidential election, as polls nationally and in battleground states show her building leads or catching Donald Trump. On Friday morning, FiveThirtyEight, a leading polling analysis site, puts Harris, the Democratic party\u2019s candidate for president, up by 2.1 points over her Republican rival in its national average. In averages for swing states, where control of the White House rests, Harris led in Michigan by two points, Pennsylvania by 1.1 point and Wisconsin by 1.8 points. Trump led in Arizona by less than half a point and in Georgia by half a point. In battleground states without enough polls to calculate averages, Trump was ahead by about three points in North Carolina and the candidates were about level in Nevada. In the latter state, recent CBS and Bloomberg polls have given Harris two-point leads while on Friday the Nevada Independent reported a poll showing the Democrat six points up. The US vice-president, 59, has changed the election race since mid-July, when Joe Biden, 81, finally heeded calls from his own party to step aside for a younger candidate to take on Trump, who is 78. He endorsed Harris to take over the top of the Democratic ticket for this November, while he serves out his single term. On Thursday night, Amy Walter, of the non-partisan Cook Political Report, told PBS that before Harris entered the race, Biden \u201cwas behind by a significant number, not just at the national popular vote, but in those \u2026 battleground states. You can see almost six points in a state like Georgia and Nevada. \u201cNow, just in the time that Harris has been in the race, you have seen those numbers move pretty significantly toward Harris, four- or five-point shifts in those battleground states, which is mirroring what we\u2019re seeing in the national poll as well. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t turned those states, though, from ones that favored Trump to ones that now favor Harris. It just means now that the race is no longer as lopsided in Trump\u2019s favor as it was, say, in late July \u2026 which is why we\u2019re calling this race a toss-up.\u201d The same day, the Cook Political Report changed its ratings for three Sun belt swing states \u2013 Arizona, Georgia and Nevada \u2013 from \u201cleans Republican\u201d to \u201ctoss-up\u201d. Another analysis site, Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, based at the University of Virginia, changed Georgia from leans Republican to toss-up. Looking north, the site changed Minnesota and New Hampshire, states where Trump made gains while Biden was top of the Democratic ticket, from leans Democratic to likely Democratic. Harris\u2019s choice for vice-president, Tim Walz, is governor of Minnesota. Any Walz effect on polling has not yet been felt but some observers expressed surprise that Harris passed over Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, a battleground state. Others argued back. For Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, Joel K Goldstein said that though Shapiro and Mark Kelly, the Arizona senator who was also closely considered, were \u201cboth from competitive states that were \u2026 important pieces of the 306 electoral votes Democrats won in 2020\u201d, in choosing Walz, \u201cHarris demonstrated yet again that vice-presidential selection turns on matters other than the over-hyped criterion of home-state advantage. \u201cWalz also had the most experience (17 and a half years) in traditional vice-presidential feeder positions (senator, governor, member of the House of Representatives, holder of high federal executive office) of her options, which contrasts with the very limited experience (one and a half years) of his Republican counterpart, Ohio senator JD Vance.\u201d Among widely noted individual polls, Harris led for a second week in the Economist/YouGov survey, maintaining a two-point advantage. Reuters/Ipsos found Harris up five points, 42%-37%, up two on the last such survey, taken just after Biden withdrew. Ipsos said it also found in a separate poll Harris leading Trump 42%-40% in the seven battleground states, though it \u201cdid not break out results for individual states\u201d. A national poll from Marquette University in Wisconsin showed Harris up six points, with 53% support among likely voters to 47% for Trump. Harris maintained that lead when other candidates were included. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the leading independent, took 6% support. In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, Kennedy\u2019s support had fallen six points to 4% since July. The Marquette poll contained further good news for Harris, pointing to her energizing effect as the campaign heads for the home stretch: an 11-point rise in respondents saying they were very enthusiastic about voting in November. \u201cEnthusiasm has increased substantially among Democrats, with a small increase among Republicans,\u201d the Marquette pollster Charles Franklin wrote. \u201cRepublicans had a consistent enthusiasm advantage over Democrats in previous polls, but this has been mostly erased now.\u201d It was not all good news for Harris and Democrats. In a poll released on Thursday, CNBC put Trump up two points and firmly ahead on who voters thought would make them financially better off. Micah Roberts of Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican pollster who worked on the survey with a Democratic counterpart, said the election was \u201cless now a referendum on Trump than it is a head-to-head competition between the two candidates\u201d. Harris, Roberts said, was \u201cstill carrying a lot of water for the [Biden] administration. She has to answer for that and define herself independently \u2026 That\u2019s a lot of baggage to carry when you\u2019ve got a compressed time frame against a mature campaign on Trump\u2019s side.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-20T06:00:13Z",
            "content": "In a volatile region, few areas are more hostile than the flatlands surrounding the South Sudanese town of Abiemnom. Four miles north-east of it lies the border of the oil-rich Abyei region, where spasms of violence have left scores dead this year. Slightly further on is the border with Sudan, which is engulfed in civil war. From there, the notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are moving steadily closer. To the east are the armed \u201ccriminals\u201d of Warrap state, responsible for a series of murderous raids on Abiemnom this year. South and west offer little respite; there lie the militias of Unity state, recently accused of slaughtering civilians. This corner of the world\u2019s newest nation serves as a microcosm of the maelstrom of ethnic rivalries and historical enmities threatening to tear South Sudan apart. Tasked with keeping a lid on Abiemnom\u2019s tensions are 72 UN peacekeeping troops in a modest outpost that opened in May on the outskirts of town. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous here,\u201d confirms Capt Enkhtuya Ariunbold, 27, peering through the barbed wire topping the base\u2019s perimeter. Ariunbold hails from the world\u2019s coldest capital, Mongolia\u2019s Ulaanbaatar, where temperatures can reach -40C (-40F). Here, it was 35C early in the morning. Sweat drips from his nose. He gestures towards a rickety bridge, the boundary of Warrap state. \u201cThe criminals come over in armed rigs, shooting at residents, taking their cattle. We\u2019ve not been shot at \u2013 so far.\u201d But a new threat is now emerging, one Ariunbold appreciates could bring trouble from every conceivable direction. South Sudan is preparing to stage its first election as an independent country. What should have been a unifying coming-of-age moment for the embryonic state is fast becoming a source of mounting anxiety. The vote was conceived as the finale to a peace agreement signed five years ago to pull the nation from a civil war that left at least 400,000 dead. All the signs, however, suggest the country\u2019s preparation for such a complex, logistical undertaking are nowhere near sufficient. Senior UN officials warn that any election interpreted as unfair, corrupt or simply incompetent risks pushing one of the world\u2019s poorest states back into nationwide conflict. Nicholas Haysom, the head of the UN mission in South Sudan (Unmiss), cuts an anxious figure in his frugal quarters in the capital, Juba. Haysom has 14,000 peacekeeping troops stationed across South Sudan in an attempt to prevent a slip into another calamitous civil war, but recently requested another battalion \u2013 an extra 1,000 soldiers. He says South Sudan \u2013 which acquired independence in 2011 \u2013 is facing an \u201cexistential\u201d crisis. A chronic food crisis, the pressures of hosting 700,000 refugees from Sudan and a decline in aid for a country where three-quarters of people require humanitarian assistance are all testing the state\u2019s viability. The rupture of a crucial oil pipeline in Sudan might be the final straw. Oil is the glue that holds South Sudan together, with its export accounting for nearly 90% of government revenue. The economy is in freefall. \u201cI want to underscore that the prospect of a second war in this region of the kind we\u2019re witnessing in Sudan would be absolutely catastrophic,\u201d Haysom says. He is not alone in worrying that against such a tumultuous backdrop, South Sudan is not ready to hold its first post-independence election. Originally set for December \u2013 no date has been finalised \u2013 the first warnings that preparations were behind schedule were sounded in April. There has been scant tangible progress since then. Last week Haysom told the UN security council that the country had not prepared sufficiently for elections in December. Earlier he told the Guardian that the uncertainty over the vote was sowing unease across South Sudan. \u201cAcademic literature shows that elections are one of the most likely triggers for relapse into conflict in society,\u201d he says. \u201cThis country is in a state of some anxiety. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what electoral system there\u2019ll be or whether there\u2019ll be voter registration [or] what the complaints machinery will be.\u201d No one still knows what form the elections will take. \u201cThere\u2019s very little progress in completing a vision of what the elections would look like,\u201d Haysom told the UN. The uncertainty is deterring donors who want assurances that their funding will support a fair and transparent process. It is an ambiguity that, according to Haysom\u2019s most senior military commander, is generating significant stress among the population. Lt Gen Mohan Subramanian, the Unmiss force commander, described his troops as operating in an \u201celection-related politically charged atmosphere\u201d and that a country awash with 320,000 weapons had entered a \u201ccritical period for its peace and tranquility\u201d. Studying a map of South Sudan liberally marked with hotspots and potential flashpoints, Subramanian said: \u201cThe worst-case scenario, hypothetically, is a relapse to countrywide violence. \u201cMore realistically it is a relapse into far more widespread concurrent waves of violence in multiple states.\u201d UN troops are based at 27 locations. A strategic UN review suggested 36 were needed. But Haysom says the South Sudanese are desperate for the democratic process to begin. \u201cAll the polls or surveys have shown that the South Sudanese want elections, even though they suspect it may come with some violence,\u201d he says. Back in Abiemnom, Ariunbold is finishing the morning patrol. From one of the town\u2019s biggest buildings emerges the county commissioner, Matiop Dau Deng. Quick to berate the Mongolian over the state of the town\u2019s only road, Deng\u2019s mood soon brightens. \u201cWe are very grateful you are here, the situation is much calmer. But you must know that here, things can change very quickly.\u201d"

            "content": "The 2024 election season is well under way. The campaign was marked by a consequential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, followed by weeks of pressure on Biden following his debate performance, culminating in his announcement that he would drop out of the race. As Biden reconsidered his re-election, there was an attempted assassination against Trump, followed by the naming of the Ohio senator JD Vance as the Republican vice-presidential pick. After Biden\u2019s surprise announcement, he backed his vice-president, Kamala Harris, as his choice to replace him on the party\u2019s ticket. Harris quickly secured enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic pick. She tapped the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate, and both were confirmed as their party\u2019s nominees at the Democratic convention in August. Also in August, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the independent candidate with no shortage of wild stories, suspended his campaign and threw his support behind Trump. Here is the full list of candidates as of 27 August, including some long-shots who hope to challenge the major party candidates in November. The remaining candidates Donald Trump Former president of the United States. Running mate: JD Vance Donald Trump accepted the Republican party\u2019s nomination for president for the third consecutive time. At the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, the former president formally accepted the nomination on a night that was supposed to be filled with calls for unity but instead was marked by alarmist language and false claims. Trump announced Vance \u2013 once a vocal \u201cnever Trumper\u201d \u2013 as his pick for the nomination for vice-president at the Republican convention. Kamala Harris Vice-president of the United States. Running-mate: Tim Walz Harris officially accepted the Democratic party\u2019s presidential nomination at the Democratic convention in August in Chicago, after a whirlwind tour of battleground states alongside her running mate, Walz. Harris\u2019s campaign came after weeks of pressure following Biden\u2019s disastrous June debate, and after Biden announced he would not accept his party\u2019s nomination and endorsed her to replace him on the Democratic ticket. Immediately following Biden\u2019s decision, Harris confirmed her intention to \u201cearn and win this nomination\u201d as a flood of Democrats endorsed her campaign, heading off a competitive race for the Democratic ticket. Harris made her first official campaign stop in Delaware on 22 July and has crisscrosed the country, stopping in swing state after swing state, since. Jill Stein Doctor and activist. Running mate: Butch Ware Leftwing environmentalist Jill Stein formally launched her third presidential bid in an online conversation in November 2023. Stein also stood as the Green party\u2019s candidate in the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. Her candidacy follows the decision by Cornel West, the party\u2019s original likely nominee, to leave the Green party and run as an independent. Cornel West Professor and progressive activist. Running mate: Melina Abdullah The progressive activist Cornel West announced in a video posted to Twitter that he was running for president as a member of the People\u2019s party, a third party headed by a former campaign staffer for Bernie Sanders. West is currently a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary and previously worked at Harvard but resigned, saying the school had an \u201cintellectual and spiritual bankruptcy of deep depths\u201d. Dropped out Joe Biden President of the United States, dropped out 21 July 2024 Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election, winning all the party\u2019s primary contests. However, following a disastrous debate performance in June against Trump, and weeks of pressure, Biden announced on 21 July that he would not accept the party\u2019s nomination. Biden endorsed Kamala Harris to replace him at the top of the Democratic ticket. Biden served in politics for more than five decades, culminating in his 2020 victory over Donald Trump. Ryan Binkley Businessman and pastor, dropped out 27 February 2024 Binkley, a Texas businessman, was a long-shot candidate who is also a pastor at Create church. The self-proclaimed far-right fiscal conservative criticized both Democrats and Republicans for not being able to balance the federal budget, and said he would focus on health costs, immigration reform and a national volunteer movement. Doug Burgum Governor of North Dakota, dropped out 4 December 2023 Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, announced his campaign in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal on 6 June 2023. Viewed as a surprise, long-shot candidate, he touted his experience as a career businessman and leaned on his small-town roots in an announcement video titled Change. As governor, Burgum signed into law a near-total abortion ban, which makes the procedure illegal after six weeks, and only permissible in cases of rape, incest or medical emergency up to that point. He supported Donald Trump for president in 2016 and in 2020. Chris Christie Former governor of New Jersey, dropped out 10 January 2024 The former New Jersey governor has emerged as one of the harshest Republican critics of Donald Trump, whom he endorsed for president in 2016 after dropping out of that race. Christie says he broke ties with the former president after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, claiming that he hadn\u2019t spoken to Trump since then. Christie, a lawyer and a lobbyist who served as a US attorney appointed by George W Bush, announced he was running for president a second time on 6 June 2023 in New Hampshire during a town hall. Ron DeSantis Governor of Florida, dropped out 21 January 2024 Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida was predicted to be the strongest contender for the GOP nomination against Donald Trump, consistently polling second among Republican primary voters. He made his formal announcement on Twitter, during a Spaces event attended by roughly 300,000 users that was riddled with technological glitches, on 24 May 2023. DeSantis, who has served as Florida\u2019s governor since 2019 and handily defeated the Democratic challenger, Charlie Crist, in 2022, previously represented Florida\u2019s sixth congressional district as a member of the US House from 2012 to 2018. As governor, DeSantis has signed a slate of laws banning minors from receiving gender-affirming care and restricting education on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, and he has become an outspoken critic of the Chinese Communist party. Larry Elder Conservative radio host, dropped out 26 October 2023 The rightwing political commentator and radio talkshow host announced his run for president on Fox News as a guest on the now-canceled Tucker Carlson Tonight on 20 April 2023. In 2021, Elder joined a list of Republicans seeking to replace Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, in a failed recall. The Los Angeles resident was an outspoken critic of the state\u2019s mask mandates, calling them \u201ca joke\u201d. Nikki Haley Former ambassador to the United Nations, dropped out 6 March 2024 Haley, who got her start in politics as a member of South Carolina\u2019s general assembly, was governor of the state from 2011 to 2017. She ended her second term early to serve as US ambassador to the United Nations under Donald Trump before announcing her resignation in 2018. She became the first Republican to announce a run against Donald Trump, even though she previously said she would not run against him. Haley vowed to \u201cfix\u201d the US immigration system by \u201cstopping illegal immigration\u201d and described herself as pro-life, but said a federal abortion ban was unrealistic. Haley, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants, would have been the first US president of Asian descent, as well as the first woman. Will Hurd Former congressman from Texas, dropped out 10 October 2023 Former US Representative Will Hurd, of Texas, entered the crowded primary field as a moderate and critic of Donald Trump. Hurd announced his campaign in an interview on CBS. He followed that with a video posted online in which he called Trump a \u201clawless, selfish, failed politician\u201d and laid out an agenda to curb \u201cillegal immigration\u201d, inflation, crime and homelessness. Hurd, who worked for nearly a decade in the CIA, served three terms in the House, from 2015 to 2021. He left office as the only Black Republican in the chamber. Asa Hutchinson Former governor of Arkansas, dropped out 16 January 2024 Hutchinson is the former governor of Arkansas, a post he held from 2015 to 2023. The relatively unknown politician announced his candidacy in an interview on ABC days after Trump was indicted in a Manhattan court, saying the ex-president should drop out of the race. Hutchinson is a businessman and lawyer who was appointed by Ronald Reagan to serve as a US attorney. He also served a stint in the US House of Representatives, winning a congressional seat in 1996 when he replaced his brother, Tim, who ran for Senate. Perry Johnson Businessman, dropped out 20 October 2023 Johnson is a businessman who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michigan in 2022 after providing fraudulent nominating signatures for that campaign. Originally from Illinois, Johnson founded dozens of companies, and lives in Michigan with his family. He has billed himself as Donald Trump \u201cwithout the baggage\u201d and has taken similar policy positions on curbing US debt and cracking down on the FBI. Robert F Kennedy Jr Lawyer and author, dropped out 23 August 2024 Robert F Kennedy Jr, known for his work as an environmental lawyer and his anti-vaccine views, said he was running for president to end the \u201cchronic disease epidemic\u201d. Kennedy, who compared vaccine mandates during the Covid-19 pandemic to \u201cHitler\u2019s Germany\u201d, has promoted other baseless conspiracy theories such as telecom networks being used to control people. He is the nephew of John F Kennedy, the former Democratic president, who was assassinated in office, and is the son of 1968 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy, who was assassinated on the campaign trail. He suspended his campaign on 23 August and endorsed Trump. Mike Pence Former vice-president of the United States, dropped out 28 October 2023 Mike Pence officially launched his campaign for president on 7 June 2023, in a rare instance of a former vice-president challenging the president with whom he shared a ticket a few years ago. Pence joined a crowded Republican field in which he has consistently polled third, even before he officially announced his candidacy, though he trails far behind DeSantis and Trump. Pence was angling for a wide base among evangelical Christians and had vowed to ban abortion if he were elected. He denounced the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, and had used it as a talking point against Trump, who turned against him after he publicly refused supporters\u2019 calls to overturn the results of the election. Dean Phillips Representative from Minnesota, dropped out 6 March 2024 Dean Phillips, a three-term Democratic congressman from Minnesota, challenged Biden, saying the next generation should have the opportunity to lead the country. Phillips is the heir to a distilling company and once co-owned a gelato company. He entered public office spurred by fighting back against Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy Entrepreneur and author, dropped out 16 January 2024 The biotech entrepreneur and political newcomer announced his campaign in a video describing attacks on the \u201cculture of free speech in America\u201d and again on Fox News in an interview with now-fired Tucker Carlson. He is the author of Woke, Inc, a book that lobbies against \u201cESG\u201d \u2013 a framework of corporate governance that encourages companies to consider the environment and social justice issues. Ramaswamy, who was the youngest candidate vying for the Republican nomination, had lobbied in favor of raising the national voting age to 25. Ramaswamy would have been the first president of Asian and Indian descent. He had also vowed to pardon federally indicted Donald Trump. Francis Suarez Mayor of Miami, dropped out 29 August 2023 Suarez, the mayor of Miami, was the first major Hispanic candidate seeking the Republican party nomination this election cycle. The son of Miami\u2019s first Cuban-born mayor, Suarez had said he would broaden support for Republicans among Latino voters. He was the third candidate from Florida to join the crowded primary field, alongside frontrunners Trump and DeSantis. Suarez, who was first elected in 2017, filed paperwork to run the day after Trump appeared in a Miami court over federal charges and made his formal announcement on Good Morning America the day after that. Tim Scott Senator from South Carolina, dropped out 13 November 2023 In May, Scott became the second politician from South Carolina to run for the Republican nomination. He has served as a senator from South Carolina since 2013, when he was appointed by Republican challenger Nikki Haley to fill a vacancy. Scott, who is one of three Black members of the Senate and is the only Black Republican senator, said in his announcement speech that \u201cAmerica is not a racist country\u201d. Scott joined fellow Republicans in opposing the Respect for Marriage Act in 2022. Scott served as a member of the House from 2011 to 2013 and before that spent stints in South Carolina\u2019s general assembly and Charleston\u2019s county council. During his 2010 campaign for the House of Representatives, Scott told Newsweek that homosexuality was a morally wrong choice. Marianne Williamson Author Failed 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, who also unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the US House of Representatives in 2014, became the first Democratic candidate to announce she is running for president as a challenge to Joe Biden. Williamson, an author of self-help books, launched her long-shot bid with campaign promises to address climate change and student loan debt. She previously worked as \u201cspiritual leader\u201d of a Michigan Unity church. She originally ended her campaign on 7 February 2024 but announced on 28 February she was \u201cun-suspending\u201d."

            "content": "On a recent Sunday, instructions in Arabic and English filled the air on a quiet street in New Hope, Minnesota. Every weekend, a group of Sudanese American professionals and students come to the half-acre space nestled near a distribution warehouse about 20 minutes north of Minneapolis. Their goal: to farm, and to do it together. For the Sudanese Farming Group (SFG), every decision on this small plot of land is a collective one, every crop carefully tended. And each week brings new conversations, discoveries and people. Co-founders Khalid Elhassan and Haytham Ibrahim are both engineers and were inspired by a series of news broadcasts describing minority residents\u2019 farming initiatives in the Twin Cities. Established in 2022, the SFG connects Minnesota\u2019s small Sudanese community, close to 3,500 people statewide, to a shared history of cultivation. \u201cIn 20 years here, I had never seen [Black farmers in Minnesota],\u201d said Elhassan. He had come to the US from the African nation 25 years ago for work. His family hails from Nuri, located on the west side of the Nile River and known for its ancient pyramids. As a farming community, it\u2019s the birthplace of Elhassan\u2019s interest in agriculture. After hearing the media report, he eagerly reached out to local minority, immigrant, and Black farming leaders in the area. For Minnesota\u2019s immigrant and minority communities, the idea of agricultural reclamation \u2013 a return to communal labor and ancestral practices \u2013 was a unifying one. For the SFG, reclamation signaled an opportunity to reconnect with land, compatriots, and cultivation in an adopted homeland. Despite the different histories of Black Americans and African immigrants, the idea of agricultural reclamation \u2013 a return to communal labor and ancestral practices \u2013 was a unifying one. For the SFG, reclamation signaled an opportunity to reconnect with land, compatriots and cultivation in an adopted homeland. \u201cMost of us here are only one or two generations removed from farmers in Sudan,\u201d explained Elhassan. \u201cWe aren\u2019t just emerging farmers. We are returning farmers.\u201d That is the case for Gamal Dirdeeri, a physician and SFG member. \u201cI\u2019ve missed being outside. My dad was a farmer, and I used to go with him almost every day for three, four months a year. I\u2019ve missed just feeling at home. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt at home, like my village in Sudan [Gedaref, a sesame- and cotton-farming hub near the Ethiopian border], other than the moments here at the farm.\u201d Sudan, which lies at the intersection between sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, has been embroiled in civil wars and unrest for much of the last 20 years. Yet it was once considered a garden basket of the region, with agriculture accounting for 60% of its exports. But production has been largely interrupted since war broke out in April 2023. Now, an estimated 10 million people have been displaced by conflict, and about 45 million face food insecurity and famine. While some of the farming group\u2019s 60-odd members fled recent violence \u2013 and came to Minnesota due to its large African community \u2013 their path to the state is not a single one. Some of the members, those whose parents or grandparents came to the US, use the SFG to connect to a Sudanese identity that felt unfamiliar. \u201cOur youth \u2013 from kindergartners to teens \u2013 attend, play around and help us. They get something out of being here,\u201d said Ibrahim. Farming and cultivation efforts built around reclamation are on the rise among Minnesota immigrant communities. The SFG is part of a slew of African immigrant farms that have been established in Minnesota in recent years. Kenyan immigrants Moses and Lonah Momanyi lead the Kilimo incubator farm. There\u2019s even a Somali American farmers\u2019 association, reflecting the state\u2019s large Horn of Africa community. The 2023 establishment of the Emerging Farmers Office (EFO) within the state department of agriculture acknowledged the trend. \u201cThe need for marginalized communities to have a voice [in agriculture] is integral \u2013 not optional,\u201d explained Patrice Bailey, assistant commissioner at the Minnesota department of agriculture. \u201cThe value is having an office dedicated to young farmers, women, entrepreneurs, Bipoc, African farmers and more. It gives an entry point into agriculture.\u201d For the SFG, that entry point has largely been the campus of The Food Group. The non-profit runs the incubator farm where SFG, three other African-led farms and other growers learn everything from organic cultivation to selling their produce at farmers markets. Profits from produce sales and grant dollars will go to the eventual purchase of the SPG\u2019s own farm. Elhassan already envisions what that farm should look like. \u201cWe want a big tree, a gate like those our homes back in Sudan. We want it to be as if you walked into a Sudanese village.\u201d On the SFG\u2019s plot in New Hope, people who have never touched a crop work next to seasoned experts. They care for culturally relevant crops: molokhia, jute leaves that are commonly called Egyptian spinach; okra; and ajjour, a large muskmelon that\u2019s related to the cucumber and common in cuisines from Armenia to Syria. To round out their farm, the members have also planted eggplants, peppers, pears, apples, mint, alfalfa and tomatoes \u201dthe Sudanese way\u201d. Here, \u201cthe Sudanese way\u201d is built on cooperative, familial efforts \u2013 reminiscent of large, shared farms along the Nile Basin. They all care for the sheep, including a crowd favorite Hamada (\u201cpraiseworthy\u201d in Arabic), on their new livestock farm an hour from the New Hope site. And they share in the work and bounty of harvesting food. \u201cWe work together and share the crops at the end of the year. We grow specific plants that bring back good memories, like molokhia. We sit down how we did in Sudan \u2026 at one of the benches at our farm here and clean the leaves. It brings back good memories of doing the same thing in a family setting in Sudan,\u201d said Ibrahim. Volunteers enjoy lunch and time with others, and they can leave with a vegetable basket brimming with tastes of home. Ibrahim said: \u201cWe\u2019ve ended up creating a venue for a lot of community members who live in the outskirts to get more involved and feel like they are important parts of the community. They bring us so much, even in a piece of wisdom or a story about Sudan.\u201d Comments about new war developments are sprinkled between chitchat and planting advice. \u201cWhen you find people who share the same tragedy as you, it offers some relief,\u201d said Saleh Ali, a retired businessman and SFG grower. At the moment, harrowing stories of agricultural disruption across Sudan weigh on the farmers\u2019 minds. News reports detail intentional arson attacks on farming communities by the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, which is warring with government forces. A UN development programme analysis revealed that over 70% of rural Sudanese households couldn\u2019t cultivate any land during the summer 2023 season. One day, when it\u2019s safe in Sudan, the SFG hopes to open a farm in their homeland too. Drawing on their engineering expertise, Elhassan and Ibrahim are researching solar irrigation technology \u2013 relying on Sudan\u2019s ample sun rather than foreign machinery that might prove unreliable in local conditions. \u201cOur people have been doing this for a thousand years,\u201d said Elhassan on organic farming. \u201cBuilding a farm in Sudan is absolutely a priority, but it\u2019s important we work with the farming communities there. It\u2019s not our place to go in and say they\u2019ve been doing it wrong. It\u2019s just different.\u201d"

            "content": "Within weeks, work is expected to begin on a 121-mile (195-kilometre) clean energy \u201csuperhighway\u201d designed to channel green electricity from Scotland\u2019s rich renewable resources to the north of England. The industry regulator Ofgem is expected to give the green light for work to begin on the first section of the multibillion-pound high-voltage cable project, Eastern Green Link (EGL), in the coming days. Ofgem\u2019s approval for a second section is expected to follow within weeks. By the autumn, construction is expected to begin on what will be one of Britain\u2019s biggest power grid projects, carrying enough green electricity along the east coast of Britain, mostly under the sea, to power 4m homes by 2029. The first section to gain approval \u2013 officially phase 2 of EGL \u2013 will be built by National Grid in partnership with the energy company SSE and run from Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, to Wilsthorpe on the Yorkshire coast near Bridlington. The second project expected to be greenlit \u2013 EGL phase 1 \u2013 will link the Torness area in East Lothian to the Hawthorn Pit in County Durham, constructed by National Grid and Scottish Power. The scale of the project is expected to double in the years to come as EGL\u2019s third and fourth phases form the electrical backbone of Britain\u2019s future green electricity system. \u201cThe scale of these projects is absolutely massive,\u201d said one industry source. The size of EGL matches the scale of the challenge ahead in creating an electricity system fit for a net-zero future. It is one of 26 critical energy infrastructure schemes, worth an estimated \u00a320bn, being fast-tracked by the regulator to meet Britain\u2019s ambitious green energy targets. Under the new Labour government these targets are even more pressing: to create a net-zero electricity system by 2030, ministers plan to double the UK\u2019s onshore wind, triple its solar power and quadruple its offshore wind capacity. This clean energy boom will require a big change in the UK\u2019s approach to energy infrastructure, both in the speed and scale of the work and how it affects local communities. National Grid estimates that the UK will need to build five times more electricity infrastructure by 2030 than it has in the past three decades. But not everyone welcomes the change. The EGL undersea cables will require substations, converter stations and miles of overhead lines on land to connect the projects to Britain\u2019s existing electricity grid. The energy companies have undertaken some of the most in-depth public consultation exercises ever seen in the sector to address concerns over the sharp increase in energy infrastructure across rural areas. \u201cAs a country we are trying to put as much of this new transmission as possible out at sea,\u201d said an industry source. \u201cBut these cables do need to come ashore somewhere, and there needs to be the infrastructure in place to carry the power from the coast into people\u2019s homes. This means substations, pylons and cables. It means more power lines and poles. And people don\u2019t seem prepared for the fact that this infrastructure is both very necessary and very visible.\u201d For SSE the green link project is one of four new critical national transmission schemes across the north of Scotland that will enable the supply of clean energy to homes and businesses around Great Britain. It believes that its public consultation on the projects amounts to \u201cone of the biggest listening exercises in Scotland\u2019s history\u201d. The company has directly contacted nearly 300,000 people within six miles of the proposed projects to have their say in more than 220 consultation events and public meetings. It estimates that more than 10,000 people attended and it has received more than 12,000 written responses. Lesley Dow, SSE\u2019s head of community engagement, said the company was working to balance \u201cthe clear need for these projects to deliver energy security and net zero\u201d with community concerns and technical and environmental constraints. \u201cThis balance is by no means easily reached, but by listening closely to communities we have already made significant changes to project plans, including moving substation locations and altering overhead line routes,\u201d she said. This level of public engagement will need to be replicated across the major infrastructure projects needed across the country as the UK moves towards becoming a net-zero economy by 2050. \u201cMost people in the UK are not used to seeing where their electricity comes from,\u201d the source added. \u201cIn the past it was possible to keep a few giant power plants from view by basing them far from the most populated areas. But in a low-carbon world we\u2019ll need a lot more electricity, and we\u2019ll rely on a lot more energy projects to get it. This won\u2019t be inconspicuous.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-03T21:30:14Z",
            "content": "The UK has stepped up preparations for a possible evacuation of British citizens from Lebanon in the aftermath of last week\u2019s assassinations in Beirut and Tehran \u2013 killings blamed on Israel that threaten to transform the war in Gaza into a region-wide conflict. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Saturday that consular experts, border force officials and military personnel have been deployed to the region as part of planning for \u201ca range of possible conflict scenarios\u201d. The landing ships RFA Cardigan Bay and HMS Duncan are already in the eastern Mediterranean, and the air force is putting transport helicopters on standby, the statement said. The UK is not expecting an imminent need to evacuate citizens from Lebanon, the Observer understands, but the decision to put forces on standby comes after a meeting on Friday between the defence secretary John Healey and his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant, during a visit to the region by Healey and the foreign secretary, David Lammy. On Saturday the government also repeated a call for British nationals in Lebanon to leave while \u201ccommercial options are still available\u201d, joining the US and several other countries. Dozens of companies have suspended flights to Lebanon and Israel in the past week. David Lammy spoke to the US secretary of state Antony Blinken last night in a call in which the two men reaffirmed the need to de-escalate rising tensions in the region and prevent the conflict from spreading. They stressed the importance of finalising a ceasefire and hostage release deal under negotiation as soon as possible. Egypt\u2019s foreign minister Badr Abdelatty told Iran\u2019s acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani in a phone call that recent developments in the region were \u201cunprecedented, very dangerous\u201d and threatening to stability, officials in Cairo said. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling anxiety, but feel confused about what I should do. What\u2019s the best option, should I stay or should I leave and try to start over somewhere else?\u201d said Lebanese-Brazilian Bruna Hassan al-Safawi, 23. Safawi\u2019s home is not far from Beirut airport: as the country is surrounded by Syrian and Israeli territory, it is effectively the one route in and out of the country for mostpeople. \u201cIf I\u2019m still seeing planes landing, it\u2019s OK, I\u2019m safe. If I stop seeing planes, I\u2019m gonna start packing my things,\u201d she said. In Haifa, Israel\u2019s northernmost city, on Friday, bars and restaurants that would normally be packed on a summer evening were near empty. \u201cI am trying not to think about it and doing things like normal, or you will go mad with worrying,\u201d said resident Layla al-Nasser, 26. Fears that the war in Gaza is on the brink of morphing into a conflict that could consume much of the Middle East grew over the weekend after comments from Iran on Saturday in which the Islamic Republic said it expected its ally in Lebanon, the powerful Shia militia Hezbollah, would begin striking deeper inside Israel, and no longer be confined to hitting military targets. Israel and Hezbollah have traded tit-for-tat attacks since the Lebanese militia began firing on Israel the day after Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on 7 October, ostensibly to aid its Palestinian allies. In parallel with the fighting in Gaza, the conflict on the blue line separating the two countries has steadily escalated over the past 10 months, with tens of thousands of people on both sides displaced from their homes. Tensions reached unprecedented levels this week in the wake of the back-to-back assassinations of Fuad Shukur, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, and Hamas\u2019s political chief, Ismail Haniyeh. Israel has claimed responsibility for Shukur\u2019s killing, a missile strike on an apartment building in Beirut on Tuesday evening that also killed four other people and injured about 70. Israel said he was to blame for a rocket attack on the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights last weekend that killed 12 children and young people playing football. Hezbollah has denied it carried out the attack. Hours later, Shukur\u2019s killing was overshadowed by the news that Haniyeh had been assassinated during a visit to Tehran for the inauguration of Iran\u2019s new president. Conflicting reports have emerged about how the killing was carried out: on Saturday, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards released a statement saying that the Qatar-based official was killed by a short-range projectile with a warhead of about 7kg. Both Hezbollah and Iran have vowed revenge for the killings. The Revolutionary Guards statement said Tehran\u2019s revenge for the attack would be \u201csevere\u201d and at an \u201cappropriate time, place and manner\u201d, blaming Israel for Haniyeh\u2019s death. Israel has not commented on the Hamas leader\u2019s death, but has carried out targeted assassinations on Iranian soil in the past. In a speech at Shukur\u2019s funeral on Thursday, Hezbollah\u2019s secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah, delinked the Lebanese front from Gaza for the first time, saying \u201cthe issue has gone beyond the support front\u201d, and that the conflict with Israel had \u201centered a new phase\u201d. The US, Israel\u2019s key ally, said on Friday it would move additional warships and fighter jets to the region to \u201cprotect US personnel and defend Israel\u201d as the Iran-aligned \u201caxis of resistance\u201d readied its response to Haniyeh\u2019s killing. The fighting in the Gaza Strip has also drawn in militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, which have fired drones and missiles at Israel and US assets in the region. Tehran directly attacked Israel for the first time in April, after a strike it blamed on Israel killed several senior Revolutionary Guards at the Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus. Iran\u2019s course of action this time is expected to be stronger, possibly taking the form of a joint attack. Meanwhile, fighting continues to rage in Gaza. An Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced persons in Gaza City killed at least 15 Palestinians yesterday, hours after two strikes in the occupied West Bank killed nine militants including a local Hamas commander. Health officials in Gaza said on Saturday the conflict had now killed almost 40,000 people. The UN said this week nearly 40,000 cases of hepatitis A had been confirmed in the enclave, and that health conditions \u201ccontinue to deteriorate\u201d. The conflict broke out after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack in which approximately 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 taken hostage. An initial ceasefire in November broke down after a week, and protracted talks aimed at a truce and hostage release deal since have so far proved unsuccessful."

            "content": "The German armed forces are investigating the suspected sabotage of one of their military bases amid suspicions that it was broken into and the water supply system contaminated. The defence ministry confirmed on Wednesday that state security was investigating the reported attack after suspicions of attempted or actual entry, as well as sabotage, at the Cologne-Wahn barracks, just outside Cologne. The parliamentary defence committee was informed about a \u201cserious indication\u201d of sabotage, a ministry spokesperson added. Suspicions were raised on Tuesday night at the major military base close to Cologne-Bonn airport, which houses airfields and other barracks, where one or several people are thought to have broken in and tampered with the water supply pipes. The base was sealed off on Wednesday morning, with no one allowed to enter or leave. There had been reports of abnormalities in the water, a spokesperson confirmed, without giving more detail. Elsewhere, a Nato base outside the German town of Geilenkirchen faced an attempted trespassing incident on Tuesday, with the military alliance saying a person had been stopped while trying to enter the base. Police were investigating the incident. A spokesperson for the base denied earlier media reports that it had been sealed off. Like much of the rest of Europe, Germany is on high alert after a spate of arson attacks, espionage and attacks on infrastructure often blamed on Russia as it finds different ways of fighting its war with the west away from the battlefield in Ukraine. Lt Col Ulrich Fonrobert, a spokesperson for the military in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, said the armed forces were taking the incidents very seriously. \u201cLast night there was an incident at the barracks. This incident has led to the barracks having been shut since then,\u201d he said outside the base. He said the alarm had been raised after a report of \u201cabnormal water values\u201d, but did not elaborate except to say an analysis of the base\u2019s drinking water was being carried out. The base was reopened at about midday. A spokesperson for the defence ministry said that state security had been informed, and that no one had been harmed. Security guards were alerted on Tuesday night to a person fleeing the Cologne-Wahn base, after electronic sensors on the waterworks on the site were triggered, but they were unable to apprehend the person. A hole was later discovered in a fence. A message broadcast to everyone at the base warned personnel to address any \u201cunknown person they see\u201d and to \u201creport any suspicious behaviour\u201d. An internal memo urgently warned solders and civilian forces against drinking from the water supply and from showering. Military police secured forensic evidence at the water supply works. According to Spiegel magazine, members of the military airport police stationed at the base had filed several reports of gastrointestinal complaints, though it is unclear whether this was connected to the reported act of sabotage. The magazine said the Cologne-Wahn base was home to several command authorities as well as military and civilian departments of the Bundeswehr which employs 4,300 members of the armed forces and 1,200 civilians. The Ministry of Defence department for coordinating air transport for politicians is also headquartered there. It is an important hub for the west\u2019s military support for Ukraine. Ukrainian military personnel being trained in Germany regularly use it as a base from which to return home via Poland."

            "content": "It was on Marseille\u2019s Corniche John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the coastal road that slings around France\u2019s second city, that G\u00e9rald Darmanin metaphorically staged his own medal ceremony. A peculiar choice of location for this particular moment of national back-slapping given the Kennedy history, but France\u2019s interior minister could be excused for getting a little giddy. \u201cIt all started here, with the arrival of the Olympic flame in Marseille,\u201d Darmanin told a lineup of gendarmes. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful gold medal for the security forces.\u201d This was going to be the Conflict Games, staged at a time of unnerving global insecurity, with Russia said to be out to disrupt it having been prohibited from involvement, along with Belarus, as a result of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. It was being played out to the backdrop of a potential all-out regional war in the Middle East that ushered up memories of the 1972 Munich Olympics, when Palestinian militants infiltrated the Olympic village, killing 11 members of the Israel team. A certain sense of foreboding had not been assuaged by the excitable warnings from Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Israel Katz, who spoke of intelligence of a plot by \u201cIranian terrorist proxies and other terrorist organisations who aim to carry out attacks against members of the Israeli delegation and Israeli tourists during the Olympics\u201d. It had looked a brave, even foolhardy decision, to turn over the crown jewels of Paris\u2019s locations to the Olympic events and the banks of the Seine to the opening ceremony, rather than take the London 2012 route and parcel off most of it to the outskirts of the city. Such bravado certainly demanded a show of extraordinary force. There were 45,000 police and gendarmes in the capital that Friday night, on top of 20,000 private security guards and a reserve of 10,000 soldiers, accommodated in a bespoke military base in Bois de Vincennes on the outskirts of Paris. That was the peak of the police presence but on any given day there have been 30,000 armed officers patrolling the streets, marshalling off roads and whistling frenetically at the traffic. It is little wonder then that the organisers and politicians have enjoyed a little release of tension as the Games have come to a peaceable close. \u201cOur vision \u2026 has been contradicted, contested, mocked, caricatured,\u201d said Paris\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo. \u201cIt is a great pleasure to see the city the way we had planned it and to hear people thank us \u2026 fuck the reactionaries, fuck this extreme right, fuck all those who would like to lock us into the war of all against all.\u201d An arson attack, subsequently blamed on the extreme left, that disabled France\u2019s high-speed railway network on the eve of the opening ceremony had forced Keir Starmer to travel to Paris by plane rather than by Eurostar but the effect on the wider Games was minimal. There were \u201cFree Palestine\u201d banners at Israel\u2019s opening football game against Mali at the Stade de France and Nurali Emomali of Tajikistan refused to shake the hands of his Israeli opponent Tohar Butbul at the end of their judo bout. The closest the Games got to an incident of real note was perhaps in the moments before the men\u2019s 100m final when an intruder, a 24-year-old Australian wearing a T-shirt that read \u201cFree Palestine, Free Ukraine\u201d, was bundled to the ground as the runners prepared to take their marks. \u201cIs that what we were waiting for?\u201d asked the Olympic champion, Noah Lyles. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anybody try to get on the field.\u201d Stephanie Adam, a campaigner with the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, said there had been a \u201crepressive level of \u2018security\u2019 in Paris\u201d but it had \u201cfailed to keep on the sidelines the vibrant protests targeting Israel\u2019s participation despite its ongoing Gaza genocide against Palestinians\u201d. It was a different type of war, a cultural one, that occasionally threatened to take the shine off the athletic achievements. There was an initial outrage in some quarters at the opening ceremony, and, in particular, a segment seen by some to be a parody of the Last Supper involving drag queens, a transgender model and a semi-naked singer sitting in a fruit bowl, though those responsible stressed it was based on a painting of feasting Greek gods. Then there was the reaction to the uncomfortable images of the Italian boxer Angela Carini abandoning her bout against the Algerian Imane Khelif after 46 seconds, claiming she had never been hit harder. Khelif and Lin Yu-ting, a featherweight representing Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), were banned from the world championships last year by the International Boxing Association after allegedly failing chromosome eligibility tests. The International Olympic Committee said they had been registered at birth as women and had passports as such. The tests undertaken by the IBA, led by a Russian national and stripped of its status as a regulatory body over failures to address problems relating to corruption and integrity, were said by the IOC to lack credibility. The opening ceremony and the boxing row may seem to be unrelated but both were seized upon in the Kremlin as proof of the degeneracy of the west. \u201cI personally watched most of the material myself,\u201d said Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov of the opening ceremony. \u201cIndeed, there were some absolutely disgusting moments. We have long known the oddities of the French Republic. But that it was approved by the IOC for such a broad international audience is hard to believe.\u201d As for the continuing row over the two boxers, it offered an opportunity for Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, to muddy the waters further by accusing western countries of monopolising the Olympic movement and \u201caggressively\u201d imposing an LGBTQ+ agenda on the rest of the world. \u201cAt the Olympic Games in Paris female boxers are being publicly subjected to violence [by] athletes who had previously failed hormonal tests done by the International Boxing Federation and, according to the federation and according to common sense, are men,\u201d Polyanskiy ranted at a meeting of the UN. \u201cThis is absolutely repellent.\u201d Gordon Crovitz, co-founder of NewsGuard, a US-based company that analyses online misinformation, said the Kremlin deserved a gold medal for the creativity of the disinformation about the Games being spread across the internet. NewsGuard had identified 31 \u201cmisinformation narratives\u201d, stories that were wholly untrue and seemingly designed to confuse, relating to the Paris Olympics. They had been spread in 16 languages over social media and 74 news and information websites, of which 24 had a history of publishing false, pro-Russia propaganda and disinformation, he said. They included 11 sites that belong to the Pravda network, a group of anonymously owned sites that republish content from pro-Kremlin sources and frequently advance false or egregiously misleading information. A feature of this Games had been the use of artificial intelligence to create fake videos, according to NewsGuard. \u201cI would say that at these Olympics Russia deserves the gold medal for disinformation,\u201d said Crovitz. \u201cOne of the examples is the claim that the CIA had issued a video warning against riding the metro in Paris because it was going to be too dangerous. That video we found to be entirely a deep fake released first on an account on X just for that purpose and then published on pro-Russian accounts and then state media. \u201cThen there were reports claiming to be from BBC and [the Netherlands-based investigative journalism group] Bellingcat that were completely faked claiming there were plans to postpone the Olympics.\u201d There had been a Kremlin policy of denigrating everything about the Olympics, said Crovitz. But had it damaged the games? That\u2019s not the conclusion in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace or the wider French public where initial indifference had turned to widespread enthusiasm, as Le\u00f3n Marchand in the pool and the rugby sevens orchestrator Antoine Dupont claimed the golds. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the interior minister, you take care of everything domestic \u2013 I know that people wanted this to go badly, people that didn\u2019t have faith in the security forces,\u201d said Darmanin in Marseille. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to see that France is capable of this.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-20T15:51:32Z",
            "content": "Disney has dropped a controversial legal claim that the terms and conditions a widower agreed to when signing up for Disney+ streaming service protect it from a wrongful death lawsuit he brought over his wife\u2019s death after she ate at a resort restaurant. On Monday night, Josh D\u2019Amaro, the chair of Disney Experiences, released a statement announcing that Disney had decided to have the matter proceed in court, rather than through arbitration, as the company had been fighting for just last week. \u201cAt Disney, we strive to put humanity above all other considerations,\u201d D\u2019Amaro said. \u201cWith such unique circumstances as the ones in this case, we believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss. As such, we\u2019ve decided to waive our right to arbitration and have the matter proceed in court.\u201d Disney made headlines last week after its lawyers asked a judge in Florida to dismiss the wrongful death lawsuit and settle any disputes with the company out of court via arbitration. The company\u2019s lawyers argued the widower had agreed to Disney\u2019s terms of use \u2013 which state that users agree to settle any disputes with the company out of court via arbitration \u2013 when he signed up for a one-month free trial of Disney+ in 2019, and again in 2023, when he purchased the Disney theme park tickets using his Disney+ account. In court documents, attorneys for Disney argued that the terms of use included an arbitration clause that applied to \u201call disputes\u201d including those involving \u201cThe Walt Disney Company or its affiliates\u201d and that Walt Disney Parks and Resorts was an affiliate of the Walt Disney Company. Daniel Zuniga, a partner at Personal Injury of Florida law firm, described the argument as \u201cunconscionable\u201d. \u201cThe consequences of such a ruling or such a holding could be catastrophic for the average person,\u201d he told the Guardian when the suit was disclosed. \u201cBig conglomerates just keep getting bigger and bigger, so how far up the chain can it go?\u201d Jeffrey Piccolo filed the wrongful death lawsuit against Walt Disney World and Resorts and a restaurant at the resort earlier this year after his wife, Dr Kanokporn Tangsuan, died in October 2023 after eating at the Raglan Road Irish Pub at the resort near Orlando, Florida. In the lawsuit, Piccolo alleges that his wife\u2019s death was a result of suffering an allergic reaction, which is supported by the report of a medical examiner who determined that her cause of death was anaphylaxis due to elevated levels of dairy and nut in her system. Piccolo says that while they were dining at the resort restaurant he and his wife both questioned the waiter multiple times, as Tangsuan had a severe allergy to dairy and nuts, and that the waiter assured them that the order would be allergen-free. The lawsuit argues that the wait staff was negligent and seeks damages exceeding $50,000 from Disney, per the complaint. Monday\u2019s statement from Disney comes as a complete reversal of a position the company took last week when a spokesperson defended the company\u2019s legal strategy and said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened by the family\u2019s loss and understand their grief. Given that this restaurant is neither owned nor operated by Disney, we are merely defending ourselves against the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s attempt to include us in their lawsuit against the restaurant.\u201d Piccolo\u2019s lawyers had called Disney\u2019s argument for dismissal \u201csurreal\u201d in court documents, and personal injury and wrongful death lawyers had described Disney\u2019s arguments as a legal stretch. The litigation remains ongoing and a hearing is scheduled for 2 October."

            "date": "2024-08-21T23:03:16Z",
            "content": "A Las Vegas politician accused of murdering a local investigative journalist who wrote critical articles about him took the stand in his own defense on Wednesday, giving his testimony in narrative style, without being asked questions. \u201cRight now I want to say unequivocally: I\u2019m innocent. I didn\u2019t kill Mr German. And I\u2019ve got a lot to share with you all,\u201d said Robert Telles, a former Clark county public administrator. Jeff German, a veteran journalist, was found stabbed to death outside his home in 2022. Prosecutors say Telles killed German in broad daylight in retaliation for stories that appeared in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, painting Telles as a bullying boss who had an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate. On Wednesday, Telles spoke for more than an hour-and-a-half and his testimony is expected to continue when court resumes Thursday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a day I\u2019ve been waiting for for nearly two years,\u201d Telles told jurors. \u201cThis thing\u2019s been kind of a nightmare, frankly.\u201d The trial has captivated the city, rehashing the grim details of a crime that sent shockwaves through Las Vegas and beyond. Telles had insisted to journalists and judges that he wanted to tell his story to jurors who will decide whether he goes to prison or is set free. Much of what the jury and the public have heard weighs against Telles, an attorney who was once the county administrator of unclaimed estates. His DNA was found beneath German\u2019s fingernails. He had family ties to a maroon SUV seen in German\u2019s neighborhood at about the time German was killed. Police found on Telles\u2019s cellphone and computer hundreds of photos of German\u2019s home, and several pages of German\u2019s identity records, including time stamps showing they had been collected just weeks before the killing. Surveillance video, shown in court last week, captured a person in a wide-brimmed straw hat and an orange oversized long-sleeve shirt and carrying a large cloth satchel slipping into a side yard of German\u2019s home before the reporter was ambushed and left dead in a pool of blood. Later, at Telles\u2019s house, police found cut-up pieces of a broad straw hat and gray athletic shoes that resembled those worn by the person in the footage. On Tuesday, Michelle Leavitt, the judge overseeing the case, questioned Telles about whether he wanted to risk answering questions under oath from prosecutors. They rested their case on Monday after presenting 28 witnesses and hundreds of pages of photos, police reports and video evidence against Telles. \u201cMr Telles, you understand you have heard all of the evidence that the state intends to present in this case,\u201d the judge said. \u201cYou understand that you cannot be compelled to testify in this matter?\u201d \u201cYes, your honor,\u201d Telles said. Telles\u2019s defense attorney Robert Draskovich and co-counsel Michael Horvath said outside court they had advised Telles against testifying, but that he insisted on doing so. Prosecutor Pamela Weckerly, in her opening statement on 14 August, asked the jury to remain focused on German\u2019s killing and not on other issues. \u201cIn the end, this case is not about politics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about an alleged inappropriate relationship. It\u2019s not about who\u2019s a good boss or who\u2019s a good supervisor or favoritism at work. It\u2019s just about murder.\u201d The defense might still call three other witnesses, Draskovich said on Tuesday, including a witness who might corroborate Telles\u2019s account that he visited a local gym on the day of the murder. Telles is expected to be the last person called for the defense, the attorney said. No family members or character witnesses are scheduled. Telles\u2019s testimony could take more than a day. \u201cHe\u2019s entitled to his defense,\u201d Draskovich told reporters. \u201cThis is the defense that he wants to present.\u201d The other defense witness on Tuesday was a woman who testified that she called police after seeing surveillance video in a news report showing a man walking near German\u2019s home in an orange outfit. She said the man resembled someone she had seen at a park a few days before the killing. Robbery wasn\u2019t an apparent motive for the killing, prosecutors said. The jury learned that German\u2019s wallet, money, car keys and cellphone were still in the pockets of his shorts. Nothing was amiss in German\u2019s home, although his garage door remained open, to the puzzlement of his across-the-street neighbors. They sobbed on the witness stand as they remembered finding his body the next day. Prosecutors allege that Telles had been motivated to kill German after German wrote articles for the Las Vegas Review-Journal about a county office in turmoil, including allegations that Telles had had an inappropriate relationship with a female co-worker. Telles lost his bid for re-election as the Clark county public administrator and guardian, and derided German and the newspaper on social media. Telles had complained that he was being victimized by a political and social \u201cold guard\u201d real estate network for trying to fight corruption that he saw in his office. German spent 44 years covering Las Vegas mobsters and public officials at the Las Vegas Sun and then at the larger Review-Journal. About 10 of his family members and friends have attended each day of Telles\u2019s trial. They have declined to speak to the media."

            "date": "2024-08-30T14:14:05Z",
            "content": "The UK housing market is at its strongest since the aftermath of Liz Truss\u2019s infamous mini-budget that sent borrowing costs soaring, according to the latest figures. Nationwide said house prices grew at an annual rate of 2.4% in August, up from 2.1% in July and the fastest rate since December 2022. Separate figures from the Bank of England showed there were nearly 62,000 mortgages approved for homebuyers in July, the highest total since September 2022 \u2013 the same month as the former prime minister\u2019s disastrous mini-budget. The Bank also revised mortgage approval figures for June slightly upwards. The UK housing market has been buoyed up by the Bank\u2019s move this month to reduce rates from 5.25% to 5%, the first cut in four and a half years. Lenders have responded to the cut by introducing more competitive mortgage rates while Lloyds Bank, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage provider, announced on Thursday it would increase the maximum sum it was willing to lend to first-time buyers. Under the \u00a32bn initiative, which experts say will bring home ownership within the reach of more prospective buyers, the Lloyds and Halifax chains will allow new buyers to take out loans worth up to 5.5 times their household annual income \u2013 up from 4.49 times. \u201cSummer may be coming to an end but there\u2019s certainly no end in sight when it comes to the improvements being seen across the UK property market,\u201d said Marc von Grundherr, a director at the estate agent Benham and Reeves. \u201cIt\u2019s quite remarkable just how swiftly the market has accelerated in just a few short months.\u201d Von Grundherr said he believed Labour\u2019s warning of a \u201cpainful\u201d October budget and a potential worsening of economic conditions in the short term would not slow the burgeoning recovery in the housing market. \u201cThis is unlikely to derail the ambitions of the UK\u2019s buyers and sellers, who are now making their move with confidence following a prolonged period of market uncertainty,\u201d he said. Earlier this month the mortgage lender Halifax forecast that UK house prices would continue to grow throughout the rest of this year, as mortgage rates began to drop after the cut in interest rates. Nationwide said the average house price in the UK was \u00a3265,375 in August, down 0.2% on the previous month. The month-on-month drop is the first since April, reversing monthly increases of between 0.2% and 0.4%, although the price of an average UK house remains at its highest level since October 2022. \u201cWhile house price growth and activity remains subdued by historic standards, they nevertheless present a picture of resilience in the context of the higher interest rate environment, and where house prices remain high relative to average earnings \u2013 which makes raising a deposit more challenging,\u201d said Robert Gardner, the chief economist at Nationwide. Verona Frankish, the chief executive of the online property seller Yopa, said the new figures provided a first look at house price performance since interest rates were cut at the start of August. \u201cDespite the very marginal monthly decline, it\u2019s clear that the first reduction in four months has helped to further boost the market momentum, with yet another strong rate of annual house price growth being seen,\u201d she said. Frankish said that while rates remained \u201cconsiderably higher\u201d than buyers and sellers were used to, the expectation of the Bank of England making another cut this year \u201cshould only help to strengthen buyer appetites further\u201d."

            "date": "2024-08-22T13:27:16Z",
            "content": "Many of Scotland\u2019s best known arts organisations, including the Edinburgh fringe and national jazz orchestra, are in uproar over plans for deep cuts in culture funding. They said the proposed cuts, which came to light in the middle of the Edinburgh festival, would leave Scottish artists in crisis and cause deep damage to the country\u2019s reputation and economy. One hundred and eleven organisations and artists have signed an open letter to John Swinney, the first minister, Angus Robertson, the culture secretary, and Kate Forbes, the economy secretary, warning the cuts would have grave consequences for Scotland\u2019s cultural wellbeing. They said the government was betraying promises from the previous first minister, Humza Yousaf, that funding for Scotland\u2019s arts sector would grow by \u00a3100m, and was rowing back on recent pledges to spend another \u00a325m this year. The row follows orders to the civil service from the Scottish finance secretary, Shona Robison, to freeze or cut all non-essential spending after the Treasury warned of deep reductions in public spending this year. Scottish ministers have already begun cutting spending, including scrapping a pilot scheme that removed peak fares from all domestic rail services, in preparation for an emergency budget this autumn. Creative Scotland, the government\u2019s art agency, warned earlier this month that nearly \u00a310m had suddenly been cut from its budget, including \u00a36.6m in grant-in-aid. The agency told MSPs its budgets were experiencing \u201csevere limitations\u201d. Part of that money was for an open fund worth \u00a33m for hundreds of individual freelance artists, who will now no longer be financially supported. The open letter, supported by the Fruitmarket and Summerhall arts centres in Edinburgh, the Traverse theatre, the Aberdeen arts centre and the DCA arts centre in Dundee, said those artists were \u201cthe heartbeat\u201d of the cultural sector. \u201cWithout it, many artists are left without the means to continue their work,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis risks sending a stark message out to the world: Scottish arts is closed for business. \u201cIn the same month as the global spotlight is on Scotland\u2019s vibrant cultural scene through the Edinburgh festivals, this cessation of support for local artists is particularly devastating.\u201d The letter said the cuts would mean Scottish artists would be absent from the international stage; venues would close; community wealth-building would be put at risk, talent would be drained from Scotland. Those cumulatively would damage Scotland\u2019s economy. A separate petition launched by the Campaign for the Arts said the cuts were already damaging the cultural sector and risked a catastrophe. \u201cMeanwhile, more than 45 of Scotland\u2019s museums and galleries are at risk of closure within 12 months, and Edinburgh\u2019s festivals are warning that Scotland\u2019s cultural assets are now in a \u2018perilously fragile\u2019 state,\u201d its petition said. A Scottish government spokesperson said it had already increased arts funding this year, and remained committed to investing at least \u00a3100m more a year on arts and culture by 2028-29. \u201cThe Scottish budget continues to face significant challenges. We are considering the implications of the actions announced by the chancellor [Rachel Reeves] on 29 July for our public finances, and the next steps required by the Scottish government,\u201d he said. The spokesperson added: \u201cThe culture secretary is in regular contact with the sector to discuss the issues it currently faces and how to address those challenges. We will continue to do everything within our powers and resources to protect our world class arts and culture sector.\u201d Arts organisations argue that increased funding merely repaid Creative Scotland the money it had lost in earlier rounds of cuts, and to repay the money it had used from its reserves. Lori Anderson, who is due to become director of Festivals Edinburgh in October, said arts funding was equal to 0.5% of the Scottish government\u2019s overall spending yet delivered far greater benefits to the Scottish economy. She said the arts had endured 15 years of standstill budgets. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing that individual artists are going to be the most affected,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re the most vulnerable, but they\u2019re the heart of the sector. There would be no art without artists.\u201d"

            "content": "The US military has made its largest investment in Canada\u2019s mining sector in decades, spending millions amid a looming battle among nations to control the supply of cobalt. On Tuesday, the Pentagon announced a $20m grant to help build a cobalt refinery in the province of Ontario, saying the investment will \u201ccreate a more robust industrial base capable of meeting growing demand across both the defense and commercial sectors\u201d. In recent years, cobalt has emerged as a \u201ckey precursor material\u201d in the race to build the batteries that power electric vehicles, electronics and military hardware batteries. With China controlling nearly 80% of the global cobalt market, the United States has looked for novel ways to diversify its supply chain among allied nations. The multi-million dollar grant was made by the US Department of Defense through the Defense Production Act, a statute meant to expand domestic production capability, and will aid in the construction of the facility in northern Ontario. The Canadian government is contributing an additional USD$3.6m to the project. Electra Battery Materials says when the operation, located between the town of Cobalt and Temiskaming Shores, is up and running, it will be North America\u2019s only cobalt sulfate refinery, capable of producing battery-grade materials. The company has been vocal about its aims reducing China\u2019s market share in critical minerals processing. Electra currently has an agreement with South Korea\u2019s LG Energy Solution, to deliver 80% of Electra\u2019s cobalt sulfate production for the first five years in operation. But the company says there are \u201cno strings\u201d attached to the Pentagon money, and no requirement to send any production to the US. The investment by the Pentagon marks the third since Joe Biden visited Ottawa in 2022. It is notable as the first large investment since the second world war, when the US poured money into Quebec\u2019s aluminum industry in order to secure a steady supply of the coveted material. Earlier this year, the US said it would help fund copper, gold, graphite and cobalt processing projects in Quebec and the Northwest Territories, but these grants totalled less than $15m."

            "content": "The US military will deploy additional fighter jets and navy warships to the Middle East, the Pentagon said on Friday, as Washington braces for Iran and its regional allies to make good on a promise to respond to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. After the back-to-back assassinations of Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday and top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut the evening before, international diplomats have scrambled to head off a full-fledged regional war. Rising tensions have spurred a growing list of major airlines into cancelling flights to Tel Aviv or Beirut, including Lufthansa, Delta and Air India. On Friday France urged its citizens to leave Iran and Cyprus said it had expanded plans to support a large-scale evacuation from the region if the war expands. The island nation helped tens of thousands of people leave during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, approved sending the additional Navy cruisers and destroyers \u2013 which can shoot down ballistic missiles \u2013 to the Middle East and Europe on Friday and the US will also send an additional squadron of fighter jets to the Middle East. \u201cAustin has ordered adjustments to US military posture designed to improve US force protection, to increase support for the defence of Israel and to ensure the United States is prepared to respond to various contingencies,\u201d the Pentagon said in a statement. The US military previously intensified deployments prior to 13 April, when Iran launched an attack on Israeli territory with drones and missiles. Israel successfully knocked down almost all of the roughly 300 drones and missiles with the help of the US and other allies. It is thought that the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon could present unique challenges to any efforts by the US to intercept drones and missiles given the group\u2019s vast arsenal and immediate proximity to Israel. On Friday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the country was \u201cin a state of very high readiness for any scenario\u201d. The government had given ministers satellite phones in case Iran\u2019s retaliation takes down communications, Israeli media reported. Israel killed Shukr \u2013 Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command \u2013 in Beirut on Tuesday, a move it said was a response to deadly rocket fire last week on the annexed Golan Heights. Hours later, Haniyeh was killed in Tehran. Haniyeh\u2019s death has not been officially claimed by Israel but it has been widely celebrated inside the country, including by top politicians and former security chiefs. Iran and Hamas have both accused Israel of carrying out the killing and have pledged to retaliate. On Friday crowds gathered in Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha, to bury Haniyeh, a day after a prayer ceremony in Tehran for the Hamas leader, who was the group\u2019s chief negotiator in efforts to broker a ceasefire in Gaza. The US president, Joe Biden, who has pushed hard for a ceasefire in recent months, said the killing was \u201cnot helpful\u201d, in comments to journalists at a US airbase late on Thursday. Biden added that he had a \u201cvery direct\u201d conversation with Netanyahu about the need to reach a deal. \u201cWe have the basis for a ceasefire. He should move on it and they should move on it now.\u201d On Friday, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the US did not believe escalation was inevitable. \u201cI think we are being very direct in our messaging that certainly we don\u2019t want to see heightened tensions and we do believe there is an offramp here, and that is that ceasefire deal,\u201d Singh said. An Israeli delegation will travel to Cairo in coming days for negotiations to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, Netanyahu\u2019s office said on Friday. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri commented on the announcement, telling Reuters: \u201cNetanyahu does not want to stop the war and is using these empty statements to cover up his crimes and evade their consequences.\u201d Reuters, Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press contributed to this report"

            "content": "This blog is now closing. Thank you for following along. Below is a roundup of today\u2019s stories: The UK, France and Germany have said there must be \u201cno further delay\u201d in agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and called on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks against Israel that would further escalate tensions. In a joint statement released on Monday, they endorsed the latest push by the US, Qatar and Egypt to broker an agreement to end the 10-month-old war. Gaza officials told AFP on Monday that they had identified 75 bodies of Palestinians killed in a weekend strike by Israel on a school building where rescuers reported at least 93 dead. The Israeli military claimed that Saturday\u2019s pre-dawn strike on the Al-Tabieen religious school compound in Gaza City killed at least 19 Palestinian militants who were allegedly using it as a base. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the deployment of a guided missile submarine to the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region, the Pentagon said on Sunday. The moves come as the US and other allies push for Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal that could help calm soaring regional tensions after the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, for which Iran has vowed to retaliate, as well as a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s top diplomat, has said the bloc should consider sanctions in response to calls by Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister to cut off aid to Gaza, calling them an \u201cincitement to war crimes\u201d. Writing on the X platform late on Sunday, EU foreign policy chief Borrell said the recent remarks by Itamar Ben-Gvir constitute \u201cincitement to war crimes,\u201d adding that \u201csanctions must be on our EU agenda.\u201d 142 people have been killed and 150 others have been injured by Israeli strikes in Gaza in the past 48 hours, the Palestinian health ministry has said, as the overall death toll from the war nears 40,000. On Monday, the health ministry said 39,897 Palestinians have been killed and 92,152 have been injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October. Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has responded to the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who had referenced the far-right politician when calling for the consideration of sanctions against Israel on Sunday (see post at 11.09BST). Writing on X, Smotrich accused Borrell of \u201csiding with terror\u201d. Ryanair, the low-cost Irish airline, is canceling all flights to and from Ben Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv from Tuesday until 26 August \u201cdue to operational restrictions which are beyond our control.\u201d The airline did provide any further details. The Vatican has called on Iran to refrain \u201cin every way\u201d from escalating a potential conflict in the Middle East after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in Tehran last month. The Israeli government has officially declined to comment on Haniyeh\u2019s death, but the strike was widely acknowledged as an Israeli operation both inside the country and beyond. The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appealed instead for Tehran to embrace dialogue, negotiation and peace, during a phone call Monday with Iran\u2019s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian. Parolin spoke with Pezeshkian to congratulate him on the start of his mandate. According to a Vatican statement, Parolin \u201cexpressed the Holy See\u2019s serious concern about what is happening in the Middle East, reiterating the need to avoid in any way the widening of the very serious conflict under way and preferring instead dialogue, negotiation and peace.\u201d Gaza officials told AFP on Monday that they had identified 75 bodies of Palestinians killed in a weekend strike by Israel on a school building where rescuers reported at least 93 dead. The Israeli military said that Saturday\u2019s pre-dawn strike on the Al-Tabieen religious school compound in Gaza City killed at least 19 Palestinian militants who were using it as a base. AFP was unable to independently verify the toll. \u201cThere are 93 dead in the Al-Tabieen school strike, 75 of them have been identified,\u201d Gaza civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told AFP. \u201cThe others have not yet been identified because some bodies are torn and charred by the bombardment.\u201d He said the dead included 11 children and six women. Amjad Aliwa, an emergency doctor at Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, confirmed that 75 people killed in the strike had been identified. \u201cThere are still bodies (whose identities are unknown) that are completely destroyed,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cThere are also some families who have been displaced to the south (of the Gaza Strip) and cannot come to identify their loved ones.\u201d Meanwhile, Israeli news website Walla, citing the military, reported that 38 militants were killed in the strike. Asked by AFP about the report, the Israeli military said that it would respond later. Reuters reports that Israel's air force has suspended travel abroad for its service personnel, a military spokesperson said. The region is bracing for possible attacks against Israel by Iran and its allies after the killing of senior members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Safety instructions from the military for the general public remained unchanged. A hospital in southern Gaza has received the bodies of 13 people, including a child, who were killed in Israeli strikes on Khan Younis, the Associated Press reports. The strikes came as Israel has ordered mass evacuations from Gaza\u2019s second-largest city in recent days, claiming Palestinian militants are firing rockets from the area. Khan Younis suffered heavy destruction earlier this year during a major Israeli air and ground offensive. An AP journalist counted the bodies at the nearby Nasser hospital and saw funeral prayers being held Monday morning. The dead include a medic who was killed along with two others in a strike on his house, according to the hospital records. This footage from Gaza City shows the moment an Israeli airstrike hit a house in the suburb of Sheikh Radwan on Sunday. One person was killed and several others were wounded, according to Palestinian medics. According to Reuters, the cameraman who filmed the video said the Israeli army had notified people of a possible strike in the area. 142 people have been killed and 150 others have been injured by Israeli strikes in Gaza in the past 48 hours, the Palestinian health ministry has said, as the overall death toll from the war nears 40,000. On Monday, the health ministry said 39,897 Palestinians have been killed and 92,152 have been injured in Israel\u2019s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s top diplomat, has said the bloc should consider sanctions in response to calls by Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister to cut off aid to Gaza, calling them an \u201cincitement to war crimes\u201d. Writing on the X platform late on Sunday, EU foreign policy chief Borrell said the recent remarks by Itamar Ben-Gvir constitute \u201cincitement to war crimes,\u201d adding that \u201csanctions must be on our EU agenda.\u201d In his own post on X and in media interviews, Ben-Gvir said that instead of agreeing to a potential ceasefire deal, Israel should block the entry of humanitarian aid and fuel to Gaza until Hamas releases all of the hostages, saying that doing so would bring the militant group to its knees. Ben-Gvir has also repeatedly called for Israel to permanently reoccupy Gaza, rebuild Jewish settlements there and encourage the \u201cvoluntary\u201d migration of Palestinians from the territory. Ben-Gvir, a key member of prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, has threatened to bring the government down if it makes too many concessions in the ceasefire talks. Borrell called on Israel\u2019s government to \u201cunequivocally distance itself from these incitements to commit war crimes,\u201d and to engage \u201cin good faith\u201d with ceasefire negotiations mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt. The overseers of the Geneva conventions, the core of international humanitarian law that seeks to protect civilians, detainees and wounded soldiers in war, have said they are being \u201cdisregarded\u201d and have called on the world to recommit to the framework on its 75th anniversary. The Geneva conventions, which have been adopted by nearly all the world\u2019s countries since they were finalised on 12 August 1949, are back on their heels as armed militia groups and national forces regularly disregard the rules of war. \u201cInternational humanitarian law is under strain, disregarded, undermined to justify violence,\u201d president Mirjana Spoljaric of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which oversees the conventions, said on Monday. \u201cThe world must recommit to this robust protective framework for armed conflict, one that follows the premise of protecting life instead of justifying death,\u201d she said. The conventions, with roots dating to the 19th century, aims to set rules around the conduct of war: they ban torture and sexual violence, require humane treatment of detainees and mandate searches for missing persons. The conventions \u201creflect a global consensus that all wars have limits,\u201d Spoljaric told reporters at ICRC headquarters in Geneva. \u201cThe dehumanization of both enemy fighters and civilian populations is a path to ruin and disaster.\u201d The Red Cross says the conventions are needed now more than ever: It has counted more than 120 active conflicts around the world, a six-fold increase from the half-century anniversary in 1999. These days, many countries and combatants exploit loopholes in international humanitarian law or interpret it as they see fit. Hospitals, schools and ambulances have come under fire, aid workers and civilians are killed, and countries refuse access to detainees. Iran has the \u201cright to an appropriate and deterrent response\u201d against Israel to ensure regional stability, the country\u2019s acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani told his Chinese counterpart on Monday, Reuters reports, citing state media. Designated humanitarian zones in Khan Younis are shrinking, Al Jazeera reports, as Israel goes ahead with another military operation in the city. On Saturday night, Israel expanded evacuation orders in Khan Younis, forcing tens of thousands of Palestinian residents and displaced families to leave in the dark as explosions from tank shelling reverberated around them. Hani Mahmoud, reporting from the ground in Khan Younis for Al Jazeera, said: Here, the ongoing mass evacuation is causing a great deal of difficult living conditions as people are pushed into a smaller area after the Israeli military cut off part of the humanitarian zone and included it in the red zone. The Hamad residential complex, that is in the western part of Khan Younis, which used to be part of the humanitarian zones, was designated in the past months as an area for people to shelter in. But not any more. This has shrunk the humanitarian zones in the western part of Khan Younis city and other areas, just causing further difficult living conditions in an area already overcrowded and running out of space. People don\u2019t have basic necessities or basic supplies to cope and sustain their lives in these unusually difficult living conditions. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia France have again extended the suspension of their flights to Beirut, through Wednesday 15 August, because of continued tensions in the region, the Associated Press reports. The flights have been suspended since 29 July because of the \"security situation in Lebanon\" and their resumption \"will be subject to a new assessment of the situation on the ground\", Air France said in a statement. The airline said \"the safety of its clients and crews are its absolute priority\". Clients with reservations for flights before 18 August can annul or modify their trips without cost. Numerous international companies have ceased serving Beirut over fears of a military escalation between Israel and Hezbollah. However, Air France said it continues to operate its flights to Tel Aviv even though some international carriers, such as Italy\u2019s ITA, have suspended their flights until at least 15 August. The UK, France and Germany have said there must be \u201cno further delay\u201d in agreeing to a ceasefire in Gaza and called on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks against Israel that would further escalate tensions. In a joint statement released on Monday, they endorsed the latest push by the US, Qatar and Egypt to broker an agreement to end the 10-month-old war. The mediators have spent months trying to get the sides to agree to a three-phase plan in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel and Israel would withdraw from Gaza. \u201cWe agree that there can be no further delay. We have been working with all parties to prevent escalation and will spare no effort to reduce tensions and find a path to stability. \u201cThe fighting must end now, and all hostages still detained by Hamas must be released. The people of Gaza need urgent and unfettered delivery and distribution of aid.,\u201d the statement said. It was signed by French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Olaf Scholz and British prime minister Keir Starmer. The statement also called on Iran and its allies to refrain from any retaliatory attacks that would further escalate regional tensions after the killing of two senior militants last month in Beirut and Tehran. Hello and welcome to today's blog. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the deployment of a guided missile submarine to the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region, the Pentagon said on Sunday. Austin also ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group, equipped with F-35 fighters, to accelerate its deployment to the Middle East, the Pentagon said in a statement. The moves come as the US and other allies push for Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal that could help calm soaring regional tensions after the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, for which Iran has vowed to retaliate, as well as a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut. Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant spoke on Sunday with Austin and told him Iran\u2019s military preparations suggested Iran was getting ready for a large-scale attack on Israel, Axios reporter Barak Ravid posted on X, citing a source. Iran\u2019s official news agency said on Sunday that its elite Revolutionary Guards were holding a military drill in the country\u2019s west that would continue until Tuesday. The drills, which started on Friday, were ongoing in the province of Kermanshah, close to the border with Iraq, to \u201cenhance combat readiness and vigilance\u201d, an armed forces official told IRNA. In other developments: Hamas has urged Gaza mediators to implement a ceasefire plan presented by US president Joe Biden instead of holding more talks. International mediators had invited Israel and the Palestinian militant group to resume talks towards a long-sought truce and hostage-release deal, amid the growing fears of a wider regional conflict. Israel has accepted the invitation from the US, Qatar and Egypt for a round of talks planned for Thursday. However, Hamas said on Sunday it wanted the implementation of a truce plan laid out by Biden on 31 May and later endorsed by the UN security council, \u201crather than going through more negotiation rounds or new proposals\u201d. An Israeli was killed and another wounded by Palestinian gunmen who opened fire on a main road in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, Israel\u2019s ambulance service and military said, with the armed wing of militant faction Hamas claiming responsibility. The Israeli military said it was pursuing the suspected assailants, blocking routes and conducting searches. Later on Sunday, Hamas\u2019 al-Qassam Brigades said its West Bank-based fighters killed an Israeli soldier at point-blank range in the Mehola settlement in the West Bank\u2019s Jordan Valley and \u201creturned to their bases safely\u201d. Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah said an Israeli airstrike killed two of the group\u2019s fighters in Taybeh village on Sunday, with the health ministry reporting another death from an attack days ago. The Israeli military said it struck several Hezbollah military structures throughout Sunday. Separately, the health ministry said a Lebanese man who succumbed to injuries sustained in an Israeli strike \u201cseveral days ago\u201d on the southern village of Beit Lif was a Hezbollah fighter, not a civilian as earlier reported. Hezbollah said that overnight into Monday it launched salvos of rockets \u201cin response\u201d to the Israeli fire, targeting troops in northern Israel. Thousands of people have fled Khan Younis after the Israeli military warned of a new operation to flush out Hamas militants that it says have regrouped in the southern Gaza city. In al-Jala, a neighbourhood in the city\u2019s south that the Israel military had previously designated a humanitarian zone, residents on Sunday packed their belongings, uncertain where to seek refuge. Israel said rockets had been fired from the area. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, posted on X: \u201cThe people of Gaza are trapped &amp; have nowhere to go. Just in the past few days, more than 75,000 people have been displaced in southwest Gaza.\u201d The US vice-president, Kamala Harris, said \u201cyet again far too many civilians\u201d had been killed, after Israeli strikes on a school site in northern Gaza killed at least 80 people on Saturday. \u201cI mean, Israel has a right to go after the terrorists that are Hamas,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as I have said many, many times, they also have, I believe, an important responsibility to avoid civilian casualties.\u201d The European Union\u2019s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said there was \u201cno justification\u201d for the attack on the Gaza City school, while the White House said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about it. Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia condemned the attack. A spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, urged the US to \u201cput an end to the blind support that leads to the killing of thousands of innocent civilians, including children, women and the elderly\u201d. The Israeli military acknowledged Saturday\u2019s strike on the al-Tabeen school, claiming it hit a Hamas command centre within the school and that it had taken steps to reduce the risk of harming civilians. Hamas denied having a base at the school. An airstrike on a vehicle in eastern Syria near the porous border with Iraq killed at least five fighters from pro-Iran units, two security sources in the region told Reuters. One of the sources said the strike was carried out by a drone, but could not specify which military the drone belonged to. The second source said it targeted fighters as they changed shifts at a checkpoint, Reuters reported."

            "date": "2024-08-14T16:05:22Z",
            "content": "The German armed forces are investigating the suspected sabotage of one of their military bases amid suspicions that it was broken into and the water supply system contaminated. The defence ministry confirmed on Wednesday that state security was investigating the reported attack after suspicions of attempted or actual entry, as well as sabotage, at the Cologne-Wahn barracks, just outside Cologne. The parliamentary defence committee was informed about a \u201cserious indication\u201d of sabotage, a ministry spokesperson added. Suspicions were raised on Tuesday night at the major military base close to Cologne-Bonn airport, which houses airfields and other barracks, where one or several people are thought to have broken in and tampered with the water supply pipes. The base was sealed off on Wednesday morning, with no one allowed to enter or leave. There had been reports of abnormalities in the water, a spokesperson confirmed, without giving more detail. Elsewhere, a Nato base outside the German town of Geilenkirchen faced an attempted trespassing incident on Tuesday, with the military alliance saying a person had been stopped while trying to enter the base. Police were investigating the incident. A spokesperson for the base denied earlier media reports that it had been sealed off. Like much of the rest of Europe, Germany is on high alert after a spate of arson attacks, espionage and attacks on infrastructure often blamed on Russia as it finds different ways of fighting its war with the west away from the battlefield in Ukraine. Lt Col Ulrich Fonrobert, a spokesperson for the military in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, said the armed forces were taking the incidents very seriously. \u201cLast night there was an incident at the barracks. This incident has led to the barracks having been shut since then,\u201d he said outside the base. He said the alarm had been raised after a report of \u201cabnormal water values\u201d, but did not elaborate except to say an analysis of the base\u2019s drinking water was being carried out. The base was reopened at about midday. A spokesperson for the defence ministry said that state security had been informed, and that no one had been harmed. Security guards were alerted on Tuesday night to a person fleeing the Cologne-Wahn base, after electronic sensors on the waterworks on the site were triggered, but they were unable to apprehend the person. A hole was later discovered in a fence. A message broadcast to everyone at the base warned personnel to address any \u201cunknown person they see\u201d and to \u201creport any suspicious behaviour\u201d. An internal memo urgently warned solders and civilian forces against drinking from the water supply and from showering. Military police secured forensic evidence at the water supply works. According to Spiegel magazine, members of the military airport police stationed at the base had filed several reports of gastrointestinal complaints, though it is unclear whether this was connected to the reported act of sabotage. The magazine said the Cologne-Wahn base was home to several command authorities as well as military and civilian departments of the Bundeswehr which employs 4,300 members of the armed forces and 1,200 civilians. The Ministry of Defence department for coordinating air transport for politicians is also headquartered there. It is an important hub for the west\u2019s military support for Ukraine. Ukrainian military personnel being trained in Germany regularly use it as a base from which to return home via Poland."

            "title": "Walz attacked by Trump but military record shows honorable service",
            "date": "2024-08-16T18:00:36Z",
            "content": "Al Bonnifield was an armorer for the 1st Battalion, 125 Field Artillery, when then Command Sergeant Major Tim Walz buttonholed a couple of the guys on drill in 2005 at the national guard unit in New Ulm, Minnesota, to talk about whether he should retire to run for Congress or not. \u201cI was in that room,\u201d Bonnifield said. \u201cGovernor Walz is a very hard person to figure out. He\u2019s all game until something like this comes up, and then he\u2019s, \u2018Well, what should I do?\u2019\u201d It was a fateful moment, he said. The decision to run, which has led to his ascent as the Democratic nominee for vice-president, seems dramatic in retrospect, like a scene from a movie. It has also led to accusations of shirking duty and even stolen valor by Trump-supporting opponents who claim he retired because he knew his unit would be deploying to Iraq. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, he made the right decision in retiring and going to Congress,\u201d Bonnifield said. \u201cAt the time he retired, we hadn\u2019t gotten alert notice. We had no notice other than \u2018this could happen.\u2019 It could have, may not have. So when he made the decision, there were a lot of other people that did at the same time, and why everyone was picking on him for retiring, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Walz has criticized those who denigrate another person\u2019s service record. \u201cAnyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words. Thank you for your service and sacrifice.\u201d JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate and a Marine Corps veteran, responded to thank Walz for his service, but said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have lied about it. You shouldn\u2019t have said you went to war when you didn\u2019t. Nor should you have said that you didn\u2019t know your unit was going to Iraq.\u201d Neither of those accusations are fundamentally true. Walz\u2019s military record shows 24 years of honorable service in a variety of roles. According to a synopsis of service records obtained from the Minnesota national guard, Walz enlisted in the army national guard two days after turning 17 and trained as an 11B \u2013 a military occupational specialty for an army infantryman, the most ubiquitous job in the army. Four years later while in college in Houston, Walz transferred to a Texas army national guard unit. Walz was reclassified as a 13B, a field artillery cannon crew member. While in Nebraska, Walz served as an 11Z, the designation for an infantry senior sergeant typically held by an infantryman serving as the first sergeant of a company or in a senior battalion staff role. He also served in the 71L MOS as an administrative specialist. According to the Minnesota national guard, Walz joined the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery after transferring from the Nebraska national guard in 1996. He served as a cannon crewmember and as a 13Z \u2013 cannon senior sergeant, the MOS held by a master sergeant of rank E-8 serving as a first sergeant for a field artillery battery or staff roles at the battalion level. The 125th Field Artillery provides artillery support to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat team. It has three batteries, each of which has six M-109 self-propelled 155mm howitzers, along with a headquarters and support unit. Walz\u2019s uniform would bear three racks of ribbons for his service. Most are common awards for a soldier of his rank. The Army Service Ribbon is given to every soldier, for example. Walz has an Army Reserve Components Achievement Medal with five oakleaf clusters. Each cluster represents three additional years of continuous service after the first award. The Noncommissioned Officer Professional Ribbon with numeral 3 denotes his completion of training schools for ranks E-5 \u2013 sergeant \u2013 through E-8 \u2013 master sergeant. He has an Army Achievement Medal with one oakleaf cluster, indicating two awards. National guard troops can be called to active duty service in times of emergency by the governor of the state in which they serve, or to service in times of war. Historically, such call-ups had been rare, but the tempo of reserve component operations increased substantially during and after the Gulf war and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Doug Julin, a retired sergeant major who was the senior enlisted adviser at the brigade level \u2013 one step above the battalion level \u2013 at the time of Walz\u2019s retirement, said in an interview. \u201cThe big frustration was that he let his troops down.\u201d Two people who served with Walz penned a letter in 2018, challenging Walz\u2019s characterization of his service and accusing him of shirking his duty to his unit. The men suggested that Walz knew he would be deploying and wanted out of it. The timeline of his retirement suggests otherwise: Walz retired months before the unit was given a formal order to be called to active duty service. Julin suggested that he should have been consulted when Walz filed his retirement paperwork, but legally he wasn\u2019t in a position to prevent the retirement, which is entirely a personnel matter. Walz has repeatedly referenced his service when calling for a ban on military-style rifles from being available to civilians over the course of his years in Congress and in the Minnesota governor\u2019s mansion. In one instance, he described having carried a weapon of war \u201cin war\u201d, for which he subsequently apologized as a misstatement. Trump campaign surrogates insist this and statements he has made describing himself as a retired command sergeant major constitutes \u201cstolen valor\u201d. By the legal definitions, they do not. It is a federal misdemeanor to falsely represent oneself as having received any US military decoration or medal in order to obtain money, property, or other tangible benefit. Nonetheless, the campaign has been scrubbing references to Walz as a retired command sergeant major, replacing them with phrases indicating he served at that rank but did not retire with it. The accusation is gross, said Jacob Thomas, an air force and air force reserve veteran and communications director for Common Defense, a progressive activist group for veterans. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we shouldn\u2019t be doing without kind of real, hard facts of stolen valor. And you know, it\u2019s a serious, a serious thing \u2026 It feels a little gross to kind of be having to go back and ask these people all that and kind of thrust them into this political argument.\u201d The politicization of Walz\u2019s service is equally disturbing, he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing from our members is, most people don\u2019t care about what you did in the service, or what your exact job was, or where you got stationed, or anything like that,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe care that you served, that you raised your right hand and that you did what was asked of you, and it\u2019s clear from Walz\u2019s record that that\u2019s exactly what he did.\u201d Two of Walz\u2019s awards \u2013 the Army Commendation Medal and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal \u2013 have the \u201cM\u201d device for mobilization, denoting active-duty service after an involuntary or volunteer mobilization. He also has a Reserve Components Overseas Training Ribbon with a bronze 4 device, indicating four separate instances of training overseas for more than 10 days. Walz also has a Global War on Terrorism medal. The Minnesota national guard said it was unclear if it was the service medal issued to anyone serving for 30 continuous (or 60 non-continuous) days on active duty after September 11, or the expeditionary medal for soldiers who deployed overseas in support of one of the nine designated operations. Walz deployed in a support role to Italy and Turkey in August 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, returning from Vicenza in April 2004, said Army Lt Col Kristen Aug\u00e9, Minnesota national guard\u2019s state public affairs officer. This would appear to qualify him for the expeditionary award. Walz was promoted to command sergeant major of the battalion \u2013 an E-9 rank. Army regulation 600-8-19 requires soldiers who do not finish the sergeants major course to revert back to their prior rank. The first two phases of the course are conducted online in distance learning, while the third phase is conducted in-person at the Sergeants Major Academy. Walz retired before attending the academy. \u201cWhen a service member reaches 20 years of service, they can submit a request to retire even if there is time remaining on their enlisted contractual agreement,\u201d said Army Col Scott Rohweder, Minnesota national guard\u2019s joint chief of staff. \u2018Their request is reviewed and must be approved by leadership.\u201d Walz\u2019s retirement is standard fare and similar to the attacks to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign that waylaid John Kerry\u2019s bid for the presidency in 2004, said Mike Lavigne, a retired army sergeant major and spokesman for VoteVets, a progressive veterans organization. \u201cAll these people that are connected with the Minnesota national guard have an ax to grind,\u201d Lavigne said, noting how two of the people who have been critical of Walz from the unit have social media accounts dripping with rightwing invective. \u201cIt\u2019s got nothing to do with army service. It\u2019s got nothing to do with the army values. It\u2019s all politics. \u201cIf you do 20 years and a day and you reach retirement eligibility, you have done much more than many,\u201d Lavigne said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no shame in the game in dropping your papers and walking and moving on with your life after 20 years of service. Twenty-four years of service is beyond the pale. The argument that comes from the people who are attacking him right now is disingenuous at best, absolutely dishonest at worst.\u201d Bonnifield, the retired sergeant and fateful confidant from Walz\u2019s unit, has received hate mail from some people since speaking about Walz, he said. He was invited by his old sergeant major to go to Chicago next week to appear at the Democratic national convention. Bonnifield declined. A video made by the campaign describing his conversation will go in his stead, he said."

            "date": "2024-08-21T14:23:15Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has approved a US nuclear strategy to prepare for possible coordinated nuclear confrontations with Russia, China and North Korea, according to a New York Times report on Tuesday. On Tuesday, the White House said the president approved the plan earlier this year and it was not a response to a single country or threat. The spokesperson Sean Savett said that while \u201cthe specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat.\u201d The Times reported that the deterrent policy takes into account a rapid buildup of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which will rival the size and diversity of the US and Russian stockpiles over the next decade. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. China\u2019s foreign ministry on Wednesday said that it was \u201cseriously concerned\u201d by the reports and accused the US of \u201cstirring up the so-called \u2018China nuclear threat theory\u2019\u201d. Mao Ning, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said that China had a \u201cno-first-use\u201d policy for nuclear weapons and said that the US was a bigger nuclear threat. According to research by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China had an estimated 500 nuclear warheads in January, up from 410 in January 2023. The US and Russia have more than 5,000 warheads each. But China\u2019s arsenal is thought to be expanding at a much faster pace than any other country\u2019s. The US-based Arms Control Association said it understood US nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration\u2019s 2022 nuclear posture review, and there had been no reorientation away from Russia and toward China. Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while US intelligence estimates suggested China might increase the size of its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia currently had about 4,000 nuclear warheads \u201cand it remains the major driver behind US nuclear strategy\u201d. Biden approved the revised strategy \u2013 called the nuclear employment guidance \u2013 in March, according to the Times, but an unclassified notification of the policy change has not yet been presented to Congress. After years of nuclear arms reduction efforts, the administration has been signalling willingness to expand the US arsenal to counter China and Russia\u2019s nuclear strategies more recently. In February, the US warned allies that Russia could be planning to put a nuclear weapon into space. On Tuesday, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army, Zhou Bo, published a piece in Foreign Policy arguing that the US and China could still cooperate on nuclear diplomacy. Zhou said that \u201cit is impossible for Beijing to stand by idly\u201d in the face of deteriorating relations between Russia and the US, but that there was space to strengthen the policies governing the control of nuclear weapons stockpiles. Zhou argued that nuclear-armed states should declare a \u201cno first use\u201d policy, as so far only China and India have done. On Tuesday, the Times reported that two senior administration officials had earlier been permitted to allude to the revision in US nuclear strategy without disclosing its existence. In June, Pranay Vaddi, a senior director of the national security council, warned that \u201cabsent a change\u201d in nuclear strategy by China and Russia, the US was prepared to shift from modernisation of existing weapons to expanding its arsenal. Vaddi also alluded to the highly classified document, saying it emphasised \u201cthe need to deter Russia, the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] and North Korea simultaneously\u201d. The last major nuclear arms control agreement with Russia, New Start, which sets limits on intercontinental-range nuclear weapons, expires in early 2026 with no subsequent agreement in place. China and Russia are now more politically and economically aligned. Last month, Chinese and Russian long-range bombers patrolled together near Alaska for the first time and held live-fire exercises in the South China Sea. The second US administration official permitted to refer to the document, Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear strategist who served in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden had \u201cissued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries\u201d and for \u201cthe significant increase in the size and diversity\u201d of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \u201cIt is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,\u201d the Times quoted Narang as saying. \u201cIt is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter-century after the cold war as nuclear intermission.\u201d"

            "title": "Putin\u2019s war is raising risk of another Chernobyl, says historian who inspired hit TV show",
            "date": "2024-08-25T13:00:05Z",
            "content": "There are, Serhii Plokhy says, not many amusing stories to come out of the war between Russia and his native Ukraine. But he couldn\u2019t help but have the bleakest of laughs at one item of news from the last week. It was prompted by a statement from the Russian foreign ministry. Faced with the prospect of Ukrainian forces advancing across the border towards a Russian nuclear power station in Kursk, the ministry called for urgent intervention from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Given Russia\u2019s conduct over the last two years \u2013 shelling and seizing the Ukrainian power station at Zaporizhzhia by force, and for a time occupying the contaminated site at Chernobyl with total disregard for the risks involved, the ironies were too brutal even for him. Plokhy, the celebrated Harvard historian, is the author of the definitive account not only of the genesis of the current war but also of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster (for which he won the Baillie Gifford prize for nonfiction in 2018, and which was one source for the fabulous HBO drama of the disaster the following year). His new book, Chernobyl Roulette, published with urgent timing next month, is an inside account of how nuclear power facilities have become a terrifying element of the current battlefield. It details, with professorial care, and the intermittent pace of a thriller, exactly what happened after Russian forces entered the Chernobyl exclusion zone in the first week of the invasion in February 2022, trapping more than 100 workers inside the plant for nearly five weeks, until it was liberated by Ukraine. In many ways Plokhy was fated to tell this story. The historian was born in the shadow of Zaporizhzhia, and a few hundred miles downwind of Chernobyl (he was 19 at the time of the disaster). He left Ukraine in 1991 to teach in Canada \u2013 four months that coincided with the failed coup in Moscow that precipitated the final collapse of the Soviet Union and Ukraine\u2019s independence. Much of his writing since then, he told me on an online call last week, with a laugh, has been an attempt to understand \u201cexactly what happened in the four months of my sabbatical\u201d. The current book is the latest instalment of that vocation. You read it with mounting unease, not least because the chaotic events he describes are playing out in real time. On the day that we speak the BBC is leading its bulletins with reports of a major fire at Zaporizhzhia, a reactor complex very similar to the archaic plant at Chernobyl. Plokhy\u2019s book details how up until now the IAEA has been powerless in mitigating these threats \u2013 and makes the argument that \u201cuntil we find out how to protect the existing nuclear power plants, we have no business at all in building new ones.\u201d Counterintuitively he believes that the current threat in Kursk offers a small window of hope. \u201cNow that even Russia is pointing the finger at the IAEA there is maybe an opportunity,\u201d he says, \u201cto look at how basically unprepared we are to deal with a nuclear crisis within a war, when facilities that were envisioned as atoms for peace become atoms for war.\u201d The fact that Russia has invited Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, to visit its Kursk facility next week provides tentative support to this idea (though Grossi\u2019s pre-visit assessment that it \u201cis a Chernobyl-type plant\u201d in which the \u201c[nuclear] fuel elements\u201d are housed \u201cin something like a sports hall\u201d adds to the alarm.) \u201cWhat is coming out of Russia for now is just rhetoric,\u201d Plokhy says. \u201cBut the time may come when it is more than just an attempt to blame somebody else \u2013 and perhaps new protocols can be discussed.\u201d His account of the monumental hubris of the Russian occupation of Chernobyl might serve as Exhibit A in the need for such controls. \u201cThe words that I would use are \u2018extreme recklessness\u2019,\u201d he says of that operation. \u201cA total disregard for human health and human life. And from that point of view, it shows very little has changed since 1986 in terms of Russian [political] culture.\u201d As his original book \u2013 and the primary basis of the TV drama, Svetlana Alexiyevech\u2019s Voices from Chernobyl \u2013 showed that apocalypse was the result not only of antiquated technology but of a command and control system that fatally prioritised party politics over science and health and safety. Plokhy suggests that Putin\u2019s regime has learned nothing from that disaster. \u201cThere is this episode from the current conflict which demonstrates the extent of their recklessness,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile they occupied the site the Russian army began digging trenches, in the exclusion zone at the edge of the Red Forest\u201d. The evidence suggests that conscripted troops, without any protective clothing or equipment, blithely excavated some of the most toxic radioactive land on earth. The other pivotal scene in the current book involves the extraordinary moment when the commanders of Russian forces entered the operations room of the Chernobyl plant. Their plan was to take into custody the safety experts and scientists who monitored the plant, without any apparent contingency for what came next. Plokhy describes how the power balance in that room quickly shifted as the people in charge of the plant coolly observed that if they handed over control, they also handed over the enormous responsibility and risks of keeping Chernobyl safe. \u201cThat scene was amazing,\u201d Plokhy says. \u201cMy surprise on revisiting Chernobyl after 1986 was not only to see how much Russia hadn\u2019t changed in its approach. But also to see how much Ukraine had departed from that culture of 1986. The people in charge of the site put their faith in the regulations and protocols. They believed they would be traitors if they abandoned the station.\u201d The scene, I suggest, would make a fitting sequel to the televised Chernobyl drama. Plokhy agrees. \u201cThe 1986 story was of the catastrophe, and catastrophes normally attract more attention. Catastrophe did not happen this time. Instead though, it\u2019s a phenomenal story, if you like, of the kidnapped kidnapping the kidnappers.\u201d The Russian army came and took hostages, and hostages immediately turned their expertise back against them. In order to tell that story, Plokhy was given access to the testimonies of those involved on the Ukrainian side, collected after liberation. \u201cChernobyl obviously has a special importance and meaning worldwide, and particularly in Ukraine,\u201d he says, \u201cso there were a lot of people who immediately went into the zone to collect this information. I was really very lucky that what is called the reckoning project allowed me to use those materials. My task was really to make sense out of it all.\u201d Obviously, he had a personal stake in all this; how easy was it for him to be objective? \u201cWell, I made the decision that while writing the last book, The Russo-Ukrainian War, that I had a mission, to tell the story of those people.\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I know that to be effective in this mission, I had to push aside emotions, or not allow them to dominate. I tried wherever I could to use Russian sources, but inevitably most came from the Ukrainian side. Still, in the back of my mind, constantly, I was thinking: \u2018OK, be careful in what you say. You don\u2019t have all the sources.\u2019\u201d Plokhy had family in Zaporizhzhia when the war started. His previous book was dedicated and paid tribute to his cousin, who was killed in fighting near Bakhmut in October 2022. Are other family members still there? \u201cMy sister was in Zaporizhzhia for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to leave and we were trying to persuade her, and eventually we managed to do that. Fortunately when the Russians took over the nuclear power plant, she was already on the way out.\u201d Is he getting information from on the ground now? \u201cPeople there have to be very careful,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re have been many [Russian] arrests of people reporting information to their families. So, no, I don\u2019t have that access. For example, like everyone, I read what Russians and Ukrainians are saying about this latest fire in Zaporizhzhia. I basically think that Ukrainians are probably telling the story that is closer to the truth: that because of what is happening in Kursk, the Russians were interested in staging something and [creating alarm by] burning tyres there. But I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d That high-stakes standoff makes the case for his wider point that the world isn\u2019t paying enough attention to the scale of the nuclear threat. Does he feel like a Cassandra \u2013 drawing attention to imminent disaster, but with nobody properly listening? \u201cYes, I have this feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I understand that there are good reasons for people to look the other way. One of them was also produced by the war, after sanctions on Russian oil and gas. \u201cSome people want to see nuclear energy as the saviour, not only in the long term because of climate change, but also in the short term, economically. Despite what is happening, the last two years have seen the most positive stories about nuclear energy since before the Fukushima disaster [in 2011].\u201d War is not the only thing which is highlighting the threats to greater international co-operation on nuclear safety. Obviously Plokhy is watching these events unfold in an American election year. A second Trump presidency would no doubt jeopardise Ukraine\u2019s independent future as well as further undermining UN authority. How does he view that prospect? \u201cIt won\u2019t surprise you,\u201d he says, \u201cthat I look at that with horror not just [at Trump] but more about how his sort of political behaviour can be embraced by so many of my now compatriots.\u201d And what of the other major variable in the horrific conflict. Does he sense that Putin\u2019s internal power is waning at all? \u201cKursk is a massive challenge to his narrative,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is still certainly fear of Putin in the west. But historically there was less fear in Ukraine, and still is.\u201d One way of looking at the war, he says, is \u201cPutin marching from one failure to another\u201d. That fact brings with it other threats. \u201cWe should remember Churchill\u2019s cold war speech about the balance of terror,\u201d Plokhy insists. \u201cIt was that fear [of mutual destruction] that helped the world to avoid cataclysm during the cold war. But I would say the balance of terror is now of a more complicated nature. That unpredictability is what makes this time so dangerous.\u201d Despite everything, however, he is not without hope that a new consensus can be formed. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Plokhy says, \u201c[nuclear power] is the place where we can start creating that consensus. Perhaps the lesson of 2022 is that this is the moment that should be seized on to talk about the security of the nuclear sites and then build on that for the future.\u201d If that is the case, then his book would be a good place for those discussions to start."

            "content": "Police are investigating an alleged death threat sent to Amanda Abbington, demanding the actor withdraw her complaint about the dancer Giovanni Pernice. In recent weeks Abbington has spoken out about her experience on the last series of Strictly Come Dancing, where she was paired with the Italian before quitting in week five of the competition. According to the Sun, the Sherlock star was sent an email warning her she would \u201cdie on stage\u201d unless she retracted her complaint about Pernice, who left the show before the upcoming season. Citing \u201cmedical\u201d and \u201cpersonal\u201d reasons at the time, the actor went on to make a complaint about the teaching methods of her former dance partner, alleging she was subjected to \u201cinappropriate, mean, nasty bullying\u201d while on the show. Abbington told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour that while there were \u201cpockets of times\u201d when she got along with Pernice, an ultimately tumultuous relationship prompted her to raise the alarm. \u201cI decided to just speak to the producers about it and say: \u2018Look, I\u2019m not comfortable. This is beginning to slightly get out of hand. And it\u2019s a repeat pattern, it starts well, and then it starts to descend into chaos\u2019.\u201d She also spoke about receiving extreme online abuse after making the complaint against Pernice. This abuse, which included death and rape threats, made her fearful of using public transport. Abbington is now starring in When It Happens to You at the Park theatre in Finsbury Park, north London, and police said they were called to a theatre in the area on Friday afternoon. A statement from the Metropolitan police to PA Media said: \u201cPolice were called at around 4pm on Friday August 2 by a staff member at a theatre in Finsbury Park following receipt of an alleged malicious communication. \u201cThere have been no arrests, inquiries are ongoing.\u201d Abbington is the not the only former partner of Pernice who has made allegations about his behaviour. Laura Whitmore, who took part in the 2016 series, said she felt \u201cextremely uncomfortable with him\u201d and \u201ccried every day\u201d. And Ranvir Singh said of her experience in 2020: \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by his angelic face. He\u2019s a fiery Italian, super-strict. I\u2019m a bit scared of him.\u201d The 33-year-old Sicilian has rejected \u201cany suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour\u201d, and believes he will be cleared by a BBC review. Abbington\u2019s representatives and the theatre have been approached for comment."

            "date": "2024-08-19T04:00:50Z",
            "content": "A vulnerable unpaid carer threatened by benefits officials with prosecution for fraud unless she agreed to pay a \u00a31,300 penalty for an accidental breach of carer\u2019s allowance earnings rules has described her experience as \u201clike blackmail\u201d. Clemency Jacques, a carer for her disabled son, was told by Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) investigators her case would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unless she paid a 50% charge on top of an existing agreement to repay \u00a32,600 in carer\u2019s allowance overpayments \u2013 a total of \u00a33,900. Jacques, 43, a former NHS psychologist who cares for her severely disabled son and frail elderly mother, said she was threatened with prosecution even though the DWP accepted she had made an \u201cunintentional error\u201d. Her treatment was condemned as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and \u201cinhumane\u201d by politicians and campaigners amid growing concern over the DWP\u2019s policy of prosecuting \u2013 or threatening with prosecution \u2013 carers who unwittingly breach carer\u2019s allowance benefit earnings rules by relatively minor amounts. \u201cAgreeing to the administrative penalty feels more like blackmail than an actual choice. It\u2019s like: \u2018Say how naughty you have been and pay us a large chunk of money or we will send you to court and punish you for being a stressed-out carer,\u2019\u201d Jacques said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, who is a carer for his disabled teenage son, said: \u201cThe fact the government is forcing carers to chose between an expensive fine or a criminal record, just for making an innocent mistake, is a disgrace. \u201cThis is all part of the legacy left to Labour by the Conservative party, who failed carers again and again and treated them like criminals.\u201d The DWP said it was reviewing Jacques\u2019s case \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. The government last month promised a wider review of carer\u2019s allowance following a Guardian investigation that revealed that tens of thousands of unpaid carers were repaying more than \u00a3250m in overpayments that in many cases had been allowed to accumulate because of years of DWP administrative failures. Carer\u2019s allowance, worth \u00a381.90 a week, is claimed by just under a million unpaid carers in the UK who look after disabled, frail and ill loved ones for at least 35 hours a week. Most are women and a high proportion are in poverty. Jacques\u2019s case was taken up earlier this year by her then MP, Caroline Lucas, who asked the DWP to review its decision. Lucas described Jacques\u2019s treatment by officials as \u201cdisproportionate and inhumane\u201d and argued they had failed to take into account \u201cthe exceptional and extenuating circumstances\u201d of her situation. Jacques, a single mother, said at the time of the overpayments she was overwhelmed by looking after her severely disabled toddler son, Alex, who had been born prematurely and needed constant care, while also caring for her mother who had Alzheimer\u2019s. Jacques herself had post-traumatic stress related to birth complications and was attempting to move back into work after maternity leave. Responding to Lucas in May, the DWP complaints team stood by its decision, saying it had followed the correct processes and taken \u201creasonable, necessary and proportionate\u201d actions. It said it was not its intention \u201cto cause claimants any undue distress\u201d but had a \u201cresponsibility to protect public funds and preserve public trust\u201d. Jacques told the Guardian she had been \u201cpetrified\u201d by the DWP\u2019s treatment of her for what she said was an unwitting oversight made during a period when she was under extreme stress. \u201cWhat is most frustrating is that I didn\u2019t claim fraudulently. I was most definitely a carer twice over. I didn\u2019t fake or overstate my situation,\u201d she said. Under carer\u2019s allowance earnings rules, claimants must pay back the entire \u00a381.90 a week benefit if they earn more than the \u00a3151 a week earnings limit, even by a penny. These have been criticised as \u201cperverse\u201d, plunging carers into financial hardship and ill health after they unwittingly ran up huge overpayments. In Jacques\u2019s case, the DWP would have been alerted immediately by HMRC that she had returned to paid work and was earning above the limit, but it did not act, allowing her overpayments to build to a size where prosecution for fraud became a possibility. The Guardian can reveal the DWP has levied more than \u00a35m in additional fines on thousands of carers in the past four years relating to earnings rule breaches, on top of clawing back at least \u00a3250m in carer\u2019s allowance overpayments. These comprise \u00a3420,000 from administrative penalties such as the one paid by Jacques \u2013 225 claimants have paid these since 2020 to prevent their case from being passed to the CPS \u2013 and \u00a34.8m in more routine civil penalties of \u00a350, levied on at least 98,000 carers deemed to have breached earnings rules over the same four-year period. Dominic Carter, the director of policy at Carers Trust, said: \u201cSadly, we have heard of plenty of examples like this. It\u2019s frustrating that so many carers continue to fall foul of a system not fit for the present day. Carers shouldn\u2019t be made to feel like criminals, they should be recognised for the contribution they make to society and to the taxpayer.\u201d Katy Styles, the founder of We Care Campaign, a grassroots network for unpaid carers, said: \u201cThreatening to criminalise unpaid carers over genuine and understandable errors related to carer\u2019s allowance earnings rules is a disproportionate response, and it\u2019s shocking that we continue to hear these stories. Where is the compassion?\u201d Official data shows that 119 carer\u2019s allowance cases have gone to court in the last two years after being referred to the CPS by the DWP. A trawl through local newspaper reports and court data suggests scores of unpaid carers have criminal records after being prosecuted for inadvertent earnings-related breaches."

Although scientists knew that pollution and warmer water damage life in freshwater they had not realised the combination of the two further hastens the destruction of much aquatic life, especially the diversity of small creatures which fish need for food. Humans, as happened at the Olympic Games, can choose to avoid endangering themselves by not entering polluted water, but fish in the River Seine in Paris have no options. They are gradually being wiped out by the combination of warmer water and pollution. In Britain the privatised water companies and poorly controlled industrial farming companies have been increasingly pouring raw sewage, animal waste and fertilisers into our waterways for decades. There is a public outcry over this and the new government has promised to take action to improve matters but the new research makes clear that the problem is even more severe and urgent than previously thought. Cherished trout and salmon fisheries and the already endangered eel populations require rivers to be clean and cool for their entire length for adults to breed. Many long-established coarse fisheries will also be lost."

She was on vacation in northern Wisconsin, sipping coffee next to her sleeping dog \u2013 a quiet, midwestern kind of celebration. Reyer felt compelled to stress \u201chow absolutely strongly I was pulling for Governor Walz to be the VP pick\u201d. \u201cIt feels really important and like a huge opportunity,\u201d said Reyer, about the possibility of making such reforms nationally. \u201cI share with Governor Walz the bedrock belief that healthcare is a human right. So, to me \u2013 yeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d Since the Obama era, health reformers have had a tough run. After the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) better known as \u201cObamacare\u201d, in 2010, the Democratic party suffered heavy midterm losses to what would become known as the conservative Tea Party movement. Perhaps worse, the ACA became a focal point of Republican rage well into the Trump administration. Republicans only abandoned calls to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the ACA in 2017, after the now-deceased Republican senator John McCain stunned party leaders by casting the decisive vote against Trump\u2019s plan, returning to Washington amid a brain cancer diagnosis. Although Republicans were not able to repeal Obamacare, they were successful in another way: years of attacks left little room to expand coverage or rein in healthcare prices, essentially the unfinished work of Obamacare. Republicans policy wonks have since retreated to time-worn proposals for a second Trump term, primarily fleshed out in the Project 2025 document. Among the early 2000s hits now on a nostalgia tour: Make healthcare shoppable! More privatization! Less regulation! Tax-free savings accounts! The former president has disavowed Project 2025, though the official Republican platform does not look dissimilar. Notably, Trump\u2019s current campaign and former administration has close ties to authors of the project. The 2024 Republican platform focuses on \u201ctransparency\u201d, \u201cchoice\u201d and \u201ccompetition\u201d (read: shoppable prices and fewer regulations). It also promises \u201cno cuts\u201d to Medicare, a government program for the elderly, though Project 2025 promotes further privatizing the program. Today, about 92% of Americans have health insurance. That still leaves about 26 million people out of the system \u2013 potentially vulnerable to the full force of market prices in the world\u2019s most expensive health system. A catastrophic illness or ailment can easily lead to financial ruin. What\u2019s more, even for people who have health insurance, medical debt remains a persistent problem. Forty-one per cent of Americans owe money to a medical provider, credit card or family member for healthcare. Often, when people have or fear medical debt, they cut back on food, clothing and other household items, according to a widely cited Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker poll. People with medical debt tend to be sicker and die sooner. At the same time, the cost of healthcare now eats up 17% of America\u2019s gross domestic product, nearly double that of peer nations. That is in spite of the fact that Americans see the doctor less than peers in other wealthy nations and have worse health outcomes. While not all of America\u2019s health problems can be pegged to problems with the insurance industry, anecdotal reports show at least some can be \u2013 such as adults waiting until they reach Medicare eligibility age to get cataract surgery or Americans feeling reticent to smile for fear of revealing a mouth full of decay. Exactly what Harris and Walz\u2019s healthcare platform will be remains to be seen. The 2020 Democratic platform included a call for a public option, reining in pharmaceutical spending and strengthening Obamacare. The administration accomplished some of this. Notably, the Biden administration just finished its first Medicare prescription drug price negotiation \u2013 a process common in peer nations but which was prohibited when Biden took office. The most recently released Democratic party platform came in July, before Biden dropped out of the race. What is clear is the similarities in Harris\u2019s and Walz\u2019s records. The Biden administration capped insulin prices at $35 a month for Medicare beneficiaries. So did Walz for Minnesotans not on Medicare \u2013 an act he named after resident Alec Smith, a 26-year-old who died from rationing his $1,300-a-month insulin supply. Walz worked closely with Reyer to pass a comprehensive package of reforms for medical debt collection, which included a prohibition on hospitals from denying care to patients with outstanding balances, and which stopped the automatic transfer of debt liability to spouses. Similarly, the Biden administration has sought medical debt restrictions through rule-making with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Walz said in his inaugural address as governor that he believed healthcare was a \u201chuman right\u201d. That\u2019s widely accepted wisdom outside the US, and all but the unofficial tagline for single-payer healthcare advocates \u2013 the kind of government-run universal healthcare that is a source of pride for the UK\u2019s National Health Service. Similarly, Harris co-sponsored 2019 legislation introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders that would have established single-payer healthcare nationally. The revolutionary proposal stood no chance of passing, and she has since sought to moderate from that moment. Her campaign has said she would \u201cnot push\u201d single-payer as president. Still, it has got advocates excited. \u201cFrom our standpoint, this is fantastic,\u201d said Dr Philip A Verhoef, a critical care doctor in Hawaii and president of Physicians for a National Health Program, the nation\u2019s largest single-payer advocacy organization. \u201cTen years ago, single-payer burst on to the scene,\u201d with Sanders\u2019s presidential run, said Verhoef. \u201cPrior to that, nobody ever talked about this.\u201d Similarly, single-payer advocates were \u201cshut out\u201d of Obamacare discussions, Verhoef added. Walz also laid the groundwork for a \u201cpublic option\u201d health insurance plan in Minnesota, where the government would allow people to buy into Medicaid, and banned private health insurance companies, such as behemoth UnitedHealth, from contracting with Minnesota\u2019s Medicaid plan. How the Harris-Walz ticket will translate the excitement of reformers into action \u2013 and what exactly their proposals will be \u2013 remains to be seen. For the time being, activists are enjoying a sense of possibility, knowing difficult discussions lie ahead. \u201cSo often, we see people in positions of political power are thinking, \u2018Well, what can we get done without blowing up the system,\u2019\u201d said Verhoef. \u201cI appreciate that attitude \u2013 in a way that\u2019s what the ACA was. It helped a lot of people. But it still left 30 million people uninsured in this country and it hasn\u2019t stopped people from going bankrupt from healthcare bills.\u201d"

            "content": "Bernie Sanders detailed an extensive progressive agenda that Democrats must enact if Kamala Harris is elected president as he addressed the party\u2019s nominating convention in Chicago on Tuesday. The Vermont senator mentioned Harris\u2019s name only a handful of times and instead focused his forceful speech on the need to expand healthcare access, reduce the cost of higher education and raise the minimum wage. As he seeks re-election to a fourth Senate term this November, Sanders insisted that Democrats could come together to make meaningful change, as they did in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic with the passage of the American Rescue Plan. \u201cI say all of this not to relive that difficult moment, but to make one simple point. When the political will is there, government can effectively deliver for the people of our country,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe need to summon that will again \u2013 because too many of our fellow Americans are struggling every day to just get by.\u201d Sanders\u2019 speech sounded much like his typical remarks at a rally, as he invoked the language of his two unsuccessful presidential campaigns. He implored his fellow lawmakers to \u201cget big money out of our political process\u201d, \u201cguarantee healthcare to all as a human right\u201d and \u201ctake on big pharma\u201d. While applauding Joe Biden and his administration for having accomplished \u201cmore than any government since FDR\u201d, Sanders made it clear that he considers the work unfinished. \u201cMuch more remains to be done,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe must have the courage to stand up to wealth and power and deliver justice for people at home and abroad.\u201d Sanders\u2019 focus on policy rather than the new Democratic nominee was notable given his staunch support of Biden in the weeks after the president\u2019s devastating debate performance last month. While more Democrats were calling on the president to step aside, Sanders penned a New York Times op-ed arguing Biden was \u201cthe strongest candidate to defeat Mr Trump\u201d. Despite those concerns, Sanders has commended Harris in recent weeks, as she has ridden a wave of enthusiasm to quickly consolidate Democrats\u2019 support. In an interview on Monday, Sanders described Harris as \u201ca very strong candidate\u201d while urging Democrats against potential complacency in the election. In that interview, Sanders attacked Trump as the \u201cmost dangerous candidate\u201d in US history, a warning that he has repeated throughout this election season. On Tuesday, Sanders contrasted his vision of economic populism with the policies included in Project 2025, a rightwing manifesto that has become a punching bag for Democrats. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: this is not a radical agenda,\u201d Sanders said of his proposals. \u201cGiving more tax breaks to billionaires. Putting forth budgets to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Letting polluters destroy our planet. That is what is radical.\u201d Sanders received a warm welcome from the convention crowd, but the senator received the most robust applause toward the end of his speech, when he addressed the war in Gaza. Sanders has become one of the most vocal critics of Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government in Congress, and he has chastised Biden over his response to the war. \u201cAbroad, we must end this horrific war in Gaza, bring home the hostages, and demand an immediate ceasefire,\u201d Sanders said, prompting loud cheers from the crowd. Pro-Palestinian protesters have held a series of demonstrations across Chicago this week to bring more attention to Biden\u2019s handling of the war and demand a new approach from Harris. Progressives are hopeful that Harris will set a new tone on Israel, and she will have a chance to specify her views on the war when she addresses the convention on Thursday. As progressives wait to hear more details on Harris\u2019 platform, Sanders made it clear on Monday that he was ready to work to get her to the White House. \u201cOn November 5, let us elect Kamala Harris as our president,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd let us go forward to create the nation we know we can become.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-15T01:24:05Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris will announce plans to tackle high grocery costs by targeting corporations in the food and grocery industry, as she previews her economic agenda ahead of the November election. She will also tackle prescription drug and housing costs, drawing a contrast with Trump on tariffs and taxes, according to a Harris campaign statement. Harris is expected to lay out some details of her economic plan in a speech in North Carolina on Friday. \u201cSame values, different vision,\u201d said one aide, describing how Harris\u2019s economic agenda will compare with that of Joe Biden, who stepped aside as the Democratic presidential candidate last month. \u201cShe\u2019s not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her.\u201d In July, inflation fell to below 3% for the first time in nearly three and a half years, the labor department said on Wednesday, but high prices of groceries and consumer goods remain well above their pre-pandemic levels, and are front of mind for voters. Among the plans from the Harris campaign is a federal ban on price-gouging in the industries. Most states currently have such bans in place. The ban will apply to corporations in the food and grocery industries, stopping them \u201cfrom unfairly jacking up prices on consumers\u201d. Harris will single out meat prices, and in particular the meat-processing industry. Her first 100 days will also see support for small businesses, a \u201ccrack down on unfair mergers and acquisitions\u201d among food corporations. Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that the Democrats want to ban red meat. Speaking in Pennsylvania on 31 July, he said that Harris wants to \u201cget rid of your cows\u201d and wants to \u201cslash consumption of red meat\u201d. The Harris campaign has so far centred healthcare and abortion rights, with the first campaign ad focused on gun violence, reproductive freedom, child poverty and affordable healthcare. Harris no longer supports measures from her short-lived 2020 presidential bid such as a fracking ban or Medicare for All, advisers told Reuters. Not all of the elements of Harris\u2019 economic agenda will make it to the Friday speech, a draft of which is still in the works. Her campaign said it wanted to avoid dividing voters and attracting attacks from business groups over granular details, and will be \u201cstrategically ambiguous\u201d in areas such as energy. She will push plans to cut costs of rental housing and home ownership, including funding more affordable housing and building climate resistant communities. \u201cShe does have a focus on housing because we know and she knows very, very clearly that housing is a crisis in this country,\u201d said Marcia Fudge, a Harris adviser and the former housing and urban development secretary under Biden. Harris will also draw contrasts with Trump on tax policy and tariffs and maintain Biden\u2019s promise not to raise taxes on people who make $400,000 or less a year, advisers said. Trump slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and implemented other tax breaks that are set to expire next year. The Trump campaign has been mulling new tax cuts for middle-class households, and has proposed eliminating taxes on tipped wages \u2013 something Harris also recently said she supported. Trump has promised to make the tax cuts permanent and suggested new, across-the-board tariffs on imports, an idea Harris rejects. In a campaign speech in Asheville, North Carolinawhich was billed as an address on the economy, Trump veered off topic, saying his advisers had wanted him to focus on economic concerns. He was \u201cnot sure\u201d, however, that the economy is the most important issue of the election, he said. Trump used a \u201ctravel-sized\u201d box of Tic Tacs to make a point about inflation. \u201cThis is Tic Tacs,\u201d he said, holding up a standard-sized box of the mints. \u201cThis is inflation,\u201d he said, holding up the smaller box. He called it the \u201cgreatest commercial they ever had\u201d. The Guardian contacted Ferrero, the company that makes Tic Tacs, for comment. Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Reuters: \u201cAmerica cannot afford another four years of Kamala\u2019s failed economic policies. President Trump has a proven track record of making this country prosperous and affordable, and Americans can trust him to put more money back in their pockets again.\u201d Biden was briefed on the economy on Thursday by the US treasury secretary Janet Yellen, commerce secretary Gina Raimondo, national economic adviser Lael Brainard and others. \u201cThe group discussed the resilience of the US economy, with inflation falling below 3%, strong business investment and consumer spending, and a healthy job market,\u201d according to a pool report.

            "date": "2024-08-31T18:28:40Z",
            "content": "Most people in the UK now believe they will have to spend their own money on private healthcare for routine services such as dentistry, physiotherapy and counselling because they won\u2019t be able to get them quickly on the NHS, pioneering new research has found. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says its findings, based on extensive focus group analysis, is evidence that Britons have undergone a \u201ccritical shift in expectations\u201d about the health service\u2019s capacity to meet their needs. \u201cThis research shows that the public feel they can no longer count on the NHS to provide a universal service that\u2019s free at the point of delivery because some NHS services are now so difficult to access\u201d, said Peter Matejic, the thinktank\u2019s chief analyst. For the first time, the foundation has adjusted its minimum income standard, which sets out what working-age adults believe is the base level of money they need to live a decent life in the UK, to include \u00a3200 a year for spending on private health care. The foundation commissioned focus groups for research conducted by Loughborough University as the basis for its study, following recent jumps in use of private healthcare after the Covid pandemic. A record 898,000 people were admitted to private hospitals in 2023, according to figures from the Private Healthcare Information Network. Record numbers are also spending up to \u00a33,200 on having a cataract removed and \u00a315,075 on a new hip as frustration grows at having to wait months or years for an operation on the NHS. The focus groups found people routinely taking the view that they should set aside money for private care. One woman in Sheffield said that a sum of money for private healthcare was necessary because \u201cit is for things that the NHS don\u2019t cover, which is a lot now\u201d. A man in Norwich said: \u201cWhether it is mental or physical, you need to be able to have the choice to not go with the NHS and see yourself on a waiting list for years and years. \u201cYou want to just be able to get the help that you need as soon as possible. So you need the little budget to put towards that.\u201d According to the foundation\u2019s minimum income standard, drawn up by Loughborough University, a single person is now estimated to need \u00a328,000 a year in earnings in order to \u201clive with dignity\u201d, while a couple with two children must bring in \u00a369,400 between them. In 2022, 272,000 people used their own funds to cover the cost of having an operation or diagnostic procedure at a private hospital. That was up from 262,000 the year before and a sharp rise on the 199,000 in 2019, the year before the pandemic struck. While all the main parties went into July\u2019s general election promising to keep the NHS \u201cfree at the point of delivery\u201d, there is a growing recognition among its staff and the public that it can\u2019t cope with growing demand, given budget constraints. Waiting lists for hospital care in England went up again last month to 7.62 million. Keir Starmer and health secretary Wes Streeting have pledged to end long waits and once again meet targets enshrined in the NHS constitution. But they have stressed that they inherited an NHS \u201cbroken\u201d after years of neglect by the Conservatives. Private health operators are experiencing an uplift resulting from more people using private health insurance as employers offer private health cover to circumvent NHS delays. Non-NHS hospitals, clinics and diagnosis services are benefiting from significant rises in the numbers having scans, day-case procedures or overnight stays for bigger operations. But campaigners warned that the foundation\u2019s findings underlined the NHS\u2019s damaging descent after years of under-investment into \u201ca poor service for poor people\u201d, rather than the universal, free-at-the-point-of-use service conceived at its creation in 1948. \u201cIt is shocking to see how neglect of the service by politicians now means that those people who can afford it feel they have no option but to turn to private providers\u201d, said Dr John Puntis, co-chair of Keep Our NHS Public. \u201cLabour\u2019s plans for greater reliance on the private sector are likely to drive this shift further towards the NHS becoming a poor service for poor people.\u201d David Rowland, director of the Centre for Health and the Public Interest, a thinktank that tracks NHS privatisation, said: \u201cThe fact that households are budgeting for healthcare costs is yet another example of how the UK risks drifting towards a two-tier healthcare system where the costs of healthcare are being pushed back on to individuals and their families. \u201cThis has happened by stealth over the past two decades, undermining the founding principle of the NHS, which is that healthcare should be available to all on the basis of need, not ability to pay. \u201cAvoiding a two-tier system is the biggest political issue facing the new Labour government and it can only be avoided if the NHS is given the resources to provide timely access to good quality care for all\u201d, he added. But David Hare, chief executive of the Independent Healthcare Providers Network, which represents many firms profiting from the surge in private healthcare, said people turning to non-NHS providers for basic health needs was \u201cbecoming a new normal\u201d, including for GP services, diagnostic tests and surgery. \u201cPeople\u2019s health and the health of their family is their number one priority, and so it is not surprising that more people are willing to fund their own treatment to ensure they receive the swift care they need,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 September 2024 because an earlier version misnamed the Private Healthcare Hospitals Information Network as the Private Hospitals Information Network. It was further amended on 6 September 2024 after the Joseph Rowntree Foundation contacted us to correct the figures they cited in relation to minimum income standard."

After discovering the Olympic Village provides not only free food to athletes but also a suite of free healthcare options, she will be heading home having completed a pap smear and a free eye and dental exam. She even snagged a free pair of prescription glasses. To quote her now-viral TikTok video, \u201cLike, what?\u201d The Olympic Village \u2013 where athletes reside during the Games \u2013 began offering free medical care in 1932, according to Sports Illustrated. SI also reported that the village offers cardiology, orthopedics, physiotherapy, psychology and podiatry, with dermatology also being offered to Paralympic athletes, who arrive next week. In the US, healthcare is covered by private insurance that often requires customers to pay out of pocket until a deductible is reached, as well as copays and co-insurance costs, with extra fees incurred if a doctor is out of network. These expenses frequently make even basic healthcare such as gynaecology check-ups prohibitively expensive, and Ramsey has spent the last week chronicling her experience with free healthcare on TikTok. \u201cAmerica needs to do better with their healthcare system because there\u2019s no way why me, an American girl, should be so amazed by free healthcare,\u201d she said. Ramsey, who was part of history in Paris when her team won the US\u2019s first-ever Olympic rugby sevens medal, is also a certified personal trainer. Her excitement about the free care, and the ease with which it is distributed, has led to heated debate on her social media, with some noting it isn\u2019t \u201cfree\u201d since someone else is paying for it, and others calling it \u201cjust embarrassing\u201d for the US. Healthcare in the US is projected to have cost $4.8tn in 2023, according to recently released federal data, outpacing the country\u2019s GDP. Per person, this amounts to an estimated $14,423 in 2023 with a projected rise to $15,074 in 2024. In France, the host country of the 2024 Games, that number was estimated to have been $5,740 per person in 2020. By the end of the Paralympic Games in September, more than 22,000 athletes will have stayed in the Olympic Village, many of whom will have enjoyed access to the free care on offer. Since making her first TikTok bringing awareness to the Olympic Village polyclinic, Ramsey said she has been thanked by the healthcare workers for her positive message and is being recognised on the street. \u201cI\u2019m officially a free healthcare advocate,\u201d Ramsey said after completing a dental appointment. \u201cThis is gonna be my new fight for action: free healthcare in America. Period.\u201d Ramsey started playing rugby in high school, where she also excelled in track, wrestling and field hockey. She continued to play rugby in college at Dartmouth, where she was a co-captain. She also represented the US at the Tokyo Olympics, where her team reached the quarter-finals."

The company also deleted posts criticising Covid vaccines, and suggestions the virus was developed in a Chinese laboratory. In the 2020 US presidential election campaign, Biden accused social media platforms such as Facebook of \u201ckilling people\u201d by allowing disinformation about coronavirus vaccines to be posted on its platform. \u201cI think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn\u2019t make today,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI regret we were not more outspoken about it. \u201cLike I said to our teams at the time, I feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration in either direction. And we are ready to push back if something like this happens again.\u201d Zuckerberg also said that Facebook \u201ctemporarily demoted\u201d a story about the contents of a laptop owned by Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, after a warning from the FBI that Russia was preparing a disinformation campaign against the Bidens. Zuckerberg wrote that it has since become clear that the story was not disinformation, and \u201cin retrospect, we shouldn\u2019t have demoted the story\u201d. The House judiciary committee, which is controlled by Republicans, called Zuckerberg\u2019s admissions a \u201cbig win for free speech\u201d in a post on the committee\u2019s Facebook page.

On Tuesday he described his push to convert every poker machine in NSW to cashless gaming \u2013 before he lost the 2023 election to Labor \u2013 as one of his biggest reform ideas. \u201cI look forward to the day these machines of misery in their factories of despair no longer feed on some of the most vulnerable people in the state,\u201d he said. Perrottet also criticised the federation and said the federal government\u2019s encroachment into service delivery \u2013 such as with the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Broadband Network \u2013 had been an \u201cabject failure\u201d. He said federal governments should be elected for fixed, four-year terms, to give them \u201cmore time on reforming and less time on campaigning\u201d. Perrottet thanked all the political colleagues and public servants he worked with, as well as his personal staff, many of them by name. His parents, his wife, Helen, and their seven children, watched from a packed public gallery along with several former federal and state Liberal ministers."

            "content": "The pound has gained ground in recent days as a gap appears to have opened up between the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, strategists say. While Fed chair Jerome Powell said \u201cthe time has come\u201d for interest rate cuts, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey appeared to suggest that the pace in the UK will be slower. That has helped to lift sterling to its highest level in two years against the US dollar on Tuesday, at $1.3246 at its peak. Interest rate cuts tend to make a currency relatively less attractive for investors looking for higher-yielding assets. Imogen Bachra, head of economics and markets strategy at NatWest Markets, a bank, said that He adopted the same fairly cautious tone that we heard in the press conference a few weeks ago. The conclusion is that data is softening enough that the MPC appears comfortable to take its foot off the gas, but not especially quickly and probably not as far or as fast as the market is pricing. The speech itself was quite lengthy, and I think the key paragraph was buried somewhere in the middle (emphasis ours): \u201cIn the UK case, the evidence suggests this may have worked insofar as we are seeing a lower level of inflation persistence than we expected a year ago. But, we need to be cautious because the job is not completed \u2013 we are not yet back to target on a sustained basis. Policy setting will need to remain restrictive for sufficiently long until the risks to inflation remaining sustainably around the 2% target in the medium term have dissipated further. The course will therefore be a steady one.\u201d Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG, a Japanese investment bank, said: There was certainly a more cautious tone to the speech from Bailey in contrast to Fed Chair Powell\u2019s speech. But that is of course understandable. There was a far larger energy price shock in Europe than in the US and the problem in Europe was more supply-, less demand-related. In other business news today: The Meta boss, Mark Zuckerberg, has said he regrets bowing to what he claims was pressure from the US government to censor posts about Covid on Facebook and Instagram during the pandemic. The veteran media executive Edgar Bronfman Jr has abandoned a $6bn (\u00a34.5bn) bid for Paramount Global, clearing the path for the conglomerate\u2019s multibillion-dollar merger with the production group Skydance Media.

Britvic, whose brands include J20, Robinsons and R White\u2019s lemonade, accepted a \u00a33.3bn offer in July after rejecting previous takeover offers from Carlsberg on the grounds that they undervalued the company. On Tuesday the company said that all the motions it had put to shareholders had passed. The vote to sell to Carlsberg was near unanimous: Number of votes: For: 165,809,035 (99.69%) Against: 515,673 (0.31%) US stock markets have indeed dropped back on Tuesday morning. Here are the opening snaps from Wall Street: S&amp;P 500 DOWN 12.08 POINTS, OR 0.22%, AT 5,604.76 NASDAQ DOWN 68.61 POINTS, OR 0.39%, AT 17,657.16 DOW JONES DOWN 21.24 POINTS, OR 0.05%, AT 41,219.28 US stock markets are due to drop when markets open in a few minutes\u2019 time. Futures trades indicate that the S&amp;P 500 benchmark will fall by 0.4%, the tech-focused Nasdaq will fall 0.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average will drop by 0.3%. Perhaps the key thing for US equity investors this week is what happens with Nvidia. The hype around artificial intelligence has prompted one of the most astonishing sectoral booms in history. Chip designer Nvidia is the company that has gained the most \u2013 and potentially has the most to lose \u2013 if demand deflates at all. Nvidia\u2019s performance has been one of the key drivers of the entire S&amp;P 500 since the release of ChatGPT, the app that first brought large language models to broader public attention. House prices in the 20 major US metro markets rose by 6.5% year to June, according to the S&amp;P Case-Shiller index. That was a deceleration compared with last month, but still faster growth than economists polled by Reuters had expected. Keir Starmer may be warning of pain to come, but the UK economy in 2024 has not been awful \u2013 at least if GDP figures are to be believed. They may well be masking deeper, longer-term problems that could slow productivity growth, but in the short term some traders are clearly convinced of the relative attractions of sterling. Enrique D\u00edaz-Alvarez, chief financial risk officer at Ebury, a foreign exchange company, said: The PMI indices of business activity for August provided further proof of the healthy state of the UK economy, with both the manufacturing and service sectors posting numbers consistent with solid and even modestly accelerating growth. The Bank of England signalled continued cuts, but it kept its cautious tone. We think this opens up a bit of a sweet spot for sterling, as healthy growth is combined with a cautious central bank and what will likely be the highest rates of any G10 economy for at least the next few months. The pound has hit its strongest in more than two years against the US dollar as traders remain fixated on the pace of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Sterling rose by 0.2% on Tuesday, but that was enough to push it to a new high against the US dollar. One pound bought $1.3246 at its peak, the highest since March 2022. The pound fell to near parity with the dollar in September 2022, when Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled a \u201cmini-budget\u201d that sparked panic in financial markets. Since then, it has recovered. It has risen sharply over the summer in part because of stronger economic growth in the UK, but perhaps more notably because of the Federal Reserve\u2019s signals that it will cut interest rates for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, after a cycle of tightening that pushed its federal funds rate to a range of between 5.25% and 5.5%. Currencies tend to appreciate when the home central bank is expected to tighten monetary policy (because assets priced in that currency will yield higher returns for investors). When a central bank is loosening monetary policy \u2013 as the Fed is now \u2013 the opposite tends to happen. Fed chair Jerome Powell gave little doubt that the central bank will cut interest rates on 18 September. In a speech last week he said: \u201cThe time has come for policy to adjust.\u201d Keir Starmer is readying the county for a \u201cpainful\u201d budget \u2013 or at least is managing expectations and trying to pin the blame on the previous Conservative government. In a speech this morning Starmer warned that the government\u2019s forthcoming Budget will be \u201cpainful\u201d as he asked the country to \u201caccept short-term pain for long-term good\u201d. Starmer said those with the \u201cbroadest shoulders\u201d will carry the heaviest burden. He stressed that taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d \u2013 namely national insurance, VAT and income tax \u2013 will not be increased in the 30 October budget, but stressed that \u201cthings will get worse before they get better\u201d. You can follow all the reaction to the speech with Andrew Sparrow on the politics live blog: Arts and crafts chain Hobbycraft has been bought by retail investor Modella Capital for an undisclosed sum. Modella said it will invest in Hobbycraft\u2019s stores. Private equity investor Bridgepoint put the chain up for sale in February. At the time the Sunday Times reported that Bridgepoint was considering taking a steep loss on the sale. Bridgepoint bought Hobbycraft for \u00a3100m in 2010, but was reportedly considering a sale for between \u00a360m and \u00a370m. Bridgepoint had overseen investments that doubled the retailer\u2019s store estate and also included a new warehouse in Burton, Staffordshire, according to Retail Gazette. Modella was an investor in the UK licensing partner of fashion retailer Ted Baker, which collapsed into administration earlier this year. Modella Capital managing director Joseph Price said: Hobbycraft is a business with fantastic potential, boasting a highly experienced management team, truly passionate store colleagues and real authority in a sector on the high street that continues to grow and is set to do so in the future. We look forward to accelerating the team\u2019s growth strategy through investment in the physical footprint of the group, displaying a real commitment to bricks and mortar retail, and by enhancing the returns generated from their existing sales channels, including their growing online business. Dominic Jordan, Hobbycraft\u2019s chief executive, said: We are delighted that Modella Capital is the new owner of this great business. Their deep understanding of the retail sector, shared vision and cultural values, combined with significant reserves of growth capital, make them an ideal partner. I would also like to thank Bridgepoint for their support and collaboration over the past 14 years. Hobbycraft has evolved into a leading name in the arts and crafts sector and I am confident that, together with Modella Capital, we have a very bright future ahead of us. Hobbycraft\u2019s pre-tax losses rose to \u00a316.2m for the 12 months ended 19 February, widening from \u00a37.4m a year earlier, even as revenues rose from \u00a3203m to \u00a3211m, according to ShareCast. Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the CBI, said: Retail sales volumes continued to disappoint in the year to August, with contractions also being seen in the wholesale and motor trade sectors. Retailers reported increased caution regarding their investment and hiring plans, which seemed to reflect concerns about persistently weak demand conditions. Although households seem to still be feeling the pinch from the cost-of-living crisis, firms should gradually begin to see some tailwinds from consumers\u2019 rising real incomes. The sector will want to see measures in the budget this autumn to give certainty to firms and incentivise investment. Reforming business rates, introducing a business tax roadmap, and changing the apprenticeship levy would help businesses to deliver on the government\u2019s ambitions to supercharge the economy. Retail sales fell for a third month in a row, with businesses scaling back hiring and investment plans, according to data just published by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The balance of retailers who said that sales declined in the year to August was 27%, the CBI said. That was better than the 43% who said sales declined in July, but hardly a vote of confidence. Retailers are less optimistic that things will pick up. A balance of 13% of retailers said they expected the business situation to deteriorate in the next three months, compared with a balance of 2% who had said that things would improve back in May. There is intense scrutiny on social media bosses at the moment. Telegram founder Pavel Durov is one such example: he has been arrested by France as part of investigation on allegedly illicit transactions, child sexual abuse, fraud and the refusal to communicate information to authorities. Durov left his native Russia and the government took control of the social network, VKontakte, which Durov had made into Russia\u2019s dominant social network. Durov then founded Telegram, which is particularly widely used in Russia and the Middle East \u2013 even though the platform is not as secure as some rivals. You can read about the reasons for his arrest here: Durov has won support from some notable people who say his arrest is an attack on freedom of speech. Those backers include Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, which rivals Telegram in some respects. Another \u2013 perhaps more surprising \u2013 supporter: the Kremlin. In comments reported by Reuters, a spokesperson for the Russian government said that the arrest will be seen as (checks notes) an attempt to restrict freedom of communication unless the accusations are backed up by evidence. The Kremlin said that it hopes that Durov will be able to organise a legal defence against very serious allegations. Some of the shine has come off European stock markets. The FTSE 100 is now only up by 0.2%. London\u2019s benchmark index has not been helped by weakness in the property industry. Developer Berkeley Group is the biggest faller, down 2.7%, while Persimmon, Barratt Developments, Vistry Group and Taylor Wimpey are all down by between 1.9% and 2.3%. Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg has said the US government under Joe Biden put pressure on the Facebook social network to \u201ccensor certain Covid-19 content\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic. Zuckerberg said that \u201csenior officials\u201d from the White House \u201crepeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain Covid-19 content, including humour and satire\u201d, in a letter to the US House of Representatives\u2019 judiciary committee. He wrote: I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it. I also think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn\u2019t make today. Zuckerberg also said that Facebook \u201ctemporarily demoted\u201d a story about the contents of a laptop owned by Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, after a warning from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that Russia was preparing a disinformation campaign against the Bidens. Zuckerberg wrote that it has since become clear that the story was not disinformation, and \u201cin retrospect, we shouldn\u2019t have demoted the story\u201d. The admissions will probably fuel criticisms of tech companies and the Biden administration by Republicans. They control the judiciary committee, and posted Zuckerberg\u2019s letter on \u2013 of all places \u2013 the committee\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cBig win for free speech\u201d, the page\u2019s administrators wrote in the post containing the letter. Zuckerberg also said he would not donate money towards US election infrastructure, after facing criticism from Republicans that similar donations in 2020 benefited the Democratic party. European airlines have risen across the board after Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary said the worst-case fare falls (from investors\u2019 perspective rather than consumers) had been avoided. EasyJet gained by 4.3%, Wizz Air gained 7% and British Airways owner International Airlines Group rose by 1.4%. Frankfurt-listed Deutsche Lufthansa and Paris-listed Air France KLM rose by 2.6% and 2% respectively. Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has given typically short shrift to plane manufacturer Boeing, saying that relations with the new management are \u201cdifficult\u201d. Boeing is struggling to increase the production rate for its aircraft after another year of crisis. In January a door plug panel blew out from a flight, renewing regulatory scrutiny of the company after years of trying to repair the damage from two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that were caused by design flaws. Ryanair, the biggest airline in Europe, is one of Boeing\u2019s biggest customers. O\u2019Leary, a tough negotiator, is rarely one to pull his punches. O\u2019Leary told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that things with Boeing are \u201cdifficult\u201d. The Irish airline was due to receive seven and 10 new aircraft from Boeing in July and August respectively, but will only received ten in total, he said. Ryanair is working with Boeing\u2019s new management, after Stephanie Pope took over its commercial aviation arm, but \u201cthey continue to disappoint us\u201d, O\u2019Leary said. Ryanair shares have risen after boss Michael O\u2019Leary said that fares will fall by less than 10%, reassuring investors who had feared steeper reductions in prices. The Irish airline alarmed the aviation industry last month when it warned that fares could drop by more than 10% as it missed analyst estimates for sales. O\u2019Leary on Tuesday said that he expected a fall of about 5% compared with last year, in an interview with Reuters. That prompted a 4.6% rally in the Dublin-listed airline\u2019s share price, although it remains down by 17% over the course of this year. The risk of what O\u2019Leary at the time called an \u201cugly scenario\u201d of double-digit falls in average fares \u201clooks like it has disappeared,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. That suggests that passengers are happier to pay more for flights. O\u2019Leary said: While fares were kind of softening during April, May and June, that has leveled out. Germany is struggling so much because it is facing cyclical headwinds at the same time as deeper structural changes, said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, a Dutch investment bank. He said: The German economy had started the year with some optimism. First-quarter GDP growth was a positive surprise and confidence indicators improved, giving rise to hopes that the pessimism of the last few years was behind us, and that discussions about whether or not Germany was the \u201csick man of Europe\u201d could be put to one side. The truth, however, is that GDP growth in the first quarter was driven by the mild winter weather and a downward revision of fourth quarter GDP. Therefore, it was not what we would call a sustainable and healthy growth story. With disappointing second-quarter growth and almost all confidence sentiment indicators pointing south, the German economy is currently back where it was a year ago: stuck in stagnation as the growth laggard of the entire eurozone. Still, we are not ready, yet, to give up on at least some optimism for the second half of the year. The highest increase in real wages in more than a decade could still open German consumers\u2019 wallets and there only needs to be a small improvement in industrial orders to bring the long overdue turning of the inventory cycle. Admittedly, hopes of a consumer-driven recovery in the second half of the year got another hit this morning with consumer confidence dropping. The numbers from Germany\u2019s economy are not very promising, but there may well be some reasons to be hopeful, said Melanie Debono, senior Europe economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy. There have been worrying signs from business surveys, today\u2019s GDP figures show very weak business investment, and today\u2019s GfK consumer sentiment numbers are not very promising for spending. Yet Debono said it is not all bad. She said: The recession in industry [reasserted] itself after signs it may have been fading in previous months. Investment in machinery and equipment will likely remain in the doldrums. But inventories, we think, are on the cusp of a sustained rebound. We still believe, meanwhile, that consumers\u2019 spending, will rebound on the back of the improvement in real income growth. Today\u2019s other release, showing consumer confidence fell back at the end of the third quarter, bodes ill but these data have only a weak relationship with retail sales and consumers\u2019 spending figures more widely. On the Paramount bid battle, here is what the various parties had to say. Edgar Bronfman officially dropped out of the running on Monday evening. Reuters reported that a source said that some of the equity partners had dropped out. Bronfman said in a statement: We continue to believe that Paramount Global is an extraordinary company, with an unrivaled collection of marquee brands, assets and people. While there may have been differences, we believe that everyone involved in the sale process is united in the belief that Paramount\u2019s best days are ahead. Paramount said the deal with Skydance will close in the first half of 2025. Charles Phillips Jr, chair of Paramount\u2019s special committee, said: Having thoroughly explored actionable opportunities for Paramount over nearly eight months, our special committee continues to believe that the transaction we have agreed with Skydance delivers immediate value and the potential for continued participation in value creation in a rapidly evolving industry landscape. The biggest gainer on the FTSE 100 this morning is Bunzl, which distributes packaging, cleaning products and personal protective equipment. It may not be the most glamorous name on London\u2019s benchmark index, but it has wowed investors this morning with a big upgrade to its profit forecast thanks to higher profitability. It also said it will buy back shares worth \u00a3450m. Frank van Zanten, chief executive of Bunzl, said: I am very pleased with the performance of the group during the first half of 2024, with strong growth in adjusted operating profit for the period. London\u2019s FTSE 100 is the pick of Europe\u2019s stock markets this morning, as investors catch up from a bank holiday on Monday. Most of the other main indices are fairly flat in the opening trades. Here are the opening snaps, via Reuters. EUROPE\u2019S STOXX 600 UP 0.2% BRITAIN\u2019S FTSE 100 UP 0.4% FRANCE\u2019S CAC 40 UP 0.1%; SPAIN\u2019S IBEX FLAT EURO STOXX INDEX FLAT; EURO ZONE BLUE CHIPS FLAT Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Germany\u2019s economic outlook has worsened as GDP was confirmed to have fallen in the second quarter and consumer sentiment slumped, according to figures published on Tuesday. GDP fell by 0.1% in the second quarter, confirming the previous estimate, said Destatis, the federal statistics office. GDP in the first quarter of 2024 was up 0.2% on the previous quarter, unrevised from the last reading. Meanwhile job concerns weighed on German consumer sentiment. GfK\u2019s closely followed index fell to -22 points for September. That was down from a slightly revised -18.6 the month prior and below a forecast by economists polled by Reuters for -18.2. Ruth Brand, Destatis\u2019s president, said: After the slight increase in the previous quarter, the German economy slowed down again in spring. Germany\u2019s economy has narrowly avoided a technical recession for a year and a half, alternating between a contracting economy followed by expansion. Two consecutive quarters of contraction is one commonly used definition of recession. Edgar Bronfman drops bid for Paramount Media industry veteran Edgar Bronfman has dropped his bid to take over Paramount Global, paving the way for a $28bn (\u00a321bn) deal with Skydance to proceed. Bronfman, a former Warner Music chief executive, had gathered a consortium of investors to try to gazump Skydance after it last month agreed a merger (described, of course, as a blockbuster) with Paramount. The deal will, if it goes through, sever links with the Redstone family, whose media empire has included Paramount since 1994. That deal had a \u201cgo shop\u201d period in the terms, allowing Paramount to evaluate other offers. Bronfman gathered a consortium to offer $4.3bn and then $6bn to Shari Redstone, who controls the company. However, he failed to come up with the equity to finance the deal, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. Paramount is the company behind classic films such as The Godfather, Titanic and Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. It also owns the television network CBS and channels including MTV, Nickelodeon and the UK\u2019s Channel 5. Skydance, a film production group, is led by the producer David Ellison, the son of Larry Ellison, the tech tycoon who co-founded Oracle.

            "content": "Hit new Chinese game Black Myth: Wukong has sparked controversy after gaming influencers who were given early access were told not to mention news and politics, Covid-19, or \u201cfeminist propaganda\u201d while publicly discussing the game. The game, which was released last week, is China\u2019s first \u201ctriple A\u201d rated game, an industry term meaning a high budget blockbuster game, and is based on the famous 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West. Within three days it had sold more than 10m copies worldwide according to the game\u2019s developers, Game Science. But amid its success there has been debate over a list of topics to avoid that was sent to influencers and content creators along with access to a pre-release version of the game. The document, which was quickly shared on social media, listed issues to avoid while live-streaming the game. Do NOT insult other influencers or players. Do NOT use any offensive language/humor. Do NOT include politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishization, and other content that instigates negative discourse. Do NOT use trigger words such as \u2018quarantine\u2019 or \u2018isolation\u2019 or \u2018Covid-19\u2019. Do NOT discuss content related to China\u2019s game industry policies, opinions, news, etc. It wasn\u2019t clear what the instructions meant by \u201cfeminist propaganda\u201d, but reporting on the directive noted Game Science employees had faced allegations of sexist and inappropriate behaviour, most notably in reports from game website IGN in November. Game Science and Hero Games, a co-publisher which reportedly issued the directives, have been contacted for comment. Among fans online there was heated discussion about the directive to gaming influencers, with many players linking it to the IGN reports. On popular gaming YouTube channels, some also celebrated the directive as a pushback on what they saw as \u201cwokeness\u201d in gaming, noting some reviews which had criticised the game for a lack of diversity. Rolling Stone reported that the directives \u2013 which were not sent to traditional publications and reviewers \u2013 were not accompanied by non-disclosure agreements and were not legally enforceable. In a highly viewed livestream, one user appeared to poke fun at the directives, titling his broadcast \u201cCovid-19 Isolation Taiwan (Is A Real Country) Feminism Propaganda\u201d, while commenters filled the chatbox with politically sensitive terms including references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear to what extent the list was issued to appease China\u2019s strict censorship rules. People can face harsh punishment for publicly speaking about sensitive topics or criticising the ruling Communist party. Some streamers told gaming outlet Aftermath that such directives from companies were not unusual, including requests to not mention Covid. \u201cThe normal language of \u2018No politics, please don\u2019t talk about current events (covid), etc\u2019 have always been part of contracts,\u201d Twitch streamer Ben Cassel told Aftermath. However he added: \u201cI do many sponsored streams, and I\u2019ve never seen anything about \u2018feminist\u2019 anything in any of them. That is new. And definitely very strange.\u201d The game has been a global hit, peaking at more than 3 million concurrent players across all platforms, including 2 million concurrent players on PC gaming platform Steam, in its first week \u2013 the second highest rate ever. On its first day it was the most viewed game on Chinese platforms, and in Singapore some workers were given time off to play it, according to the Straits Times. Chinese authorities and media have praised the game\u2019s success, with headlines saying it \u201cbuilds pride, subdues prejudice\u201d and \u201csparks interest in Chinese culture\u201d. In recent days Chinese state media has also hit back at reports on the controversy, accusing western media of using the game to attack China. \u201cTheir strategy of attacking the game is just the same old Western tactic - politicising every Chinese achievement, even in the realm of gaming,\u201d wrote nationalistic tabloid the Global Times. The article said Black Myth\u2019s success had triggered the \u201cradar of some anti-China forces\u201d and accused the BBC \u2013 which reported on the directives \u2013 of \u201cwrongly accus[ing] China of censorship to dampen international perceptions of China\u201d, but did not detail or refute the accusations."

            "content": "Teachers returning to work next month will confront a worrying \u201cbehaviour bubble\u201d as younger children who were most severely affected by the pandemic reach the teenage years renowned for peak classroom disruption. The warning from experts and school leaders in England comes as evidence shows that children of primary school age during the pandemic \u2013 when schools were closed to most pupils \u2013 have been accruing exclusions and suspensions at a record pace since moving to secondary school. The most recent official figures, for 2022-23, show that the fastest increases in exclusions and suspensions were among a \u201cbubble\u201d of younger pupils in years 7 and 8. Those pupils will now be in years 9 and 10, when sanctions for misbehaviour are traditionally the highest. Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that worsening levels of behaviour have escalated into a crisis since the pandemic, and warned that there could be worse to come. \u201cIn the aftermath of the riots in many towns and cities during the summer, we also need to see government and other agencies stepping up to work with our schools and colleges to support vulnerable young people who are at risk of being drawn into violence,\u201d Roach said. He added: \u201cWhile the Covid pandemic highlighted the failures of government policy, it also amplified those failures, as more and more teachers reported being sworn at, threatened, shoved, kicked, bitten or punched and attacked by pupils carrying weapons.\u201d A government source said: \u201cThe merry-go-round of Tory ministers in recent years failed to grip the rising tide of poor behaviour pre-pandemic and then told children and their families they\u2019d \u2018maxed out\u2019 on Covid recovery support. This government will do the hard yards and get to the root of much of the bad behaviour blighting our schools with a support-first approach that gets control of our classrooms once again.\u201d The Department for Education\u2019s (DfE) most recent behaviour data for England\u2019s state schools shows the proportion of year 7 pupils who received at least one suspension rose from 3.5% in the year before the pandemic to 5.5% in 2022-23, while the rate of year 8 pupils suspended rose from 5.5% to more than 8%. Older pupils in year 9 and year 10 had close to 10% of pupils receiving at least one suspension in 2022-23, also well above pre-pandemic levels. More worryingly, the rate of exclusions at secondary schools rose fastest among year 7 and year 8 pupils, particularly among girls. Before and during the pandemic, roughly three boys were excluded for each girl \u2013 but the ratio in 2022-23 moved to nearly two to one, with 1,000 more female exclusions compared with 2018-19. Andrew Old, a secondary school teacher and blogger who identified the trend of rising exclusions among younger pupils and girls, said: \u201cNext year\u2019s year 9s and year 10s could be the most challenging for many years. However, that may depend on whether schools have successfully addressed the behaviour of those pupils in the years they have already been at secondary school.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cThe rising number of school suspensions and permanent exclusions are shocking, and show the massive scale of disruptive behaviour that has developed in schools across the country in recent years, harming the life chances of children. \u201cWe are determined to get to grips with the causes of poor behaviour: we\u2019ve already committed to providing access to specialist mental health professionals in every school, introducing free breakfast clubs in every primary school and ensuring earlier intervention in mainstream schools for pupils with special needs. \u201cBut we know poor behaviour can also be rooted in wider issues, which is why the government is developing an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty led by a taskforce co-chaired by the education secretary so that we can break down the barriers to opportunity.\u201d Tom Bennett, a DfE adviser on behaviour management, said: \u201cI think that the idea of a \u2018behaviour bubble\u2019 moving up the pipe is possible but not certain. I would speculate that the experience of home schooling during lockdown may well be responsible for the deterioration of some social skills, which, like truancy, will be disproportionately concentrated in sub-groups who were already most at risk of misbehaving. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t guarantee that they will remain so chaotic forever. They could, for instance, readjust to the socialising effect of being back at school. It may be that these effects don\u2019t persist in an environment of structure and boundaries. \u201cOn the other hand, the effect may well be sustainable, and we may well see a bubble move up and create, with the effects of adolescence, a perfect storm.\u201d While poverty and an increasing proportion of pupils with special needs may be factors behind the recent increases in sanctions, exclusion rates in primary schools and among year 11 pupils remain around or below those seen before the pandemic, suggesting that the disruption experienced by pupils moving up to secondary school has had an outsized impact. Lee Wilson, the chief executive of the Outwood Grange Academies Trust, said: \u201cMany parts of our society are still feeling the effects of Covid. Its legacy in schools \u2013 the result of lockdowns and school closures \u2013 has led to weaker academic outcomes nationally, lower attendance and poorer behaviour, especially among disadvantaged children and in schools which were already struggling or were at the start of their transformation.\u201d Bennett added: \u201cI think the pandemic disruption plus \u2013 I hate to say it \u2013 a burgeoning reliance on social media and smartphones has desocialised the cohort, giving them somewhere to invest their attention spans and cognitive bandwidth on pursuits that are essentially trivial and worthless.\u201d Pepe Di\u2019Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the behaviour issues affecting younger children may continue to be a challenge as they progress through school. \u201cThe sad reality is that schools and children have been let down by more than a decade of underfunding both in education and the broader network of local services. This is the result,\u201d Di\u2019Iasio said."

            "title": "Fifty English secondary schools suspended more than a quarter of pupils after pandemic",
            "date": "2024-08-25T16:00:06Z",
            "content": "Fifty secondary schools in England suspended more than a quarter of their students after the pandemic, with children at schools with the most disadvantaged pupils three times as likely to be suspended as those in wealthier areas, according to analysis by the Guardian. The proportion of schools suspending large numbers of pupils has risen sharply since schools were closed to many children during Covid, and teachers have struggled with deteriorating behaviour since they reopened. The number of secondary schools that sent away a quarter or more of their pupils rose to 50 in 2022-23, double the 24 that did so in 2018-19, according to data published by the Department for Education (DfE). Of the 50 schools, five are run by Dixons Academies Trust and three each by Outwood Grange Academies Trust (OGAT) and Northern Education Trust. Three of the schools suspended more than 37% of their pupils in 2022-23: Dixons Croxteth academy in Liverpool, Outwood academy Kirkby in Nottinghamshire and Outwood academy Bishopsgarth in Stockton-on-Tees. Luke Sparkes, the chief executive of Dixons Academies Trust, said his trust exclusively took on schools in disadvantaged communities with \u201cserious problems\u201d dating back years. \u201cWhen we arrive in these schools, they are very often characterised by bad behaviour \u2013 bullying, behaviour that puts other children and staff in danger, and constant disruption of lessons which means children who want to learn are stopped from doing well,\u201d Sparkes said. \u201cWe never want to suspend or exclude any student. But we also can\u2019t accept situations where children are in danger, are unhappy or can\u2019t learn. Our behaviour policies are clear and we apply sanctions consistently and fairly \u2013 everyone knows where they stand, and everyone receives high-quality support to achieve the expectations we set. \u201d Lee Wilson, the chief executive of OGAT, which operates in the north of England and the Midlands, said the trust included schools in areas of high deprivation that faced multiple challenges. \u201cThese schools have been transformed by OGAT. They now provide students with a great education and the best chance to lead successful lives. Our schools have never been so popular with parents and local authorities have expanded several of them so they can take even more students,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cTrusts like ours \u2013 and there are many \u2013 are working hard to get these schools to the best possible place and to support all students, in particular younger ones who joined secondary school at such a disjointed time, to achieve what we know they can so they can lead successful lives.\u201d The DfE\u2019s national figures for 2022-23 showed a record 257,000 students were sent away for at least part of the school day after receiving one of the 787,000 suspensions issued during the school year. The DfE said there \u201cwill always be a need for suspensions as a last resort, and we back headteachers to make those decisions whilst we work in tandem to tackle the causes of poor behaviour to prevent suspensions\u201d. On average, 7% of pupils at each secondary school received at least one suspension. But the rate was far higher in some parts of the country: Stoke-on-Trent and Middlesbrough recorded double the national rate with 14% of their pupils suspended during the year. Suspensions were also concentrated in schools serving the most deprived communities across England. In 2022-23 the secondary schools in the top fifth in terms of children on free school meals suspended 11.5% of pupils at least once, compared with 3.4% of pupils at schools with the fewest children on free meals. Tom Bennett, an expert on pupil behaviour who advises the DfE, said it was not remarkable that some schools suspended pupils at higher rates than others, as there was no \u201cright\u201d level of suspensions. \u201cObviously averages are just that, and some will be above, some will be below. Schools that serve more disadvantaged communities will almost by definition use disciplinary methods more frequently,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cSuspending might actually be the right thing to do. What are the school outcomes? Are kids doing well? Maybe the suspensions keep them safe. Suspensions are not a good or bad thing intrinsically, they are a strategy.\u201d Rates of suspension for individual schools vary widely from year to year due to differing policies or enforcement of behaviour codes, or whether schools prefer to use internal exclusions. Since the pandemic 45% of schools had higher suspension rates in 2022-23 than 2018-19, while 9% had lower rates. Six OGAT academies were among the schools that reduced suspensions the most."

            "date": "2024-08-04T06:00:25Z",
            "content": "Trainee doctors are at higher risk of burnout now than during the pandemic, with some describing how they have struggled with unsustainable workloads and inadequate support. The most recent figures published by the General Medical Council (GMC) in its national training survey of junior doctors and their trainers reveal the proportion of trainees feeling \u201cat a high or moderate risk\u201d of burnout is 63%. This is higher than in 2020 and 2021 during the pandemic, when the figures were 43% and 56% respectively, although a slight fall on last year. Mike Greenhalgh, deputy co-chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) junior doctors committee, said: \u201cThe burnout statistics from the GMC are shocking but sadly unsurprising \u2013 as too is the increasing trend of doctors taking time out of training, or choosing careers abroad and outside the NHS.\u201d The GMC survey \u2013 the largest annual survey of doctors in the UK \u2013 asked 74,000 physicians about their working environments, quality of training, wellbeing at work and workloads. It found 32% of trainees in emergency medicine were at high risk of burnout, the highest figure of any specialisation. \u201cThe survey results remain very concerning,\u201d the report said. \u201cA third of trainees in emergency medicine posts [are] measured to be at high risk of burnout, suggesting unsustainable workplace pressures have become the norm in this speciality.\u201d The warnings over the pressures faced by trainees come as the health secretary, Wes Streeting, hopes to resolve the dispute with junior doctors. The government and the BMA, the doctors\u2019 union, have struck an improved pay deal for junior doctors in England worth about 22% on average over two years. Members will now vote on whether to accept the deal. Victoria Selwyn, 27, a junior doctor, said that in addition to better pay, there needed to be more recognition that trainees were feeling burned out, as well as improved support. She said she was well trained, but that nothing can prepare a junior doctor caring at night for \u201ctwo or three hundred patients\u201d with one registrar across seven floors of a hospital. She described trying to stabilise deteriorating patients at night until her registrar was available. \u201cEveryone is stretched \u2026 and on these nights, your bleep is just constantly going off,\u201d she said. \u201cYour job ends up being multiple jobs and you\u2019re trying to split yourself a million different ways. You\u2019re wondering how you are meant to get through and prioritise the patients. You feel like you\u2019re spread too thin.\u201d She said there were challenges of a lack of staff during her training, with several colleagues needing time off from burnout. Selwyn added it could be demoralising that after such an intensive training environment it was often difficult to find a job in a chosen specialism. She hopes to train in psychiatry and believes more training posts would help create a better job structure for junior doctors. Michael West, professor of work and organisational psychology at Lancaster University, said: \u201cIf you wanted to design about the worst possible job at the start of somebody\u2019s career, the job of a junior doctor is it.\u201d West, co-author of the 2019 GMC report Caring for Doctors, Caring for Patients, said a lack of autonomy, poor working conditions and a culture of blame had contributed to a \u201ctoxic cocktail\u201d for junior doctors. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be effective and treat every patient as a human being.\u201d More than 9,000 junior doctors start work in hospitals each year across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Many take time off during or after their initial two years of work, with significant numbers complaining of stress and overwork. Nathan Robinson, 28, said he took time off from stress within six months of starting as a junior doctor in the summer of 2021. He said there was a \u201cmismatch\u201d between how medical students envisaged their profession and the reality of frontline roles. Robinson said while the workloads were gruelling, he found it particularly difficult that there was a lack of support and a blame culture when things went wrong. \u201cI never knew what I was going into,\u201d he said. \u201cIs it going to be understaffed? Is someone going to deteriorate?\u201d On one occasion in his second year of hospital training, he was the only doctor in his emergency unit dealing with \u201cmajors\u201d \u2013 patients attending with moderate to serious health complaints. He said he was assessing \u201cpatient after patient\u201d with no time to stop and think. \u201cWe forget sometimes there are lives on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are working 150% pretty much all the time, but no one seems to appreciate it.\u201d Robinson said there was no support or learning after particularly difficult shifts. \u201cI would come home, sit down and think: \u2018Wow, what even just happened?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe next day, it\u2019s like everything that happened the day before is a clean slate. No debrief. Nothing.\u201d A survey of 10,000 medical students by the British Medical Journal last year found that one in three UK medical students planned to leave the NHS within two years of graduating \u2013 either to practise abroad or to abandon medicine altogether. Some trainees say the frustrations and discontent have been compounded this year by a new system of allocation for their hospital training programme. While most get their top preference location, others are asked to move hundreds of miles from their home. Prof Colin Melville, medical director and director of education and standards at the GMC, said: \u201cOur analysis shows high risk of burnout is strongly associated with high workloads, a lack of or disruption of time to train, and feeling unsupported.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe findings from this report demonstrate the continued need to support the training and working lives of doctors and the importance of recognising the risk of burnout for doctors in training and the doctors who train them. We know there is more to do and so we are strengthening occupational health services and reviewing our mental health and treatment offer for staff to ensure everyone working in the NHS has the right support they need.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe deal being put to doctors will increase pay for junior doctors and see the BMA, NHS England and government work together to improve conditions, including by reviewing the current rotation system.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-11T11:00:12Z",
            "content": "A recently released study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows levels of sadness and hopelessness are improving in some US teenagers, and notably among girls. However,, the survey and experts said, challenges remain, as some metrics worsened in the most recent report. Of particular concern is a growing group of students who missed school because they did not feel safe. \u201cI was pleased to see a little bit of improvement\u201d in teenagers\u2019 mental health, Hedy Chang, executive director of Attendance Works, a nonprofit that works to reduce chronic absenteeism, told the Guardian. \u201cI think schools heard the message that they needed to invest more in social-emotional support and in a sense of belonging.\u201d It was a message echoed by top officials at the CDC, that came with a caveat: \u201cThe data released today show improvements to a number of metrics that measure young people\u2019s mental wellbeing \u2013 progress we can build on,\u201d said Dr Debra Houry, CDC\u2019s chief medical officer and deputy director for program and science, said in a release accompanying the data. \u201cHowever, this work is far from complete,\u201d said Houry. \u201cEvery child should feel safe and supported, and CDC will continue its work to turn this data into action until we reach that goal.\u201d The new data is drawn from the CDC\u2019s Youth Risk Behavior survey, an every-other-year report on sexual behavior, substance use, violent experiences and mental health among ninth-12th grade students. The survey measures these experiences across six demographics, including gender, sexual identity, race, ethnicity and grade, and began in 1990. This report reflects data from 2023, and provides the survey\u2019s first update since 2021. Then, in the teeth of the Covid-19 pandemic, experts saw a worrying deterioration in youth mental health that led the American Academy of Pediatrics to call for a national emergency declaration to address the crisis. Shoots of hope emerged between 2021 and 2023, according to the data. The overall number of students who report persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness has decreased from 42% to 40%. The number of female students who felt the same also decreased, from 57% to 53%. Hispanic students also reported a drop in feelings of persistent sadness (down from 46% to 42%), lower rates of poor mental health (from 30% to 26%), and decreases in who seriously considered a suicide attempt (22% to 18%) and who made a suicide plan (19% to 16%). Black students were also significantly less likely to report a suicide attempt in this survey (from 14% to 10%), and fewer were injured in suicide attempts (from 4% to 2%). Other challenges persist. The report continues to show disparities in youth mental health experienced by girls and LGBTQ+ students. Girls fare worse than male counterparts on nearly every measure of substance use, experiences of violence, mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. LGBTQ+ youth face similar disparities, with three in five experiencing persistent feelings of sadness of hopelessness. Worrying, the survey also found worsening concerning trends in school safety. More students were bullied at school (15% to 19%) between 2021-2023, and more students missed school because of safety concerns (increasing from 9% to 13%). The percentage of students who were threatened or injured at school also increased (7% to 9%). The percentage of girls and Asian American students who said they missed school because of safety was even more dramatic, respectively growing from 10% to 16% and doubling for Asian Americans, from 5% to 10%. \u201cI\u2019m Chinese American, and personally I feel less safe in the United States than I did 10 years ago,\u201d said Chang. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that one of the groups that feels most nervous is Asian American kids.\u201d Chang continued: \u201cWhen we\u2019re in a world outside that blames people \u2013 blames people for the pandemic, says they\u2019re a threat to the wellbeing of society \u2013 you worry both about how that plays out in schools. Schools are always, in part, a reflection of the world outside.\u201d"

            "title": "\u2018It\u2019s happening on the scale of a pandemic\u2019: the drug-resistant infections killing African babies",
            "date": "2024-08-08T11:00:06Z",
            "content": "Her tiny body hooked up to machines twice her size, her mother standing vigil at the side of her cot, Yusra was in a struggle for life. The baby had severe sepsis, which meant her body had turned on itself \u2013 her immune system attacking her organs. Doctors tried different antibiotics but none of the drugs were working. Yusra and her twin had been born two months premature, by caesarean section, in Woldia, a hill town in the Amhara region of northern Ethiopia where rebel and government forces are in violent conflict. Two years earlier, the hospital had been raided by a militia which stripped it of vital supplies. At six days old, Yusra\u2019s sister died for want of a blood transfusion. Fearing she would lose her second daughter too, Yusra\u2019s mother took her on a five-hour journey, past numerous military checkpoints, to a specialist hospital in Dessie. Sepsis accounts for one in three newborn deaths in Ethiopia. The condition, whereby the body overreacts to an infection, can be stopped by tackling infections with antibiotics. In Yusra\u2019s case, doctors had treated her with \u201cfirst-line\u201d antibiotics \u2013 drugs that are used on infections in the first instance \u2013 which proved ineffective. As they cycled through other types of antibiotics, the baby\u2019s condition deteriorated. Even if the doctors did find one that could save Yusra\u2019s life, her mother might not be able to afford it. Yusra has become a statistic in a growing global emergency. Increasingly, infections that would once have been easily managed with antibiotics are no longer responding to the drugs. In 2019, drug-resistant infections were linked to nearly five million deaths globally \u2013 more than HIV and malaria combined. More than 20% occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where the drugs that do exist can be in short supply, incorrectly prescribed and prohibitively priced. \u201cIt\u2019s happening on the scale of a pandemic,\u201d Prof Nicholas Feasey, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine tells the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. \u201cAfrican babies are dying in huge numbers because of this very widespread and severe illness.\u201d Antibiotics are the cornerstone of modern medicine. Without them, the risk of a deadly infection is present every time anyone undergoes routine surgery, gives birth or cuts themselves falling over. Since the Scottish microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic in 1928, it has been estimated that almost 500 million lives have been saved by penicillin alone. But antibiotics are fighting a moving target. The bacteria that cause infections react to their surroundings and, if given the opportunity, \u201clearn\u201d ways to fend off the drugs designed to kill them. In the last 25 years there has been an almost 50% increase in the amount of antibiotics used globally. They are increasingly prescribed by doctors as a first recourse for conditions that may not require them, while wealthy patients can demand what they think is a cure-all. Where resources are scarce, lack of access to diagnostic testing and vaccines can leave doctors with little choice. Overuse of these drugs \u2013 combined with a lack of clean water, sanitation and hygiene \u2013 has driven an alarming increase in antibiotic resistance, with medical progress against infections from typhoid to pneumonia in effect being reversed. Dessie\u2019s neonatal intensive-care ward has 50 beds. With referrals coming from across the region, the unit is constantly at full capacity. In a separate room to Yusra, a mother was breastfeeding her newborn, called Adonias, who was also battling an infection. Following complications during his birth, Adonias was showing signs of neonatal sepsis \u2013 trouble breathing, fever, poor feeding and tiredness. The family\u2019s local hospital did not have the tests to identify the bacteria causing the infection and therefore which antibiotics would have the best chance of treating it. They took a shot in the dark and prescribed Adonias the antibiotics most commonly used for sepsis. When days passed without improvement, Adonias and his mother travelled eight hours to Dessie. But again, the hospital did not have the tests and the doctors had to gamble. \u201cWe usually have to treat them blindly,\u201d says Tarekegn Bitew, a neonatal doctor in the Dessie unit. \u201cIf they don\u2019t improve with the first-line antibiotics, we suspect clinical drug resistance and blindly prescribe second-line antibiotics.\u201d The high concentration of sick people and widespread presence of antibiotics in hospitals can lead to bacteria surviving, getting stronger and spreading between patients. The wrong antibiotics prescribed by guesswork mean bacteria will continue to multiply and a patient\u2019s condition will worsen. In another neonatal ward, this time in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest city, Eniyoha, just a few weeks old, had been abandoned by her parents. Eniyoha\u2019s file was thick with notes detailing her condition, complications and treatments. She had been born eight weeks early with birth defects that would mean lifelong physical impairments. Her parents left without explanation; hospital staff thought it likely that they could not afford the hospital bill. Like almost all of the babies admitted here, Eniyoha had drug-resistant neonatal sepsis. With resources limited, staff swabbed the ward daily for bacteria, sending samples for tests in government laboratories; results were compiled and used to decide which drugs to use. So even without the means to test every baby, the staff now had a cheat sheet: a list of antibiotics with a higher chance of success. In Nigeria, one in 25 babies dies before they are a month old. Sepsis is one of the main causes. For premature babies such as Eniyoha, the odds of surviving a drug-resistant infection are low. Eniyoha had not responded to first or second-line antibiotics, so doctors were trying a third. In Nigeria, hospitals do not cover the costs of drugs, and for now, donations were being used to foot the bill. \u201cWe come across parents that can\u2019t afford treatment every day,\u201d says Folakemi Irewole-Ojo, medical director of the hospital, referring to the costs faced by patients needing antibiotics. \u201cIt\u2019s the long duration of treatment \u2013 by the time the preterm babies have spent two weeks here, [the parents\u2019] pocket is dry.\u201d It is the same in Ethiopia, where hospitals cover some drugs but not all, so trying the cheaper drugs first is standard. But if these fail, and a baby needs so-called \u201clast-resort\u201d antibiotics such as meropenem, then the hospital cannot cover the costs. A full course \u2013 about 20 vials \u2013 can cost five times average monthly earnings. \u201cIf we had testing in this hospital, we would be able to improve patient management,\u201d says Bitew. \u201cIt would also decrease the costs for the families.\u201d One vial of meropenem might sometimes be shared between three babies, to make the most of scant resources, but at the risk of encouraging infections across wards. Unsanitised equipment in hospitals with little clean water risks further contamination. \u201cHaving to share hospital equipment is a major source of drug-resistant infections among neonates,\u201d says Jonathan Strysko, an epidemiologist in Botswana. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact hospitals have major reservoirs [of bacteria], like equipment that can never be fully cleaned. \u201cWe need different ways of looking at infection prevention and controls in the hospital setting.\u201d In Lagos, the doctors\u2019 comprehensive notes and observations had done their job: Eniyoha\u2019s infection cleared. Social services are now trying to trace her parents. Back in Dessie, Adonias also continued to improve and was discharged from hospital. But Yusra did not respond to second-line antibiotics. Her mother tried to get hold of meropenem. It was on sale at pharmacies just outside the hospital gates, but she did not have the money to pay for it. Yusra died five days later. \u201cMost of the patients die,\u201d said Bitew. \u201cSome of them do improve.\u201d Patient access to testing equipment, vaccinations, clean water, sanitation and hygiene need to be addressed, says Feasey, warning that otherwise: \u201cThe frailest members of African society will continue to die.\u201d This story was produced in collaboration with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism"

The cut is part of a wide-reaching review of all investment decisions taken by the previous administration, the Financial Times reported. Reeves is looking to cut government spending to plug a \u00a322bn black hole in public finances, which she has said was \u201ccovered up\u201d by the Conservative government. Almost half of the shortfall, \u00a39.4bn, was a result of her decision to fund above-inflation public-sector pay recommendations in full, which reversed years of declining wages and saw off the threat of strikes. Hunt initially announced plans to provide government support to expand the Speke facility, near Liverpool, as part of his budget in March. AstraZeneca already runs a facility on the site, which employs 400 people, focusing on childhood vaccinations. The decision to cut funding by a third would come as a blow to AstraZeneca, whose chief executive, Pascal Soriot \u2013 the highest-paid boss in the FTSE 100 \u2013 announced last month that it was \u201cabsolutely ready to go\u201d with the scheme and hoped the investment could be concluded quickly. The FT reported that the government decision could even mean the project being relocated to France. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to making the UK one of the best places in the world to develop and manufacture new and innovative medicines. The chancellor receives regular updates on this planned investment in Speke, and we are in positive discussions with AstraZeneca to support its delivery.\u201d AstraZeneca has made a bigger push into the vaccine market in recent years after developing a Covid vaccine in collaboration with the University of Oxford, of which 3bn doses were administered globally. In May, it withdrew the vaccine from the market owing to a \u201csurplus of available updated vaccines\u201d that target new variants of the virus. On Tuesday, its stock market value hit \u00a3200bn for the first time, after its shares rose by 1%. AstraZeneca declined to comment."

            "date": "2024-08-23T04:00:24Z",
            "content": "Doctors have begun trialling the world\u2019s first mRNA lung cancer vaccine in patients, as experts hailed its \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d potential to save thousands of lives. Lung cancer is the world\u2019s leading cause of cancer death, accounting for about 1.8m deaths every year. Survival rates in those with advanced forms of the disease, where tumours have spread, are particularly poor. Now experts are testing a new jab that instructs the body to hunt down and kill cancer cells \u2013 then prevents them ever coming back. Known as BNT116 and made by BioNTech, the vaccine is designed to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease. The phase 1 clinical trial, the first human study of BNT116, has launched across 34 research sites in seven countries: the UK, US, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain and Turkey. The UK has six sites, located in England and Wales, with the first UK patient to receive the vaccine having their initial dose on Tuesday. Overall, about 130 patients \u2013 from early-stage before surgery or radiotherapy, to late-stage disease or recurrent cancer \u2013 will be enrolled to have the jab alongside immunotherapy. About 20 will be from the UK. The jab uses messenger RNA (mRNA), similar to Covid-19 vaccines, and works by presenting the immune system with tumour markers from NSCLC to prime the body to fight cancer cells expressing these markers. The aim is to strengthen a person\u2019s immune response to cancer while leaving healthy cells untouched, unlike chemotherapy. \u201cWe are now entering this very exciting new era of mRNA-based immunotherapy clinical trials to investigate the treatment of lung cancer,\u201d said Prof Siow Ming Lee, a consultant medical oncologist at University College London hospitals NHS foundation trust (UCLH), which is leading the trial in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s simple to deliver, and you can select specific antigens in the cancer cell, and then you target them. This technology is the next big phase of cancer treatment.\u201d Janusz Racz, 67, from London, was the first person to have the vaccine in the UK. He was diagnosed in May and soon after started chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The scientist, who specialises in AI, said his profession inspired him to take part in the trial. \u201cI am a scientist too, and I understand that the progress of science \u2013 especially in medicine \u2013 lies in people agreeing to be involved in such investigations,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cIt would be very beneficial for me, because it\u2019s a new methodology not available for other patients that can help me to get rid of the cancer. \u201cAnd also, I can be a part of the team that can provide proof of concept for this new methodology, and the faster it would be implemented across the world, more people will be saved.\u201d Racz received six consecutive injections five minutes apart over 30 minutes at the National Institute for Health Research UCLH Clinical Research Facility on Tuesday. Each jab contained different RNA strands. He will get the vaccine every week for six consecutive weeks, and then every three weeks for 54 weeks. Lee said: \u201cWe hope adding this additional treatment will stop the cancer coming back because a lot of time for lung cancer patients, even after surgery and radiation, it does come back.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve been in lung cancer research for 40 years now. When I started in the 1990s, nobody believed chemotherapy worked. \u201cWe now know about 20-30% [of patients] stay alive with stage 4 with immunotherapy and now we want to improve survival rates. So hopefully this mRNA vaccine, on top of immunotherapy, might provide the extra boost. \u201cWe hope to go on to phase 2, phase 3, and then hope it becomes standard of care worldwide and saves lots of lung cancer patients.\u201d The Guardian revealed in May that thousands of patients in England were to be fast-tracked into groundbreaking trials of cancer vaccines in a revolutionary world-first NHS \u201cmatchmaking\u201d scheme to save lives. Under the scheme, patients who meet the eligibility criteria will gain access to clinical trials for the vaccines that experts say represent a new dawn in cancer treatment. Lord Vallance, the science minister, hailed the launch of the lung cancer vaccine trial. \u201cThis approach has the potential to save the lives of thousands diagnosed with lung cancer every year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe back our researchers so that they continue to be an integral part of projects that produce groundbreaking therapies, like this one.\u201d Racz hopes once his treatment is over he can get back to running and achieve his lifetime ambition: completing the London Marathon."

            "date": "2024-08-27T13:32:19Z",
            "content": "The UN has said its ability to function in Gaza is being crippled by a flurry of Israeli evacuation orders, forcing Palestinians into ever smaller and more remote areas, days before a critical effort to contain a polio outbreak. Aid workers warn that without a humanitarian pause, a vaccination drive due to begin this weekend could fail to reach enough children to stop the spread of the virus, which was detected there this month for the first time in 25 years. A baby has already been partly paralysed by the disease, and health experts have warned it could spread rapidly given the terrible sanitation and overcrowding in camps for Gaza\u2019s exhausted, displaced population. \u201cOne thing for sure is that it\u2019s almost impossible to lead a polio vaccination campaign at scale in an active combat zone,\u201d said Jonathan Crickx, a spokesperson in the region for the UN child welfare agency, Unicef. Talks are under way between aid agencies and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) about the planned vaccination campaign. The IDF cooperated in the delivery of more than 25,000 vials of vaccine and refrigeration equipment through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza on Sunday, but their commanders have yet to agree to a pause in the bombing to allow the immunisation effort to go ahead safely and effectively. Israeli forces have significantly stepped up their clearance of neighbourhoods, including camps for the displaced, in what they said was the pursuit of \u201cterror operatives\u201d. According to the UN, the Israeli military issued a record 16 evacuation orders in August, forcing 12% of the territory\u2019s population to move within a few days. The overwhelming majority of those affected have already had to flee multiple times since the start of the war nearly 11 months ago. The impact of the orders on aid workers such as drivers meant that the UN had to halt movements around the strip on Monday, though staff already in position with supplies were able to continue their work. \u201cThese evacuation orders \u2026 make our work nearly impossible,\u201d said UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric. He added that the residual work still under way was \u201chalf a drop in a barrel\u201d compared with the needs of the 2.2 million Palestinians besieged in Gaza. Juliette Touma, the head spokesperson for Unrwa, the biggest humanitarian agency operating in Gaza, said: \u201cOur ability to undertake and implement humanitarian work is shrinking by the hour. Every time there are evacuation orders, we are affected, because our local staff are constantly on the move and they are the backbone of the humanitarian operation.\u201d The latest evacuation orders have targeted Deir al-Balah, a town in central Gaza that became a humanitarian hub after cities to the south such as Rafah and Khan Younis were targeted by IDF offensives. The latest edict on Sunday affected four UN warehouses in the town and 15 premises used by aid agencies. The orders are increasingly concentrating huge numbers of displaced Palestinians within a 41 sq km area of the Gazan coast at al-Mawasi, near Khan Younis. According to a report on Monday by the UN humanitarian agency, OCHA: \u201cThe severe overcrowding, with a density of 30,000 to 34,000 individuals per square kilometre, has exacerbated the dire shortage of essential resources such as water, sanitation and hygiene supplies, health services, protection and shelter.\u201d The refrigerated warehouse where the vials of polio vaccine are being stored is in Deir al-Balah, in a district not directly affected by the evacuation orders. However, the orders impede the ability of aid workers to move around and find the Gaza\u2019s scattered children, including more than 50,000 babies estimated to have been born since the start of the war who are very unlikely to have received any vaccinations at all. For the immunisation drive to be effective in containing the polio outbreak, the first of two rounds of vaccine must reach 90% of those babies and the rest of the 640,000 children in Gaza under the age of 10. This will need to be achieved quickly to break the transmission of the virus before it spreads or mutates. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical that this vaccination campaign is executed in a few days \u2013 between five to seven days is what we are asking for,\u201d Crickx said."

            "date": "2024-08-28T04:05:06Z",
            "content": "Policymakers who want to encourage the uptake of Covid vaccines should focus on communicating the risks of not having such jabs, research suggests. Researchers in China say they have found the approach, known as a loss frame strategy, is more persuasive in boosting people\u2019s willingness to get vaccinated than focusing on the benefits either to the individual themselves or to others. That, the team say, could be because focusing on gains tends to be beneficial when people think a certain behaviour is safe. \u201cVaccines may be considered risky, given their potential side-effects, despite their preventive characteristics,\u201d they write. \u201cTherefore, the loss frame strategy has advantages over gain frames in promoting vaccination.\u201d Writing in the Journal of Public Health, the researchers report how they randomly split 1,085 participants into four groups of similar size. Participants were all 18 or over, and had not yet received all of their Covid jabs. All participants were given information about the prevalence and mortality rate of Covid. However, while one group was given no further information, the others were given extra messaging, either explaining the individual benefits of vaccination, the benefits to others, or the risks from not getting vaccinated. The participants were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, whether they thought vaccination was effective in preventing people from contracting Covid, and their willingness to be vaccinated, also on a five-point scale. The results revealed that, overall, a greater perception of vaccination effectiveness was associated with a greater willingness to get vaccinated. The team also found groups that had received additional messaging were more willing to be vaccinated than the group that had not. However, the greatest willingness was seen among the participants who were told about the possible harms of not having a Covid jab, such as being more likely to develop severe Covid symptoms. Indeed, compared with the group given no extra messaging, participants in this group were 2.79 times more willing to get vaccinated. A further analysis suggested the three types of additional messaging could boost the positive association between perceived vaccine effectiveness and willingness to be vaccinated. Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist and public health researcher at Swansea University, said the results chimed with other studies showing that the perceived effectiveness of a vaccine affected how willing people were to take it. He said that was very relevant for Covid vaccines, given many countries were facing challenges in communicating that boosters were still effective, and important for certain groups. But, he said, while the new work suggested framing vaccine messages in terms of what you stood to lose by not getting vaccinated was more effective than framing them in terms of possible gains, it was not clear if the same results would be found in other countries. Some research had come to different conclusions. \u201cA number of studies have found that loss messages tend to work better for disease \u2018detection\u2019 messages, like \u2018get screened\u2019 to catch disease early,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas \u2018gain\u2019 messages work better for prevention behaviours, like \u2018get vaccinated\u2019 or \u2018eat healthy\u2019 to avoid disease.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-30T10:58:33Z",
            "content": "The World Health Organization has said it delivered 1.2m doses of polio vaccine to Gaza, with 400,000 more to follow, as part of an emergency campaign after the first case of the childhood disease in the war-hit coastal strip in a quarter of a century. The vaccinations, due to begin this weekend, will be accompanied by three-day pauses in the fighting in several areas of the territory to allow the inoculation of more than 640,000 children. However, UN officials warned that Hamas and the Israeli military \u201cmust respect\u201d the humanitarian pauses negotiated to allow the vaccinations, after two incidents this week \u2013 one deadly \u2013 when Israeli forces fired on aid vehicles, raising questions over how safely the vaccinations could be conducted. Underlining the scale of the challenge one WHO official said the plan was \u201cnot ideal\u201d but added that it would be feasible \u201cif all the pieces of the puzzle\u201d were in place. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, confirmed vaccinations were due to start on Sunday with daily pauses scheduled to take place between 6am and 3pm. UN officials have said the vaccination campaign will be carried out in three-day phases in different zones of the Gaza Strip. The campaign has been organised after the WHO said earlier this month that a baby had been paralysed by the type 2 polio virus, prompting UN agencies to urge an urgent vaccination effort. It will involve more than 2,000 health and community workers at several hundred locations. \u201cFrom Sunday, we\u2019re giving out two oral doses of the polio vaccination, and then four weeks after this initial round of campaigns we will need to repeat the vaccination again. This is for 640,000 children across the Gaza Strip,\u201d Louise Wateridge, a UN official, told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that we get this vaccination campaign out as soon as possible, and that we have the safety to do this, because the repercussions will be disastrous for not just children in the Gaza Strip but children in the region. And they have already been put through so much.\u201d In response to concerns over the safety of aid workers and families during the campaign, Catherine Russell, the executive director of Unicef, said the humanitarian pauses must be respected. \u201cUNICEF is ready to start the first round of the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza on Sunday to reach nearly 640,000 children. All parties MUST respect the area-specific humanitarian pauses to stop polio from spreading in Gaza and the region,\u201d she wrote on X. \u201cIf fighting doesn\u2019t stop, polio vaccinators are unable to reach children. Gaza has been polio free for 25 years until now. Failing to respect these pauses would be an unforgivable failure for the children in Gaza and the region, who have already suffered so much.\u201d On Thursday, an Israeli missile hit a convoy carrying medical supplies and fuel to an Emirati hospital in the Gaza Strip, killing five Palestinians from a local transportation company, the American Near East Refugee Aid group (Anera) said on Friday. Israel claimed without immediate evidence that it opened fire after gunmen seized the convoy. Sandra Rasheed, the Palestine director at Anera, said: \u201cThe convoy, which was coordinated by Anera and approved by Israeli authorities, included an Anera employee who was fortunately unharmed. \u201cDespite this devastating incident, our understanding is that the remaining vehicles in the convoy were able to continue and successfully deliver the aid to the hospital. We are urgently seeking further details about what happened.\u201d Anera planned to release more information on Friday. An Israeli military spokesperson, Lt Col Avichay Adraee, posted on X that \u201cgunmen seized a car at the head of the convoy (a Jeep) and began driving\u201d. Israeli forces had opened fire on aid convoys in the Gaza Strip before this week\u2019s incidents. The World Food Programme announced on Wednesday that it was pausing all staff movement in Gaza until further notice after Israeli troops opened fire on one of its marked vehicles, hitting it with at least 10 rounds. The shooting came despite having received multiple clearances from Israeli authorities. On 23 July, Unicef said two of its vehicles were hit with live ammunition while waiting at a designated holding point. A sustained Israeli attack on a convoy in April hit three World Central Kitchen vehicles, killing seven people."

            "content": "There are many ways of trying to make sense of tragedies involving people with severe mental illness (Nottingham attacks: series of errors led to Valdo Calocane being discharged, review finds, 12 August). Calls for new guidelines, changed legislation, and improved \u201crisk assessment\u201d, while well-meaning, are unconvincing, not least because that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening since the Clunis report 30 years ago. They miss how complex and profound the problems are. NHS clinicians operate in a context of rationing and scarcity, gaslit by their own organisations with talk of \u201cefficiency savings\u201d, \u201cflow\u201d and \u201cproductivity\u201d. This can sound an awful lot like the problem is with staff who are slow, lazy and inefficient. The service values high \u201cchurn\u201d and rapid discharge, viewing every inpatient admission as a failure of community care. On top of this sit highly fragmented services, which can shield clinicians from seeing the consequences of their decisions as the patient moves from one team to another. Still further is an ideological attachment to respecting patient autonomy that spills over into the respecting of autonomies highly distorted by psychotic illness, where the patient is certain there is nothing at all wrong with them; psychosis often involving a seductive invitation to collude with this denial. Practising careful, thoughtful psychiatry in this context is extremely difficult. Over time, clinicians (GPs as well as mental health staff) begin to have the experience of rarely seeing a person with psychosis get better. They start to believe that the patients are untreatable or are unable to benefit from services. And, of course, this makes premature discharge still easier. You cannot legislate your way out of what is fundamentally a problem of resources and a deeply rooted distorted culture. Dr Simon Wilson Consultant psychiatrist, London \u2022 I have just retired after 30 years as a consultant psychiatrist working in a community mental health team. Let me provide you with some context for the tragic events in Nottingham. Mental health services everywhere are under severe pressure after years of neglect and cuts. There are not enough inpatient beds, so it\u2019s difficult to admit people who are very unwell, even when detained under the Mental Health Act, and inpatient teams have to discharge quickly to poorly-staffed community teams. There is a lack of trained staff, money and social resources \u2013 all the result of repeatedly broken promises. Community mental health teams are particularly affected as they are right in the middle of this. The jobs are high pressure, exacerbated by understaffing and rising demand. It is impossible to work to a good standard. This context is always absent from any locally focused review following any shocking incident. Staff working on the frontline are acutely aware that they will be \u201cheld to account\u201d, yet they are in an impossible bind and understandably are tempted to manage the tension by turning away \u2013 by discharging patients they do not have the resources to effectively help. You\u2019d have to be superhuman not to become demoralised by the situation. Can we be surprised that staff are leaving and it is impossible to replace them? Dr Geoffrey Searle Bournemouth \u2022 Anybody with experience of either working in mental health or having recovered from severe psychosis knows that the world of the sufferer is completely dominated by delusions and hallucinations which may, in some cases, cause the individual to engage in violent behaviours that they would never engage in when well. Severe paranoid psychosis is not something that the sufferer is able to control without skilled and assertive therapeutic intervention, so often sadly lacking within our current mental health services. I have every sympathy for the victims in this case and the relatives of those who lost their lives. I also feel sympathy for the family of Valdo Calocane and for Calocane himself. They have also been severely let down by mental health services and have to live with the consequences for the rest of their lives. They are also victims and deserve our understanding and compassion.

            "content": "The government has told the families of the Nottingham attack victims it will slow down mental health care reforms in the wake of a damning report on the treatment that Valdo Calocane received in the years before the killings. Dr Sanjoy Kumar, whose daughter Grace O\u2019Malley-Kumar was one of three people killed in the attacks, said the health secretary had told the family that mental health reforms would be slowed down. \u201cWes Streeting, secretary of state for health, has promised us that he\u2019s going to slow down the modifications to the Mental Health Act,\u201d Kumar told Sky News on Tuesday. \u201cHe has promised that we will be able to work with people who are working with the law. A change is needed. We need to step back a little bit and really see what is safe for the public.\u201d In the king\u2019s speech in July, the government revealed plans to \u201cmodernise\u201d the Mental Health Act, which applies to England and Wales, and give patients \u201cgreater choice, autonomy, rights and support\u201d. They included plans to revise detention criteria so people could only be detained under the act if they posed a risk of serious harm, as well as shortening the period of time for which they could be detained. The government also said it would \u201cstrengthen the voice of patients\u201d by adding statutory weight to their right to be involved with planning their care, and making choices and refusals. Kumar said he wanted to \u201cget the Mental Health Act right\u201d and it was \u201cnot about depriving people of their liberty\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s about holding clinicians responsible who put people like that out on our streets,\u201d he said. \u201cAny psychiatrist who puts out a dangerous person on our streets has to be held responsible for putting that patient out if he has not done a comprehensive risk assessment. We really hope to be working collaboratively with Wes Streeting, who certainly has the will and the intention to get this right.\u201d Streeting said he wanted to reform the act in a way that would get the \u201cbalance right between recognising there are people whose liberties are being deprived today who could live safely in the community, but also recognising for others there needs to be much better and closer supervision so that people like Calocane are not able to be on the street causing risk or fatalities to others\u201d. Calocane, who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, killed O\u2019Malley-Kumar, Barnaby Webber and Ian Coates in Nottingham in the early hours of 13 June last year. He also seriously injured three other people when he drove a van into pedestrians. A Care Quality Commission (CQC) review of the mental health care that Calocane received in the years before the killings found \u201ca series of errors, omissions and misjudgments\u201d in his treatment. These included risk assessments that \u201cminimised or omitted\u201d key details such as the seriousness of his risk to others, and not opting to medicate him via depot injection, a slow-releasing form of medication, since he was not taking it himself. Calocane frequently refused to take medication when at home and showed \u201clittle understanding or acceptance of his condition\u201d, the CQC said. The report criticised clinicians for not assessing whether Calocane was in a position to make decisions about his care, saying his psychosis symptoms would have \u201cimpaired his ability to weigh up the information regarding the need for antipsychotic treatment and the risks of discontinuing it\u201d. Calocane declined depot injection and therapies, and frequently missed appointments. In response to the CQC report, Streeting said: \u201cI want to assure myself and the country that the failures identified in Nottinghamshire are not being repeated elsewhere. I expect the findings and recommendations in this report to be considered and applied throughout the country so that other families do not experience the unimaginable pain that Barnaby, Grace and Ian\u2019s family are living with.\u201d"

Her medical records show that she lost a baby only a few days after birth and now \u201cshe has become more difficult to live with\u201d. For that, she\u2019s incarcerated in Heathcote, a psychiatric hospital in Western Australia. Gwen was Leah Shelton\u2019s grandma, and the inspiration for Batshit, a one-woman show about \u201cthe pathologisation of women\u2019s mental health\u201d. Directed by Ursula Martinez, legend of provocative cross-genre shows, Batshit debuted in Australia in 2022. We open with Shelton as Gwen in a Stepford Wives get-up: ball gown, gloves, heels, perfect hair and makeup. And a gag. She sings Judy Garland\u2019s Get Happy. She dances around a mid-century TV and chaise longue that sit on institutional white tiles, one comically extended arm gripping an axe. The play fuses Shelton\u2019s magnetic performance with serious research, through clownish physical sequences, audio recordings of Shelton\u2019s mum\u2019s memories, patient case notes and educational videos. The TV regularly flickers into life. It shows historic vox pops of Australians debating the life of housewives, a court official reading out Amber Heard\u2019s histrionic personality disorder diagnosis, Shelton challenging people to name \u201ccrazy\u201d celebrities or find a male equivalent to \u201ccrazy bitch\u201d. Sometimes it\u2019s a tool of surveillance. Shelton teases out threads that connect 1960s Gwen to us today. She becomes doctor and we become patients in an effective segment on the shiftiness of diagnostic criteria. She reads out moving letters to her grandma and pays fierce tribute to famous women who met similar fates. Two years out from the show\u2019s premiere, the celebrity focus and the fact these topics have now been discussed widely in the context of Heard and Britney Spears, slightly dilute the emotional heft.

            "title": "Are wildfires linked to depression? How smoke can affect mental health",
            "date": "2024-08-07T16:00:08Z",
            "content": "Wildfire smoke, a major source of air pollution, is linked to severe health issues including heart attacks, strokes and lung diseases like asthma. Fire season brings other health hazards, too. When the skies darken with smoke and communities face potential evacuation and destruction, it can profoundly affect one\u2019s mental state. What is contributing to this feeling of smoke-season stress \u2013 or \u201cfire brain\u201d as it\u2019s sometimes called? Chronic and persistent smoke events are a relatively new phenomenon, and the body of research on their mental health effects is nascent. Nonetheless, research is beginning to reveal some connections that can help us better understand how these complex interactions impact our wellbeing, and inform potential solutions. How does wildfire smoke affect the brain? Air pollution affects our brain health and cognitive function. Researchers have found the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution released by wildfires is even more toxic than air pollution from other sources. One possible reason is the high level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) mixed with various levels of other known neurotoxic particles that can be found in smoke, including heavy metals. These particles can reach the brain via the olfactory nerve and pass through the blood\u2013brain barrier, or modulate the nervous system, leading to brain inflammation and oxidative stress. Can wildfire smoke affect cognitive function? Neuroinflammation caused by wildfire smoke increases the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Recent research from the Universities of Washington and Pennsylvania found that the odds of a new dementia diagnosis increased about 21% for every 1 microgram increase in the concentration of wildfire particles a person inhales, compared with a 3% increased risk for every 3 microgram jump in non-wildfire particles. Additional research from the University of New Mexico suggests that sudden increases in air pollution, as occur during wildfires, create surges of inflammation in the hippocampus region of the brain, responsible for memory and learning. These can linger for over a month after exposure. That may explain why, in addition to several studies finding a correlation between smoke exposure and poorer concentration and decision making skills while playing digital games and sports, smoky days also appear linked to poorer academic performance. In a 2020 study, UC San Diego economist and researcher Josh Graff Zivin examined how smoky air affected students taking China\u2019s national college entrance exam over a six year period. Graff Zivin specifically studied smoke created by routine, controlled agricultural fires, removing potential anxiety related to possible evacuations as a factor from the study. His team found that when there was a significant increase in fires upwind compared to downwind during the exam, students\u2019 total scores dropped by 0.6 points on average. This decrease in scores also slightly reduced students\u2019 likelihood of getting into top-tier universities. A US study from 2022 estimated that smoke exposure in 2016 reduced students\u2019 future earnings by nearly $1.7bn (or $111 per student). \u201cWe don\u2019t exactly know what\u2019s happening to the brain\u201d during heavy smoke days, says Graff Zivin. \u201cBut we know it\u2019s bad.\u201d The cardiovascular effects of smoke inhalation may affect our body\u2019s ability to properly oxygenate our brains. \u201cJust having impaired lung function could lead to cognitive impairment,\u201d he says. But more research is required to fully understand the extent to which smoky days affect cognitive performance. Nor do we yet fully understand the cumulative impact of being exposed to smoke for weeks or months each year, Graff Zivin adds. What\u2019s the relationship between smoky days and depression? It\u2019s not exactly clear how smoke may physiologically impact the brain in ways that contribute to feelings of depression, but researchers believe cognitive impairment \u2013 like that which Graff Zivin observed among test-taking students \u2013 can be a factor in low mood. Researchers also increasingly believe brain inflammation plays a role in producing depression, raising the possibility that brain inflammation triggered by wildfire smoke could contribute to mood disorders. The stress and trauma of a wildfire event can also affect mental health. UC San Diego School of Medicine neuroscientist Dr Jyoti Mishra studied people both directly and indirectly exposed to 2018\u2019s Camp fire, one year after it tore through Butte county, California. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she found that those who faced significant personal loss or trauma during the fires exhibited the highest levels of PTSD, anxiety and depression. Yet even community members who were not directly impacted by the fire reported increased neurocognitive issues, and struggled with depression and anxiety. Can wildfires cause environment-related anxiety? Some of the dread people living close to wildfires feel is related to \u201cseeing landscapes change, environments change, and worrying about both the present and the future,\u201d says Dr Warren Dodd, an associate professor in the School of Public Health Sciences at the University of Waterloo. Dodd has interviewed residents of Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories who experienced what was, in 2014, a record fire season. They reported feelings of anger, stress and hopelessness about the threats posed by climate change. In addition to the distress of witnessing one\u2019s environment change rapidly \u2013 also known as solastalgia \u2013 the people Dodd interviewed reported that stopping their summertime outdoor and land-based activities to shelter indoors had negative consequences for their mental health. What can we do about the mental health effects of wildfires? Curtailing the physiological effects of wildfire smoke on our brains involves many of the same behaviors as protecting the rest of our bodies from air pollution: using an air purifier at home, thoroughly cleaning living spaces to remove particulate matter that gets inside, wearing a mask outdoors and minimizing unnecessary time spent outside. When it comes to mitigating the psychological harms of smoky days, local authorities can spring into action. Making community resources available for free during wildfires is one way to help people alleviate some of the isolation and anxiety felt when sheltering indoors. For instance, Dodd notes that the city of Yellowknife waived fees for its indoor recreation center during the fire, allowing people to get some exercise and see their neighbors without having to be outside. Resilience is important for communities to focus on, says Mishra \u2013 not just after a climate disaster, but also preemptively. \u201cWhen we studied the Camp fire folks, we found that there are certainly some traits, such as greater mindfulness and better physical activity that can contribute to a sense of resilience,\u201d she says. But the strength of people\u2019s family and social connections were also a significant factor in their resilience. People who \u201cfeel supported and like there\u2019s a sense of community around you are best protected in terms of their mental health outcomes\u201d, she says. A stronger sense of community can be an antidote for loneliness and a tool for climate resilience, Mishra notes. For those experiencing PTSD, therapy for underlying neurocognitive issues can assist with recovery. As ever, prevention is key: reducing greenhouse gas emissions can slow global warming and help curb forest fires and their devastating, complex consequences. Graff Zivin believes that governments must bear in mind the economic repercussions of diminished productivity and cognitive function, and invest more heavily in wildfire prevention and forest health. A healthy forest maintained with prescribed burns can lead to less intense wildfires, he says. \u201cWe rarely talk about the value of having healthy forests.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-22T12:35:50Z",
            "content": "The Paris Olympics have provided a boost to the eurozone economy after a sharp rise in spending as athletes and spectators descended on the French capital for the summer sporting event. Figures from a closely watched survey of businesses showed monthly French private sector output rose to its highest level in 17 months in August. Economists said the growth in activity, fuelled by the French service sector as millions of tourists flocked to Paris for the two-and-a-half week sporting event, bolstered the figures for the entire 27-country bloc. The eurozone composite purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), conducted by the Hamburg Commercial Bank and S&amp;P Global, rose to 51.2 in August from 50.2 a month earlier, where anything above 50 signals growth. However, experts warned the Olympic boost masked a disappointing performance elsewhere, amid a slowdown in activity across the eurozone led by a collapse in manufacturing output, particularly in Germany. Bert Colijn, a senior economist for the eurozone at the Dutch bank ING, said: \u201cEurozone manufacturing continues to resemble Germany\u2019s performance at the Olympics: a big disappointment.\u201d Hosting the Olympic Games can deliver economic benefits, acting as a catalyst for construction, tourism and the events industry, as well as by raising the global profile of host countries and businesses. The UK government estimated that hosting the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games generated up to \u00a341bn for the British economy by 2020. The International Olympic Committee estimated the Paris Games could produce a $12.2bn (\u00a39.3bn) economic benefit within the \u00cele-de-France region, while the 2028 Los Angeles Games could provide an $18.3bn boost in output. However, while major sporting events can benefit some parts of the economy, they can also displace activity in other areas, making it difficult to quantify the net impact. Despite the boost to the French service sector, analysts warned the underlying picture for the wider eurozone economy suggested the outlook was weak enough to warrant another interest rate cut from the European Central Bank. Cyrus de la Rubia, the chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: \u201cA closer look at the numbers reveals that the underlying fundamentals might be shakier than they appear. \u201cThe boost largely comes from a surge in services activity in France, with the business activity index jumping by almost five points, likely linked to the buzz surrounding the Olympic Games in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s doubtful this momentum will carry over into the coming months, however. Meanwhile, the overall pace of growth in the services sector has slowed down in Germany, and the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing sector remains in rapid decline.\u201d Separate PMI figures for the UK showed a rise in output to the highest level in four months after a robust upturn in new order intakes, helped by an upbeat assessment of the domestic economic outlook by businesses. The reading on the UK PMI composite output index increased from 52.8 in July to 53.4 in August. Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said the figures suggested the Bank of England would probably wait until November before cutting interest rates again, and added: \u201cThe August PMIs point to an economy that is continuing to recover after last year\u2019s recession with output and employment rising and confidence remaining high.\u201d"

            "title": "Black US voters\u2019 economic priorities revealed in new advocacy agenda",
            "date": "2024-08-09T17:41:21Z",
            "content": "Black Americans strongly support initiatives that would increase the minimum wage to $17, make affordable housing more accessible and create an equitable tax system, according to Black to the Future Action Fund, a political advocacy thinktank. On Thursday, the group released a 55-page economic agenda based on its 2023 survey of 211,219 Black people across all 50 states. The organization hopes that the report will serve as a roadmap for elected officials to address policy holes, and for advocates to generate campaigns that hold politicians accountable. \u201cWe have to start imagining what it is that we want and not be so afraid to break out of what is,\u201d said Alicia Garza, founder and former principal of Black to the Future Action Fund, at a Thursday symposium in Atlanta. The agenda suggests a range of policy shifts around worker protections, housing, healthcare, childcare, higher education and taxes, along with examples of successful models already implemented by some state governments and municipalities. \u201cEconomic insecurity experienced by Black communities cannot be resolved solely by individual actions like working more hours, getting a college degree or saving money to buy a home,\u201d the agenda\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cThese issues are systemic, and government intervention is required to eliminate these inequities and improve outcomes for our people.\u201d Along with increasing the minimum wage to $17, the authors also recommended that elected officials pass labor protections for domestic workers, many of whom are Black women. The expansion of paid family and medical leave laws would help workers care for their household. And on the topic of affordable housing, the thinktank recommended laws that ensure rent payments are incorporated into credit scores so that renters have greater access to obtaining home mortgages. Another suggestion for affordable housing included the development of shared equity programs, which use public or private investments to build or buy homes that are then sold at a reduced rate to low-to-moderate income homebuyers. There are currently 250,000 shared equity models mainly in New York City, according to the agenda. Christopher Towler, a political science associate professor at Sacramento State University and director of the Black Voter Project, called the programs \u201ca really good model to try and get people into the housing market for there to be more first-time homebuyers\u201d. The origins of the US\u2019s persistent racial wealth can be traced back to the transatlantic slave trade, when enslaved Black people were barred from accessing capital generated by their forced labor. During the Reconstruction period after the civil war, then president Andrew Johnson rescinded the 40 acres (16 hectares) of land promised to formerly enslaved Black people. When Black communities did secure economic freedom, they were sometimes violently attacked by angry white mobs, including during the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, where an estimated 300 people were killed. Additionally, banks often denied home loans to Black Americans from the early 20th century until the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that outlawed housing discrimination. \u201cThe failures of Reconstruction have yet to be made up,\u201d said Towler. \u201cAnd a large part of that is the continued residential segregation and how Black Americans have been locked out, not only of the housing market, but of the resources, the wealth, the opportunity that comes along with where you live and your access to community.\u201d The legacy of systemic inequality has a continued impact on Black workers today, who earn less than US workers overall, according to 2022 Bureau of Labor Statistics data cited by Pew Research Center. The median weekly earnings of Black full-time wage and salary workers is $878, compared to $1,059 for all US workers, according to Pew. During Thursday\u2019s symposium, the actor and activist Kendrick Sampson, the singer and songwriter Trae Crockett, and the digital storyteller Conscious Lee spoke with Garza about the need for Black communities to brainstorm needed solutions and to band together to effect political change. \u201cWhen it comes to healthcare,\u201d said Lee, \u201ca lot of us \u2026 have internalized the Black inferiority when it comes to that industry. So for me, it\u2019s really reimagining what it looks like for my grandma to get affordable insulin.\u201d Black census respondents listed a lack of affordable healthcare as their fourth most immediate economic concern. Expanding Medicaid to the 10 states that have not done so under the Affordable Care Act could help keep rural hospitals open. \u201cThe communities most affected when these rural hospitals close often have significant Black populations,\u201d the report stated, \u201cand closure means rural residents must drive 25 or more miles to access medical care.\u201d While Towler lauded the agenda as the first one he\u2019s seen that addresses the concerns of Black communities nationwide, he believes that it will be a \u201ctough sell\u201d to mobilize Black voters. \u201cAny sort of policy promises right now are going to be looked at with some hesitations, simply because the Biden administration\u2019s policy agenda, although very numerous in its accomplishments, is still in some ways misunderstood,\u201d said Towler. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of knowledge with the common voter about how the policies that Biden passed have actually affected their individual lives.\u201d According to his research, Towler said that people are encouraged to be civically engaged when they\u2019re taught how political institutions uphold the status quo to resist change: \u201cIf you even want there to be a possibility of reparations, we have to continue to vote, continue to be active and continue to put in place policy makers and legislators that are working towards that.\u201d At the end of the symposium, organizers asked participants to share the agenda with their network and elected officials. In the eyes of the Black to the Future Action Fund, the electorate is capable of shifting policy through mass mobilization. \u201cWe are the power,\u201d Sampson said toward the end of the symposium. \u201cIf we all are in alignment and we go in the same direction, now we are more powerful.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-28T15:03:25Z",
            "content": "Before a whistlestop European tour to Berlin and Paris, Keir Starmer promised to mend \u201cthe broken relationships left behind by the previous government\u201d and drive forward UK economic growth. Changing the tone with European leaders is the easy bit. Changing the substance \u2013 especially finding new arrangements to boost growth \u2013 is a much taller order. Starmer, who reiterated in Berlin on Wednesday that growth was \u201cthe number one mission of my government\u201d, is not the first prime minister to find economic ambitions crimped by self-imposed red lines on Europe. Labour has ruled out rejoining the EU\u2019s single market and customs union, the steps that would have the biggest impact in improving trade with the EU. Instead, the Labour manifesto promised to tear down \u201cunnecessary barriers to trade\u201d by negotiating a veterinary agreement with the EU, improving access for touring artists to the continent and striking mutual recognition agreements for professionals. Such policies amount to little more than \u201ctinkering around the edges of the relationship\u201d and would do little to \u201caddress the continuing economic impacts of Brexit\u201d, concluded a recent report from the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe (UKice). Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility, backed by independent economists, has said its forecast for a 15% reduction in trade as a result of Brexit was \u201cbroadly on track\u201d. Academics at UKice expect that the veterinary agreement could boost UK agri-food exports by 22.5%, a lifeline for some small businesses but not decisive for the overall economy. Labour hopes it can deepen the economic relationship without joining the EU\u2019s structures. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, for instance, has suggested a \u201cbespoke\u201d arrangement for the chemicals industry to avoid \u00a32bn of extra costs mostly associated with duplicating EU requirements. Talk of bespoke deals raises the ghosts that haunted the Brexit negotiations, namely the UK taking the benefits of the single market free from the EU\u2019s common rules, enforcement or budget payments. \u201cPeople will soon rediscover there is a reason why there were red lines,\u201d a senior EU official told the Guardian. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is to have the single market cut in pieces. The UK \u2013 they are very good negotiators and they always want to cherrypick.\u201d That said, officials are not expecting the enormous mismatch of expectations that bedevilled the early years of Brexit negotiations under Theresa May. Starmer, a regular visitor to Brussels when he was Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, is well known in the EU capital. He and his team \u201care well advised\u201d, the senior official said. \u201cThey know what is feasible, what is not feasible.\u201d One EU diplomat from a large member state expressed concern that the UK government was not being straightforward with British voters about EU demands. \u201cThey have to be honest with their public. We are not a shelf you can pick things off,\u201d they said. The EU has been disappointed by Labour\u2019s dismissive response to a proposed youth mobility scheme that would allow people aged 18-30 to work, live, study or travel for up to four years. Nils Schmid, the foreign affairs spokesperson for Olaf Scholz\u2019s SPD party in the Bundestag, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that a youth mobility scheme was \u201ca major feature of our wishlist\u201d, but \u201cnot about immigration in a general sense\u201d. Yet when answering a parliamentary question about the scheme in July, Starmer framed it in general terms: \u201cWe are not returning to freedom of movement.\u201d In Berlin, however, he struck a more nuanced approach that seemed to leave the door open to some kind of youth mobility programme. The earlier outright rejection dismayed the EU, especially its repeated conflation of a time-limited youth mobility scheme with free movement of people, a lifelong right for EU citizens. The EU diplomat expressed disappointment over Labour \u201cdismissing it right out of hand because it looks like free movement [when] it is not free movement at all\u201d. The person added: \u201cI am personally surprised they think it\u2019s toxic when [the UK has] the same arrangement with others,\u201d referring to a UK-Australia agreement. Starmer\u2019s government will face other EU demands. France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and other coastal states want to ensure post-Brexit fishing rights are extended beyond June 2026 when current arrangements lapse. Meanwhile, the European Commission insists that the UK must fully implement existing agreements before negotiating new ones, amid concern over the rights of the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK. Late last month the commission announced it was moving forward with a legal case begun in 2020 that alleges that the UK government has failed to protect EU citizens in the UK. \u201cWe have two big agreements with the UK and we want them to be implemented,\u201d said a second EU diplomat, referring to the Brexit withdrawal agreement and subsequent trade and cooperation agreement. With Starmer expected to meet the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, soon and a UK-EU summit pencilled in for spring 2025, the government has more to do to repair the broken relationships of the past."

The queen of punk was in typically combative mood, deploring the waning energy of the street. British style, she claimed, had started promoting \u2018eccentricity for its own sake. We need to grow up and look around.\u2019 Youth culture was in an identity crisis, \u2018split into 100m fragments\u2019 according to Peter York, and displaying \u2018an extravagant and aggressive diversity\u2019. Marketing was no longer directed at the 16-24 age group but their older siblings; moneyed 25- to 35-year-olds were the target of new chains, such as Next and Principles. \u2018What has changed is the assumption that youth is something special, the only fount of spending money and therefore wisdom.\u2019 Critical hype rarely translated into commercial support in an industry unwilling to risk supporting homegrown early-career designers.

Just Seventeen followed a formula of \u2018fashion, fiction, popstars and straightforward advice\u2019 and avoided slimming stories: \u2018There\u2019s quite enough misery around without us contributing to it,\u2019 editor Dave Hepworth commented.

            "date": "2024-08-06T11:15:49Z",
            "content": "Young protesters in Kenya successfully demanded the withdrawal of a bill that would have raised taxes on everything from bread to vegetable oil and sanitary towels. Inspired by their neighbours, Ugandans marched against corruption. Nigerians rallied against \u201cbad governance\u201d and the soaring cost of living. Since the Covid pandemic, people have also taken to the streets in several other African countries including Ghana, Angola, Malawi and Senegal. While each protest has had unique drivers, they have some things in common \u2013 booming young populations struggling with high inflation, a lack of good jobs and a political class that they don\u2019t trust. \u201cHere in Kenya, if you look at these protests, actually, they were led by educated people. But most of them [were] jobless,\u201d said Anthony Kamande, an inequality researcher at Oxfam, based in Nairobi. Africa is a young continent \u2013 70% of the population is under the age of 30, according to the UN. Its population is expected to almost double in 30 years, to 2.2 billion. Gen Z and millennial Africans are better educated than the generations before them. Of 22 countries that provided data to Unesco for 2011 to 2021, the proportion of students going on to higher education fell in only three. However, more than 10 million people are entering the workforce each year in sub-Saharan Africa, vying for just 3m jobs, according to the World Bank. Many of those who don\u2019t get formal work hustle in the badly paid, risky informal sector. Unemployment was ranked as the most important problem by 18- to 35-year-olds surveyed by the pan-African survey organisation Afrobarometer. On top of this, the economic shocks of the past few years \u2013 Covid, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine sending food, fuel and fertiliser prices soaring, and the US central bank\u2019s interest rate hikes pushing up borrowing costs globally \u2013 have triggered cost of living crises in many countries. Inflation was still double-digits in about a third of sub-Saharan African countries earlier this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Nigeria, it is running above 34% after the removal of a costly fuel subsidy and a botched series of currency devaluations. These policy changes, which started when Bola Tinubu took office as president in May 2023, didn\u2019t cause protests immediately. \u201cPrior to the presidential election in 2023, each of the three candidates said FX [foreign exchange] liberalisation needs to happen and the fuel subsidy is unaffordable and needs to go,\u201d said Razia Khan, Middle East and Africa chief economist at Standard Chartered bank. \u201cThere was just an acceptance on the part of Nigerians.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a year after the initial fuel subsidy removal that we\u2019re seeing protests and that\u2019s really driven by the fact that the cost of living crisis has not eased meaningfully and that inflation continues to be at runaway levels,\u201d she added. In contrast, in Kenya, tax rises were never broadly accepted. Protesters \u201cfeel that those in government, and parliamentarians in some cases, should also bear the pain by cutting spending\u201d, said Yvonne Mhango, Africa economist at Bloomberg, pointing to the now-axed offices of Kenya\u2019s first and second ladies. Kamande, the Oxfam researcher, also blamed rising inequality and a debt crisis that has led to cash-strapped governments trying to raise taxes on ordinary people. \u201cWe need debt cancellation. It\u2019s long overdue \u2013 it should have happened yesterday,\u201d he said. Heavy debt burdens have swallowed up public spending. Kenya is spending a third of government revenues servicing its debt. In Ghana, half of government income went on debt servicing in 2022, before it defaulted at the end of that year. Ethiopia is also restructuring its debt, while trying to avoid the soaring inflation that Nigeria has experienced since devaluing its currency. The east African country let its birr currency weaken 30% against the US dollar last week. Later that day, the IMF signed off on a $3.4bn (\u00a32,68bn), four-year loan. Ethiopia is also expected to get $16.6bn from the World Bank over the next three years. While an artificially strong exchange rate is not necessarily sustainable, the fallout from devaluations can be painful, said Daouda Sembene, the chief executive of the Dakar-based consultancy Africatalyst. \u201cAttention also needs to be put \u2026 to make sure that those who are likely to suffer from it are protected,\u201d said Sembene, a former IMF executive director. Many of the pressures fuelling recent protests were not going away, said Charlie Robertson, head of macro-strategy at FIM Partners, which manages investments in emerging market countries: \u201cPolitical protest is all that educated youth have.\u201d"

            "content": "Fears of a US recession have gripped global markets, triggering a share market rout that prompted investors across Asia, Europe and North America to all unwind their positions \u2013 at the same time. The severe plunge has raised questions over whether investors are facing a historic share market crash \u2013 similar to the global financial crisis or 1987\u2019s Black Monday \u2013 or if it\u2019s simply an overdue pull-back after a stellar period of strong returns. What caused the market meltdown? The volatile conditions erupted after the US Federal Reserve hinted after its 31 July meeting that interest rates would soon be cut, in what was initially seen as a stimulus for shares. But the gains quickly evaporated as investors reinterpreted the impending rate cuts as a sign the world\u2019s biggest economy was faltering. Several pieces of economic data, including manufacturing, durable goods and \u2013 crucially \u2013 jobs and payroll data, raised questions over the health of the US economy, with the well-regarded \u201cSahm Rule\u201d signalling a recession. This indicator, which is triggered when there is a rapid rise in the unemployment rate, has correctly identified every recession since the second world war. AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said \u201crecession fears are now back with a vengeance, particularly in the US\u201d. Nick Healy, a Sydney-based portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, said that the US data proved to be softer than expectations, triggering a strong market reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to classify it as an unwinding of positioning but my view is that it\u2019s hard to extrapolate too strongly into the future from one month of economic data,\u201d said Healy. After a weekend break to digest the news, a rout took hold in Asian markets on Monday and swept through European and American markets later in the day. Wall Street\u2019s gauge of fear, the CBOE Volatility Index, shot up above 65; levels not recorded since the pandemic, and reminiscent of the GFC, before settling. The S&amp;P 500 lost 3% on Monday, while the tech-focused Nasdaq shed 3.43%. While both figures were remarkable, they were more modest than what the futures market initially pointed to, providing some relief to traders and raising hopes the sell off wouldn\u2019t turn into a full blown meltdown. Even after the losses, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is still up more than 9% since January, as is the Nasdaq. What was hit hardest? Shares, stock markets and indices that had risen the most tended to fall the furthest. Chip maker Nvidia, which has led a period of robust returns for the tech sector, was down by as much as 15% at one point on Monday, before halving its losses, while bitcoin also fell sharply. Australia\u2019s share market suffered its worst day since the onset of the pandemic, erasing more than $100bn in value from local stocks in a single trading session. But it was Japan\u2019s Nikkei which came under the most extreme pressure, plunging by 12% on Monday before rebounding strongly early on Tuesday. Investors have been concerned about the state of the Japanese economy and the recent effects of a strengthening yen, which has unravelled the so-called \u201ccarry trade\u201d, in which investors borrow cheaply in yen and buy higher-yielding assets including the US dollar. Analysts had warned that the yen carry trade was unwinding, triggering margin calls and forced selling. Online trading firm IG said that it suspected the frenzied market action in Japan was the \u201cfinal act of cleansing of long positions in the Japan trade\u201d, referring to investors who were caught up in the yen-carry trade. Some safe haven assets, such as bonds, proved to be among the few hiding spots from the turmoil, with the sharp moves challenging all the sure bets of recent months. That upbeat sentiment had been underpinned by optimism about AI technologies and the wider tech sector, along with expectations inflation would cool, job markets remain robust and economies emerge from the inflationary period intact. What happens next? While it\u2019s too early to tell whether the selling pressure will abate, at the very least the sharp falls are a warning shot. The global recession concerns of recent years have been tied to a fear that cost-of-living pressures will eventually depress spending to such an extent that economies will shift into reverse. One \u201ccanary in the coalmine\u201d investors look to is American online furniture and home goods company Wayfair, which warned on Thursday that customers were very cautious after recording a near 25% fall from peak spending levels recorded three years ago \u201cThis mirrors the magnitude of the peak-to-trough correction the home furnishing space experienced during the great financial crisis,\u201d Wayfair chief executive Niraj Shah said on the earnings call. While those discretionary spending figures support a case for an ensuing bear market, investors also have an eye on the upcoming US election and associated spending initiatives, which could act as another stimulus for shares. \u201cThere is a situation where both candidates and both parties are very happy to spend money which should keep fiscal dollars going into the economy,\u201d said Healy."

            "date": "2024-08-05T16:45:18Z",
            "content": "Choose the culprit behind the sudden sell-off in stock markets but a common theme in all top contenders is complacency. In the first case, it is the US Federal Reserve that stands accused, in the eyes of the market, of being asleep to the risk of a recession in the US. Friday\u2019s weak jobs numbers intensified the worry that policymakers have waited too long to cut interest rates. Even if a US recession in the next year remains unlikely in the eyes of most economists (a 25% possibility, says Goldman Sachs, upping its forecast from 15%), it\u2019s the difference from previous expectations that moves markets. At the start of 2024, virtually nobody was talking about a US recession; now it is a plausible outcome to be priced into models. The second example of complacency is the super, soaraway performance of the US technology sector. From early 2023 until mid-2024, the likes of Nvidia went upwards in a straight line, more or less. Sceptics who said that it all felt a little bubbly, and pointed to parallels with the late 1990s bubble in dotcom stocks, were ignored in the stampede. But we\u2019re now at a point where boring questions are being asked about when the vast sums of capital being invested in the AI revolution will earn a meaningful return. Given how far valuations have risen (even after the post-June mini-correction), it is impossible to say what a rethink might mean for short-term tech valuations. Momentum can work in both directions. Then there is the special contribution to complacency from Japan, where the Nikkei 225 index fell a spectacular 12% on Monday. A modest rise in interest rates in Japan last week (from an extremely low level) has upset a favourite market game of borrowing in yen to buy high-yielding assets elsewhere. The yen has risen by 10% against the dollar in less than a month, which is a huge shift. The scale of Japan-related moves on Monday carried the whiff of leveraged bets getting scorched on a grand scale. From that unlovely mix of market-moving factors, the US outlook is by far the most important. The Japanese carry trade has burned speculators many times in the past without causing wider damage. As for the AI revolution, investors in Nvidia are still sitting on a 100% capital gain this year, so should not be blind to the risk that it may be a case of too much, too soon. But nothing destroys stock market returns in all corners of the market quite like a recession. The good news, of a sort, is that a one in four chance of a US downturn, if the forecast is roughly correct, still represents decent odds of a gentle-ish landing. But the less clear part \u2013 and the element that will guarantee a twitchy summer as every piece of economic data is suddenly given extra importance \u2013 is waiting for the US Fed to act to cut rates, as bond markets are now in effect demanding. An emergency cut in interest rates feels highly unlikely, as things currently stand. Last week\u2019s job report was bad, but Monday\u2019s US services sector report pointed in the opposite direction by showing a strengthening in business activity and new orders. Thus plan A for the Fed will surely be to wait until its next scheduled meeting in mid-September. Anything else would be an admission of a mistake. But September suddenly feels a long way off. The S&amp;P 500 index, despite it all, is still up about 10% this year, which leaves plenty of room for further wild days if investors decide the Fed has made a terrible error and the recession odds are worsening. August could be a long month."

            "content": "Japanese stocks soared more than 10% on Tuesday, a day after experiencing their biggest fall in 37 years, setting markets tumbling in Europe and on Wall Street. Other markets in Asia also appeared to settle somewhat after the rollercoaster ride that started the week. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo closed up 10.3% \u2013 up 3,217 to 34,675, a record daily points rise \u2013 as investors bought into bargains after the 12.4% rout the day before. South Korea\u2019s Kospi index was up 3%, while Australia\u2019s ASX200 added 0.4% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was steady in morning trading. Markets on Monday started with a plunge reminiscent of 1987\u2019s Black Monday crash that swept around the world and pummelled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing US economy. Wall Street suffered its worst day in almost two years, while European markets also fell, with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 suffering its steepest one-day decline in more than a year. The drops on Monday were the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to the global sell-off, which began on Friday, after a US report showed employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the US economy to come in weaker than expected, raising fears the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation. Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan\u2019s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero. Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world. Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone, said after \u201cthe breathtaking and historic moves seen across Asian markets\u201d on Monday \u201cwe look for a solid counter rally on open today.\u201d Federal Reserve officials did their best to reassure markets with Fed San Francisco president Mary Daly saying it was \u201cextremely important\u201d to prevent the labour market tipping into a downturn. Daly added that her mind was open to cutting interest rates as necessary and policy needed to be proactive. The comments underpinned market expectations that the Fed would cut by 50 basis points at its September meeting, with futures implying an 87% chance of such an outsized move.

            "date": "2024-08-01T20:31:53Z",
            "content": "US investors triggered a major sell-off on Wall Street on Thursday set off by fears that the job market is cooling, manufacturing is slowing and the Federal Reserve has left cutting interests too late to head off a recession. The Dow Jones fell nearly 500 points (1.2%), while the S&amp;P 500 was also down 1.3%. A series of disappointing results from tech companies have led to sell-offs in big tech. After a rally on Wednesday following Meta\u2019s second-quarter earnings results, which were better than expected, the tech-heavy Nasdaq\u2019s index was down 2.3%. The bad news continued after markets closed with Intel announcing 15,000 layoffs and Amazon releasing disappointing results. Two economic data points released on Thursday appeared to spook investors. One measurement of manufacturing activity by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) hit an eight-month low in July, while the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits hit an 11-month high last week, according to data released on Thursday. \u201cThe ISM is really what started the ball rolling today and then selling causes more selling,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls &amp; Snyder in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re still in earnings season and there will be positive surprises that will probably drive the market higher and there may be negative surprises as well \u2026 but if you get something negative like ISM, it causes profit-taking.\u201d Despite Thursday\u2019s stock sell-off, the stock market has still had a relatively strong year, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq up 14.3% and 16% this year, respectively. Both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq registered their biggest daily percentage gains since February in the prior session, boosted by a rally in chip shares after the Fed kept rates steady, as expected. Thursday\u2019s data came a day after the Federal Reserve announced it would keep rates at a two-decade high until September. Investors expected rates would be held steady, and many expect the first cut to come next month. But while the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, confirmed that the central bank would be willing to drop rates soon, any cut would only come if inflation over the summer proves to be somewhat stable. Inflation in June was 3%, one of the lowest months since prices started rising in 2021. \u201cIf inflation were to prove stickier, and we were seeing higher rates of inflation and disappointing readings, we would weigh that along with other things,\u201d Powell said on Wednesday, though he added that the Fed was also focused on the labor market, the other half of the Fed\u2019s \u201cdual-mandate\u201d. Unemployment in June hit 4.1% \u2013 the highest its been since 2021. The Fed\u2019s next meeting is 20 September. Reuters contributed reporting"

            "date": "2024-08-11T10:12:40Z",
            "content": "Back in the 1930s, the French government constructed what it thought was an impregnable defence system to prevent a repeat of the German invasion at the start of the first world war. The Maginot Line might have looked impressive but proved to be a white elephant because when the attack came in 1940 it was in a different place altogether. In the past week the financial markets have displayed something of a Maginot Line mentality. They are right to think there is a threat lurking out there but they are wrong to think the biggest danger is a recession in the US. The real threat comes from elsewhere. To be sure, the US economy is slowing down, but it is not remotely close to recession. Unemployment is rising but from historically low levels. The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has left it a bit late to cut interest rates but it can make up for lost time over the coming months. The US economy has staying power and \u2013 as in the past \u2013 is likely to confound the pessimists. After an extreme bout of the jitters, by the end of last week Wall Street seemed to have come round to the idea that the US is on course for a soft landing. That looks by far the most plausible outcome. There are two other sources of potential trouble: the Middle East and China. Far too little attention is being paid to the risks that the war in Gaza escalates into a full-scale conflict between Israel and Iran. In the past, this kind of ratcheting up of tension would have led to a sharp increase in the cost of crude, but it hasn\u2019t happened. A Middle East-induced oil shock has been the dog that hasn\u2019t barked. For now. One reason rising tension in the Middle East has not been reflected in commodity markets is that China\u2019s growth prospects have taken a turn for the worse. The belief in the financial markets is that policymakers in Beijing will take action to stimulate the economy and that the slowdown will be temporary. Again, this is a questionable assumption. China\u2019s problems are structural and have big implications for the rest of the world. For decades it has relied on a growth model based on building up industrial capacity through massive state investment and cheap credit. The concentration on manufacturing has resulted in relatively weak levels of consumer spending coupled with a rapidly deflating property bubble. A recalibration of this model \u2013 shifting the balance away from investment and exports towards consumption \u2013 is long overdue. Social safety nets offer far less protection than they do in the west, and it has proved impossible for the domestic economy to absorb all the goods produced by China\u2019s factories. The excess capacity has been sold as exports, leading to huge trade surpluses. From time to time, China\u2019s leaders flirt with the idea of changing tack but are wedded to the strategy that has resulted in the country becoming the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. In the 1990s, it was this model of export-led growth that helped push down inflation in the west \u2013 and it is doing so again. Goods prices in the UK in June were 1.4% lower than a year earlier \u2013 partly the result of China flooding the market with cut-priced goods. Writing in Foreign Affairs magazine, Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, notes that China is producing twice as many solar panels as the rest of the world can put to use, while almost a third of car manufacturers are unprofitable. \u201cChina is producing far more output than it, or foreign markets, can sustainably absorb. As a result, the Chinese economy runs the risk of getting caught in a doom loop of falling prices, insolvency, factory closure, and, ultimately, job losses,\u201d she says. The mismatch between supply and demand has meant Chinese companies have had to cut their prices, resulting in falling profits, and even deeper discounting as they struggle to pay off their debts and remain afloat. There are already signs of stress. Growth looks as if it will undershoot this year\u2019s 5% target set by officials in Beijing. Export figures released last week failed to meet market expectations. A measure of the money supply, which has a track record as a lead indicator of future growth, is flashing red. Two things differentiate the China now from the China of the 1990s. First, the problems of overcapacity and overproduction have intensified. Second, western governments are no longer prepared to sit back and allow their own industries to be wiped out. They have whacked tariffs on Chinese goods and \u2013 in the case of the US \u2013 offered generous subsidies to domestic producers. There are a number of ways this could play out. China might bow to western pressure, voluntarily limit its exports, and recast its whole economic model. This seems highly improbable. Far more likely is that tensions between the west and China intensify rather than ease. Beijing insists it is not guilty of dumping its excess production on global markets, while Washington and Brussels insist it is. China is already trying to divert exports through third countries in order to avoid western tariffs but has so far resisted the temptation to introduce tit-for-tat measures of its own. A short-term risk is that the west\u2019s protectionist actions lead to higher prices, higher inflation and higher interest rates. A longer-term risk is of the west adding to the global glut goods by ramping up its own production. In that event, the rate of profit would fall and global capitalism would face of a crisis of its own making \u2013 just as Karl Marx predicted."

            "content": "The Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, has downplayed the role of government spending in keeping inflation elevated, citing consumer spending and China\u2019s slowdown as bigger influences on Australia\u2019s economic trajectory. \u201cI want to be clear that public demand is not the main game,\u201d Bullock told the House of Representatives economics committee on Friday. Instead, she pointed to consumption, residential construction and trade as \u201cthe big swing things that are going to impact us over the next year or so\u201d. Bullock\u2019s comments come 10 days after the RBA left the cash rate unchanged for a sixth board meeting in a row, with Bullock warning that an interest rate cut was unlikely this year. A week ago, she also said the bank wouldn\u2019t hesitate to lift the rate if annual inflation wasn\u2019t on track to reach its 2%-3% range. The RBA has raised its forecasts for the pace of growth in spending by federal, state and local governments to an annual clip of 4.3% by December and 4.1% by next June. That compared with its projections three months earlier of spending growth rates of 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively, prompting some to speculate the central bank\u2019s inflation efforts were being undermined by public sector profligacy. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Three months earlier the bank had projected spending growth rates of 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively, prompting some to speculate its efforts to rein in inflation were being undermined by public sector profligacy. Still, inflation remained \u201ctoo high\u201d and its reduction from an annual 7.8% peak at the end of 2022 \u201chas been slow\u201d, Bullock said. \u201cBased on what the board knows at present, it does not expect that it will be in a position to cut rates in the near term.\u201d Among the threats posed to the country\u2019s economic fortunes, China\u2019s weak growth was \u201ca risk that\u2019s very pertinent for us\u201d, Bullock said. China was easily Australia\u2019s biggest trading partner but also critical for the prices of commodity exports, particularly iron ore. Massive over-building \u2013 with enough completed apartments to meet years of demand in many cities \u2013 has dented consumer sentiment but also curbed output from steel mills and other sectors of the economy. \u201cThat is something that we\u2019re watching quite closely because developments in China can have quite a big impact on the way our trade develops, and therefore on our growth,\u201d she said. RBA officials also downplayed a rise in insolvencies as firms struggled with higher interest rates. The recent increase was against \u201cabsolutely historically low levels\u201d during the pandemic, Bullock said. \u201cI you look at the trend of insolvencies over time, we\u2019re not even back to where we were trend-wise, pre pandemic.\u201d The assistant governor, Brad Jones, said the construction sector had been \u201cfront and centre\u201d to the rise in firms going bust, but they were typically very small enterprises with \u201clow single-digit number of employees\u201d. In the past six months there had been \u201csome levelling out in the stress in the construction sector\u201d, Jones said, but noted pressure was building in the arts, hospitality and some segments of the retail space."

            "date": "2024-08-14T14:55:20Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s annual inflation rate rose to 2.2% last month \u2013 its first increase since December last year \u2013 and is expected to remain above its 2% target for the rest of the year. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the government\u2019s preferred measure of the cost of living climbed again as domestic energy bills fell by less last month than in July 2023. Gabriella Dickens, G7 economist at Axa Investment Managers, said July\u2019s rise was not a one-off. \u201cThe headline rate will rise again over the next few months, as the sharp declines in energy prices in 2023 are not repeated. We expect inflation to end the year marginally in excess of 2.5%,\u201d she said. The Bank said earlier this month that it expected the consumer prices index measure of inflation would continue rising and peak at about 2.75% before falling back again. Despite the prospect of inflation continuing to rise, July\u2019s increase was slightly smaller than the increase to 2.3% anticipated by the financial markets, and prompted speculation of possible back-to-back interest rate cuts when Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee meets next month. Borrowing costs were cut from 5.25% to 5% earlier this month. Prices fell by 0.2% in July \u2013 helped by cheaper hotel stays \u2013 but this was smaller than the 0.4% decrease in prices in July 2023, when energy bills dropped sharply, meaning that the headline rate of inflation increased. The energy price cap, set by the industry regulator, Ofgem, fell by 8.6% in July 2023 but by 7.2% in the same month this year. The ONS\u2019s chief economist, Grant Fitzner, said: \u201cInflation ticked up a little in July as, although domestic energy costs fell, they fell by less than a year ago. This was partially offset by hotel costs, which fell in July after strong growth in June.\u201d Core inflation \u2013 which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco \u2013 rose by 3.3% in the year to July, down from 3.5% in June. Inflation in the services sector, which is closely watched by the Bank\u2019s interest rate setters, fell from 5.7% to 5.2% last month. The fall in services sector inflation was largely because of falling hotel prices, which dropped by 6.4% in July compared with an 8.2% rise the previous year. The ONS said it doubted whether the drop in the cost of a hotel room could be attributed to the ending of price hikes caused by Taylor Swift concerts in June, which some analysts had suggested. Martin Sartorius, a principal economist at the employers\u2019 lobbying group the CBI, said: \u201cInflation undershooting the Bank of England\u2019s expectations will be seen as a positive sign that price pressures are continuing to normalise for households and businesses. \u201cToday\u2019s data will give the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee some measure of confidence that domestic price pressures are less likely to derail a sustainable return to the 2% target.\u201d Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cThe new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited, with many families still struggling with the cost of living. That is why we are taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe chancellor must not use this data as an excuse to break her promises and hike up taxes \u2013 tax rises she had planned all along.\u201d The money markets now indicate that there is a 40% chance that the Bank Rate will be cut to 4.75% next month. Before Wednesday\u2019s data, a September rate cut was only a 36% probability, according to City pricing. The ONS figures coincide with the publication of a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank showing that poorer UK households faced significantly higher food price inflation than richer households during the height of the cost of living crisis between 2021 and 2023. The ONS said food and non-alcoholic beverage prices had risen by 1.5% in the year to July 2024, the same rate as the year to June. The June figure was the joint lowest annual rate since October 2021, when it was 1.3%, but for the first time since March 2023 the annual rate did not come down, the ONS said. Although the pace of food-price inflation has moderated, the cost of groceries has increased by 32.6% since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Gas prices are up by 68% and electricity prices by 45%. July\u2019s retail prices index inflation figure, which was 3.6% last month, was historically used to set the following year\u2019s annual rail fare rise until 2023. The Department for Transport has not revealed whether this will now be used to determine changes in the cost of train travel. A spokesperson said: \u201cNo decisions have been made on next year\u2019s rail fares but our aim is that prices are as affordable as possible for passengers.\u201d"

            "content": "Eurozone inflation fell this month to its lowest since June 2021, adding to the case for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates in September. Inflation in the single currency bloc dropped to 2.2% in August, down from 2.6% in July, and barely above the ECB\u2019s 2% target. The ECB, led by Christine Lagarde, is weighing up whether to cut interest rates at its next meeting on 12 September. In June it cut its main interest rate from 4% to 3.75%, the first downwards move since 2019. Central bankers around the world are trying to engineer \u201csoft landings\u201d \u2013 bringing inflation below target while avoiding recession. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, last week said \u201cthe time has come\u201d for lower interest rates in the US, although the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has warned he is hesitant to cut rates too quickly. The expected round of interest rate cuts comes as the bout of price increases during the chaos of the Covid pandemic has faded. Supply chains were disrupted by pandemic lockdowns, leading to steep price rises, before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused global energy prices to soar. In August it was falling energy inflation that had the biggest effect on dragging Europe\u2019s harmonised index of consumer prices down, according to Eurostat, the EU\u2019s data agency. Core inflation, which strips out the more volatile components including energy prices, dropped slightly from 2.9 to 2.8%, but services inflation ticked up from 4% to 4.2% as hosting the Olympic Games in Paris pushed up French services prices. Bert Colijn, a senior economist for the eurozone at Dutch investment bank ING, said he did not expect core inflation to drop below 2.5% for the rest of the year. \u201cThe ECB has arrived on a long home straight when it comes to bringing inflation back to target,\u201d Colijn said. He added that the modest decline in inflationary pressures and expectations for slowing inflation next year should be enough to persuade the ECB to cut rates in September. However, he also said: \u201cThis remains a slow and gradual process of releasing the brakes on the economy as the ECB continues to be concerned about upside risks to the inflation outlook.\u201d Eurozone unemployment also edged down unexpectedly from 6.5% to 6.4%. Central bankers tend to be wary of cutting interest rates when unemployment is falling because it can be a sign of shortages of workers that could lead to inflationary pressures building. Transactions on financial markets on Friday implied that a cut to the ECB\u2019s main interest rate of 0.25 percentage points is a near certainty, with two more expected before the end of the year. Sam Miley, the forecasting lead at the Centre for Business and Economics Research, warned that \u201cthe higher rate of core inflation and continually tight labour market will present risk factors to implementing looser monetary policy\u201d."

            "date": "2024-08-28T13:00:05Z",
            "content": "Back in 2019, $100 worth of groceries may have lasted a week for a household of two. Today, that same $100 will probably only buy enough groceries to stretch for a couple of days. In the last four years, food prices have increased a whopping 22%, and consumers are feeling the pinch. Even though inflation has recently fallen below 3% for the first time since 2021, food prices remain stubbornly high, and are still predicted to increase. Some food companies such as General Mills are continuing to raise prices of their products 4% this year, with profits jumping to $670.1m. Kellogg\u2019s raised the price of cereal by 12%. It\u2019s an issue that will take center stage in the upcoming presidential election: last week the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, called for a ban on price-gouging. Meanwhile, hunger is growing in the US: according to the US Department of Agriculture, 44.2 million people in the US lived in food-insecure households in 2022, up from 33.8 million in 2021. Earlier this summer the Guardian asked readers across the US how they were experiencing grocery-store inflation \u2013 which foods give them the biggest sticker shock and how this has changed their shopping habits. Readers reported soaring prices for nearly all types of food \u2013 fresh fruits and vegetables, bread, cereal, milk, eggs, cheese, seafood, meat, particularly beef, packaged snacks, soft drinks and even pet food. Here, some of them share their strategies for coping with the ever-rising cost of food, from couponing, to cutting out meat to growing their own vegetables. \u2018I am rediscovering peanut butter sandwiches\u2019 I am less likely to pick up something spontaneously, and now I shop the reduced rack at the grocery store. I am rediscovering peanut butter sandwiches and do not buy cakes or cookies \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper and more satisfying to make them from scratch. I no longer buy red meat; funnily, we haven\u2019t missed it much. Before cutting out red meat we would have grilled steak or stir fry or stew; now it\u2019s completely beyond my purse. I shop by price, whatever is on sale and chicken and pork are often reasonable, but I would say even they are a once-weekly ingredient. Produce has shot up, a 5lb bag of carrots has gone from $2.99 to $4.99. A loaf of bread is now $4.99. I used to consistently pay $2.99 before Covid and inflation. Now it\u2019s summer, we eat lots of things from our garden and veggies grown by neighbors who are eager to share. As I am over 65, I shop at a store that gives older people 10% off on Tuesdays. I use coupons but only buy what I need and normally buy. I am trying harder not to waste anything and often freeze leftovers. Lisa, 66, semi-retired paralegal, Middletown, Maryland \u2018We\u2019ve planted a garden from heirloom seeds\u2019 We\u2019re trying to rely on more cheap vegan options for protein. We\u2019re not buying as many processed foods, instead buying dried beans, rice, lentils in bulk bins and then just having to plan way ahead so that we can prepare food from these dried ingredients. Don\u2019t be scared of dried beans, you can make so many yummy things and it\u2019s so much less expensive. Plus, rice is an inexpensive way to fill up a kid\u2019s never-ending stomach. One of everyone\u2019s favorite meals is a red lentil curry with rice and naan, which is also one of the least expensive meals to make when you\u2019re using dried lentils and canned chickpeas. We also love doing lentil tacos and Spanish rice. I usually take around an hour at the grocery store but I have my system down pat! I always go to the same grocery store and a map of it exists in my head so my list is in order of the store. It has to be this way or it would take forever as I try to only shop once every two to three weeks, which makes it less likely I\u2019ll buy something on a whim. We\u2019ve also planted a garden from heirloom seeds that should return each year to try to help with the high cost of produce. We\u2019ve invested in chickens for eggs and to help keep the cost down for chicken feed, we give them any excess produce we can\u2019t eat in time from the garden. Cory Forsey, 32, with two school-aged children, director at a startup, Lehi, Utah \u2018All the choices that I make are strictly down to budget\u2019 Right now I shop for, cook for and feed seven. All the choices that I make are strictly down to budget. We purchase two gallons of milk a week at $3.39-$3.89. It used to be $1.89 a gallon. We now spend $30 a month or $1 a day on milk. This is how all grocery staples are: twice the price. Food prices are a huge contribution to our stress and financial insecurity. Majority of the time, my husband and I only eat two meals a day. But I\u2019m pregnant now and I don\u2019t want to skip meals, so I\u2019m trying to be really mindful of getting the nutritional value. The kids always have three. We never buy anything outside the staples unless it is \u201con sale\u201d (AKA the price the product used to be) or clearance. We never buy name-brand or organic. So much of our income is used for food \u2013 we no longer buy new clothes, shoes or new things for us parents. We are in the most credit card debt of our lives. I shop online, mostly Safeway, and search for the lowest price. For example, I select meat, then beef and filter the search result to organize by lowest price. During my pregnancy, I\u2019ve been craving cherries all summer, but they\u2019ve been $5 a pound at the cheapest. I just can\u2019t spend that, even though they would be what I wanted to buy. Every checkout I meticulously decipher the complex coded receipt and always find I have been overcharged (never undercharged) for items with a digital coupon. You do have to carefully read each coupon\u2019s terms because sometimes they are tricky, like you have to buy a totally different product for a deal. And it lets grocery stores advertise that they are saving you money when most people are really just being charged more. SR, 41, Colorado Springs, Colorado \u2018I plan meals around the cheaper items\u2019 Fresh produce has increased significantly in price, while quality has declined. I recently saw a watermelon with seeds selling for $16. While I\u2019ve found some for less, I never imagined a price like that would happen. I make use of sales, clearances and seasonal price reductions, planning meals around the cheaper items. The clearance rack goods aren\u2019t necessarily low-quality, they are often items that just aren\u2019t popular, and marked down before the expiration date. It helps to be flexible in one\u2019s diet, which applies to brand selections as well. Unless there is a definite difference in quality, I\u2019ll buy whichever brand is less expensive. Sorry, MegaFoodBrand, I\u2019m not loyal to any of you. Reducing waste is a key component to keeping the grocery bills low: eat everything you buy, and preserve what you can by freezing, drying or canning to maximize the shelf life. Grow a few vegetables at home if you\u2019re able. Some plants are low-care and prolific producers. Wolfie, Detroit, Michigan \u2018Night of a thousand leftovers\u2019 We\u2019ve been slowly cutting out meat, and I\u2019d describe our diet as flexitarian. We\u2019re also fans of eating leftovers; I make it fancy by calling it \u201cnight of a thousand leftovers\u201d. Want pancakes with pasta? Aces, go for it. I shop at different stores for different items, but thankfully they\u2019re near each other: a Mexican grocery store for produce, Aldi for dairy and other staples, a restaurant supply store if I\u2019m buying meat. I am fortunate to have a car to get around, so the trip will take me at least two hours, and that\u2019s me shopping with surgical precision. Shopping around the holidays makes me apoplectic as it may double shopping times. For all the talk of inflation going down, I\u2019ve not seen it on staples. Bread, milk, cereal, cheese and meat are a killer. Often, stores will put things on sale for the holidays, but most of it is over-processed food like hotdogs, potato chips, soda. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love a good hotdog, but you can\u2019t live on them. I\u2019ve tried. Tracie Bedell, 54, writer and caterer, Chicago, Illinois \u2018I\u2019ve almost completely quit buying things that aren\u2019t good for me\u2019 I probably spend two hours a week grocery shopping, that includes looking at websites and flyers that promote discounts. My Costco membership is valuable because I can\u2019t buy the groceries I get there at similar pricing anywhere else. Processed foods with a lot of added sugar are expensive \u2013 but cheap to make and high-profit items, so I just don\u2019t buy that stuff. With the bad stuff I\u2019ve quit eating or drinking, I can afford the price increases I see on the healthy foods. I often find a type of meat that\u2019s on sale, like chicken or pork, and I\u2019ll get a couple pounds of that to use as the protein in a meal in my slow cooker and fill the rest of it with dried beans that were soaked overnight. Bananas have remained steady or gone down in price. I would guess it\u2019s because it\u2019s perishable, but that has not been the case with avocados. Vexing because I like them and they don\u2019t keep very long. I\u2019ve almost completely quit buying things that aren\u2019t good for me. But I do buy stuff I shouldn\u2019t eat when it\u2019s discounted back to regular pricing \u201con sale\u201d. Notably, ice-cream. Tim, 71, semi-retired, San Diego, California \u2018I spread my shopping around to three grocery stores\u2019 I see three types of grocery price increases: price increases based on product value, such as organic, no artificial coloring, no hydrogenated fats; inflation, such as wages and other costs of doing business; and corporate gouging. I am very loyal to the stores and companies that treat me fairly. But gouging-level price increases at my usual grocery store are so egregious, that company is no longer my friend. Now, I spread my shopping around to three other grocery stores; two of them are within half a mile of each other, the third is 11 miles away. For non-food items such as dog food or over-the-counter medication medications and supplies, I sit at my computer and search the internet for the best deal. As for giving anything up? We continue to maintain our food and nutrition level, but we now rarely eat out at restaurants, and have even cut down on cherished coffee shop visits.

            "date": "2024-08-10T16:00:47Z",
            "content": "We should care more about being overcharged for the things we buy. After three years when UK shop prices have rocketed by about 20%, it is reasonable to examine whether the extra cost is justified and whether the government should have done more to protect us. From the evidence it is clear that in too many cases the extra cost cannot be justified and governments have failed to intervene, doing much to undermine the foundations of social democracy. At the heart of the problem is the trend towards monopoly that characterises many of our most important industries \u2013 those where large companies have acquired huge marketing power and have found ways to cajole, entice and even bamboozle their customers to enhance their profits. Some industry giants are household names, like Google, Amazon, Nestl\u00e9 and Procter &amp; Gamble. Others lurk in the shadows, acting as brokers or distributors. Well-known or shadowy, they all make billions of pounds in profits and distribute large proportions of their gains to senior management. They protect their income streams by buying rivals, lobbying politicians and using the latest marketing methods to convince their customers they are getting a good deal. Google is a good example and last week the US authorities signalled a clampdown on its monopolistic activities. In what is considered to be the most important anti-trust case for at least two decades, Judge Amit Mehta found that Google\u2019s 95% stranglehold on the search engine market was achieved by blocking almost every avenue to rival products, allowing it to dominate advertising sales. With a stock market value of about $2tn, making it bigger than the annual income of Australia, South Korea or Spain, Google\u2019s owner Alphabet has the resources to appeal and has said it will. One can only hope that the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, which first brought the case to the courts almost a year ago, refuse to buckle and continue to scrutinise big tech companies for alleged monopolistic practices. To show the case is not isolated, Amazon is also under scrutiny for allegedly abusing its power as a monopolist. Again, the lawsuit is about Amazon\u2019s search function, and how it allegedly artificially inflated the prices paid by consumers. One complaint asserts that Amazon makes discount sellers invisible on its online marketplace in favour of its own registered sellers when a customer types in a search term. Amazon denies the allegations. These are the systemic and systematic methods used to maintain high prices. Rivals are kept at bay and the potential for lower prices is denied. As if this wasn\u2019t bad enough, the past three years have seen a form of exploitation that capitalises on a crisis to make lots of money. Isabella Weber, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, calls it \u201csellers\u2019 inflation\u201d, which happens when the corporate sector manages to pass on a major cost shock to consumers by increasing prices to protect or enhance its profit margins. This happens even when the increase in raw materials or other costs have abated, but the company claims it is still affected. Nestl\u00e9 improved its margins during the pandemic and so did Procter &amp; Gamble. They were not alone and inflation went up as firms with market power told shoppers they, and not investors, would pick up the tab. However, only oil and gas companies, Shell and BP among them, were singled out for windfall taxes. Politicians understand little of these trends and that\u2019s because economists in positions of power believe in markets. They believe any interference will have little effect. Weber has highlighted the case of shipping companies, which profited from a jump in the demand for goods, including medical supplies, during the pandemic. Can it be true that the only way to overcome a rise in shipping costs when the next crisis hits will be to increase the number of container ships, even though that will take years and no government is going to build them and park them in a port ready for an emergency? She reckons shipping costs added a full two percentage points to inflation between 2021 and 2022. Surely the solution is for governments to take a large slice of the profits and use it to subsidise prices? Otherwise, the combined effect of sustained monopolies, highlighted by the Google and Amazon cases, and the profiteering seen during the recent crisis, will push low- and middle-income household finances to the edge. Politicians need to prevent profiteering year in year out, and tackle it when there is a crisis, or risk a transfer of wealth from consumers to investors that destabilises previously healthy economies. At the moment, politicians in the UK don\u2019t acknowledge there is a problem. The Competition and Markets Authority has blocked several mergers, but its resources are stretched and it lacks the kind of political backing to crack down on corporate influence that regulators in the EU and US have. That needs to change."

            "date": "2024-08-23T06:30:27Z",
            "content": "If you were under the impression that the opposite of a cynic is an easily hoodwinked person of low mental horsepower, then Jamil Zaki, a professor of psychology and director of Stanford\u2019s Social Neuroscience Lab, has news for you. The idea that cynics are somehow more astute is the first of many notions demolished in this succinct, uplifting book. Cynics perform less well in cognitive tests and \u201chave a harder time spotting liars than non-cynics\u201d. They are wrong more often than optimists, and the damage to their wellbeing, and to society, is higher than that incurred by their hopeful counterparts. Like an autoimmune disease, what starts out as a misguided defensive reaction ends up causing self-harm. (Zaki is careful early on to distinguish between \u201cbig-c\u201d Cynics of the ancient philosophical tradition, and the cynicism \u201cmost of us know today\u201d \u2013 which can be summarised as a lack of faith in our fellow humans.) Zaki has been studying \u201chuman goodness\u201d, and illuminating how connection, empathy and kindness operate in the world for the past 20 years. His team have found that most people are basically pretty decent, valuing \u201ccompassion over selfishness\u201d. Donating money lights up the brain just like eating chocolate, and \u201chelping others through stress soothes our own\u201d. This is a refreshing contrast to the modern, highly individualised conception of \u201cself-care\u201d, which, unmoored from community and solidarity, has mutated into the sad fetishism of bubble baths and misinterpretation of party invitations as demands for \u201cemotional labour\u201d. Cynicism is bad for us on several levels. Cynics are sicker, more depressed, drink more and die younger than their less cynical counterparts. On a societal level, \u201cstudy after study finds that cynical beliefs eat away at relationships, communities, economies, and society itself\u201d. Conversely, people who live in high-trust communities are longer-lived, healthier and happier \u2013 benefits Zaki translates into the equivalent of a 40% pay rise. And yet, over a 50-year period, cynicism has risen dramatically. The proportion of Americans agreeing that \u201cmost people can be trusted\u201d fell by 20% between 1972 and 2018. Zaki\u2019s data focuses on the US, but his findings can certainly be applied more widely. This \u201ctrust recession\u201d has serious social consequences. Zaki introduces various juicy phenomena linked to cynicism, including populism, conspiracy theories and political polarisation. He rejects the notion that cynicism is a radical, stick-it-to-the-man worldview, reframing it as a \u201ctool of the status quo\u201d wielded by propagandists to foment distrust and increase elite control. He explores how and why an apparently ordinary California woman fell prey to QAnon, touching on the psychology underlying our most basic existential needs. He makes a link to attachment theory \u2013 ideas about how the way we are attuned towards caregivers from infancy can set the pattern for our adult lives and relationships. Zaki also highlights the fact that economic inequality \u2013 regardless of the total overall wealth in a nation \u2013 erodes trust. People who live in more unequal places \u201ctend to be polarised, hostile, stressed, lonely, materialistic and mistrustful.\u201d Much of Hope for Cynics chimes with the late epidemiologist Hans Rosling\u2019s work. Like Rosling, Zaki claims our perceptions of how terrible the world is and the statistics themselves are wildly mismatched. Bad news gets far more clicks than good, after all. For example, data shows that public perception of rates of violent crime has risen steadily since 1990, while actual figures show rates of violent crime falling overall. Yet both Zaki and Rosling\u2019s arguments raise the same gnawing doubt. Despite the buoyancy of their message, the world is nevertheless full of people experiencing horrific, avoidable suffering. This demands feeling and action from the rest of us. By settling into a sense that the world isn\u2019t all that bad, really, we risk slumping into inexcusable inaction. Zaki addresses this, saying he has worried that hope might be \u201cthe sweetener that helps oppression go down easier\u201d. But it feels like an inadequate afterthought given what is happening presently in Gaza, Sudan and Congo. Perhaps his invocation of \u201chope mixed with fury\u201d strikes a better balance. As much as being eternally optimistic could induce stagnation, the paralysis that despair invites can be far worse. Zaki\u2019s choice of epigraph by Rebecca Solnit offers a way forward: \u201cHope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch \u2026 [It] is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency.\u201d \u2022 Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness by Jamil Zaki is published by Robinson (\u00a322).

            "content": "The job listings portal Seek has flagged a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in job advertisements, sparking hot competition for a dwindling number of roles. Revenue derived from Seek\u2019s Australian and New Zealand operations dropped 8% to $840m over the financial year as ad volumes fell 20%. The recruitment platform earns the majority of its income from organisations who pay to list jobs on its sites. Weaker than expected job ad volumes weighed heavily on Seek\u2019s overall result as annual earnings fell 13% to $483m, prompting a double-digit sell-down in the company\u2019s stock early on Tuesday. The chief executive of Seek, Ian Narev, said he expected paid ad volumes to keep falling in Australia and New Zealand this financial year \u201cbased on our historical experience of similar conditions\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup There is currently heightened interest in job numbers, with any significant rise in the 4.1% unemployment rate to push Australia closer to a recession. The Reserve Bank factors in the jobless rate when making interest rate decisions. The Bureau of Statistics will release new jobs data on Thursday. A jump in the US jobless rate to 4.3% earlier this month triggered volatility on global share markets over fears the world\u2019s biggest economy could fall into recession. In its recent jobs report, Seek found ad volumes had fallen well over 20% in Victoria and New South Wales, led by weakness in the hospitality, tourism and technology sectors. This had resulted in more applications per job ad, creating \u201cextremely high\u201d competition for roles. E&amp;P Capital analyst Entcho Raykovski described Seek\u2019s financials as a \u201cweaker than expected\u201d and noted its \u201cguidance will disappoint\u201d. Many Australian corporates are now releasing their annual earnings, offering insight into how companies are trying to attract consumers grappling with high living expenses. While the early pandemic shopping boom saw many retailers expand profit margins by charging customers more, there are now signs consumers have the upper hand. Retailers Myer and Nick Scali have released subdued figures, while electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi has boosted its discount and promotional activity to retain customers. Mark Coulter, the chief executive of Temple &amp; Webster, said on Tuesday the furniture and homewares retailer had \u201cbucked the trend\u201d by delivering improved results despite significant cost-of-living pressures on customers. The retailer recorded a 26% lift in revenue over the financial year, although its profit margins have narrowed."

            "title": "UK economy continues recovery from recession with GDP growth of 0.6%",
            "date": "2024-08-15T12:33:26Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy has extended its recovery from recession after recording growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, handing a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to the autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product continued to grow in the second quarter, after a rise of 0.7% in the first three months of 2024. The reading matched the forecasts of City economists. However, monthly GDP growth was flat in June as wet weather deterred shoppers from spending in what has been a washout summer for retailers. Ben Jones, the lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said the figures showed the economy had \u201cfinally shaken off its slumber of recent years\u201d, but warned there were still challenges to sustainably boosting Britain\u2019s long-term growth rate. \u201cWe think the quarterly data probably overstates the underlying momentum in the economy, with recent CBI surveys of activity remaining fairly subdued,\u201d he said. \u201cBut firms nonetheless appear confident that the recovery will continue.\u201d According to the latest snapshot, service sector output increased by 0.8% in the second quarter, powered by scientific research and development. There was also strength in the IT, transport, law, architecture and engineering sectors. Consumer-facing service output fell by 0.1%, reflecting a weaker period for purchases of physical goods amid the cost of living crisis and poor weather hitting retail sales. Manufacturing and construction output also fell. The UK has grown at a faster pace this year than many forecasters predicted, in a development seized on by the shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as evidence that the previous government had helped the economy to turn a corner. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are yet further proof that Labour have inherited a growing and resilient economy. The chancellor\u2019s attempt to blame her economic inheritance on her decision to raise taxes \u2013 tax rises she had always planned \u2013 will not wash with the public,\u201d he said. The latest figures show the UK recorded the strongest growth in the G7 group of advanced economies over the past six months. The second-quarter growth rate of 0.6% compares with 0.3% in the eurozone, and 0.7% in the US. However, it comes after a lacklustre performance over the past decade, and high living costs, elevated interest rates and faltering productivity gains are acting as a brake on momentum. The UK economy entered recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP \u2013 in the second half of last year as households cut back on spending. Reeves has said rebooting the economy is Labour\u2019s number one priority, arguing that stronger growth will help to boost living standards and raise more tax revenue to repair battered public services. The chancellor will deliver an autumn budget on 30 October. \u201cThe new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited after more than a decade of low economic growth and a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we have made economic growth our national mission and we are taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.\u201d Experts said the recent strength in the economy would be unlikely to last. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised its growth forecast from 0.5% to 1.25% for 2024, but warned of a weaker medium-term outlook as high interest rates hit activity. Figures released on Wednesday showed inflation rose by less than expected in July to 2.2%. The continued strong GDP growth in the second quarter of the year may mean that the Bank delays interest rate cuts until past September, according to financial market bets. The Bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 5% when rate-setters meet next month, before making a 0.25%-point rate cut at the following meeting in November. Much of the recent expansion has been driven by a growing population. The latest figures showed GDP per head, an important barometer of living standards, was 0.1% lower than a year earlier in the second quarter, and 0.8% below pre-pandemic levels. Simon Pittaway, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s medium-term record is far less impressive, and has been driven by a growing population rather than rising productivity. \u201cWithout a return to productivity growth, living standards will continue to stagnate and Britain will continue to fall behind its peers.\u201d"

            "content": "More 15-year-olds are reporting low life satisfaction in the UK than anywhere else in Europe, amid what experts are describing as a \u201chappiness recession\u201d for British teenagers. The group is at the bottom of European rankings in terms of life satisfaction across 27 nations, analysis by the Children\u2019s Society reveals. In the UK 25% of 15-year-olds reported low life satisfaction, compared with 7% of Dutch children of the same age \u2013 the lowest level among any of the countries surveyed. British girls are particularly affected, as are children from disadvantaged backgrounds, with food poverty highlighted as a key reason behind the poor wellbeing numbers. \u201cAlarm bells are ringing,\u201d said Mark Russell, the chief executive of the Children\u2019s Society. \u201cUK teenagers are facing a happiness recession, with 15-year-olds recording the lowest life satisfaction on average across 27 European nations.\u201d In 2021-22, children aged 10 to 15 recorded mean scores for happiness with their life as a whole, as well as with their friends, appearance, school and schoolwork, that were all significantly lower than in 2009-10, the report found. Levels of low life satisfaction are at least twice as high among UK 15-year-olds as among their peers in Finland, Denmark, Romania, Portugal, Croatia and Hungary. The study uses data from the UK Longitudinal Household Survey from 2021-22 and the OECD\u2019s programme for international student assessment (Pisa) from 2022. The findings come amid growing concern at school absences, long NHS waiting times to receive mental health support and increases in the cost of living in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis pushing more families into poverty. \u201cChildren and young people deserve better,\u201d the report says. \u201cDecisive action and national leadership are needed to overturn the decline in children\u2019s wellbeing. We know that these experiences are not lived in a vacuum \u2026 The pandemic, rising levels of poverty, concerns over young people\u2019s safety, the climate emergency and other stresses have put a strain on young people\u2019s lives and can prevent the experience of a happy and fulfilled childhood.\u201d Dutch teenagers have ranked as among the happiest in the world for several years, with supportive parents, low inequality, teachers who are not authoritarian but accept the feelings of pupils, and high levels of self-determination \u2013 for example cycling to school and being allowed to decide when to come home. At the weekend the TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp sparked a debate about whether parents who restrict teenagers\u2019 freedom were \u201cinfantilising\u201d them, after social services contacted her after she allowed her then 15-year-old to go Interrailing in Europe independently. \u201cBeing trusted, being confident, makes you feel better about yourself and happy,\u201d she said. \u201cSo are our kids anxious because we are fearful, we are holding them back, and this is leading them to be depressed?\u201d On Tuesday the Guardian revealed more than 500 children a day in England were being referred to NHS mental health services for anxiety, more than double the rate of before the pandemic began. The Children\u2019s Society study, published on Thursday, also revealed that the largest gap in life satisfaction between the most and least disadvantaged 15-year-olds was in the UK. The charity found many parents were struggling to provide basic necessities for their children, with just over one in five parents and carers finding it difficult to afford a hot meal daily, almost a quarter unable to buy a warm winter coat and just over a quarter struggling to provide daily fresh fruit and vegetables."

            "title": "Fear of US recession rattles global markets as tech shares fall",
            "date": "2024-08-02T11:56:00Z",
            "content": "Stock markets in Europe, Asia and New York tumbled on Friday as fears of a US economic slump grew and technology shares were hit by underwhelming earnings. Concerns that the US could be sliding towards a recession spurred a global sell-off, which accelerated after a poor employment report on Friday showed that the US jobs market was cooling fast, pushing up the unemployment rate. Economists fear the US economy could be weaker than central bankers at the Federal Reserve had realised, and could force the Fed into a sharp cut in borrowing costs in September \u2013 or even an emergency rate cut before that \u2013 to stimulate demand. \u201cThe sharp slowdown in payrolls in July and sharper rise in the unemployment rate makes a September interest rate cut inevitable and will increase speculation that the Fed will kick off its loosening cycle with a 50bp cut or even an intra-meeting move,\u201d said Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics. The weak jobs report added to anxiety after data this week showed weakness in the US manufacturing sector, and disappointing results from semiconductor maker Intel, which hammered its shares. The tech-focused Nasdaq index lost 2.4% to finish in correction territory \u2013 10% off its record high \u2013 after the latest US non-farm payroll report showed that only 114,000 jobs were created last month, compared with the 175,000 analysts expected. In another blow, the US unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.3%. Japanese equities suffered their worst day since the Covid-19 pandemic rocked markets in 2020; the Nikkei 225 share index tumbled by 5.8% to its lowest closing level since January. The broader Japanese Topix fell 6.1%, Australia\u2019s ASX fell 2.5% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was down 2.1%. Europe\u2019s main stock indices also declined on Friday, with European technology stocks falling to their lowest level in more than six months. France\u2019s CAC 40 hit its lowest level since last November, down over 1%, while Germany\u2019s Dax lost 2%. The Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer ASML\u2019s shares fell 9.6%, while the rival ASM International dropped 13.7%. \u201cThe past 24 hours have seen an increasingly precarious backdrop for risk markets, with a risk-off mood on the back of another batch of weak US data yesterday followed by mostly downbeat tech earnings overnight,\u201d said Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, on Friday morning. In London, the FTSE 100 blue-chip share index lost more than 120 points at one stage, down 1.5%. Friday\u2019s sell-off followed a rough day\u2019s trading on Wall Street on Thursday, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.2%, or almost 500 points. This was triggered by data showing US manufacturing activity dropped to an eight-month low in July amid a slump in new orders, and a jump in the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits to an 11-month high. New orders for US-manufactured goods fell by 3.3% in June, data on Friday showed, adding to anxiety that economic demand was tailing off. The Fed left US interest rates on hold on Wednesday, but hinted that a rate cut was close. Financial markets are now pricing in a 100% chance that the Fed will cut rates in September, with a large, half-point cut seen as a 60% chance after the weak jobs report. \u201cThe Fed remain wary about inflation, but this week\u2019s employment cost index and unit labour cost data should really have boosted their confidence that inflation is on the path to 2%. Their focus needs to be the state of the jobs market,\u201d said James Knightley, ING\u2019s chief international economist. The US dollar weakened, lifting the pound by 0.5% to $1.28, and the euro by 1.2% to $1.092. Intel\u2019s shares plunged over 28% after it announced plans to cut more than 15,000 jobs globally as it tries to \u201cresize and refocus\u201d its business. Amazon shares were down 10% after it missed sales forecasts and disappointed analysts with its latest outlook. Shares in the chipmaker Nvidia fell 2.7% after a report that the US Department of Justice had launched an investigation into complaints from competitors that it may have abused its market dominance in selling chips that power artificial intelligence. Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said rising economic pessimism meant August had got off to a bad start for global stock markets. \u201cAn economy going through a bad patch is one catalyst for a central bank to cut rates and hopefully stimulate activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis thought process is likely to be at the top of the agenda for the Fed this week after shocking US economic data that featured bigger than expected jobless claims and contraction in manufacturing. The narrative has changed from rate cuts equating to good news to rate cuts meaning measures to avoid recession.\u201d While shares slid, gold hit a fresh record on Friday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets. Gold futures at one point on Friday were up $25.70 (\u00a320.17), or 1%, to $2,506.40 an ounce."

            "date": "2024-08-20T15:40:06Z",
            "content": "I suspect that as with many people reading Alexandra Heminsley\u2019s article, my jaw dropped on reading the outcome of the trial for two reasons (Yes, bystanders can save women from sexual assault. But I know first-hand that\u2019s not always enough, 17 August). First, that someone can be found not guilty because of the impact that a guilty verdict would have on their lives rather than whether they were guilty of the crime in the first place. Second, because of the way that the magistrate (who should be relieved of their post) framed his decision through such a patriarchal, Victorian view that women who are pregnant are more likely to be emotionally unstable. This harks back to times when women were judged to be \u201chysterical\u201d and therefore their views and accounts of events could not be relied on. How on earth does anyone holding those views have the privilege of dispensing justice today? These views are not only abhorrent but have no place in a functioning justice system. No wonder women continue to be failed by the system. There should be a way for anyone, from magistrate to supreme court judge and every post in between, to be held to account for bringing personal beliefs into the courtroom. They have no place there, where justice should be delivered on the evidence and the probability of guilt rather than being dispensed through anachronistic, outdated beliefs. I hope Jess Phillips reads this, takes note and takes action. Two years on from Sarah Everard\u2019s murder, nothing seems to have changed. Alexandra Heminsley, I am so sorry you were failed so abjectly and stand with you in solidarity. Shanti Inglebright West Molesey, Surrey \u2022 I was assaulted at the age of 14 by a 16-year-old boy who, egged on by his friends, picked up a weightlifting pole from our school gym and hit me in the coccyx, simulating the sex act that he loudly claimed to want to do to me. I was hospitalised with severe pain and numbness in my left leg. In spite of giving a statement to the police, my friends coming forward as witnesses and his confession \u2013 both online and in person \u2013 the police did not move forward because of the \u201cpotential impact on his future\u201d. To add insult to injury, the school \u201clost\u201d the CCTV. Women are taught early on that our trauma matters less than the men who traumatised us. I\u2019m now 29 and I have been groped, harassed and followed by men, but I have never reported it. I know nothing will happen. Name and address supplied \u2022 Reading Alexandra Heminsley\u2019s account of her sexual assault and her attacker\u2019s acquittal, what struck me most is the double standard regarding the role of alcohol in sexual assault. If a woman is sexually assaulted and under the influence of alcohol, it is she who has to accept the consequences of that state, and she is to blame, whereas a man committing a sexual assault under the influence is somehow excused from the responsibility because he is drunk. Why are woman held to higher standards than men? And, in this case, how dare the judge consider the impact of punishment on the perpetrator and not the impact of the attacker\u2019s acquittal on the victim?

            "content": "Nazir Afzal is a man of great courage and integrity (The G2 interview, 12 August). As a former prosecutor, he has faith in the criminal justice system\u2019s ability to ensure that rioters\u2019 actions will have consequences. Like Keir Starmer and the current director of public prosecutions, Stephen Parkinson, Afzal seems confident that deterrence works, and that the prospect of unusually swift and severe punishment is what is keeping people off the streets. But the coincidence between the sentences imposed by the courts over recent weeks and the reduction in violence does not prove causation. There are other, equally plausible explanations for the ebbing of the tide, including the actions taken by thousands of counter-protesters and a failure of leadership, from Tommy Robinson in Ayia Napa, the culture warrior enablers in Reform UK and the Conservative party, suddenly afraid of the monster they have unleashed. The danger in thinking like a prosecutor and assuming that potential rioters are rational actors who can be deterred from attacking their local mosque is that we continue to see policing and punishment as a one-size-fits-all panacea for social problems, filling up our already grossly overcrowded and socially dysfunctional prisons in the process. Bill Dixon Professor of criminology, University of Nottingham \u2022 The recent unrest highlights the vital role of local news outlets. As violence erupted, local reporters risked their safety to provide crucial on-the-ground coverage. These journalists give voice to the unheard, maintaining a trusted connection within their communities, even long after the events subside. Unlike the unchecked spread of falsehoods online, professional journalists adhere to strict standards, ensuring accurate and reliable information. Their role in upholding public trust and safety has never been more critical. Despite its importance, accessing local journalism online has become increasingly difficult. The pop-up ads, cookie consent forms and clickbait links on news websites are more than mere annoyances; they are significant barriers to staying informed about local issues. If vital local journalism is to continue, we must address this funding model. Paul Wright Cleadon Village, Tyne and Wear \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "date": "2024-08-12T04:00:31Z",
            "content": "Leading children\u2019s rights and justice organisations have called for an end to child imprisonment in England. In a review, they argue that child imprisonment is beyond reform and that responsibility for children who have to be deprived of their liberty should be transferred from the Ministry of Justice to the Department for Education. The review is published 20 years after the deaths of 14-year-old Adam Rickwood and 15-year-old Gareth Myatt in children\u2019s prisons. Rickwood killed himself after being restrained at Hassockfield secure training centre (STC); Myatt, who weighed less than seven stone (44kg), died after being restrained by three G4S officers at Rainsbrook STC. MoJ pledges and policies on child imprisonment are benchmarked against the evidence in the review, which has been produced by the Alliance for Youth Justice, Article 39, the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, Child Rights International Network, Howard League for Penal Reform, Inquest, Just for Kids Law and the National Association for Youth Justice. While the safety of children in prison is a stated MoJ priority, a 2017 report from the chief inspector of prisons said: \u201cThere was not a single establishment that we inspected \u2026 in which it was safe to hold children and young people.\u201d Although the government asserts that solitary confinement is not used for children, in 2023 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern about the \u201ccontinued use of solitary confinement for children and segregation and isolation in child detention facilities\u201d. Restraint should only be used on children as a last resort and pain-inducing techniques reserved for extremely grave incidents, but earlier this year a report from HM Inspectorate of Prisons stated: \u201cThere was a high number of pain-inducing restraint techniques and strip-searches under restraint. Many of these incidents were not in accordance with national policy and were not properly authorised.\u201d The new review shows that imprisoned children receive far less than the promised 30 hours a week of \u201ceducation and purposeful activity\u201d. An inspection report into Feltham young offender institution (YOI) last month stated that many children received far less than 15 hours of weekly education. The review also shows that children are being cared for by staff who are untrained and poorly managed, and that despite the pledge to provide support in custody to enable the children to thrive on release, \u201coutcomes for children leaving custody remained, with a few exceptions, poor\u201d. Although there have been repeated promises since the 1990s that YOIs and STCs would be transformed, and the last government pledged to permanently close and replace them with secure schools (the first of which is due to receive children this summer), 81% of children in custody were still held in YOIs and the one remaining STC in June. Only 19% were held in secure children\u2019s homes, which are childcare establishments run by local authorities focused on providing intensive, expert multidisciplinary care and support to young people and their families. There was an average of around 440 children in custody at any one time during 2023. The review concludes that children should only be deprived of their liberty when this is the only means of avoiding serious and immediate harm to the child or others, and \u2013 when this does happen \u2013 ministerial and civil service responsibility should rest with the DfE alongside other areas of child welfare. Carolyne Willow, the founder director of children\u2019s rights charity Article 39, said: \u201cThe cumulative evidence that imprisonment causes children serious harm, and cannot be made safe, is incontestable. Ministers can and must change this never-ending cycle of child harm once and for all.\u201d Deborah Coles, the executive director of the human rights charity Inquest, said: \u201cTwenty years on from the deaths of Adam Rickwood and Gareth Myatt, child prisons have proved themselves incapable of reform and remain inherently dangerous and harmful. We need to close child prisons and invest in community support and services that protect and nurture children.\u201d A MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cWe are categorical that custody should be the last resort for children, reserved for those charged with the most serious offences. Frontline staff are working tirelessly to drive improvements and reduce violence, and we are committed to increasing the support these children need to turn their lives around.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-06T09:29:53Z",
            "content": "Individuals causing disorder and rioting will have a \u201cprison place waiting for them\u201d the justice minister has said, as far-right violence continued in England and Northern Ireland for a seventh day. Police officers were attacked and injured in Plymouth, Belfast and Darlington on Monday, with nearly 400 arrests made since the Southport stabbings a week ago. \u201cWe will make sure that anyone that is given a custodial sentence as a result of the riots and disorder, there will be a prison place waiting for them,\u201d the justice minister Heidi Alexander told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. In response to the disorder, the government had introduced 567 additional prison places that were due to come forward at the end of the month, Alexander said. The move comes weeks after the government announced the early release of thousands of prisoners who had served 40% of their sentence in England and Wales to solve a looming overcrowding crisis. The new prison spaces will be in Stocken prison in Rutland and Cookham Wood young offender institution in Kent, according to the justice minister. \u201cWe are confident that prison spaces will be there so that people who are perpetrating this disgusting behaviour on our streets and in our communities, if they\u2019re given a custodial sentence they will be serving it in jail,\u201d Alexander said. As disorder continued for a seventh day on Monday, Jemima Laing, a Labour councillor in Plymouth, described \u201ca pretty grim\u201d night in the port city in Devon after police officers were injured during \u201csustained violence\u201d. Several officers had minor injuries and two members of the public were taken to hospital. Laing said it was upsetting to see the city as a \u201cstop on this racist tour that seems to be happening\u201d. About 150 police officers who were deployed to the city centre tried to keep apart rival demonstrations as masked anti-immigration protesters launched missiles at a counter-demonstration where people held signs that read: \u201cNo place for hate\u201d and \u201cSay no to Nazis.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just so angry that so many people from outside our city felt it was OK to come here and cause such disruption and unrest,\u201d Laing told the Today programme. \u201cLast night\u2019s events were not reflective of us as a city,\u201d said Laing, laying blame on those from beyond the city who came to \u201ccause trouble\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really not what Plymouth\u2019s about.\u201d Devon and Cornwall police said six arrests were made in Plymouth after bricks and fireworks were launched at officers. In Belfast, people stamped on a man\u2019s head in an attack that police are treating as a hate crime during another night of rioting. Members of the public attempted to shield the man, who was in his 30s, during the disturbances in the Donegall Road and Oban Street area on Monday night, police said. \u201cHis condition is described as serious and we are treating his attack as a hate crime,\u201d said the police statement. The crowd, several dozen-strong, threw bricks and petrol bombs, set a police Land Rover alight and attempted to burn the remains of a supermarket that had been torched during a riot on Saturday. It is owned by an immigrant. \u201cOfficers were able to douse this small fire before it developed,\u201d it added. Police said they fired two projectiles striking a rioter on the hand, and arrested a 15-year-old boy on suspicion of riotous behaviour. \u201cThere is never any justification for this type of violent behaviour,\u201d Gordon Lyons, Stormont\u2019s community minister, told the BBC. \u201cThere is no justification for attack on the police it needs to stop and it needs to stop straight away.\u201d The Stormont assembly is to be recalled on Thursday to discuss the disturbances and race relations. An 18-year-old man has been arrested after bricks were thrown at police during violent disorder in Darlington on Monday evening, according to Durham police. The force said dozens of officers were deployed to the North Lodge Park area after two large groups of men gathered shortly after 9pm. It said this resulted in \u201csmall pockets of serious violence, which saw bricks being thrown at police officers who attended the scene\u201d. More than two dozen people accused of taking part in violent disorder in England and Northern Ireland appeared in magistrates courts on Monday, after the government promised \u201cswift justice\u201d. Charges included violent disorder, assault, arson and resisting police arrest, with defendants ranging from 14 to 69 years old. Neil Basu, the former head of UK counter-terrorism, said the disorder over the weekend that included rioters setting fire to a library, looting shops and storming hotels housing asylum seekers, should be treated as terrorism. When asked whether charges should be tougher, Alexander said that was a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service. \u201cThere have been a range of offences that will have been committed,\u201d said Alexander, refraining from agreeing with Basu\u2019s terrorism label for the disorder. \u201cThere have been serious offences which have undoubtedly been committed which will carry very significant jail terms.\u201d When asked how long the disorder was expected to continue, Alexander said while she did not have a \u201ccrystal ball\u201d, the government would leave \u201cno stone unturned\u201d to bring the disorder to an end. \u201cWe want to get this under control as quickly as possible because we can\u2019t go on with what we\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen outright criminal behaviour, racist attacks, dangerous extremism and we will not tolerate that in our country.\u201d"

            "content": "Youth lockups in Texas remain beset by sexual abuse, excessive use of pepper spray and other mistreatment including the prolonged isolation of children in their cells, the justice department has said in a scathing new report that accused the state of violating the constitutional rights of hundreds of minors in custody. The report comes three years after a federal investigation began into alleged widespread abuse and harsh practices within the Texas juvenile justice department, which incarcerates hundreds of young people every year. Staff in the detention centers have engaged in sexual acts with children, kept some for stretches of 17 to 22 hours of isolation in their cells and pepper-sprayed minors in their faces, US assistant attorney general Kristen Clarke said in releasing Thursday\u2019s report. Clarke also noted that about 80% of detained Texas children are Black or Hispanic. \u201cThis is a racial justice issue,\u201d she said. \u201cOur children deserve to be protected from harm and [given] access to essential services.\u201d The state\u2019s juvenile justice department said it has a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy toward abuse and neglect and had worked closely with federal investigators during their site visit in 2022. Spokespeople for the office of the state\u2019s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, did not immediately return emails seeking comment on Thursday. The governor\u2019s office said it would cooperate with the federal investigation when it was opened. Mental health concerns, such as suicidal ideation and self-harm, were ignored while children were routinely punished, according to the report. The facilities\u2019 inability to address or treat these issues violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, officials said during the announcement. The justice department said that it looks forward to cooperating with Texas, while also floating a potential federal lawsuit. \u201cThis report makes clear that we are failing our youth, that we are not providing the care they need to be successful,\u201d said Elizabeth Henneke, the founder and chief executive officer of the Lone Star Justice Alliance advocacy group. In 2021, the justice department began investigating Texas\u2019s five juvenile facilities after advocates filed a complaint. About 900 youths are detained in understaffed and outdated juvenile facilities across the state, Henneke said. She said judges and lawmakers should think creatively about other rehabilitation efforts. Meanwhile, Kentucky, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey are also being investigated or sued over allegations of harsh treatment of incarcerated children.

            "date": "2024-08-10T14:00:45Z",
            "content": "A hidden tracking tool in the website for Reform UK collected private browsing data about potentially millions of people, often without consent, and shared it with Facebook for use in targeted advertising. An Observer investigation has found that people visiting the website for Nigel Farage\u2019s anti-immigration party had details of their activity captured by a digital surveillance tool known as a Meta pixel. The tracker \u2013 active in the run-up to the election, and as recently as last week \u2013 was triggered automatically on loading the Reform site, regardless of whether the person gave consent. It then sent a package of data to Facebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, with details of which webpages had been viewed, when, and the buttons that were clicked. In some cases, this included sensitive information that could reveal a person\u2019s political beliefs, such as details of those accessing forms to become Reform UK members, linked to a unique Facebook user ID. Data gathered by the Meta pixel enters the firm\u2019s advertising system and can be used for Meta\u2019s own purposes as well as by advertisers such as Reform to re-target audiences with tailored ads. It is not known exactly how many people\u2019s data was shared with Meta, but Reform said about 1.1 million visited its website in the month to 15 July. Web archives indicate the tracking tool was in use for at least two years. The party removed it after being contacted for comment last week. The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) is examining the case. The findings raise questions about transparency and digital surveillance following a historic election result for Reform UK, in which it won 14% of the vote and five MPs were elected. Meta pixel and similar trackers are widely used by political parties and other organisations to collect data for analytics and marketing purposes, but it is against the law to use them unless consent has been \u201cactively and clearly\u201d given. Data that could reveal a person\u2019s political beliefs is classed as special category and is subject to stricter protections by law because its misuse could pose \u201csignificant risks to the individual\u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms\u201d. Reform UK has claimed that it prioritises privacy and resists \u201csurveillance\u201d, pledging in its manifesto to create a British bill of rights that would protect people\u2019s \u201cfreedoms\u201d. It says: \u201cOur data and privacy must be protected. Surveillance of the public must be limited and those monitoring us held to account.\u201d But the Observer\u2019s testing, checked by independent experts, suggests a failure to follow the rules, with the Meta pixel extracting information before consent had been given, and even if the person clicked \u201cdeny\u201d. Mark Richards, a software engineer and expert in online privacy, said the tracking raised ethical questions.People visiting Reform\u2019s website for research risked being incorrectly labelled as someone with an interest in the party, he said. Meanwhile, those clicking links to become a member were revealing \u201csensitive political information about who they are and what they believe in\u201d, which they may not wish to share. Reform UK said it was \u201ccommitted to protecting the privacy of our website visitors\u201d. It said the tracking tool had been embedded because Reform\u2019s site was made using a template that included it, and that the goal was to \u201cbetter understand how visitors interact with our website\u201d. The website also uses a third-party tool for managing cookie consent. A spokesperson for the party said any issues with the Meta pixel appeared to be \u201ccock-up rather than conspiracy\u201d. They added: \u201cWe are currently reviewing our procedures to make sure that our use of such tools is transparent and compliant with all relevant regulations.\u201d In the past, browsing information gathered by tracking tools such as Meta pixel has led to polarising ads being pushed to select groups of voters \u2013 and hidden from others \u2013 in a practice known as \u201cdark advertising\u201d. During this year\u2019s election campaign, Reform invested heavily in digital messaging, spending about \u00a3100,000 on Facebook ads between May and July. One showed a queue outside a GP surgery, with the words: \u201cImmigration isn\u2019t working\u201d. Another warned of \u201cone migrant every minute\u201d under Labour or the Conservatives. Some of the ads were targeted at custom audiences, according to Facebook transparency records. However Reform said its targeting was not informed by \u201canything other than what was told to us in the room and the media pulse\u201d, and data gathered through Meta pixel \u201cwas never utilised for political advertising or to influence voting behaviour\u201d. Meta declined to comment on the specifics. It did not say how data sent to it by Reform UK had been used, or whether it had taken steps to prevent information provided without consent being used for targeting. A spokesperson for the tech giant, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said advertisers were responsible for \u201cobtaining the necessary permissions to collect and share data\u201d and that the sending of sensitive information is prohibited. The ICO said it was examining the information about Reform\u2019s use of tracking pixels as part of a wider review of \u201cthe data protection harms arising from use of online tracking technologies\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cAll too often there\u2019s a lack of accountability for how these tools use people\u2019s personal information, with poor transparency and deceptive design.\u201d"

It aims to propose a structure that \u201cenables international cricket and domestic leagues to coexist in a clear, coherent calendar\u201d. The WCA has established a six-person committee \u2013 including Tom Harrison, the former chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, who now holds the same position with Six Nations Rugby \u2013 that will work with senior executives from the WCA and independent consultants to produce recommendations after consultation with players, broadcasters, administrators and team owners. The committee met for the first time in England last month and its recommendations are likely to focus on the creation of clearly defined windows for international and franchise cricket, before the end of the year. Heath Mills, chief executive of the New Zealand Cricket Players\u2019 Association and the WCA chair, said members of the organisation had \u201cvirtually given up hope\u201d that a sensible schedule could be created. \u201cWe are fortunate that cricket is spoilt for choice and has three core formats across both the international game and domestic leagues,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, to date, the game\u2019s leadership has collectively failed to come together to establish a clear and coherent global structure in which they can coexist. The players deserve a say on the future of the game and want us to start putting forward some solutions to known issues.\u201d Ben Stokes, the England Test captain, last month described the crowded schedule as \u201csomething that does need to be addressed\u201d. He said: \u201cWho knows what international cricket is going to look like, with all the franchise stuff that is going on as well. It does need to get looked at. I don\u2019t think anyone can put their hand on their heart and know what cricket is going to look like in even two years\u2019 time.\u201d The WCA committee also includes Paul Marsh, the chief executive of the Australian Football League Players\u2019 Association and son of Rodney Marsh, the former Australia wicketkeeper. \u201cHaving watched the progress of the game over the past 10 years from outside the sport, it is clear to me that there is so much opportunity for cricket if it can get this part of the puzzle right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is also clear that the long-term health of cricket is at risk if this work is not done and changes are not made.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-08T05:00:26Z",
            "content": "The chair of Reform UK, Zia Yusuf, was a member of the Conservatives until last week when party officials were approached by the Guardian. Richard Fuller, the Conservative party chair, emailed Yusuf to tell him his membership had been revoked last Friday afternoon, after the Guardian asked the party whether it was still active. That means Yusuf remained a paid-up Tory member despite announcing he had donated a six-figure sum to Nigel Farage\u2019s party in June, and then being unveiled as chair of Reform UK in July. The Conservative party did not cancel his membership even after Yusuf embarked on a series of broadcast interviews attacking Rishi Sunak and the government, and urging voters to make Farage prime minister. He told GB News in June that the Conservatives were \u201cso divided that I simply don\u2019t see how they can govern effectively\u201d. Addressing a Reform UK rally in Birmingham in June, Yusuf accused the Conservatives of having \u201clost control of our borders\u201d and having \u201cno coherent immigration policy\u201d. Within two weeks he had been made chair of Reform UK, replacing Richard Tice. Had the Guardian not alerted the Conservatives to it, Yusuf\u2019s membership might have continued indefinitely, allowing him to vote in the Tory leadership contest in November. It raises questions over whether other senior Reform UK figures are current Conservative party members. Yusuf told the Guardian in an interview last week that he had voted Conservative for most of his adult life. \u201cThey make it quite hard to actually cancel your membership. For all I know I might still have a direct debit with them,\u201d he said. He said he had stopped supporting the Conservatives because of Boris Johnson, suggesting that his government\u2019s policies were so leftwing they could have been former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. \u201cMy enthusiasm for the Conservatives was really extinguished after we saw the aftermath of what Boris Johnson had done \u2026 That sense of betrayal is something that I think a lot of people feel in this country about the Conservatives,\u201d Yusuf said. \u201cBoris had a walloping mandate, he came to power on the back of the promise that he would get Brexit done and then make the most of the opportunities that Brexit presented, and he really governed way further to the left than what he promised. If Jeremy Corbyn had come in and governed that way \u2026 that wouldn\u2019t have been a betrayal.\u201d Electoral Commission records show that Yusuf gave Reform UK \u00a3200,000 in June, one of the biggest donations made by an individual in the election campaign. Reform UK has been at the centre of a series of scandals. A Channel 4 investigation recorded Reform activists making racist and homophobic comments while campaigning for Farage during the election, while several of the party\u2019s election candidates were dropped over links to far-right groups or racist comments they had made in the past. A fifth of Reform UK voters said they supported the anti-immigration riots than began after last week\u2019s mass stabbing in Southport, according to a YouGov poll this week. A third of the party\u2019s voters said they thought the unrest was justified, though only 7% said it was \u201ccompletely justified\u201d. Opposition to the riots was near-universal among supporters of every other party. Reform UK says it now has more than 72,000 members, up from 28,000 before Farage announced he was standing for parliament in Clacton-on-Sea. A Conservative party spokesperson said: \u201cZia Yusuf has had his party membership suspended. The party constitution does not permit you to be a member of the Conservative party while publicly supporting another party.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-05T17:25:19Z",
            "content": "Everyone can agree on one thing regarding the government\u2019s review of the school curriculum and exams in England: Becky Francis, its leader, faces a mammoth task. In many ways, schools are inspiring places. But mounting difficulties on several fronts, including the recruitment and retention of teachers, and an inadequate Send system (for children with special educational needs and disabilities), have put them under severe strain. The challenge for Prof Francis, and the government, is to find a way of improving teaching and learning that doesn\u2019t involve huge expense or workloads. Ministers know this will be a tricky circle to square. Evolution rather than revolution is what they have asked for. So what is to be hoped for? A broadening of the curriculum ought to be painless. Last year, a House of Lords committee recommended scrapping the Ebacc, as the combination of GCSEs promoted under the Tories is known (English, maths, science, a foreign language and a humanities subject). Indeed, it is hard to see why ministers would wait until next year to take this up, given their already stated commitment to arts and sports. While breadth is an important principle in curriculum design, there is no reason for ministers to put off encouraging the wider take-up of arts subjects, to enhance young people\u2019s creativity. In primary schools, phonics should be balanced with other forms of literacy learning. A shift away from a relentlessly linear assessment model \u2013 where knowledge is tested at the end of a course \u2013 also seems inevitable, as well as desirable. There is too much emphasis on the memorisation of information. This does not mean an end to exams. Coping with deadlines and time limits are useful skills. But it would be surprising if Prof Francis did not come down on the side of variety. A consensus is also building around the importance of speaking skills. While breadth and flexibility might sound uncontroversial, the reality is complex. When the consultation opens, partisans will lobby for the inclusion of whatever they believe children should know: media studies, food and nutrition, financial education, politics and civic education, health and fitness, nature, digital skills, and so on. One possibility is that a richer curriculum becomes overstuffed. The alternative approach, of slimming the curriculum down to essentials and creating more scope for individual schools and teachers, could help tackle the problem of morale among staff who feel devalued and deprofessionalised. This is an attractive option in line with progressive educational values of imagination and creativity. But rejecting standardisation and the accountability it facilitates is not risk-free. Prof Francis has dedicated her career to breaking the link between income and achievement. Bridget Phillipson appointed her because she and her colleagues want working-class children to do better. The curriculum and assessment can be made more inclusive so that they are better suited to a wider range of children and abilities, and schools become more welcoming places. This could help reduce high absence rates, and help children with special needs. Vocational alternatives to A-levels and a new focus on practical GCSEs should be prioritised. But however much ministers and teachers might wish it, schools cannot on their own counteract the effects of inadequate housing, diet, employment and household income. For Prof Francis and other educational reformers, poverty is the biggest pitfall of all."

            "date": "2024-08-04T20:01:04Z",
            "content": "Keir Starmer sounded uncharacteristically angry as he appeared in front of a podium in Downing Street on Sunday to condemn the violent mobs causing damage and spreading fear. Just a few weeks into government, the prime minister has been confronted with an appalling triple murder of three young girls, followed by days of rioting whipped up by online disinformation that a migrant was responsible. So far, he has taken a proactive approach to tackling the violent unrest \u2013 leading visibly from Downing Street rather than letting his home secretary, Yvette Cooper, front up the response. In a statements on Friday and Sunday, Starmer has made it clear he wants the response to thuggery to be swift and decisive. He has called in the police to coordinate tactics, as well as delivering a message to Muslims and others frightened by the violence that this does not represent Britain. And he has named the forces he holds responsible \u2013 the far right exploiting a horrific tragedy to whip up disinformation and target migrants. As a former director of public prosecutions, who was involved in the response to the 2011 riots, Starmer is well placed to deal practically with a crisis in the sphere of law and order. He understands the importance of quick justice, both in getting criminals off the street to avoid prolonged violence and in deterring others from taking part when they see their fellow far-right rioters make life-ruining choices in less than week. There has also been little criticism of Starmer\u2019s approach from the Conservatives, with former shadow home secretary David Davis saying: \u201cRemember, the riots started with a lie, or three lies \u2026 I don\u2019t have that many criticisms of the government or the police on this, to be honest. \u201cAll what I would say is, perhaps they should have been faster to crush all that misinformation.\u201d However, a bigger difficulty for Starmer lies in the politics of the situation after the initial practical response, and how he reacts to Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party. Its politicians claimed over this weekend that the far right were not to blame for the riots, but discontent and unease about immigration. Labour sources say the view is that it is counterproductive to give Farage and his crew the oxygen of too much direct criticism, when the focus should be on the policing and tackling the rioters. However, others within the party are worried that Labour failing to challenge Farage more comprehensively head-on allows his anti-migrant insinuations to become part of mainstream political rhetoric, especially when he now has five MPs and received 4m votes at the election. Hostile language about migrants has become increasingly mainstream in the last five years, fuelled by those such as Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, referring to migrants as an invasion, and Lee Anderson, the former Tory deputy chair turned Reform MP, talking of wanting asylum seekers to \u201cfuck off back to France\u201d and claiming baselessly that the Labour mayor of London was controlled by Islamists. Starmer has taken the view that he needed to explicitly condemn the far right for being behind the violence \u2013 making it clear that whatever the underlying motive, causing fear, damage and disorder are never acceptable. But there may come a time soon when he needs to more strongly confront the anti-migrant rhetoric that lies behind the violence as well, whether it comes from protesters or politicians."

            "title": "Can climate stripes change the way we think about air pollution? ",
            "date": "2024-08-23T05:00:27Z",
            "content": "A team of scientists have created a new way to visualise the contrasts in air pollution breathed around the globe. The results show huge inequalities in the quality of air, with the situation worsening in many countries. But the new project also tells a positive story: that focused action by governments can lead to cleaner air. Inspired by Ed Hawkins\u2019 climate stripes, the new air quality stripes show air pollution from 1850 to today. Each year is a separate vertical bar that is coloured according to the amount of particle pollution. Air that meets World Health Organization guidelines is coded as sky blue. Shades of yellows, browns and black represent higher pollution in a colour scheme that reflects more than 200 images of smog from around the world. Dr Kirsty Pringle, of the University of Edinburgh, who co-directed the project, said: \u201cAir pollution is often called the invisible killer but these images make the invisible visible, showing the changes over the decades.\u201d The website allows you to generate your own air pollution stripes for large cities. Dr Jim McQuaid, of the University of Leeds, another co-director of the project, said: \u201cTo me it\u2019s all about that lightbulb moment when someone understands it; that sudden \u2018oh yeah, now I get it\u2019.\u201d The stripes for London and Beijing show the huge improvements that can result when action is taken. For more than a century London was plagued by coal induced smogs so thick that they were likened to pea soup. A reluctant government was finally forced to act when 12,000 people died from a week-long smog in 1952. Clean air acts followed. Coal use was replaced by heating oil and then fossil gas. Beijing\u2019s deteriorating air was largely unnoticed until the eyes of the world turned to the city for the 2008 Olympics. By this time air pollution deaths in China had reached more than 2 million a year, but a recent clean-up of industry and traffic has yielded rapid initial results. Jakarta and Islamabad represent the trajectories of many developing nations with rapid urbanisation and industrial growth and without accompanying air pollution controls. Data for the stripes came from the UK Met Office\u2019s global climate models with adjustments from satellite observations that first became available around 1998. This adjustment was also applied past pollution, projected backwards to 1850 using fuel and energy statistics. On their website, the team responsible observe: \u201cVery few historical observations of PM2.5 exist before the year 2000 so instead we use data produced from a mix of computer model simulations and satellite observations. For the most recent years (2000-2021) we use a dataset that combines ground-level and satellite observations of PM2.5 concentrations from Van Donkelaar et at (2021, V5 0.1 degree resolution), this dataset can be found here.\u201d They added: \u201cModelling global concentrations of pollutants is very challenging, and models are continuously evaluated and improved. Previous research has shown that the CMIP6 multi-model simulations tend to underestimate PM2.5 concentrations when compared to global observations (Turnock et al, 2020). \u201cTo address this issue and to ensure a smooth time series between the model and satellite data, we take the following steps: for each city, we first calculate a three-year (2000-2002) mean of the satellite data for that city. Next, we calculate the three-year (2000-2002) mean of model concentrations for the same city. The ratio between these values represents the model\u2019s bias compared to observations. We then adjust (or \u201cweight\u201d) the model values using this ratio. This is a similar approach to that taken by Turnock et al (2023) and Reddington et al (2023).\u201d Predictions are made for each degree of longitude and latitude. For the UK this is around 60km (40 miles) by 110km (70 miles), so the stripes cannot show the detail of air pollution within each city, but they do illustrate the changes. More than 99% of the world\u2019s population still breathe air that does not meet World Health Organization guidelines. Even after the improvements seen in Europe, particle pollution still leads to more than 400,000 early deaths annually; for the UK it is between 29,000 and 43,000. Prof Ed Hawkins, of the University of Reading, who created the climate stripes, said: \u201cThe climate stripes have appeared on the white cliffs of Dover, on football kits and race cars, at music festivals and at London fashion week. \u201cBy making abstract data tangible, we can all play a part in solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems. Many major cities worldwide are still struggling with dirty air, but air quality is improving in other places. These are clear demonstrations that critical global issues can be solved with enough political will.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-05T10:00:02Z",
            "content": "US politics is an outlier bastion of climate denial with nearly one in four members of Congress dismissing the reality of climate change, even as alarm has grown among the American public over dangerous global heating, an analysis has found. A total of 123 elected federal representatives \u2013 100 in the House of Representatives and 23 US senators \u2013 deny the existence of human-caused climate change, all of them Republicans, according to a recent study of statements made by current members. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning,\u201d said Kat So, campaign manager for energy and environment campaigns at the Center for American Progress, who wrote the report. The report defined climate deniers as those who say that the climate crisis is not real or not primarily caused by humans, or claim that climate science is not settled, that extreme weather is not caused by global warming or that planet-warming pollution is beneficial. It also highlights examples of denial from representatives. \u201cOf course the climate is changing,\u201d the Texas senator Ted Cruz said in 2018. \u201cThe climate has been changing from the dawn of time. The climate will change as long as we have a planet Earth.\u201d Other instances are more recent. \u201cWe\u2019ve had freezing periods in the 1970s. They said it was going to be a new cooling period,\u201d the Louisiana representative Steve Scalise said in a 2021 interview, referencing long-debunked research that is often still cited by climate deniers. \u201cAnd now it gets warmer and gets colder, and that\u2019s called Mother Nature. But the idea that hurricanes or wildfires were caused just in the last few years is just fallacy.\u201d Climate-denying lawmakers have received a combined $52m in lifetime campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry, the report also found. The research shows that the American public, perhaps uniquely among people in developed countries, is represented disproportionately by climate deniers. Although 23% of the entire US Congress is composed of those who dismiss the climate crisis, polls show the proportion of Americans who share this view is significantly smaller, by as much as half. Even as a quarter of US lawmakers deny the climate crisis, the American public has been moving significantly in the other direction. Fewer than one in five people in the US reject the findings of climate science, according to various studies, with long-running polling by Yale University showing that those they class as \u201cdismissive\u201d stand at just 11%. While this slice of the American public opinion has remained largely unchanged in recent years, a much larger, growing cohort is worried about the climate crisis following a string of record hot years and a parade of wildfires, storms and other climate-fueled events. More than half of Americans are now \u201calarmed\u201d or \u201cconcerned\u201d about climate change, the Yale surveys find. \u201cThe amount of people at each end of the spectrum \u2013 alarmed and dismissive \u2013 were essentially tied back in 2013 but today there are three alarmed people for every one dismissive, so there\u2019s been a fundamental shift in how people see climate change in the US,\u201d said Anthony Leiserowitz, an expert in climate public opinion at Yale. Though the portion of lawmakers who deny the climate crisis is stunning, it has been steadily declining in recent years. Just five years ago, 150 lawmakers denied the crisis. But many elected officials who don\u2019t deny the crisis still use anti-climate rhetoric and work to thwart greenhouse gas curbing policies. The Florida representative Mario Diaz-Balart, for instance, previously used the language of climate denial, but more recently described climate change as being \u201cmore of a religion\u201d \u2013 a different form of \u201cclimate obstruction\u201d, the report says. He has also continued to oppose climate aid. \u201cThere are lots of harmful ways to talk about climate and act on it,\u201d said So. \u201cJust because they accept the scientific findings or say they believe in climate change doesn\u2019t mean that they are not still obstructing climate action, or using rhetoric that is antithetical to climate action.\u201d Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard University who has long studied anti-climate rhetoric, said it was \u201cunsurprising\u201d that the report found old-school climate denial is on the decline. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to deny the science when it\u2019s so much more apparent that the climate is warming, that extreme weather is getting worse and happening constantly,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody can deny the science with a straight face, given everything.\u201d She noted, however, that the fossil fuel industry and its allies have long used a variety of messaging to rebuff concerns about the climate. She said she was unsure those other forms of rhetoric were any less harmful. \u201cAs far back as the 1990s, they were saying renewable energy isn\u2019t reliable enough, or they were saying that wind power \u2026 kills whales,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it really so different from climate denial if you don\u2019t deny the science but you deny the possibility of solutions?\u201d Among ordinary people, Leiserowitz said the views of the relatively small group of people who deny that temperatures are warming, or tie climate science to conspiracy theories involving Al Gore or the United Nations, are often exaggerated both politically and throughout US society. \u201cThis small minority of Americans are really vocal, they are more likely to vote and clearly they are more than adequately represented in the halls of Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are punching above their weight and having an undue influence on the public square, to the extent that most people don\u2019t want to talk about climate change because they think half of the country doesn\u2019t believe in it. There\u2019s a culture of silence \u2013 climate has joined sex, religion and politics as the topics not to bring up at the Thanksgiving table.\u201d Political polarization and the prevalence of \u201csafe\u201d congressional seats, which encourage candidates to hew to more extreme views in order to secure key party primary contests, have helped entrench this imbalance, Leiserowitz said, along with a flood of donations from the fossil fuel industry."

            "content": "The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, will attend a Pacific leaders\u2019 summit this week in Tonga with a focus on climate change in the region, one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable to rising sea levels and temperature changes. The annual meeting of leaders is the top political decision-making body of the region. The week-long summit culminates in the leaders\u2019 retreat, where key decisions are made, which may include an endorsement of a regional policing initiative promoted by Australia. The future for New Caledonia is among other big issues to be addressed at the Pacific Islands Forum (Pif) which began in Tonga on Monday. \u201cWe gather at a pivotal time in our region\u2019s history,\u201d said forum secretary Baron Waqa, a former president of Nauru. \u201cWe are at the centre of global geopolitical interest. We are at the forefront of a battle against climate change.\u201d Australia\u2019s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Christopher Luxon \u2013 leaders of the forum\u2019s two largest economies \u2013 will attend along with most heads of government of the 18-member regional bloc. As geopolitical tensions rise and competition for influence in the Pacific increases, more outside attention has been focused on some of the smallest countries in the world. The threats posed by climate change and sea level rise will be a central part of the summit, which Guterres will address. Pacific leadership will be looking for more financial support for its climate and disaster initiatives. \u201cThe fate of the Pacific depends on limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius,\u201d the UN secretary general said at a press conference in Samoa on Friday, ahead of the meeting in Tonga. \u201cThis region, the Pacific, contributes 0.02% of global emissions. Yet you are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, dealing with extreme weather events from raging tropical cyclones to record ocean heatwaves.\u201d The situation in New Caledonia is also likely to be a focus of the meeting, after the French territory was rattled by deadly violence this year over plans from Paris to expand voting rights. This week, a much anticipated high-level visit to New Caledonia by Pacific leaders was postponed, at the request of Louis Mapou, president of the New Caledonia government. \u201cWe must reach consensus on our vision for a region of peace and security,\u201d Tongan prime minister Siaosi Sovaleni said on Monday. \u201cWe must honour the vision of our forefathers regarding self determination, including in New Caledonia.\u201d The Cook Islands prime minister, Mark Brown, who is the outgoing Pif chair, said at a recent press conference it is challenging for Pif to navigate the impacts of New Caledonia\u2019s dual status as both a full member of the forum and a territory of France. The unrest has seen the territory added as a \u201cstanding item\u201d to the leaders\u2019 agenda which reflects its importance to regional leaders. In recent years the meeting has drawn increasing interest amid a geopolitical battle for influence in the region between the US and China. As Beijing has expanded its influence in the Pacific and increased its economic and security relationships, the US has boosted its engagement on numerous fronts. Washington has promised more aid, struck security partnerships and opened new embassies. Pacific countries have seen a series of ministerial visits from the US and China, as well as new initiatives across different sectors, and a rise in defence diplomacy. Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, will travel to the Pif on the heels of a visit to Beijing, where he discussed economic development and other ways to deepen ties. The leaders of Vanuatu and Solomon Islands visited China in July. While Pif members agree on many key priorities, maintaining regional solidarity can be challenging. Last year in Cook Islands, the political divide on deep-sea mining became clear. Since then, Vanuatu has led a charge at the most recent meeting of the International Seabed Authority to prevent licences for exploitation of seabed resources being issued before environmental regulations are in place. Last year, Pacific leaders asked the forum secretariat to convening a regional talanoa (discussion) on this issue. It has yet to take place. Agence-France Presse contributed to this report"

            "date": "2024-08-03T06:00:08Z",
            "content": "A beach in north-east Scotland is eroding rapidly owing to climate change, leaving a town at risk of flooding and its centuries-old golf links crumbling into the sea. The Dynamic Coast report in 2021 studied the rate of erosion at Montrose and predicted that 120 metres would be lost over 40 years, an average of 3 metres a year. People in Montrose are fearing the start of the storm season in autumn, as last year\u2019s record-breaking storms caused the beach to erode 7 metres in the space of a year, more than 4 metres more than scientists predicted. A report on behalf of Montrose Golf Links by EnviroCentre in December revealed that historically observed average rates of retreat are between 2.8\u20137.0 metres a year and that \u201cobserved trends in coastal erosion can be expected to continue, or indeed accelerate in response to future climate change\u201d. Scotland faced unprecedented storms last season and in spring recorded the country\u2019s wettest April since 1947. In November last year, Montrose\u2019s beach promenade collapsed during high tide after Storm Babet, leaving a gaping hole on the walkway. During this storm alone the beach eroded 3 metres. A month later, in December, gales of 86mph were recorded at nearby Inverbervie climate station during Storm Gerrit. David Wood, who leads Montrose community council\u2019s sub-group on coastal erosion at the beach, said: \u201cI\u2019m born and bred in Montrose and I don\u2019t think any of us can remember anything like the level of storms that we had [last season]. Were these once-in-100-year storms? Is it going to be another 100 years? Probably not. This is climate change.\u201d Montrose has a history of coastal erosion that can be measured through the loss of the golf links, founded more than 460 years ago. The original sixth tee disappeared in 1994 and the third tee was moved away from the edge in 2017 but is now also gone. The sea has advanced 70 metres in the past 30 years. Studies by Angus council and Dynamic Coast have shown that urgent maintenance to the receding dunes at Montrose Bay is needed, or there is risk of opening flood corridors through to the town\u2019s residential buildings. \u201cI would give Montrose another three years maximum and I think it\u2019ll be under,\u201d the Montrose independent councillor Tommy Stewart told the Guardian in December. \u201cThe defences will breach if they don\u2019t do anything.\u201d The EnviroCentre report also revealed there could be an estimated 170 metres lost owing to erosion and flooding to the south of Montrose by 2100. The community council is keen for emergency work to go ahead in April 2025, which would involve loading vast quantities of sand on to the beach to build up lost levels. EnviroCentre found that the work to maintain the beach could cost \u00a32m and Angus council is \u00a350m in debt. Wood agreed there were concerns about finances but said Angus council had been working closely with the community council and were building an economic case to send to the Scottish government for the works to start in April. \u201cThe funding will have to come from the Scottish government in some shape or form,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the short-term solution in this sort of beach \u2026 renourishment is not a one-off. You do it once and you may have to do it every year.\u201d Wood said the work proposed for next year was a short- term solution to slow down the erosion process, which would give the council time to build up longer-term solutions to the issue, although how those would be funded is unclear. A spokesperson for Angus council said: \u201cAngus council have identified an outline solution in order to maintain, monitor and measure the erosion at Montrose. We are in regular communication with the Scottish government along with NatureScot, who are leading on a Dynamic Coast project to help tackle coastal erosion in Angus. The cost to progress this project is anticipated to be significant and we are developing a proposal ahead of any bids for funding contributions.\u201d In January, the Scottish government\u2019s secretary for transport, net zero and just transition, M\u00e0iri McAllan, announced that Angus council would receive \u00a3440,000 from the government towards its efforts to combat coastal erosion at Montrose. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe climate emergency is not a distant threat \u2013 we are already seeing an increased impact on coastal communities such as Montrose due to adverse weather and rising sea levels. The Scottish government continues to work with the local community and stakeholders to support them in identifying common ground and building consensus for addressing coastal erosion at Montrose.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-11T09:00:07Z",
            "content": "The chalkhill blue has some surprising claims to fame. For a start, it is one of the UK\u2019s most beautiful butterflies, as can be seen as they flutter above the grasslands of southern England in summer. Then there is their close and unusual relationship with ants. Caterpillars of Lysandra coridon \u2013 found across Europe \u2013 exude a type of honeydew that is milked by ants and provides them with energy. In return, they are given protection in cells below ground especially created for them by the ants. Chalkhill blues thrive as a result, though their numbers are now coming under threat. It is an extraordinary catalogue of features, to which scientists have now made a striking addition thanks to a pioneering new project, known as Psyche, which aims to sequence the genomes of all 11,000 species of butterflies and moths in Europe and reveal in fine detail how climate change and habitat loss are affecting them. As part of Psyche, scientists have found that, depending on location, the cells of the chalkhill blue have different numbers of chromosomes \u2013 the packets of DNA that contain their genetic blueprint. In southern Europe, they have a total of 87 chromosomes, adding them one at a time as they head north until their northern limit is reached, where chalkhill blues have 90 chromosomes. \u201cThat very much goes against the dogma which states that a given species has a given number of chromosomes,\u201d said evolutionary biologist Charlotte Wright of the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge. \u201cWhy this is changing in the chalkhill blue is intriguing. It is clear that, as it has moved in Europe as glaciers retreated since the end of the last ice age, it has added a chromosome one by one while progressing northwards. It is a surprising observation.\u201d This point was backed by Mark Blaxter, who is also based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. \u201cIf we look back a million years or so, we can tell when two species have split from a single originator. But how does that happen? More to the point, how would we spot what was going on at the time? That is what we are probably seeing here. We are seeing two species in the act of being created from one. We are shining a light on evolution in action.\u201d Project Psyche research is being carried out at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in collaboration with six other leading European research centres including Oulu University, Finland, and the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. It is named after the Greek goddess of the soul, who was said to have been given butterfly wings by Zeus and was usually depicted by the ancient Greeks wreathed in butterflies. Before the development of modern genomics, the relationship between moths and butterflies generated considerable debate. \u201cHowever, DNA technology has made it clear that butterflies are essentially a sub-group of moths, albeit ones that are generally more colourful,\u201d said Wright. A tenth of all named species on Earth are moths or butterflies and they are uniquely sensitive to changes in habitats, temperature and plants on which they thrive, added Blaxter. \u201cThat means the more we know about them the better informed we will be about the changes affecting the natural world in general. The alterations affecting the chalkhill blue are a perfect example of that knowledge.\u201d Its 87-to-90 complement of chromosomes may seem extreme compared with the 23 pairs possessed by humans. However, large numbers of these genetic packages are common among moths and butterflies, say scientists, with the record being held by another blue butterfly, the species Polyommatus atlanticus. It possesses a staggering set of 229 chromosomes. Another intriguing example of lepidopteran life is provided by the xerces blue butterfly which was recently rendered extinct. By studying samples from museum collections, scientists have determined \u2013 by studying its genomes \u2013 that the species had become highly inbred and vulnerable. \u201cThat research took place in the US but the aim of Psyche is to pinpoint other similarly vulnerable species in Europe in the same way and suggest which are the best targets for interventions to save them,\u201d added Wright. \u201cA genome is a perfect starting point for understanding how well an organism is doing in its environment.\u201d Butterflies and moths are crucial pollinators of plants and are also a key source of foods for birds, so their survival is important, added Wright. \u201cThis is blue-skies research that could have very practical outcomes.\u201d"

            "content": "Humanity risks catastrophic global heating if it focuses only on decarbonisation at the expense of restoring the natural world, Colombia\u2019s environment minister has said in the lead-up to the world\u2019s key nature summit later this year. Susana Muhamad, who will be president of the UN biodiversity Cop16 summit in Cali in October, said that a singular focus on cutting carbon emissions while failing to restore and protect natural ecosystems would be \u201cdangerous for humanity\u201d and risk societal collapse. While laying out her vision for the meeting during a press briefing in Montreal, Canada, Muhamad said a main focus would be to raise political awareness for the natural world to keep humanity in safe planetary limits. \u201cThere is a double movement humanity must make. The first one is to decarbonise and have a just energy transition,\u201d Muhamad said. \u201cThe other side of the coin is to restore nature and allow nature to take again its power over planet Earth so that we can really stabilise the climate. \u201cThe climate has much more awareness and political investment, but we are not seeing the other side of the coin, and it\u2019s dangerous. That is dangerous for humanity. One of the main purposes for Cop16 in Cali is to make biodiversity and the global biodiversity framework as politically relevant as the climate agenda,\u201d she added. While the nature crisis has risen up the global political agenda, with a 2022 UN agreement to halt the loss of biodiversity by the end of the decade, thenature summits \u2013 which take place every two years \u2013 do not enjoy the same attention from governments and world leaders as meetings about the climate, which are attended by tens of thousands of delegates every year. Ahead of talks, Muhamad urged governments from the global north to make good on their commitments to increase funding for nature restoration, adding that Cop16 would focus on how to mobilise alternative sources of finance from the private sector. She called for countries to \u201cmake a gesture to increase trust in the conference and actually put their money in the global biodiversity fund that we approved in Montreal [at Cop15 in 2022]. It would be a sign that we are committed\u201d. The Colombian government has been a leading voice at for action at international environmental summits in recent years under the presidency of the country\u2019s first leftwing leader Gustavo Petro, and became the first major fossil fuel producer to join an alliance of nations calling for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty at the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai last year.

            "date": "2024-08-29T17:58:30Z",
            "content": "The UK government is considering making further commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, likely to be announced at the UN climate summit this year. It is hoped the plan will help kickstart global ambitions on cutting emissions and encourage other countries to follow suit. Under the Paris climate agreement countries are obliged to submit more stringent targets on emissions in February, if the world is to have any chance of holding global temperature rises to within 1.5C of preindustrial levels. But Ed Miliband, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, hopes to announce a new target months early, and has the support of Keir Starmer, the prime minister, in trying to propel the UK into a leadership position on the international stage at climate negotiations. Starmer attended the previous summit, Cop28, when he was leader of the opposition and has been invited to Cop29, which will take place in Azerbaijan in November. Activists representing developing countries told the Guardian the global south would welcome UK plans for the early publication of its emissions-cutting plan, known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC). Harjeet Singh, the global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, said: \u201cThe UK has a critical opportunity to set the bar for climate leadership and equity by announcing a robust NDC well ahead of Cop29. This proactive approach would signal to other developed nations the urgency of abandoning fossil fuel production and committing to a future powered by renewables. \u201cBy scaling up domestic investments in clean energy and fulfilling its fair share of climate finance to support developing countries, the UK can play its part in driving a global just transition that leaves no one behind.\u201d Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: \u201cIn terms of international leadership and diplomacy, the UK has fallen behind badly under the previous government. Being one of the first countries to outline a robust NDC is exactly the sort of thing we want to see to show the UK is under new management. \u201cIt would be good to see the UK including its fossil fuels phase-out commitment within its NDC. That would set the example that climate plans should be channelled through the UN process rather than announced ad hoc but never formally committed to. This would show the way for others to follow.\u201d Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, countries must set out their NDCs containing targets for future emissions cuts on a five-yearly cycle, with a \u201cratchet\u201d ensuring they are strengthened each time. The UK\u2019s current NDC pledges a 68% cut in emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. Miliband has asked the Climate Change Committee to advise on the UK\u2019s next target, for 2035. The Guardian understands the CCC\u2019s recommendation is likely to be published before the autumn budget in late October. If that does happen, there would be little time before Cop29 to draw up a fully fledged NDC. The UN is hoping for countries to submit NDCs as detailed plans, rather than simple targets, to make their implementation in full more likely. However, the UK could announce a provisional target and then write a detailed NDC for later submission to the UN that would still be \u201cwell ahead\u201d of the deadline for NDCs, as pledged in the joint statement with Brazil earlier this month. The Cop29 summit will take place from 11 November, days after the US election, making it difficult for the US administration to plan its impact at the negotiations. France, usually a climate leader under President Emmanuel Macron, is in political turmoil, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, also a robust climate advocate, is facing political headwinds at home. Those difficulties leave a vacancy on the global stage among powerful developed economies. This month, Miliband showed his intent for the UK to work in partnership with the developing world by visiting Brazil, the current president of the G20 and host of next year\u2019s Cop30. He also held a meeting in London last month with the president of Cop29, Mukhtar Babayev of Azerbaijan. Next year, Miliband will co-host a conference in the UK with the International Energy Agency. These efforts stand in stark contrast to the previous government. Under the Conservative prime ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson, the UK played an important role in international climate negotiations, including hosting the successful Cop26 summit in 2021. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak signalled a change in direction, forbidding King Charles from attending Cop27 in 2022 and with Sunak making significant U-turns on climate policy. Sunak made little impact at last year\u2019s Cop28, spending markedly less time there than other world leaders and meeting few of them. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cThe energy secretary will be front and centre of climate negotiations and will personally be leading Cop29 negotiations for the UK. In line with the Paris agreement, we have started planning for our next NDC, which will be submitted at least nine to 12 months ahead of Cop30. No decision on exact timing has yet been made.\u201d"

Emissions of carbon dioxide and the water vapour emitted by jet engines account for about 5% of climate heating and research shows this continues to grow. It is no surprise that rich countries dominate the ratings for most aviation emissions, measured by the airports from which the aircraft start their flights. Britain with Heathrow and other international airports comes third behind the United States and an increasingly affluent China. Fourth is Japan and fifth the United Arab Emirates, achieved with its massive transit airport at Dubai. With less than 10% of the world\u2019s population taking a plane in any one year, it\u2019s the relatively small number of frequent fliers who are making the biggest contribution to emissions. It is also no surprise that the richest country, the US, with its vast land mass, has the highest emissions per capita for domestic flights. Australia, with its coastal cities separated by a frequently inhospitable interior, comes second. Norway which is affluent and long and thin, comes third, but the flights were not north-south but between southern cities, so it cannot blame geography. It is the affluence of the average citizen that counts."

            "date": "2024-08-14T12:00:14Z",
            "content": "The impact of Donald Trump enacting the climate policies of the rightwing Project 2025 would result in billions of tonnes of extra carbon pollution, wrecking the US\u2019s climate targets, as well as wiping out clean energy investments and more than a million jobs, a new analysis finds. Should Trump retake the White House and pass the energy and environmental policies in the controversial Project 2025 document, the US\u2019s planet-heating emissions will \u201csignificantly increase\u201d by 2.7bn tonnes above the current trajectory by 2030, an amount comparable to the entire annual emissions of India, according to the report. Such a burst of extra pollution would torpedo any chance the US could meet its goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030, which scientists say is imperative to help the world avert disastrous climate change. It would also, the analysis found, result in 1.7m lost jobs in 2030, due to reduced clean energy deployment that is not offset by smaller gains in fossil fuel jobs, and a $320bn hit to US GDP as a wave of new domestic renewables and electric car manufacturing is reversed. \u201cThe US faces a fork in the road starting in January of 2025 with two climate and energy policy pathways that are highly divergent,\u201d said Anand Gopal, executive director of policy research at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy thinktank that conducted the modeling. \u201cThese future policy pathways result in stark differences for our health, our pocketbooks, the economy and climate.\u201d The new analysis provides a glimpse of what could hinge upon November\u2019s presidential election. Kamala Harris, the vice-president and Democratic nominee, has been part of a Biden administration that has overseen a raft of climate-friendly legislation and regulations, most notably the Inflation Reduction Act, which has pumped billions of dollars into new solar, wind, electric car and battery deployment. This activity has helped create more than 300,000 new jobs in clean energy technologies, as well as doubling the pace of US emissions reductions. America is now on track to cut its emissions 37% by 2030, compared with 2005, putting it within \u201cstriking distance\u201d of reaching its climate target, Gopal said. Such progress would be erased, however, should Trump be elected and fully embrace Project 2025, a comprehensive rightwing blueprint that the former president has distanced himself from, even though 140 people who worked in the last Trump administration contributed to it. JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate, wrote the foreword to a book by a leader of Project 2025. Project 2025 calls for a widespread evisceration of environmental protections, allowing for a glut of new oil and gas drilling, the repeal of the IRA and even the elimination of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Weather Service so they can be replaced by private companies. The conservative Heritage Foundation, which leads Project 2025, has said a new Trump administration should \u201ceradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere\u201d. Adopting this policy wishlist would, compared with business as usual, result in 2.7bn tonnes of extra emissions by 2030 and 26bn tonnes of further emissions by 2050, the point at which the world would need to have eliminated new fossil-fuel pollution entering the atmosphere to avoid climate breakdown, Energy Innovation found. It would also, according to the new modeling, cause several thousand extra premature deaths by the end of the decade due to worsened air pollution, and cause a bump in Americans\u2019 household costs compared to a path of more ambitious climate action. The Project 2025 team did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cProject 2025 just seems like the road to hell made with evil intentions,\u201d said Gina McCarthy, the former top climate adviser to Biden. \u201cIt really has to be rejected, and I think it summarily will be. Even Trump has realized how extreme it is: he had to publicly disown it.\u201d In his own commitments, Trump has promised to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d for more oil and gas, and to eliminate Biden-era policies that spur the take-up of electric cars. A previous analysis of Trump\u2019s plans by Carbon Brief estimated the impact of his new administration would be even greater than in the latest study, adding an extra 4bn tonnes of greenhouse gases by 2030. Vance has called the IRA a \u201cgreen energy scam\u201d that primarily benefits China, although some other Republican lawmakers have begun to warm to the legislation as the majority of the more than $300bn in climate investments has flowed to GOP-held areas. Last week, 18 Republican members of Congress wrote to Mike Johnson, the House of Representatives speaker, imploring him not to gut the spending, as Trump has indicated he should do. Harris, who enjoys the backing of many green groups, has accused Trump of intending to \u201csurrender our fight against the climate crisis\u201d. In a speech in Arizona last week, she said: \u201cAnd, Arizona, every day you feel the impact of extreme heat and drought. You know this crisis is real. He calls it a hoax.\u201d However, even if Harris wins and secures the Biden climate policies there is still a significant gap to getting the US to net zero. Energy Innovation said that further actions, such as cutting pollution from buildings, restoring degraded land and new regulations upon industry and energy use, will be required if the climate targets are to be hit. \u201cThe benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act have been startling to see,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cBut it is a foundation to do more.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-30T13:50:40Z",
            "content": "Greenhouse gas emissions from Australia\u2019s ageing coal-fired power plants rose slightly in the first half of the year, reversing years of declining pollution from the power section and raising questions about the country\u2019s ability to meet its climate targets. An increase in electricity consumption across the country and lower than usual wind and hydro output led to an increase in coal generation. It pushed up emissions from the electricity grid between January and June. Climate pollution from the east coast power grid had previously been falling steadily as renewable energy pushed out coal and gas, lifting the share of solar, wind and hydro to about 40%. Though at this stage only a short-term trend, the rise in electricity emissions is at odds with official government projections, which had forecast that coal-fired generation would continue to fall by about 10 terra-watt hours a year. In reality, coal plant output is up about 3.5% this year. It meant that while Australia\u2019s total national emissions were down a fraction over the year to March \u2013 by 0.6% \u2013 they increased in the March quarter and, based on preliminary data, the June quarter. According to the latest quarterly greenhouse gas update, Australia\u2019s emissions are 440.2m tonnes, which is 28.2% less than they were in 2005 \u2013 the baseline year against which it has made domestic and international commitments. The Albanese government has legislated a reduction targets of 43% by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Scientists say Australia should be making cuts even more rapidly to play its part in the goal of aiming to limit average global heating by 1.5C. Electricity remains the biggest source of emissions by sector in the national economy despite having fallen by about 23% since 2005 as renewables have replaced coal. Other parts of the fossil fuel economy have either flatlined in pollution output or, in the case of transport, increased CO2 emissions. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said emissions in the March quarter were affected by warmer than average temperatures pushing up electricity demand. He emphasised the longer-term trend, and said the latest inventory showed the government\u2019s plan to bolster renewables, including a 32 gigawatt underwriting program, \u201cis working\u201d after a \u201cdecade of denial and delay\u201d under the Coalition. \u201cWe must continue to drive action across all sectors of the economy,\u201d he said, pointing to changes to the \u201csafeguard mechanism\u201d that is meant to limit emissions from major industrial sites and national vehicle emissions standards that will take effect in January. The Coalition\u2019s climate spokesman, Ted O\u2019Brien, said the report showed national emissions had increased 1% since Labor came to office. This period, since May 2022, included a period in which emissions rebounded to previous levels after Covid-19 lockdowns in some states cut pollution from transport and some industry. But O\u2019Brien said it showed Labor\u2019s energy plan had \u201cfailed\u201d. The Greens said the data showed emissions \u201caren\u2019t coming down\u201d under Labor and that this was \u201cputting a safe climate out of reach\u201d. \u201cLabor\u2019s commitment to coal and gas will see Australia blow any chance of meeting safe climate targets,\u201d the party\u2019s Senate leader, Larissa Waters, said. Labor has set a target of reaching 82% electricity from renewable energy by 2030, and the Australian Energy Market Operator has said 90% of remaining coal plants were likely to shut by 2035 and that investments in renewables needed to be delivered \u201con time and in full\u201d to maintain a reliable grid. Most of the estimated emissions reductions across the country continue to be due to land and forests having become a carbon sink, absorbing more CO2 from the atmosphere than they emit. These changes have had little, if anything, to do with climate change policy. Without them national emissions across the rest of the economy are down only 1.3% since 2005."

It works with companies including Asos, the Bank of England and Revolut in the UK, and Shell, BMW and luxury goods conglomerate LVMH in Europe. \u201cThe UK is a region with many leading global brands and top tech talent, which is why we see it as key to the growth and expansion of Wiz,\u201d Reznik told the Guardian. \u201cOrganisations in this market are embracing the cloud and capitalising on the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI). At the same time, with only 10% of data having migrated to the cloud so far, we see near limitless growth potential,\u201d he added. The company made annual revenues of $350m last year and is understood to be running at a rate of $500m for this year. Wiz\u2019s target is to hit $1bn in annual revenues and then consider its strategic options. Alphabet had been in talks to acquire Wiz in an effort to catch up with rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the hyper-competitive cloud services market. Last month, Wiz bosses admitted it was \u201ctough\u201d turning down such lucrative offers but said the goal remains growth and an eventual initial public offering. However, the New York-based startup said it is planning for a US listing, and not a London one. There had been scepticism that the deal with Alphabet would pass regulatory scrutiny, as regulators seek to toughen their stance against big tech dealmaking. In June, the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission struck a deal on investigations into the main protagonists in the AI market, including Microsoft, OpenAI and Nvidia. In December last year, Adobe abandoned its $20bn (\u00a316bn) takeover of its smaller rival Figma, after European and UK regulators raised concerns it would eliminate competition in the product design software market. In May, Wiz announced that it raised $1bn at a $12bn valuation, in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital. The company has secured $1.9bn in total funding since being founded in 2020."

            "title": "Sellafield apologises after guilty plea over string of cybersecurity failings",
            "date": "2024-08-08T18:19:54Z",
            "content": "Sellafield has apologised after pleading guilty to criminal charges relating to a string of cybersecurity failings at Britain\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site, which it admitted could have threatened national security. Among the failings at the vast nuclear waste dump in Cumbria was the discovery that 75% of its computer servers were vulnerable to cyber-attacks, Westminster magistrates court in London heard. Information that could threaten national security was left exposed for four years, the nuclear watchdog revealed, and Sellafield said it had been performing critical IT health checks that were not, in fact, being carried out. Late last year, the Guardian\u2019s Nuclear Leaks investigation revealed a string of IT failings at the state-owned company dating back several years, as well as radioactive contamination and toxic workplace culture. Sellafield is a sprawling rubbish dump for nuclear waste from weapons programmes and decades of atomic power generation. It has a workforce of about 11,000 people and is part of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, a taxpayer-owned and -funded quango. The Guardian\u2019s investigation also revealed concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into Sellafield\u2019s system while unsupervised and that its computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain because it was so sensitive and dangerous. Sellafield pleaded guilty to charges brought by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) in June, which relate to information technology security offences spanning a four-year period from 2019 to 2023. The firm is now awaiting final sentencing, whichthe chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, said would happen within weeks. The ONR has said it expects sentencing to take place in September. At a sentencing hearing on Thursday, the court heard that a test had found that it was possible to download and execute malicious files on to Sellafield\u2019s IT networks via a phishing attack \u201cwithout raising any alarms\u201d, according to Nigel Lawrence KC, representing the ONR. The site, the world\u2019s largest store of plutonium, was left vulnerable to internal and external cyber-attacks and 75% of its servers were insecure, Lawrence said, citing a report by Atos, a subcontractor at the site. Sellafield\u2019s own report, from the external IT company Commissum, found that any \u201creasonably skilled hacker or malicious insider\u201d could access sensitive data and insert malware \u2013 computer code \u2013 that could then be used to steal information. Euan Hutton, chief executive of Sellafield, apologised for failures spanning years in a written witness statement referred to by Paul Greaney KC, representing the company. Hutton said: \u201cI again apologise on behalf of the company for matters which led to these proceedings \u2026 I genuinely believe that the issues which led to this prosecution are in the past.\u201d Hutton was in court but did not speak at the hearing. Greaney said the company had tried to address its cybersecurity failings by changing IT management at the site and creating a new secure datacentre. The barrister said some problems identified in recent years had been \u201cturbo-charged\u201d by the prosecution. Greaney said the failings were not a result of cost-cutting. \u201cThere was no penny-pinching,\u201d he added. The court also heard that a subcontractor was sent 4,000 files by mistake, 13 of which were classed as \u201cofficial/sensitive\u201d, without any alarm being triggered. Sensitive nuclear information (SNI), the industry\u2019s special classification system, was left vulnerable in part because of the use of \u201cobsolete\u201d technology including Windows 7 and Windows 2008, Lawrence said. SNI is a mode of categorising information that may have national security implications, and has a special status in law, like other classified materials handled by the British security services or the civil service. Details are given SNI status if they are \u201cdeemed to be of value to an adversary planning a hostile act\u201d, according to the ONR. While all parties said the failings were very serious, the judge said he would need to balance the cost to the taxpayer with the need to deter others in the sector from committing similar offences. The sentencing would be \u201cnew territory for all of us\u201d, Goldspring said, given that no nuclear site had been prosecuted in this way before. The National Audit Office, Britain\u2019s public spending watchdog, launched an investigation this year into costs and risks at Sellafield. The Guardian reported last year that the site systems had been hacked by groups linked to Russia and China in December last year, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. At the time, Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack. Greaney told the court that there was no evidence found for an \u201ceffective\u201d cyber-attack on Sellafield. The court heard that Sellafield\u2019s operations centre was found to be \u201cunable to adequately alarm and respond to tested attacks\u201d. A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cWe take cybersecurity extremely seriously at Sellafield, as reflected in our guilty pleas. The charges relate to historic offences and there is no suggestion that public safety was compromised. \u201cSellafield has not been subjected to a successful cyber-attack or suffered any loss of sensitive nuclear information. We\u2019ve already made significant improvements to our systems, network, and structures to ensure we are better protected and more resilient.\u201d The ONR declined to comment. Sellafield has agreed to pay \u00a353,000 in legal costs."

            "date": "2024-08-13T23:11:33Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign has confirmed it was warned by the FBI it had been targeted by a foreign influence campaign, triggering renewed fears over foreign interference in US elections. The disclosure \u2013 reported by NBC \u2013 came after Donald Trump\u2019s campaign claimed it had been hacked in an email phishing attempt, suspected to have been carried out by Iran. The FBI has confirmed in a statement it is investigating foreign hacking attempts against the campaigns. Harris\u2019s campaign insisted on Tuesday its cybersecurity measures had prevented its systems from being hacked. \u201cWe have robust cybersecurity measures in place, and are not aware of any security breaches of our systems resulting from those efforts,\u201d the campaign told NBC. But the confirmation of the FBI\u2019s warning evoked memories of the 2016 campaign, when Russia was widely believed to have hacked the Democratic party\u2019s email system in an effort to destabilise Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid and help Trump. The Russian hacking effort involved files being given to WikiLeaks, which subsequently published them. This time, the bureau said it was investigating efforts to hack the Biden-Harris campaign in the period before Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race \u2013 effectively handing the Democratic nomination to Harris, the vice-president \u2013 as well as that of Trump, according to the Washington Post. Three Biden-Harris campaign staff members received spear phishing emails designed to look legitimate in order to give an intruder access to wider email communications, the Post reported. It is unclear whether the phishing attempt was successful, and the response by the now-renamed Harris campaign suggested that the vice-president\u2019s staff were confident the campaign had not been hacked. By contrast, the Washington Post and two other US news outlets \u2013 Politico and the New York Times \u2013 reported last weekend receiving apparently authentic files stolen from the Trump campaign. A spokesperson for the campaign said on Saturday it had been hacked in June. It is unclear whether the stolen campaign files were a result of the apparently successful hacking attempt. The Trump campaign is understood not to have reported the hack to the FBI, due to its suspicion of the agency. The phishing attempt is understood to have also targeted Roger Stone, a long-time Trump ally who is now formally linked to his current presidential campaign. \u201cI was informed by the authorities that a couple of my personal email accounts have been compromised,\u201d Stone told the Washington Post. \u201cI really don\u2019t know more about it. And I\u2019m cooperating. It\u2019s all very strange.\u201d US intelligence officials said last month that Iran was attempting to sow discord and undermine Trump\u2019s attempts to recapture the White House. Iran has denied the accusations. The renewed suspicions come amid speculation that the country\u2019s Islamic regime is preparing a strike against Israel in retaliation for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader, in Tehran last week."

            "title": "Pakistan businesses reeling from slow internet blame testing for firewall",
            "date": "2024-08-21T11:00:53Z",
            "content": "For the free online tech skill classes advertised, there were hundreds of Facebook \u201clikes\u201d and in the end 1,500 people signed up. But on the first day last week, only a handful of those registered managed to log in to the live session. The internet was working at a snail\u2019s speed. \u201cWe received hundreds of complaints,\u201d says the course tutor, Wardah Noor, founder of the IT training firm XWave, based in Layyah, in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Internet speeds in the country have dropped by 30-40% over the past few weeks, according to the Wireless and Internet Service Providers Association of Pakistan (Wispap). IT companies say it has cost Pakistan businesses hundreds of millions of dollars. Those who were able to connect to Noor\u2019s course complained of choppy audio and failed connections. \u201cWe had little choice but to end the two-hour session in an hour and the Q&amp;A part in the programme was dropped,\u201d she says. The live sessions have now been turned into recorded lessons, which Noor says, \u201care just not the same\u201d. Many in the IT and software sector believe the government\u2019s testing of a new nationwide internet firewall is behind the mayhem. \u201cOn the one hand, the new government is promising an information technology revolution for Pakistan, and on the other it is throttling it completely,\u201d says Noor. The government has repeatedly denied being responsible for the problems but has admitted plans for a firewall to regulate, block malicious content and protect government networks. The information and technology minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, said on Sunday that her team had been \u201cworking tirelessly\u201d with internet service providers to resolve the issue and blamed Pakistan\u2019s \u201clarge population\u201d for straining the network. \u201cIt is the right of the government to take measures to protect its interests given the cybersecurity attacks that Pakistan is facing,\u201d she said. The firewall will allow the Pakistan government to be able to get to people carrying out \u201canti-state propaganda\u201d, Khawaja says. Iran, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and several other countries already have such firewalls. After the riots sparked by the arrest last year of former prime minister Imran Khan, the Pakistan government blocked social media sites where support for Khan had been building and slowed connection speeds. The platform X has been blocked since the February elections due to \u201cnational security\u201d concerns, with supporters of Khan\u2019s party point out that he is the most popular Pakistani on the platform, with nearly 21 million followers. If the new firewall is behind the huge disruptions the country is experiencing, there should have been some warning, says Khuram Rahat, vice-chair of P@SHA, an association of about 1,500 software and IT companies. \u201cIt makes sense to take steps for our national security, but in hindsight I would say, it could have been planned and managed better,\u201d he says. Azam Mughal, cybersecurity expert at P@SHA, says members have reported huge financial losses. \u201cInternational customers have told these companies they don\u2019t want to give them projects in future, since everything in tech has to be about delivering on time,\u201d says Mughal. He says business could have been warned. \u201cWhenever a new software is implemented, it is tested in a close lab environment, to anticipate the teething pains; this did not happen. \u201cOur survey has found that the country has lost up to $300m due to internet disruptions in the last few months,\u201d he says. Pakistan recorded $298m (\u00a3228m) in IT exports in June, up 33% from the year before. IT exports were worth $3.2bn in the fiscal year that ended in June, up from $2.5bn in 2023. Mughal says privacy concerns should not be ignored because a firewall controls, filters and monitors content coming in and out in the digital territory, including who is generating it. \u201cWhenever you try to bring digital frontiers under control, it is a form of censorship,\u201d he says. However, a firewall can minimise the spread of extremism, religious intolerance and fake content. But many question the need for a firewall. Jehan Ara, a startup ecosystem consultant, says: \u201cIs it to control conversations on social media or is it to prevent criticism and transparency?\u201d Hassan Belal Zaidi, an editor at Dawn newspaper, says the slowdown is a \u201cmajor headache for national newsrooms\u201d, and it is now hard to reach correspondents in remote areas. \u201cWhatsApp has come to be seen and used as the primary medium for relaying information, multimedia content and pics, and this system has been all but crippled with the throttling of these apps,\u201d he says. \u201cThe astronomical rise in taxes on internet services means we\u2019re paying nearly double the price for half the connectivity.\u201d But the worst affected are perhaps the more than 500,000 IT sector freelancers in Pakistan who rely on mobile data. \u201cIs reliable internet too much to ask for in today\u2019s digital age?\u201d says Bilal Khosa, 25, who works remotely in digital marketing. \u201cPending tasks, missed deadlines, and lost productivity are becoming a norm,\u201d he says. Khosa uses Fiverr, a freelancing platform, which now displays an \u201cout of office\u201d message. The slowdown has had a devastating effect on his ranking which could take \u201csix months or more\u201d to restore, he says. \u201cThe competition is so tough, there are hundreds just waiting to take your place,\u201d says Khosa. Bigger companies have not escaped. Veqar Islam, CEO at Jaffer Business Systems, which employs of more than 1,000 people, says \u201cfiddling in this bizarre manner\u201d is equivalent to taking Pakistan \u201cback to the stone age\u201d. He says he has just had a difficult meeting with US clients: \u201cThey told me that if we want to work with them, we need to consider relocating our back end.\u201d Islam says other customers are threatening to terminate contracts. \u201cSuch measures don\u2019t just create disasters in the present; they have long-lasting effects of up to decades.\u201d"

            "content": "US intelligence officials have confirmed that Iran was behind a hack of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, authorities said on Monday. In a joint statement, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said it attributed \u201crecently reported activities to compromise former President Trump\u2019s campaign\u201d to Iran, and that the intelligence community is \u201cconfident that the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties\u201d. Iran\u2019s efforts include \u201cthefts and disclosures\u201d and \u201care intended to influence the US election process\u201d, the statement said. The announcement comes a week after several news organizations, including the New York Times, the Washington Post and Politico, reported that they had received internal campaign records, including a dossier on Ohio senator JD Vance, Trump\u2019s running mate. The former president had blamed the Iranian government in the immediate aftermath, saying Microsoft informed the campaign about the hack. Trump also asserted that \u201conly publicly available information\u201d was taken. Last week, Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign said the FBI had warned that it had been targeted by foreign hackers. Officials with the vice-president\u2019s campaign said its cybersecurity measures had successfully thwarted the hacking attempt. The hacking efforts were part of a broader campaign to impact the US election, the intelligence officials\u2019 statement said: \u201cIran perceives this year\u2019s elections to be particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests, increasing Tehran\u2019s inclination to try to shape the outcome. We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting presidential campaigns.\u201d The FBI has been in contact with victims of the hacking and \u201cwill continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible\u201d, the statement said, adding: \u201cWe will not tolerate foreign efforts to influence or interfere with our elections, including the targeting of American political campaigns.\u201d In 2016, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was hacked, leading to the release of internal emails, which became a major controversy in the presidential campaign. Russian intelligence officers were later indicted for that hack."

            "content": "While most of the nation were enjoying the late August sunshine and the news that Oasis are getting back together, it seemed an odd moment for Keir Starmer to bring everyone back down to earth with a bump. But his gloom-laden speech in the Downing Street garden on Tuesday did just that. \u201cI have to be honest with you: things are worse than we ever imagined,\u201d the prime minister told his hand-picked audience. The finger of blame was again pointed firmly at the Conservatives, whom he accused of leaving behind an economic and societal \u201cblack hole\u201d. \u201cThat is why we have to take action and do things differently,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of that is being honest with people \u2013 about the choices we face. And how tough this will be. Frankly, things will get worse before they get better.\u201d Starmer\u2019s message \u2013 delivered from a podium emblazoned with the words \u201cFixing the foundations\u201d \u2013 set off a ripple of anxiety among Labour MPs, many of whom have been desperate for the government to offer some hope after their landslide election victory. \u201cWe\u2019ve just won power for the first time in 14 years. Surely that in itself is a reason for optimism?\u201d one remarked after the speech. Another MP said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t achieve radical change to improve people\u2019s lives with a majority of 167, then when can you?\u201d Several cited the contrast with the unbridled enthusiasm on show at the Democrat National Convention in Chicago the week before, where buoyant US presidential candidate Kamala Harris received a rockstar reception. One senior minister said that the electorate, having put their faith in Labour improving their lot, would expect to see results soon or would punish the party at the ballot box. \u201cWe don\u2019t have as long as No 10 thinks. If people aren\u2019t feeling things are better in the next couple of years, that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d they said. Others were concerned that Starmer\u2019s downbeat approach could depress consumer and business confidence to the extent that it undermines his own strategy for getting the country back on track: economic growth. \u201cThe miserablism is completely self-defeating,\u201d warned one MP. \u201cWe need to be bigging Britain up. It feels like we\u2019re doing the opposite.\u201d But Downing Street insiders brushed aside MPs\u2019 jitters. \u201cThey need to get over it,\u201d said one source. \u201cThe public is sick of boosterism. Boris Johnson overpromising and underdelivering is a big factor in why people have lost faith in politics.\u201d Another senior Labour insider said: \u201cKeir can\u2019t make everything fine just by saying it\u2019s all great. He would rather level with people and explain the trade-offs, not pretend. I don\u2019t agree that he\u2019s unnecessarily gloomy or that he doesn\u2019t \u2018do hope\u2019. He\u2019s saying that change is coming, but it\u2019s just going to take time.\u201d Some inside No 10 acknowledge that Starmer and his ministers need to do a better job of explaining the tough choices to the public. One figure admits they may even have overdone the gloom in recent days. After the government sent out Pat McFadden last weekend to roll the pitch for Starmer\u2019s speech, they conceded that the Cabinet Office minister, who \u201ccould make an undertaker look cheerful\u201d, was perhaps not the best choice. Starmer\u2019s speech had originally been planned for the week the riots broke out, sources said. It was intended as a follow-up to Rachel Reeves\u2019 own speech to MPs in July, when she emphasised the now familiar \u201cinheritance\u201d narrative. Downing Street hopes that by the time the budget \u2013 with its expected tax rises and Whitehall cuts \u2013 bites at the end of October, the public will be prepared for the pain to come. However, aides denied that their carefully honed message was all just expectation management. \u201cThings are going to be really tough,\u201d one said. Several departments have had to push announcements they had planned for the first few weeks of government into the next fiscal year because they can\u2019t afford them, sources said. But the two most recognisable figures in his cabinet this week showed some recognition that hope is needed. Reeves gave what one MP described as a \u201ctub-thumping spiel\u201d on how the economy would improve under Labour in a private meeting during a visit to Scotland. She is also expected to say more about growth in the weeks ahead, reminding people of the steps the government has already taken. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, there\u2019s a lot more to do, but we\u2019ll start seeing the hard work paying off,\u201d one government insider said. \u201cIt won\u2019t all be doom and gloom for ever.\u201d And in the small hours of Thursday morning, Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, was filmed dancing in an DJ booth in Ibiza, drink in hand. All it needed was some Oasis."

            "date": "2024-08-23T04:00:24Z",
            "content": "At al-Salam glass and ceramics factory on the outskirts of Hebron, the glassblowing furnace and the potter\u2019s wheel are no longer in daily use; the room where artists decorate bowls and tiles with the traditional blues, yellows and reds of the Palestinian craft is sometimes empty. The glass panes of one window and a door now bear the unmistakable spiderweb-like holes created by gunfire. Israeli soldiers at a nearby checkpoint fired live bullets at teenagers and young men throwing stones in an altercation a few weeks ago, said the factory\u2019s owner, Sami al-Nader. Hebron, a city in the south of the occupied West Bank, is far from the fighting between Hamas and Israel that has raged in the Gaza Strip for 10 months. But violence between Palestinians and the Israeli army and settlers in the West Bank has also reached a level not seen for 20 years, and new restrictions such as road closures, lockdowns and the cancellation of thousands of Israel work permits are suffocating the economy and daily life. \u201cThe pandemic does not compare to what our business is going through now. We used to welcome tourists every day, and now, if we are lucky, we sell things on Saturdays only. We are not even getting online orders, because no one in Palestine has any money,\u201d said Nader, 47. \u201cMy family has owned the factory for more than 70 years. I do not want it to close under my watch.\u201d For better or worse, the Israeli and Palestinian economies are deeply intertwined: Israel relies on cheaper Palestinian labour, particularly in construction and agriculture, and before the war higher Israeli wages generated an estimated 20% of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s (PA) GDP. In 2022, these workers contributed \u00a33.05bn to the Palestinian economy, two-thirds of the PA\u2019s total budget. After the Hamas attacks of 7 October, however, Israel suspended entry for about 140,000 Palestinian workers from the West Bank. Only a fraction of those have since been restored, and Israel is trying to plug the gap with labourers from India. As a result, unemployment and poverty in the West Bank have soared, putting the already unstable territory on the brink of a financial crash and fuelling unrest. In the West Bank\u2019s refugee camps, set up after the creation of Israel in 1948 and even today still slum-like, young men told the Guardian that militant groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were the only employers they could find. Unemployment in the first quarter of 2024 was up 11% to 35% year on year, according to the International Labour Organization, and the UN estimates a 13- to 16-year setback in human development. Inflation is up, the PA has slashed salaries and cut workers, and Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, is withholding tax funds to the PA as a punitive measure for its cooperation with the international criminal court in The Hague. He has also repeatedly threatened to cut off Palestinian banks from the international banking system, which would cause the PA to collapse altogether. \u201cAll Israeli administrations use the stick and the carrot with the PA, but the current government is pursuing particularly contradictory policies. Israel needs the PA to maintain security in the West Bank and protect settlers but they are leveraging what they can,\u201d said Tahani Mustafa, a senior Palestine analyst at the Crisis Group thinktank. \u201cThe other logic is that of collective punishment: although it\u2019s not worked in the past they seem to still believe that if you impose an economic siege, and a siege on movement, and squeeze the people enough, they will obey.\u201d In Nahalin, a Palestinian village south of Jerusalem, father and son Mahmood and Yaqoub Dadouh, both skilled marble and stone workers, now spend most of their days doing projects in the garden. The lights are off in Mahmood\u2019s huge kitchen and bathroom materials warehouse next door; he used to mainly supply Israelis from the nearby settlement of Beitar Illit, but not a single customer has come for the better part of a year. Yaqoub, a father of two small girls, said he was still owed 16,000 shekels (\u00a33,300) from a project in Israel that was cancelled after 7 October. The contractor is refusing to take his calls. \u201cWe\u2019ve already sold all of the gold, the jewellery. It was heartbreaking asking my wife to do that,\u201d said Yaqoub, 29. \u201cI think we can manage with our savings for another two months. After that I have no idea what we are going to do.\u201d There is no reliable data, but in the past few years people in the West Bank have begun finding ways to get through Israel\u2019s various security barriers into Israel without permits, in search of better-paid work. It is a dangerous decision, but an estimated 40,000 Palestinians are still making the journey, sometimes staying in Israel undocumented for weeks at a time. A cousin of the Dadouhs found work on a construction site in southern Israel a few weeks ago, the pair said. He has no insurance or rights and risks being caught, but is at least able to send money to his family. \u201cI think the situation is not sustainable,\u201d Yacoub said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us any more \u2013 then end the occupation and let us work for ourselves.\u201d"

            "content": "Ministers could find ways to boost the economy and improve public services by combining data from separate government departments, according to the head of the UK\u2019s statistics watchdog. Sir Robert Chote, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, said that too often government data was \u201csiloed\u201d because departments and other bodies were worried that people may uncover weaknesses in the data or even reach inconvenient conclusions. He also warned that gathering official data was becoming harder as a result of budget cuts and because people were less willing to respond to surveys. But he said that the \u201cunrealised potential\u201d of sharing and linking data could help the government generate new ideas and improve its policies. Writing in the Observer, Chote said: \u201cDuring the pandemic, the sense of national emergency provided an urgent impetus for sharing data. This enabled valuable insights, such as identifying where to target communication campaigns to increase vaccine uptake. \u201cBut since then, the system has not fully capitalised on similar opportunities. Many gains remain untapped.\u201d Other examples include the Better Outcomes through Linked Data programme, which found that offenders with alcohol or drug problems were 10 times more likely to take their own lives than the general population in England and Wales. Using data from the Ministry of Justice, Department of Health and Social Care and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, it also discovered that those deaths may be reduced by speeding up access to treatment. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been starting to collect more data from private companies to create its official figures. This month, it revealed it had started using anonymised data from supermarket scanners to check inflation as well as data on cars and train fares respectively from Auto Trader and the Rail Delivery Group. It similarly takes anonymised Visa data to track credit and debit card spending to inform its travel and tourism research, and also uses live PAYE data from HM Revenue and Customs to give a more accurate number of people in work. Yet these examples are still too rare, Chote said. Too often departments and other bodies were more concerned about the downsides of sharing information, such as risks to privacy, as well as to the reputation of bodies \u201cif weaknesses in their own data are revealed or if they are used to reach conclusions or narratives that the institution or its leadership finds inconvenient\u201d. Chote also warned that the ONS and other data gatherers were \u201cunder greater strain\u201d, partly because of tight budgets. \u201cIt is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain the quality of the household surveys that we rely on to understand important parts of the economy and society because of falling response rates and higher collection costs, a trend seen by other statistics agencies across the world,\u201d he said.Last year, the ONS suddenly stopped publishing monthly jobs data from the labour force survey because of concerns that the response rate made the figures unreliable. The survey is used to estimate unemployment and jobs data, which in turn forms part of the Bank of England\u2019s decisions about interest rates."

            "content": "Vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris unveiled her economic campaign proposal in North Carolina to build what she called an \u201copportunity economy\u201d focused on the middle class. She said in Raleigh: \u201cYour salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life \u2026 such as, no child should have to grow up in poverty. Such as, after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity, and you should be able to join a union if you choose.\u201d To lower the cost of living, Harris told the rally she intends to cut needless bureaucracy and red tape, pursue investigations of anti-competitive behavior in the food supply, and propose a federal ban on price-gouging in food. Harris said inflation had fallen below 3% for the first time since March 2021, according to a recent federal report. \u201cOur supply chains have now improved, and prices are still too high,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMany of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades. And while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren\u2019t. \u201cLook, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy and playing by the rules. But some are not, and that\u2019s just not right. And we need to take action when that\u2019s the case.\u201d Harris\u2019s comments came before next week\u2019s Democratic national convention in Chicago, where political observers might expect to hear more detail about her economic agenda. North Carolina is also a particular focal point for the new campaign. Barack Obama was the last Democratic presidential candidate to win North Carolina, eking out a win by a 0.32-percentage-point margin in 2008. Recent polling suggests North Carolina is close enough to contest in 2024, and even more so after Harris replaced Joe Biden when he dropped out in late July. Harris said she had visited the state 16 times as vice-president. In her speech, Harris said she had worked at McDonald\u2019s in her youth and understood the struggle of low-wage work, and that she worked as California\u2019s attorney general to lower drug prices and to go after predatory lending in the housing market. Red tape and barriers are constraining the housing supply, she said. \u201cBy the end of my first term, we will end America\u2019s housing shortage by building 3m new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we will make sure those homes actually go to working and middle-class Americans, not just investors.\u201d The purchase of single-family housing by corporate landlords in the real estate investment trust financial sector has become a significant national political issue. \u201cIt can make it impossible then for regular people to buy or even rent a home,\u201d Harris said, noting accusations of collusion raised by ProPublica in an investigation of the use of RealPage software. The Federal Trade Commission and US Department of Justice filed a joint legal brief in March addressing their concerns about algorithmic price fixing. \u201cIt\u2019s anti-competitive, and it drives up costs,\u201d she said. \u201cI will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices.\u201d Harris also proposed a $25,000 grant for first-time homebuyers to help with down-payments. \u201cUnder my plan, more than 100 million Americans would get a tax cut,\u201d Harris said, proposing a return of the earned income tax credit and child tax credit, and a $6,000 tax credit for new parents. She contrasted her proposals to Donald Trump\u2019s support for the FairTax, a national sales tax intended to replace income tax, and said taxpayers would pay thousands more under the proposals contained in the Project 2025 manifesto. \u201cHe [Trump] plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts year after year,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he plans to cut corporate taxes by over $1tn, even as they pull in record profits. And that\u2019s on top of the $2tn tax cut he already signed into law as president, which, by the way, overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations, and exploded the national deficit. \u201cI think if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-08-15T12:33:26Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy has extended its recovery from recession after recording growth of 0.6% in the three months to June, handing a boost to the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, in the run-up to the autumn budget. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show gross domestic product continued to grow in the second quarter, after a rise of 0.7% in the first three months of 2024. The reading matched the forecasts of City economists. However, monthly GDP growth was flat in June as wet weather deterred shoppers from spending in what has been a washout summer for retailers. Ben Jones, the lead economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said the figures showed the economy had \u201cfinally shaken off its slumber of recent years\u201d, but warned there were still challenges to sustainably boosting Britain\u2019s long-term growth rate. \u201cWe think the quarterly data probably overstates the underlying momentum in the economy, with recent CBI surveys of activity remaining fairly subdued,\u201d he said. \u201cBut firms nonetheless appear confident that the recovery will continue.\u201d According to the latest snapshot, service sector output increased by 0.8% in the second quarter, powered by scientific research and development. There was also strength in the IT, transport, law, architecture and engineering sectors. Consumer-facing service output fell by 0.1%, reflecting a weaker period for purchases of physical goods amid the cost of living crisis and poor weather hitting retail sales. Manufacturing and construction output also fell. The UK has grown at a faster pace this year than many forecasters predicted, in a development seized on by the shadow chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, as evidence that the previous government had helped the economy to turn a corner. \u201cToday\u2019s figures are yet further proof that Labour have inherited a growing and resilient economy. The chancellor\u2019s attempt to blame her economic inheritance on her decision to raise taxes \u2013 tax rises she had always planned \u2013 will not wash with the public,\u201d he said. The latest figures show the UK recorded the strongest growth in the G7 group of advanced economies over the past six months. The second-quarter growth rate of 0.6% compares with 0.3% in the eurozone, and 0.7% in the US. However, it comes after a lacklustre performance over the past decade, and high living costs, elevated interest rates and faltering productivity gains are acting as a brake on momentum. The UK economy entered recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of falling GDP \u2013 in the second half of last year as households cut back on spending. Reeves has said rebooting the economy is Labour\u2019s number one priority, arguing that stronger growth will help to boost living standards and raise more tax revenue to repair battered public services. The chancellor will deliver an autumn budget on 30 October. \u201cThe new government is under no illusion as to the scale of the challenge we have inherited after more than a decade of low economic growth and a \u00a322bn black hole in the public finances,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why we have made economic growth our national mission and we are taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off.\u201d Experts said the recent strength in the economy would be unlikely to last. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised its growth forecast from 0.5% to 1.25% for 2024, but warned of a weaker medium-term outlook as high interest rates hit activity. Figures released on Wednesday showed inflation rose by less than expected in July to 2.2%. The continued strong GDP growth in the second quarter of the year may mean that the Bank delays interest rate cuts until past September, according to financial market bets. The Bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 5% when rate-setters meet next month, before making a 0.25%-point rate cut at the following meeting in November. Much of the recent expansion has been driven by a growing population. The latest figures showed GDP per head, an important barometer of living standards, was 0.1% lower than a year earlier in the second quarter, and 0.8% below pre-pandemic levels. Simon Pittaway, a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s medium-term record is far less impressive, and has been driven by a growing population rather than rising productivity. \u201cWithout a return to productivity growth, living standards will continue to stagnate and Britain will continue to fall behind its peers.\u201d"

            "content": "The forthcoming election is one of the most important to me since I first cast a ballot more than four decades ago. And yet this time \u2013 while I\u2019ve never felt more invested in an election\u2019s outcome \u2013 I won\u2019t have a vote. I\u2019m not talking about the next federal poll in Australia \u2013 the one that\u2019s most likely to be held early next year. No, I\u2019m referring to the United States presidential election in November, the result of which will reverberate with profound global consequences and \u2013 therefore \u2013 with significant personal others as well. Yes, I\u2019ve heard our ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, praise Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cdiscipline\u2019\u2019 and tell people to \u201cjust chill\u2019\u2019 because \u201cwe\u2019re not going over some chasm\u2019\u2019 if the 45th president \u2013 a narcissist and misogynist with a chaotic vision (or hallucination; it\u2019s hard to tell) \u2013 is elected the 47th. And I\u2019ve heard the rote, condescending nonsense \u2013 equally aimed to assuage the fears of the decent and progressive \u2013 from Australian politicians: that the US-Australia relationship exists between two \u201cgreat democracies\u2019\u2019 and that it is effectively immaterial who the next president ... blah blah. But I did also hear another, rather more convincing, non-ambassadorial version of Rudd say Trump was \u201cnuts\u201d (mild criticism, really, given the array of damning material in the ether about the Republican presidential nominee). Just as it resonated when the Republican veep nominee, JD Vance, called his running mate \u201ccultural heroin\u2019\u2019 and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d. In fairness, that was in the not-so-distant past (according to him, another country) when Vance had a book to sell and before he decided that he\u2019d like to follow Trump all the way into the Oval Office. Indeed, there seems to be a bottomless well of character assessments (\u201cmorally reprehensible human being\u2019\u2019 \u2013 again, hard to argue!) Vance gave Trump in the unforgiving continent that is the past. My obsession with what happens next in the US \u2013 and my sense of powerlessness to change it \u2013 is manifesting in personally unprecedented engagement with US news, commentary media and polls. This fixation is doubtless related to advancing middle age, legacy and a future (without me in it) that will still be inhabited by my children and grandchildren. America is the most geopolitically and militarily influential of countries. It is also the west\u2019s most culturally and socially impactful. It\u2019s why I fear for my \u2013 and everyone else\u2019s \u2013 descendants (not least women and girls like my daughters and granddaughters) in a world whose the two potentially most-powerful men \u2013 Trump and Vance \u2013 are also so apparently misogynistic, hateful and narcissistic. The litany of Trump\u2019s actual (and verbal) offences against women is notorious. This seems too often forgotten or overlooked by admirers the world over \u2013 especially among sections of the political class here in Australia \u2013 to the file marked \u201ccharacter\u2019\u2019 and made, therefore, somehow irrelevant. But such character traits are as highly relevant globally, as Trump attacks the reproductive (and human) rights of American women and deploys vicious slurs against women who threaten \u2013 or call out \u2013 their misogyny. The latest to come to light seems to be Vance\u2019s weaponisation of parenthood, in 2021 labelling senior Democrats \u2013 including now presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 \u201cchildless cat ladies\u2019\u2019. Trump\u2019s latest attack on Kamala Harris \u2013 saying she had \u201cturned black\u2019\u2019, an unsustainably false challenge to her racial identity \u2013 makes him less worthy. Just as this will give succour to racists the world over, it also enables politicians, including here, who would weaponise racial identity for cynical gain. While Trump and Vance, like all populists, are perilously short on constructive policy and plans and optimism for the future, their prescriptive visions for social design when it comes to families and how they reckon they should look are coming into very sharp \u2013 and alarming \u2013 focus. If this is all starting to sound, well, somewhat dystopic, that\u2019s because it is. The most alarming thing for me, a world away, about the re-emergence of Trump (twice impeached, 34 felony convictions) and the upwardly-managing Vance is the global licence they give others to ape, voice and enact their misogyny. If it\u2019s good enough for the leader of the free world and his apprentice ... With Trump\u2019s cozying up to despots and dictators and his own dictatorial fantasies (having denied the last election result then incited a 6 January lynch mob to attack the capitol in pursuit of his then vice-president, Mike Pence, who certified the legitimate election of Joe Biden), Trump is the embodiment of autocracy. The danger he poses potentially extends far and away beyond the US, and with a deputy like Vance (who would not stand up to him the way Pence did), Trump\u2019s power would be unfettered. So, \u201cresponsible\u2019\u2019? No. Don\u2019t just chill. Be vigilant. I could go on about how Trump\u2019s general playbook and cynical identity politics has already influenced and enabled elements of Australian leadership (as it has elsewhere in the world) from the tenor of civic debate to renewables (\u201cdrill baby drill\u2019\u2019), emissions targets and a range of social issues. But it is the Trump/Vance attitude \u2013 their words and actions regarding women, gender, families, race and society \u2013 that makes the forthcoming presidential election the most consequential for the rest of my life. It\u2019s true we don\u2019t have a vote down here. But as many have said, maybe we should. Meanwhile, some of us can continue to hope and watch carefully. \u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist"

            "date": "2024-08-12T03:02:41Z",
            "content": "Thailand\u2019s conservative establishment is seeking to exterminate politicians who promised reform, according to the former leader of a popular party that was banned by the courts last week. Pita Limjaroenrat, whose Move Forward party won the most votes and most seats in last year\u2019s election, said Thailand was trapped in a \u201cdouble lock democracy\u201d where the legal system and military coups were repeatedly being used to undermine election results. His former party was dissolved on Wednesday over its promise to reform the country\u2019s strict lese majesty law, under which criticism of the monarchy can lead to up to 15 years in prison. UN Human Rights Chief, Volker Turk, the European Union and the US state department all expressed concern over the Constitutional Court judgment, warning it set back the country\u2019s democratic progress. The party\u2019s remaining MPs have since regrouped under a new party, the People\u2019s Party, but Pita and the executive committee of Move Forward are banned from politics for 10 years. He has warned legal threats against the new party could escalate. \u201cThey\u2019re coming after us. They\u2019re exterminating us,\u201d said Pita, who spoke to the Guardian from his home in Bangkok. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to compromise. They\u2019re not here to find consensus.\u201d Move Forward had promised to shake up Thailand by stopping the military from intervening in politics, breaking up monopolies that dominate the economy and reforming the lese majesty law. Their pledges resonated with a wide cross-section of Thai voters, but also attracted fierce opposition from members of the powerful military royalist establishment, which blocked it from taking power, accusing it of trying to overthrow the monarchy. Pita said his opponents were using the monarchy as a pretext to protect their own interests. \u201cI believe the king is revered above politics as we are a constitutional monarchy,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped, \u201cthe people in power, whether it\u2019s military or monopolies, stop dragging down the monarch as an excuse to protect their concentration of wealth and power.\u201d The party\u2019s pledge to reform the law was aimed at de-escalating conflict that has existed between younger generations and the monarchy, he said. \u201cMy attempted amendment of the criminal code [article] 112 [the lese majesty law], was hoping to use the parliament as a middle path, a common ground, with transparency.\u201d In 2020, mass youth-led protests called for reform of the monarchy, criticising an institution that had long been considered untouchable. In the run up to last year\u2019s election there was unprecedented discussion of lese majesty, with political parties forced to announce their stance on the law. Move Forward was the only party to promise reform. There is now a shrinking space for such debates, Pita said, adding that the conditions for free speech were worse today than even before the mass protests began. Since 2020 at least 272 people have since been charged with lese majesty. Pita said that there was \u201ca thirst for justice\u201d among the public after the dissolution of Move Forward. \u201cI spend my time trying to shape the trajectory of anger and thirst [towards] the ballot box, rather than the battles on the street,\u201d he said, adding that street protests brought the risk of \u201cbullets in people\u2019s heads\u201d and of a military coup. The Thai authorities have a history of using excessive violence against protesters, including in 2010, when at least 90 people were killed in a military crackdown. The threat of a coup was always a possibility in Thailand, he added. \u201cI speak that not because of my feeling but because of facts \u2026 From 1932\u2026 there have been 13 military coups and 20 attempted [coups] \u2026 the last one being just a decade ago,\u201d he said. Judicial harassment was the other way in which the establishment maintained control, he added. Move Forward was the 34th political party to be dissolved since 2006, according to Pita. Further legal threats loom against former Move Forward MPs, including those who have moved to its successor, People\u2019s Party. The National Anti-Corruption Commission is investigating the ethical conduct of 44 politicians who belonged to Move Forward who supported the bill to reform lese majesty. They could face a lifetime ban from politics. The new party would aspire to win by an even greater margin than in last\u2019s year\u2019s election, \u201cto the extent that we\u2019re the undisputed leader in a democratic Thailand\u201d. The old structures that exist in Thailand also risked a \u201ccollapse from within\u201d, he added, as newer generations enter politics, the legal system or the military. The People\u2019s party has said its ideology remains unchanged, though its strategies may differ. \u201cYou can pick up a few flowers, but you cannot stop spring,\u201d Pita said."

            "content": "India is home to more than a billion people and several hundred languages, and so any list of books that attempt to describe it is bound to be incomplete. The ones I\u2019ve chosen speak to some of the themes dominant in India these days \u2013 caste, propaganda, political prisoners, the weaponisation of state machinery, listless youth and nostalgia for gentler times. Some are recent and helped me understand the country as I wrote my own book, The New India; others, though older, stand out for their language and craft. All of them are worth your time. *** Gujarat Under Modi by Christophe Jaffrelot Jaffrelot\u2019s extraordinary book describes Narendra Modi\u2019s centralised governance style before he was prime minister. It was written in 2013, the year before Modi\u2019s national victory, and deemed too \u201chigh-risk\u201d to publish for almost a decade. But 10 years later, the book could well be a record of Modi\u2019s prime ministership. It\u2019s a detailed study of how he outflanked rivals, thwarted investigations, reduced his dependency on the RSS \u2013 the organisation he rose from \u2013 and took his message directly to the people. Jaffrelot records how Modi tinkers with political systems and bureaucratic processes to make them align with his interests, and describes how these actions lend cover to Hindu nationalists as they embed themselves deeper into society, making their extrication increasingly difficult. *** The Incarcerations by Alpa Shah In 2018, a day-long commemoration of a 200-year-old Dalit victory over an upper caste army ended in deadly violence. The police investigation that followed snares not the instigators of the unrest, but 16 human rights activists, journalists, and poets working toward Dalit solidarity. Shah uses these real events to tell the story of a country fighting to define itself. It unfolds gradually, drawing readers in with backstories of the arrested and their ambitions, and the alleged perpetrators and their links to the Hindu right. Shah pays special attention to the electronic evidence found on confiscated devices, including letters full of unbelievable plots and conspiracies. (Fittingly, the book was a finalist for the Orwell prize for political nonfiction this year.) She worries for the republic, but reminds us that \u201cthe seeds of democracy are preserved within fascism\u201d. *** Curfewed Night by Basharat Peer The journalist and author Peer wants to be an observer, not a voyeur, in this lament for the region of Kashmir. People tell him what they did and what was done to them between walnut and willow trees and fields covered in frost in this land of Indian army security checkpoints, forced disappearances and a population that longs for freedom. Peer is a hungry witness, and he not only excavates his subjects\u2019 memories, but also his own memory of home in this work of narrative nonfiction. We see it all: what Kashmir was, what it is, what it could still be. *** Malevolent Republic by KS Komireddi There has been no angrier book about India in recent years, no book that contains as sustained a primal scream. Komireddi\u2019s rollicking reported polemic is a critique of modern India and the people whose missteps and disingenuousness led it to the brink of disaster. He spares no one \u2013 not Modi, not the Gandhi family, not broader Indian society. *** A Free Man by Aman Sethi Because employment and the nature of work are political subjects, and because the vast majority of India\u2019s labour force is informal, Sethi\u2019s immense study of itinerant labourers, published the early 2010s, is a deeply political book. He smokes and gets drunk with his subjects, buys tools with them, watches how they find work and fall ill and die, identifies their dreams and records their disillusionments, and lists the scars they acquire from a lifetime of uncertainty. A work of incredible beauty. The New India: The Unmaking of the World\u2019s Largest Democracy by Rahul Bhatia is published by Abacus (\u00a325).

Frivolous doesn\u2019t seem an option for these young British Muslims: theirs can\u2019t simply be private choices that shut out the world. There are other ways this two-hander doesn\u2019t play out via romcom rules. In a theatre culture that skews secular, Manzoor-Khan writes from faith: the characters are practising Muslims aiming to live with intention. \u201cHow\u2019s it bringing me closer to God?\u201d wonders Hafsah about her choices, while a declaration of love is followed by: \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated \u2013 we just tell our mums and get married.\u201d There\u2019s as much direct address as dialogue: perhaps too much, as the characters narrate their thoughts rather than test them with each other. Manzoor-Khan is a poet so it\u2019s no surprise her text carries salt and darting lyricism. But she\u2019s also an activist, unpicking Islamophobia. Public paranoia and the heavy-handed Prevent strategy shape the action. The actors can\u2019t touch, so in Sammena Hussain\u2019s engagingly performed production they work to charge the space between them \u2013 an over-the-shoulder glance, a tender moment in a rainstorm. Between scenes, they often run in circles \u2013 in opposite directions then joyously in sync, a moment that lifts the heaviness of the world. \u2022 At Kiln theatre, London, until 31 August"

            "date": "2024-08-14T00:07:44Z",
            "content": "This blog is closing now, thanks for following along. You can find our latest US politics coverage here. Tim Walz has wrapped up his 30 minute appearance at an event in Newport that donors paid between $1000 and 100,000 to attend. The Orange Country register reports that his speech was \u201cpeppered with Midwest jokes and self-deprecating quips\u201d. Here is the local news outlet\u2019s report: Standing before a large ballroom at the Balboa Bay Resort, a waterfront hotel in Newport Beach, Walz ran through his resume: governor, congressman, educator, coach \u2014 \u201cWe won the damn state championship,\u201d he reminded a cheering audience. He ran through his platform \u2014 supporting gun ownership when balanced with certain regulations, paid family leave and clean air regulations. \u2018They keep talking about these are radical things, and I\u2019m like, go ahead and label me whatever you want because I\u2019ll damn sure guarantee you 80% of people in Minnesota and across the country want those things,\u2019 said Walz to applause. \u2018You know better than anybody in this state what we\u2019ve got in the vice president,\u2019 Walz said. \u2018She\u2019s found her voice.\u2019 One of the fundraiser\u2019s hosts, attorney Wylie Aitken, said he had never seen so much enthusiasm in all the years he\u2019d been doing this: '\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that when everybody was kind of down and out and feeling, legitimately, concern with Biden, etc., then suddenly to have this reversal and to see this incredible enthusiasm that\u2019s energised everyone.\u201d Missouri voters will decide in November whether to guarantee a right to abortion with a constitutional amendment that would reverse the state\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure. Missouri has become the eighth state to have abortion on the ballot in November. The secretary of state\u2019s office certified Tuesday that an initiative petition received more than enough signatures from registered voters to qualify for the general election. It will need approval from a majority of voters to become enshrined in the state constitution. Missouri will join at least seven states voting on abortion rights during the presidential election. Arizona\u2019s secretary of state certified an abortion-rights measure for the ballot on Monday. Measures also will go before voters in Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada and South Dakota. While not explicitly addressing abortion rights, a New York ballot measure would bar discrimination based on \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and \u201creproductive healthcare,\u201d among other things. Harris and Walz are planning to hold a rally in Milwaukee while the DNC is happening in Chicago next week, the New York Times reports \u2013 in the venue where Trump accepted the Republican nomination last month. The rally is planned for Tuesday, according to the report, which cites four people briefed on the discussions. The Fiserv Forum, where the rally will reportedly take place, is 80 miles, or 128km, from the United Center in Chicago, where the DNC is taking place all week. The move is not unusual, but is interesting because it will serve as a direct comparison of crowd size and energy to Trump\u2019s event. Trump has claimed, falsely, that Harris\u2019s crowd sizes are fake. Meanwhile Joe Biden says Ukraine\u2019s military incursion into Russia has \u201ccreated a real dilemma\u201d for Russian President Vladimir Putin. He added that US officials are in constant touch with the Ukrainians about the move. About 1,000 Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of 6 August, with tanks and armoured vehicles, Reuters reports. A US official said late on Tuesday that the goal of Ukraine\u2019s Kursk incursion appears to be to force Russia to pull troops out of Ukraine to defend Russian territory against the cross-border assault. Answering questions from reporters upon arrival in New Orleans, Biden said he has been briefed every four to five hours for the last six to eight days on Ukraine\u2019s action. \u201cIt\u2019s creating a real dilemma for Putin,\u201d he said in his first substantive comments about the operation, which appeared to have caught the Russians off guard. The US has provided billions of dollars of weaponry to Ukraine intended largely for defensive purposes, as Ukraine tries to repel the Russian invasion launched in February 2022. In May, Biden authorised Kyiv to launch US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia that are supporting an offensive against the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. The White House said Ukraine did not provide advance notice of its incursion, which took place in the Kursk region of Russia. Russian forces on Tuesday struck back at Ukrainian troops with missiles, drones and airstrikes. As we await news of Walz\u2019s appearance at a fundraiser in California, here is AP\u2019s look at his first solo appearance since being named the Democratic vice presidential nominee last week: Minnesota Governor Tim Walz warned cheering union members Tuesday that Donald Trump would wage war on working people while threatening Medicare and Social Security as he kicked off a five-state fundraising swing. Speaking in a cavernous, dimly lit ballroom to thousands of members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Walz said he and Vice President Kamala Harris want to spread collective bargaining and other worker protections to \u201cevery state in the union.\u201d \u201cWhen unions are strong, America is strong,\u201d Walz, a former school teacher and union member, said. The Democratic campaign chose to kick off Walz\u2019s national swing on the safest of political terrain \u2014 heavily Democratic California, home to Vice President Harris and where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans about 2-1. Though Harris is gaining ground in the polls, Trump is still more popular than he was at this point in 2016 or 2020: Tim Walz is scheduled to appear at a fundraiser in Newport Beach, California this afternoon. On Wednesday, he will address fundraisers in Denver and Boston, and then wrap up his trip on Thursday in Newport, Rhode Island, and Southampton, New York. Walz\u2019s focus on fundraising this week comes after he stormed through a series of battleground states with Harris last week to introduce himself to voters nationally. The two held rallies in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. His speeches so far have been built around key themes for Democrats in 2024: support for abortion rights, lifting the middle class and characterizing Trump as \u201cweird\u201d \u2014 an attack line Walz has been credited with authoring. Democratic voter registration has surged following Biden dropping out \u2013 and Harris stepping in, the New York Times reports. This follows an almost year-long trend of more people registering as Republicans than Democrats in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, including a spike after the Trump assassination attempt. But after Biden dropped out, weekly Democratic registrations outnumbered Republican nominations in North Carolina. Pennsylvania saw the largest Democratic margin for new registrations since late last year. The paper\u2019s chief political analyst, Nate Cohn, points out that the Democrats nonetheless still need to catch up: AP has important apostrophe news: Whatever possessed Vice President Kamala Harris to pick Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, it probably wasn\u2019t a desire to inflame arguments about apostrophes. But it doesn\u2019t take much to get grammar nerds fired up. They\u2019re all over social media debating rules for possessive proper names ending in S. Some agree with The Associated Press, which says just add an apostrophe to Harris to make it possessive. Others agree with The New York Times and other outlets that add an apostrophe S. Timothy Pulju, a senior lecturer in linguistics at Dartmouth College, says the AP guidance reflects how English was spoken and written centuries ago but a shift is underway. For now, he says both are acceptable. \u201cThe lower the stakes, the bigger the fight,\u201d Ron Woloshun, a creative director and digital marketer in California told AP. The resident punctuation guru on my desk, Warren Murray, has this rule: you use apostrophe and -s when that is the way you say it. Otherwise, it is an apostrophe. So it is Harris\u2019s, and Walz\u2019s. (At my Anglican high school the rule was that only Jesus got an apostrophe -s). The Guardian\u2019s style guide says: The possessive in words and names ending in S normally takes an apostrophe followed by a second S (Jones\u2019s, James\u2019s), but be guided by pronunciation. Tuesday\u2019s Minnesota Democratic primary is the last in a series of heated primaries for the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d of House Democrats who have been vocal in their criticism of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Fellow Squad members Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri were recently defeated by candidates supported by a deluge of pro-Israel spending. But Omar faces a lower-key race. The two-term congresswoman became the first woman of color to represent Minnesota in the US House of Representatives in 2019. While in office, she has allied herself with the left wing of the Democratic party, serving as the deputy chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and backing key progressive measures such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. Even before the 7 October Hamas attacks and Israel\u2019s ensuing offensive, Omar had established herself as a vocal critic of Israel. She memorably drew criticism in 2019 for quipping that US politicians\u2019 support for Israel was \u201call about the Benjamins\u201d, in reference to donations from the American Israel Political Affairs Committee (Aipac). The comment drew accusations of antisemitism and she later apologized for it. In the wake of the 7 October attacks, and as Israel escalated its retaliatory war, Omar was among the first in Congress to call for a ceasefire. She has spoken out in support of the university encampments in solidarity with Gaza. Her daughter was suspended from Barnard College for taking part. These together would seem to make Omar a natural target of pro-Israel groups, but Samuels, a former Minneapolis city councilman has not drawn support from Aipac or its affiliated Super Pac, United Democracy Project. In contrast, UDP dropped more than $20m to unseat Bowman and Bush. The lobby groups have not said why they have not gotten involved in the Minnesota primary \u2013 but it is possible that Omar just did not provide them the fodder. Hello, this is Helen Sullivan taking over our live US politics coverage. Coming up today, we\u2019re expecting Tim Walz to speak at a Harris-Walz campaign reception in Newport Beach, California. And Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota is defending her seat in the state Democratic primary, a rematch against Don Samuels that comes two years after she barely eked out a victory against him. Polls close at 8pm Minnesota time \u2013 in about three hours. I\u2019ll take you through the latest \u2013 stay tuned. Elon Musk is basking in the afterglow of the interview he conducted on Twitter/X with Donald Trump last night. The Tesla CEO said their conversation had attracted 1bn views and comments, a number that was impossible to verify, while adding he would be willing to hold a similar event with Kamala Harris. But a remark the ex-president made during the interview about firing employees who strike has spurred the United Auto Workers to file a federal labor law complaint against both Trump and Musk, while Harris\u2019s campaign dismissed last night\u2019s event as a chat between \u201cself-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a live stream in the year 2024\u201d. The campaign also went public with news that it had received warning from the FBI of foreign hackers trying to breach its systems, but does not think they have been successful. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor who is Harris\u2019s running mate, made his first solo campaign appearance at a union convention, and defended his military service. Harris has no public events scheduled today, but her campaign continues to face questions over why the vice-president hasn\u2019t held a press conference or granted a sit-down interview since announcing her bid for the White House. Musk has a long history of opposing unions, including at Tesla, where the UAW has been trying to encourage workers to organize. Trump has been flying around to campaign events in a plane once owned by Jeffrey Epstein, according to a report. Bernie Sanders, the progressive senator, warned that Trump was \u201claying the groundwork\u201d to dispute the November election, if he loses. In the further annals of Republicans who broke with Donald Trump returning to the fold, former North Carolina senator Richard Burr said he will vote for the ex-president in November. Burr, who declined to seek re-election and left the Senate in 2022, was one of seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump after he was impeached by the House of Representatives in response to the January 6 insurrection. The conviction ultimately failed to receive the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate required to be approved, and North Carolina\u2019s GOP censured Burr for his vote. In an interview with Spectrum News, Burr said: Maybe someone will have a hard time squaring with it. I don\u2019t have a hard time squaring with it because I firmly understood why I voted for impeachment. And like I said, that\u2019s not a disqualifier as to whether you can serve. It\u2019s a bad choice I thought a president made one time. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is facing accusations of racism over this post on Twitter/X earlier today: It appears to be in line with the former president\u2019s messaging around undocumented people, who he has baselessly blamed for causing crime, and sparked a wave of condemnation from users of X: Tim Walz is set to become one of the most prominent Democrats in the country \u2013 at least for the next three months, as he campaigns alongside Kamala Harris. Here\u2019s a look at his record in Minnesota, from the Guardian\u2019s Rachel Leingang: Tim Walz must be having the wildest month of his life. After the Minnesota governor was announced as Kamala Harris\u2019s pick for running mate, the progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and independent senator Joe Manchin both put out statements praising him, an indication of his appeal across Democratic constituencies. \u201cDems in disconcerting levels of array,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez joked on X. In the week since his name catapulted from relative obscurity \u2013 Walz flew up the shortlist of second-in-command possibles in a matter of two weeks, buoyed by clips of his TV appearances and memes about his dadliness \u2013 camo caps with orange writing have flown off the campaign merch shelves, a nod to Walz\u2019s dressed-down midwestern attire. But beyond the appearances, his record in politics shows an evolution \u2013 a shift from a moderate Democrat winning over a Republican-leaning district to a governor who delivered a laundry list of progressive policy wins that has his critics fuming. Is he a progressive darling? Is he a moderate in progressive clothing? A centrist? Is this a bait-and-switch? Well, he\u2019s Tim Walz. When you talk to people who know Walz, they all call him real, genuine, authentic, an everyman. There\u2019s no reason to believe he\u2019s putting on an act. Speaking of the Harris campaign, the vice-president\u2019s newly minted running mate, Tim Walz, today made his first solo campaign appearance at a convention of union members. The Minnesota governor gave a wide-ranging speech in which he attacked Donald Trump and cheered the power of organized labor, while also taking time to respond to attacks from the former president and his supporters, who say Walz has exaggerated his military service. Here\u2019s what he said in response, at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees\u2019s annual convention: The attacks on Walz\u2019s military service, from Trump allies including his running mate, Ohio senator JD Vance, have centered on the timing of his decision to retire after 24 years of army national guard service. Here\u2019s more on that: Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign said it has received a warning from the FBI that it had been targeted by foreign hackers, but they have not detected any breaches of their systems. \u201cIn July, the campaign legal and security teams were notified by the FBI that we were targeted by a foreign actor influence operation. We have robust cybersecurity measures in place, and are not aware of any security breaches of our systems resulting from those efforts. We remain in communication with appropriate law enforcement authorities,\u201d a campaign official said. Earlier this week, the FBI said it was investigating a leak of documents from the Trump campaign that is being blamed on hackers tied to Iran. Here\u2019s more on that: Democrats in Arizona received some good news yesterday, when the secretary of state approved a ballot measure that would protect abortion rights, the Guardian\u2019s Carter Sherman reports. The party hopes the initiative will bring out voters who will also cast ballots for Kamala Harris in a state that could prove decisive to her hopes to winning the White House: Arizona voters will decide this November whether to add abortion rights into their state constitution, a prospect that could turbocharge voter turnout in a critical battleground state in the 2024 election. Late Monday, the Arizona secretary of state\u2019s office announced that it had validated an estimated 577,971 signatures in support of a ballot measure, the Arizona For Abortion Access Act, to establish a constitutional right to abortion in the state. On X, the office called the measure \u201cthe largest petition effort in Arizona history\u201d. The measure will be listed on the ballot as Proposition 139. Arizona is not the only state to face the prospect of an abortion-related ballot measure this November. So far, states including Colorado, Florida and Nevada \u2013 another key battleground state \u2013 are also set to hold similar ballot measures. Tuesday also marks the deadline for the state of Missouri to determine whether to add its own abortion-related measure to its ballots. Since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, ballot measures that protect or preserve abortion rights have successfully passed even in red states such as Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky. However, they have never been tested during a presidential election. Democrats are hoping that enthusiasm for the measures will boost turnout among their base, especially since the vice-president, Kamala Harris, one of the Democrats\u2019 most effective messengers on abortion rights, became the party\u2019s nominee. Arizona\u2019s Republican former governor Doug Ducey has endorsed Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid, after he was censured by the state GOP near the end of his term for not being sufficiently loyal to the former president. Ducey cited his support for tougher immigration policies and a continuation of Trump-era tax cuts in his endorsement: Three years ago, the state Republican party reprimanded Ducey after it was taken over by rightwing officials who retaliated against politicians from the state that had clashed with Trump: Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is out with a new statement claiming that the former president\u2019s interview with Elon Musk last night \u201cbreaks the internet\u201d. It says 25 million users on X have listened to the entire two-hour-plus interview as of noon today, and that the conversation generated 9.6m posts, among other statistics. It also hit out at Kamala Harris for not having done any interviews since launching her campaign. \u201cWhile weak, failed, and dangerously liberal Kamala Harris has avoided answering questions for 23 days, President Trump delivered his message directly to the people in a historic, two-hour interview that generated millions of posts and impressions related to President Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s unfiltered conversation,\u201d the statement reads. Here\u2019s more, from the Trump campaign communications director, Steven Cheung: President Trump will do everything he can to bring his unscripted message directly to the people, something the fake news media refuses to do. While Kamala Harris enjoys the luxury of hiding from the press, President Trump accepted Elon\u2019s invitation to have an unfiltered conversation about his America First policies with voters and people around the world. The media can lie, but the numbers don\u2019t: Americans are eager to hear from President Trump and his momentum is only growing as we get closer to November 5. The prominent progressive senator Bernie Sanders has warned that Donald Trump is preparing to once again dispute the results of the 2024 election, should he lose. Trump has never publicly conceded his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, and engaged in a months-long effort to prevent the Democrat from taking office that culminated in the violent January 6 insurrection. In a just-released statement, Sanders cites the former president\u2019s recent language to argue that he is preparing to do the same this year: Donald Trump may be crazy, but he\u2019s not stupid. When he claims that \u201cnobody\u201d showed up at a 10,000-person Harris-Walz rally in Michigan that was live-streamed and widely covered by the media, that it was all AI, and that Democrats cheat all of the time, there is a method to his madness. Clearly, and dangerously, what Trump is doing is laying the groundwork for rejecting the election results if he loses. If you can convince your supporters that thousands of people who attended a televised rally do not exist, it will not be hard to convince them that the election returns in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and elsewhere are \u201cfake\u201d and \u201cfraudulent\u201d. This is what destroying faith in institutions is about. This is what undermining democracy is about. This is what fascism is about. The former Colorado clerk Tina Peters, the first local election official to be charged with a security breach after the 2020 election as unfounded conspiracy theories swirled, was found guilty by a jury on most charges last night. Peters, a one-time hero to those denying that Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, was accused of using someone else\u2019s security badge to give an expert affiliated with the My Pillow chief executive, Mike Lindell, access to the Mesa county election system and deceiving other officials about that person\u2019s identity, the Associated Press reports. Lindell is a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to \u201csteal\u201d the election from Trump. His online broadcasting site has been showing a livestream of Peters\u2019 trial. Prosecutors said Peters was seeking fame and became \u201cfixated\u201d on voting problems after becoming involved with those who had questioned the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election results. The breach Peters was charged of orchestrating heightened concerns over potential insider threats, in which rogue election workers sympathetic to partisan lies could use their access and knowledge to launch an attack from within. Peters was convicted of three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state. She was found not guilty of identity theft, one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation and one count of criminal impersonation. She will be sentenced on 3 October. Sea level rise will help create \u201cmore oceanfront property\u201d, carbon pollution is only a problem once it starts causing \u201cheadaches and nausea\u201d and we should be more worried about \u201cnuclear warming\u201d than global warming. Donald Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s conversation on X, which Musk owns, last night featured several incoherent and baseless statements on the climate crisis, prompting both confusion and derision among environmental advocates. Bill McKibben, co-founder of the climate group 350.org, labeled it the \u201cdumbest climate conversation of all time.\u201d Trump, the Republican presidential nominee in this election, said that rising seas will help create \u201cmore oceanfront property\u201d and complained that \u201cpeople talk about global warming or they talk about climate change, but they never talk about nuclear warming,\u201d in reference to potential nuclear war. During the often disjointed exchange, Trump also said it is a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that Joe Biden\u2019s administration hadn\u2019t opened up the Arctic to oil drilling and baselessly claimed that \u201cyou have farmers that are not allowed to farm anymore and have to get rid of their cattle\u201d because of climate edicts. Musk, meanwhile, said that he is \u201chelping the environment\u201d by making electric cars via Tesla but said that he didn\u2019t want people to \u201cvilify\u201d the oil and gas industry that is driving the climate crisis and that the real dangers were, he felt, an increase in CO2 that will cause \u201cheadaches and nausea\u201d and the world potentially running out of oil. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to rush and we don\u2019t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that,\u201d Musk said about the urgency of climate change. \u201cLike leave the farmers alone.\u201d Scientists are clear that the world needs to rapidly move away from fossil fuels to avoid worsening and disastrous climate impacts such as heatwaves, flooding and droughts. The exchange did little to assuage concerns that a second Trump term will only help accelerate dangerous global heating. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign team has posted a clip of the United Auto Workers president, Shawn Fain, praising her support for workers\u2019 right to strike, in contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s lack of such support. \u201cIn 2019, GM [General Motors] was on strike for 40 days, Donald Trump was nowhere to be found, didn\u2019t say nothing, didn\u2019t do nothing. Now, let\u2019s look at Kamala Harris \u2026 you want to know where she was? On the picket line \u2026 she stood with workers on strike,\u201d Fain said. He praised job retention and creation in the auto and auto parts industry by Joe Biden and his vice-president, Harris, and criticized Trump for promising to save workers\u2019 jobs but then \u201cleaving them behind\u201d as jobs transferred away from factories \u201cleft for dead\u201d. The UAW reposted the post on X, formerly Twitter. The United States was not engaged in any aspect of planning or preparation for Ukraine\u2019s incursion in Russia, the state department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters a little earlier today. Ukraine blindsided Moscow by pouring thousands of troops into the western Russian region of Kursk last week in a surprise operation that Kyiv says has seen its forces take 1,000 sq km of land, its largest gains since 2022, Reuters reports. You can read our global coverage here. The fraud trial against the former congressman George Santos, slated to start in a matter of weeks, is coming into focus after a federal judge ruled today that jurors will have their identities kept secret from the public. They won\u2019t, however, be required to fill out a written questionnaire gauging their opinions of Santos when they arrive for jury selection on 9 September, as his lawyers had requested, the Associated Press reports. Judge Joanna Seybert said during a brief hearing in federal court on Long Island that she agreed with the government\u2019s assessment that a questionnaire would only bog the proceedings down. She said questioning each potential juror in person would allow her and both sides to ask more varied and probing questions to elicit more truthful responses. Prosecutors told the judge the trial could last three weeks. Santos has pleaded not guilty to a range of financial crimes, including lying to Congress about his wealth, collecting unemployment benefits while actually working, and using campaign contributions to pay for personal expenses. Santos declined to speak with reporters outside court after the hearing, the last expected before the trial. For all intents and purposes, Santos has already been found guilty in the court of public opinion,\u201d read a memo from Santos\u2019s defense team, filed last week. After Santos, a Republican, was ousted from Congress, Democrat Tom Suozzi won the House seat. Wilma Liebman, chair of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under the former US president Barack Obama, said that the fact that Elon Musk chuckled but did not respond to Donald Trump\u2019s comments about firing strike workers, during their online conversation last night, makes it harder for the NLRB to find the electric vehicle entrepreneur liable for making illegal threats to workers at his companies, Reuters reports. Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labor Relations Act, the UAW auto workers union said in a statement. Trump called Musk \u201cthe greatest cutter\u201d for his swathing job losses. The NLRB has limited power to punish unlawful labor practices. In cases involving illegal threats, the board can order employers to cease and desist from such conduct and to post notices in the workplace informing workers of their rights. Unions can also use favorable rulings from the NLRB to engage workers they are trying to organize. It\u2019s trying to expose more than anything politically what Donald Trump is about in terms of workers, and Musk as well. Everyone knows the NLRB remedies are toothless to start with, but it\u2019s not so much for the remedy as for sending both a political message and an organizing message,\u201d Liebman said. The UAW has filed separate complaints against Musk and Trump with the NLRB. The United Auto Workers union (UAW) leadership is going all in against Donald Trump for this presidential election. In addition to the statement from the union president, Shawn Fain, the association has posted on X: \u201cHe\u2019s for the billionaires. Not for you. Donald Trump is a scab.\u201d And, with a skeptical inquiring face emoji, the union re-posted a message from Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign X account, @KamalaHQ: \u201cTrump praises billionaire Elon Musk for firing workers who were striking for better pay and working conditions.\u201d The UAW has endorsed Harris for president, as the presumptive Democratic nominee against Trump, the Republican nominee. It is also trying to unionize workers at Tesla, Musk\u2019s electric vehicle company. Elon Musk is basking in the afterglow of the interview he conducted on X with Donald Trump last night. The Tesla CEO said their conversation had attracted 1bn views and comments, a number that was impossible to verify, while adding he would be willing to hold a similar event with Kamala Harris. But a remark Trump made during the interview about firing employees who strike has spurred the United Auto Workers to file a federal labor law complaint against both the former president and Musk, while Harris\u2019s campaign dismissed last night\u2019s event as a chat between \u201cself-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a live stream in the year 2024\u201d. Here\u2019s what else has happened today so far: Harris has no public events scheduled today, but her campaign continues to face questions over why the vice-president hasn\u2019t held a press conference or granted a sit-down interview since announcing her bid for the White House. Musk has a long history of opposing unions, including at Tesla, where the UAW has been trying to encourage workers to organize. Trump has been flying around to campaign events in a plane once owned by Jeffrey Epstein, according to a report. Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has no public events scheduled today, but continues to face questions over why she won\u2019t talk to reporters. The vice-president has not granted a proper interview or held a press conference since announcing her bid for the White House late last month, a decision her campaign spokeswoman Adrienne Elrod was asked about today, in an interview with CNN. Elrod replied: She has said on the campaign trail that she would be doing an interview at some point. She said that, I think, last week during \u2013 a during a rope line or when she was talking to reporters. But look, what is important here \u2026 is that she is taking her message directly to the American people. She hit a number of battleground states. I think we had 15,000 people in Detroit last week, 12,000 to 13,000 in Nevada. She\u2019s been taking her message to the voters and drawing large crowds. So, she\u2019s actually having those direct conversations. Among those calling for Harris to talk to the press is the Guardian\u2019s media columnist Margaret Sullivan. Here\u2019s what she has to say: As the Guardian\u2019s Michael Sainato reported earlier this year, Elon Musk is part of a group of powerful business interests that have turned to the courts to blunt efforts to organize workers nationwide. Here\u2019s more: A multi-pronged legal attack under way by Elon Musk, large corporations, business groups and anti-union litigators threatens to \u201craise havoc\u201d with US labor law and hobble a resurgent labor movement, according to experts. So far efforts to scale back or undermine workers\u2019 rights through the US courts have centered on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) \u2013 the US top workplace watchdog and overseer of union elections. But other laws \u2013 including trademark and property rights statutes \u2013 are also being used. Both Musk and Starbucks are pursuing cases that would undermine the NLRB. Musk\u2019s company SpaceX filed a lawsuit championed by the Federalist Society and other conservative groups against the NLRB in January. The lawsuit claims the board is unconstitutional because its members can only be removed for cause, not at will, and claims the board violates due process protections. The suit was filed in Texas by Musk\u2019s attorneys with the union avoidance law firm Morgan Lewis in response to a board complaint that SpaceX fired workers in retaliation for writing a letter over concerns about Musk\u2019s behavior. The United Auto Workers labor union, which is trying to organize workers at Tesla, has filed a federal labor charge over comments Donald Trump made last night in his interview with Elon Musk. The union, which has endorsed Kamala Harris\u2019s bid for the White House, said this comment from Trump to Musk ran afoul of federal law against threatening to fire workers who go on strike: \u201cYou walk in, you say, You want to quit? They go on strike, I won\u2019t mention the name of the company, but they go on strike and you say, \u2018That\u2019s OK, you\u2019re all gone. You\u2019re all gone. So, every one of you is gone.\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s more, from UAW president Shawn Fain: Donald Trump will always side against workers standing up for themselves, and he will always side with billionaires like Elon Musk, who is contributing $45m a month to a Super Pac to get him elected. Both Trump and Musk want working-class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly. It\u2019s disgusting, illegal and totally predictable from these two clowns. In addition to Elon Musk, Donald Trump was also a friend to the late convicted sex offender and New York socialite Jeffrey Epstein. The Guardian\u2019s Robert Tait reports that the former president has been using a plane Epstein once owned to travel to campaign events: Donald Trump used a plane that was once owned by Jeffrey Epstein, the late disgraced financier and convicted sex offender, to fly to several presidential campaign events last weekend, it has been revealed. The former president flew on a Gulfstream G-550 jet whose previous ownership was subsequently traced to Epstein after Trump\u2019s own private plane \u2013 a Boeing 757 known colloquially as Trump Force One \u2013 encountered engine troubles. The former Epstein jet was emblazoned with the slogan \u201cTrump 2024\u201d for the duration of the ex-president\u2019s use. According to the Miami Herald, Trump flew from Bozeman, Montana, to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and then to Aspen, Colorado, before a final trip to Denver on the jet to attend fundraisers as the Republican presidential nominee for November\u2019s election. The Trump campaign said it was unaware of the plane\u2019s previous ownership when it chartered it from Private Jet Services Group, a charter jet vendor it occasionally uses, after the technical problems with the former president\u2019s own aircraft. Elon Musk yesterday succeeded in getting Donald Trump to use X, the platform that he wielded as a bully pulpit throughout his presidency, but has generally avoided ever since, even after Musk reversed a ban placed on his account in response to the January 6 insurrection by the company\u2019s then owners. But Trump\u2019s return to X may not last. The former president has not tweeted since his interview with Musk last night, though he has made several posts on Truth Social, the X-like platform that he owns, and which has become one of his primary mouthpieces over the past four years. We\u2019ll let you know if that changes. Elon Musk also said that his interview with Donald Trump generated 1bn in both views and discussions: It was impossible to verify Musk\u2019s statement, but it\u2019s worth noting that Trump, in the interview yesterday, implied that Musk showed him that tens of millions of accounts were listening in, when X\u2019s public count showed that number was closer to 1m. Following his conversation with Donald Trump last night, Elon Musk said he would be willing to host a similar interview with Kamala Harris: Musk proposed using X\u2019s Spaces feature, which allows live audio broadcasts. Should Harris take him up on the offer, one wonders if he will first fix whatever issue caused the more than 40-minute delay in beginning his interview with Trump last night. George Santos, the former Republican New York congressman, is appearing in court for a pre-trial hearing today in the federal fraud case against him. Santos has pleaded not guilty to charges of defrauding supporters, illegally receiving benefits and lying to Congress. The trial is set to begin with jury selection on 9 September, and the parties have proposed for opening statements to begin 16 September. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota will defend her seat on Tuesday in the state Democratic primary, a rematch against Don Samuels that comes two years after she barely eked out a victory against him. Tuesday\u2019s race is the last in a series of heated primaries for the progressive \u201csquad\u201d of House Democrats who have been vocal in their criticism of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Her fellow squad members Jamaal Bowman of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri were recently defeated by candidates supported by a deluge of pro-Israel spending. But Omar faces a lower-key race. The two-term congresswoman became the first woman of color to represent Minnesota in the US House of Representatives in 2019. While in office, she has allied herself with the left wing of the Democratic party, serving as the deputy chair of the Congressional Progressive caucus and backing key progressive measures like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. Even before the 7 October Hamas attacks and Israel\u2019s ensuing offensive, Omar had established herself as a vocal critic of Israel. She famously drew criticism in 2019 for quipping that US politicians\u2019 support for Israel was \u201call about the Benjamins\u201d, in reference to donations from the American Israel Political Affairs Committee (Aipac). The comment drew accusations of antisemitism and she later apologized for it. In the wake of the 7 October attacks, and as Israel escalated its retaliatory war, Omar was among the first in Congress to call for a ceasefire. She has spoken out in support of the university encampments in solidarity with Gaza. Her daughter was suspended from Barnard College for taking part. The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, will address union members in Los Angeles today as part of his first solo campaign stop since he was announced as Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate. Walz is scheduled to deliver remarks at the convention of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), one of the nation\u2019s largest public sector unions, in Los Angeles today at 12.35 pm PT. He is also expected to deliver remarks at a campaign reception in Newport, California, at 2.30pm PT today. Oscar Wilde once described the English country gentleman galloping after a fox as \u201cthe unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable\u201d. Elon Musk interviewing Donald Trump surely qualifies as the incoherent in full pursuit of the unendurable. The men\u2019s joint appearance in an audio conversation on X on Monday night was, as expected, a display of two planet-sized egos, toxic masculinity and breathtaking mendacity. More surprisingly it was also dull, like sitting with two drunks at a bar trying to set the world to rights over more than two hours. The main message: if Trump doesn\u2019t win the election, and if Musk doesn\u2019t become the emperor of the universe, you\u2019re not going to have a country any more. Musk and Trump\u2019s banal chatter about subjects such as radioactive vegetables and the defeat of Napoleon made you crave a return to what came first: a blissful 40 minutes of wallpaper music. That was because crippling technical glitches left thousands of people unable to join. Read the full sketch from our Washington DC bureau chief: The Musk-Trump X interview: a surprisingly dull meeting of two planet-sized egos Donald Trump returned to the social media platform that turbocharged his career for a live discussion with Elon Musk. The former president unleashed familiar rambling, vitriolic talking points to a sympathetic Musk. Here are key takeaways from the event. Donald Trump sat down with billionaire Elon Musk on Monday for a rambling and vitriolic interview that revisited many of the former president\u2019s most divisive talking points. The interview on X, which is owned by Musk, got off to an inauspicious start, with technical issues that initially prevented many users from watching the conversation. Musk blamed the delay on a \u201cmassive\u201d cyber-attack, but the cause of the glitch was not entirely clear. After the interview started more than 40 minutes late, Trump \u2013 who at times appeared to have a lisp \u2013 began the conversation by recounting the failed assassination attempt against him last month at Musk\u2019s request. Although Trump previously said he would only share the story once at the Republican convention last month, he again discussed in detail his brush with death at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which he said he would visit again in October. Trump told Musk: It was a miracle. If I hadn\u2019t turned my head, I would not be talking to you right now, as much as I like you. Here\u2019s a clip from the interview: Good morning US politics readers. On Monday night, Donald Trump sat down with billionaire Elon Musk for an interview on X that began 45 minutes late, featured the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s greatest hits and biggest lies, in which he denigrated immigrants and attempted to paint Kamala Harris as a \u201cradical\u201d leftist, repeatedly mispronounced her name, and called the Democratic presumptive nominee \u201cbeautiful\u201d. Throughout the conversation, the two men lavished praise and admiration on each other and at the end, Musk told Trump he was \u201con the right path\u201d. Here are key takeaways from the event. The Harris campaign condemned the interview as an example of Trump\u2019s \u201cextremism and dangerous Project 2025 agenda\u201d. Joseph Costello, a Harris campaign spokesperson, said: Trump\u2019s entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself \u2013 self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a live stream in the year 2024. The interview came as Harris has pulled ahead in polls following the launch of her campaign last month. The Decision Desk HQ and the Hill\u2019s national polling average now shows Harris with a 0.3% lead over Trump, who had a 3.3% advantage over Joe Biden before the president withdrew from the race. Harris appears to be in an even stronger position in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which will likely determine the outcome of the election in November. According to a recent set of surveys conducted last week by the New York Times and Siena College, Harris now leads by four points in those three states, while prior polls showed a virtual tie or a slight Trump advantage in those states. Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re watching: 12.20pm ET. Joe Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, will depart the White House en route to New Orleans. 3.35pm. Minnesota governor and Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate, Tim Walz, will deliver remarks at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Convention in Los Angeles. He will later deliver remarks at a campaign reception in Newport, California."

            "content": "Kamala Harris said on Friday she was \u201chonored\u201d to have secured enough votes from delegates to become the Democratic presidential nominee, making her the first Black woman and person of south Asian heritage to lead a major party ticket. Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, announced that the vice-president had earned the majority of delegates\u2019 votes to become the party\u2019s nominee to challenge Donald Trump in November, though her nomination would not be official until Monday, the end of the virtual roll-call vote. \u201cI am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee,\u201d Harris said during an online meeting of supporters that was broadcast live. Her ascent from running mate to party nominee caps a volatile few weeks in US politics that saw the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, Joe Biden, end his bid for re-election following a disastrous debate performance that ignited a storm of calls from elected Democrats, donors and activists to step aside. \u201cWith the support of more than 50% of all delegates just one day into voting, Vice-President Harris has the overwhelming backing of the Democratic party and will lead us united in our mission to defeat Donald Trump in November,\u201d Harrison said in a statement. \u201cBut I want to be clear \u2013 there is still time for delegates to cast their ballots. I encourage every single delegate across the country to meet this moment and cast their ballot so that we head into our convention in Chicago with a show of force as a united Democratic party.\u201d In the video call, Harrison said the speed at which the party had coalesced around Harris was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and vowed the party would \u201crally around Vice-President Kamala Harris and demonstrate the strength of our party\u201d at its convention in Chicago. Before Biden dropped out, the party had opted to hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate him before the convention due to concerns about meeting a ballot deadline in Ohio. Harris will formally accept the nomination in person at the party\u2019s convention, held from 19 to 22 August. Late on Friday, Trump said he had agreed with Fox News to a debate with Harris on 4 September. Harris had accused Trump of \u201cbackpedaling\u201d from a previously agreed presidential debate in September, after the Trump campaign said that it would not agree to finalising plans until Harris formally became the Democratic nominee. In a post on social media, Trump said the rules would be the same as those at his previous debate with Biden, \u201cbut with a full arena audience\u201d. A debate, hosted by ABC News, had been planned for 10 September. It\u2019s not clear whether the Harris campaign has also agreed to partake in a debate hosted by Fox News. Republicans formally nominated Trump to be their presidential nominee for a third consecutive time at the party\u2019s convention in Milwaukee last month, just days after the former president survived an assassination attempt. At the convention he unveiled his choice for running mate, the hard-right Ohio senator JD Vance. Harris is expected to announce her running mate next week, after a lightning-fast vetting process. The vice-president is expected to interview a list of potential contenders over the weekend. Among the leading Democrats are the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, the Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, the Arizona senator Mark Kelly and the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg. Earlier on Friday, Harris\u2019s campaign announced that it had raised $310m last month, a stunning amount that was fueled in part by a surge in donations from women and young voters. The campaign said two-thirds of the haul came from first-time donors. It raised more than $200m during Harris\u2019s first week as a presidential candidate, meaning most of the haul came after her elevation to the top of the ticket. In a tweet on Friday, Biden said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be prouder\u201d of Harris, whose selection as his vice-president he called \u201cone of the best decisions I\u2019ve made\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s win,\u201d he wrote."

            "date": "2024-08-05T13:00:02Z",
            "content": "A chill wind swept through Europe this summer. On the continent, far-right parties rose triumphantly in the EU elections, hoisted not just by the grumbles of older xenophobes but on the shoulders of young men. When news crews went out on the streets to train their cameras on these extremists in France, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands, they found no blackshirts, just barbershop trims and Zara chinos worn by young men, enthralled by dreams of ethnonationalism and a return to the values of the 1980s or the 1940s or some other period long before their birth. Then, in Britain this weekend, gangs of mostly young far-right men marauded through northern towns, attacking mosques and accommodation for asylum seekers. The nationalist right is rising once more on the tides of gelled-backed hair and Nike swooshes. A similar transformation could befall America in November. Until now, twentysomething voters were a thorn in Donald Trump\u2019s side, opposing him robustly in previous elections and making their resistance corporeal as leaders in the Women\u2019s March, Black Lives Matter protests and climate movement. Yet recent election polls suggest that while young women remain committed to the cause, there has been a tremulous withdrawal from young men. In 2016, 51% of young men identified with or leaned toward the Democratic party. By last year, it was down to 39%. Young men now favor Republican control of Congress and their support for Trump has grown since 2020. The Democratic strategist James Carville (he who told Bill Clinton \u201cit\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d) has been warning Democrats that the party\u2019s eroding numbers among young men and young people of color are \u201chorrifying\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re not shedding them; they\u2019re leaving in droves.\u201d Of course, many of these fears were emerging when Joe Biden, an octogenarian white man, was still the presumptive Democratic nominee. But while early polling suggests that overall, gen Z is excited by Kamala Harris\u2019s likely nomination, she hasn\u2019t made much impact on gen Z men. Research by the Young Men Research Initiative (YMRI), a group set up in recent months to observe this unexpected drift, shows that men aged 18-29 are split 32% for Harris and 33% for Donald Trump, with Robert F Kennedy Jr taking 15%. This is an almost identical split to when Biden was the frontrunner. Young men used to vote more like young people: left. Now they might start voting like men: right. What changed? Some pollsters believe we are witnessing a new politics of resentment \u2013 that young men feel #MeToo has gone too far, that feminism has left them behind, and that they can only see a home for themselves in a testosterone-fuelled Republican party. Others \u2013 including Richard Reeves, head of the recently founded and influential American Institute for Boys and Men \u2013 say this isn\u2019t a cultural issue. While a small, loud minority of men might have become more extreme in their views on feminism, most are responding to other economic and social factors that have meant they have lagged behind women for some time. Young men statistically are more depressed, financially worse off and less educated than young women, and looking for electoral answers. \u201cThis is less about young men being pulled towards the right than it is about them being pushed away from the left,\u201d Reeves says. Blue-collar workers, Hispanic voters in Florida, white married women: Democrats have blundered before in assuming they had certain demographics locked up only to find they had taken them for granted. Unless the party can work out why it\u2019s losing young men and how to win them back, Democrats may wake up to a cold new dawn in November, as Europe did in June. \u2018A very scary time\u2019: the politics of resentment In 2018, a gaggle of the White House press corps asked Trump for his opinion on the allegations that Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the supreme court, had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when she was 15 years old. Trump, almost drowned out by the whirring blades of Marine One, could only offer superlatives in response. \u201cHigh quality\u201d, \u201ctop student\u201d, \u201ca great judge\u201d. The reporters sounded desperate: what does it say to boys that someone facing such a serious accusation is still being considered for the supreme court? \u201cWell, I say it\u2019s a very scary time for young men in America,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cYou could be somebody that was perfect your entire life and somebody could accuse you of something \u2026 and you\u2019re automatically guilty.\u201d Trump had dismissed his own boasts of sexual assault as \u201clocker room talk\u201d during his 2016 campaign, but now he was making his pitch directly to the locker room. Having harnessed the racial resentment of white voters who felt society had become too diverse, could he do the same with young men who felt society had become too feminized? The answer was a resounding no. One month later, in the midterms, the Democrats won 72% of young people\u2019s votes overall, including at least 57% of young male voters. In 2020, Biden only won the popular vote narrowly but among young people (men and women aged 18-29), it was another landslide: a 24-point win. Time Magazine declared that young voters had reshaped \u201cthe contours of American politics\u201d \u2013 if you were young, you were a Democrat. The feeling was that members of gen Z share a unique set of economic circumstances (a lifetime of renting, high student loans), will suffer most from environmental catastrophe, and are racially diverse and socially aware. A 2022 Gallup poll in the US found that more young people aged 18-29 had a favorable view of socialism than of capitalism. These sentiments have filtered into our cultural image of young people, too. Google images of gen Z and you\u2019ll see groups of gender-ambiguous, ethnically diverse, septum-pierced activists clutching a smartphone in one hand and a protest sign in the other. Yet Trump\u2019s dog whistles and Kavanaugh\u2019s eventual appointment to the supreme court led to an embryonic neo-chauvinism. Kavanaugh, describing his confirmation hearing \u201cas a national disgrace\u201d, seemed to support Trump\u2019s read that he was a victim of his gender and nod towards a politics of grievance. A few years later, Kavanaugh was instrumental in overturning Roe v Wade, destroying the hard-won freedoms of women and transforming the Democratic party \u2013 and its sometimes reluctant, whispered pro-choice position \u2013 into an explicitly pro-abortion-rights party. It also entrenched a situation in which young women passionately hated Trump; about 74% of young women had a negative view of him immediately after Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, compared with 57% of young men. So if Democrats were clearly the party of young women, Republicans tried to take advantage of being the de facto party of young men. Tucker Carlson, the most powerful commentator on the right at the time, monologued nightly on Fox News about their plight. \u201c[Young men] know that their lives will not be better than their parents, they\u2019ll be worse,\u201d he said. \u201cYet the authorities in their lives, mostly women, never stop lecturing them about their so-called privilege. \u2018You\u2019re male! You\u2019re privileged.\u2019 Imagine that. Try to imagine an unhealthier, unhappier life than that. So a lot of young men in America are going nuts. Are you surprised?\u201d It was the night after the Highland Park Independence Day parade shooting, and Carlson was explaining why a 21-year-old man like Robert Crimo might want to murder seven people at random. The Republican senator Josh Hawley, who raised his fist in salute to rioters at the US Capitol on January 6, picked up the baton in Congress and in his book Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you turn off the computer and log off the porn and go ask a real woman on a date \u2013 how about that?\u201d the senator yelled at the rightwing Turning Point USA conference. The message was amplified by Trump-supporting figures outside the party too, chief among them Andrew Tate, the misogynist podcaster with a huge following among teenage boys. \u201cTate\u2019s telling men that they are in a worse position than they should be because of feminism,\u201d says Matt Shea, the journalist and documentary director who spent four years with Tate and hundreds of his young fans for two BBC documentaries and a new book, Clown World. He says Tate\u2019s skill is in linking a feeling of incompetence in the dating world with a political impotence. Tate promotes the myth that the \u201csexual marketplace is dominated by a small number of alpha males, and that other men are sexually starved \u2013 and the reason for that is that women have more choice now\u201d, says Shea. While there have always been sexually frustrated men, Shea believes that \u201cnow those men feel that they\u2019re owed sex and have coagulated into a political movement that lays the blame on society for denying it to them\u201d. Daniel Cox, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market thinktank, agrees we need to look \u201cupstream from politics\u201d to relationships to see why men are becoming less progressive. \u201cWomen are less willing to overlook the same kinds of qualities that maybe their mothers and grandmothers were \u2026 in terms of what [men] need to contribute to a romantic partnership, the emotional labor that they need to do. Some young men have a kind of zero-sum mentality where if women are gaining, they\u2019re losing.\u201d In Germany, far-right candidates are already trying to capitalize on men\u2019s supposed dating woes. The controversial AfD candidate Maximilian Krah posted on TikTok saying: \u201cOne in three young men in Germany has never had a girlfriend. Are you one of them? \u2026 Don\u2019t watch porn, don\u2019t vote green, go outside into the fresh air \u2026 Real men stand on the far right \u2026 That\u2019s the way to find a girlfriend!\u201d Within days of being re-elected to the European parliament this year, he was expelled from his party after making sympathetic comments about the SS. Unease about gender roles is reflected in polling. A July poll by YMRI found that 65% of young men aged 18-29 agreed that \u201cguys can have their reputation destroyed just for speaking their minds these days\u201d \u2013 an eerie refrain of Trump\u2019s Kavanaugh statement \u2013 and 52% of men under 30 agreed that \u201cthings are generally better when men bring in money and women take care of the home and kids\u201d. Armed with this sort of feedback, it seems Trump has been heavily courting the young, resentful male vote. He has attended Ultimate Fighting Championship bouts until the early hours, walking out to Kid Rock\u2019s American Badass. He has lately worked hard to position himself as the crypto candidate and is heavily promoting himself on TikTok. When Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan and Dana White, CEO of UFC, introduced him at the Republican convention, Kid Rock screamed at everyone to put their fists in the air and shout \u201cfight!\u201d as Trump had done after the attempt on his life. Trump even attended a sneaker conference to launch his own golden hi-tops. There are millions of progressive young men who won\u2019t be interested in his proposition. LGBTQ+ men, for example, remain solidly progressive, as do young Asian American voters. But for others, Cox says, Trump\u2019s effort could work. \u201cLogan Paul just had Trump on his show. He\u2019s got over 7 million followers. Some young men who are not very political might say, \u2018Oh, hey, you know, Trump showing up, he\u2019s talking, he\u2019s engaging. I kind of like this.\u2019\u201d \u2018Shrugging shoulders, not raising fists\u2019 Fortunately for Harris, for all the many headlines about Trump\u2019s successful overtures to young men, the polls are laden with caveats. Harris\u2019s support jumps dramatically when pollsters measure only young men who are registered to vote (from 38% to 52% in a head-to-head matchup, according to the YMRI poll), suggesting that if Republicans want to capitalize on their popularity with this group, they will have to get them registered to vote (something they have made much harder over the past 20 years). She also takes a lead over Trump among all young male voters if RFK Jr isn\u2019t offered as an option. The way in which age and gender overlap with race is also contested. Polling suggests a stark drop in support for Democrats in the past five years from both young Black men and young Hispanic men, with YMRI data showing both groups preferred Trump to Biden by a two-point and 19-point margin respectively. Harris changes things somewhat, but support for Trump remains high. \u201cYoung men, including men of color, are drifting away from the Democratic party,\u201d says Shauna Daly, co-founder of YMRI, who conducted the research. \u201cIt\u2019s just not reality if we don\u2019t acknowledge that.\u201d But Mondale Robinson, founder of Black Male Voter Project, which exclusively works with Black men who haven\u2019t voted in previous elections, is dubious. He says that before every election, some polls say Black men are becoming less progressive, and yet in the elections it never comes to pass. He points to Black men in Ohio voting in 2023 on women\u2019s right to abortion \u201cmore than anybody, 88%, even by eight points more than Black women\u201d. What we do know is that women are becoming much more liberal. While the number of young men who identify as liberal has held pretty much steady around 25%, the number of young women who do soared in the space of a decade to almost 45%. A major Gallup poll unveiled by the Financial Times in January revealed that \u201cwomen aged 18 to 30 are now 30 percentage points more liberal than their male contemporaries\u201d in the US \u2013 a gap that opened up in just the last six years. (Polling found kindred patterns in the UK, Germany, South Korea and China.) Young women have become easily the most progressive generation in history \u2013 on abortion, healthcare, taxation and trans rights. But the shift in young men\u2019s political attitudes can\u2019t be explained simply by young women moving leftwards. Nor is it simply a story about young men resenting them for it. Richard Reeves \u2013 whose 2022 book, Of Boys and Men, has become a foundational text on what has gone wrong for young men in the country \u2013 is damning of framing that puts young men\u2019s rightward turn in terms of UFC fights and incels, when he believes it\u2019s about deep-seated inequalities of outcome in education, mental health and employment. \u201cI want to talk about why only 60% of Black boys graduate high school on time in Michigan, or the fact that the share of male teachers has gone from 33% to 23%. Or that we\u2019ve lost more than half the men who work in social work and psychology,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d want to talk about that rather than, for example, whether the Barbie movie was unfair on Ken.\u201d He says people are misinterpreting the polling. \u201cIt\u2019s not enthusiasm for the reactionary right, it\u2019s a sense of being taken for granted by the left. There are more young men shrugging their shoulders than raising their fists.\u201d It\u2019s true that there is now a growing gender gap in education; for every 100 bachelor\u2019s degrees awarded to women, 74 are awarded to men. In many US cities, young women are earning more than young men and moving out of parents\u2019 homes earlier than them. Reeves is careful to say that improving conditions for men and boys should not mean slowing down similar efforts for women and girls. But he says that government institutions do have a tendency to purposefully avoid naming the problems young men face. Suicide is one of the clearest areas in which there is a huge gender divide \u2013 there\u2019s a fourfold gender gap in rates for young people \u2013 and yet, says Reeves, \u201cthe CDC website breaks down suicide rates by every demographic except gender. Why? Why don\u2019t the Democrats have a taskforce on male suicide when there are 40,000 deaths a year?\u201d He gives other compelling examples of how Democrats have failed to signpost their achievements to young men. Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill \u2013 his key piece of legislative success \u2013 was a huge jobs creator for working-class men, \u201cbut the administration tied itself in knots not to say so\u201d. Instead, it focused on the million women in construction initiative to ensure women got some of the funding. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Now, er, where\u2019s the million men into teaching initiative? \u2026 There are so many initiatives for women in Stem; why not one for men in teaching? Who is going to attack that?\u201d On the Democrats\u2019 own website is a page titled \u201cwho we serve\u201d that lists 14 different groups. Men are not among them. Reeves believes there are some simple solutions \u2013 although he acknowledges they are \u201cpallid\u201d in terms of \u201cthe vividness\u201d of Trump\u2019s trips to UFC fights. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about writing the speech Biden should give,\u201d he said before Harris became the likely Democratic nominee. \u201cIt would talk about vocational training, technical high schools, all things that are massively pro-men. And rather than apologizing for it, he could just say, \u2018These would be particularly helpful for young men even though of course we want more women to do it too.\u2019 Then I would want him to say, \u2018I\u2019ve asked the White House gender policy council to stop only focusing on women and girls\u2019 issues, but also focus on some issues of boys and men, starting with issues of Black men, education, mental health.\u201d Message testing by YMRI bears this out. Researchers asked two groups of men about the same hypothetical infrastructure bill, calling it \u201cthe Democratic Agenda for America\u201d in one group and \u201cthe Democratic Agenda for Men\u201d in the other. In another poll, they asked about a hypothetical female presidential candidate who promised one group to make history as the first female president, and the other group to focus on progressive policies like affordable housing and healthcare. There was \u201ca 5-7 point swing in support, either an increase if you centered the policy agenda around men or a decrease if you focused on the historic nature of the candidate\u201d, says Daly. Perhaps the \u201cwhite dudes for Kamala\u201d and \u201cBlack men for Kamala\u201d fundraising calls are early steps towards Democrats acknowledging men as an important voting bloc in 2024 (even if those calls were mostly for rich donors). Biden\u2019s attempt at masculine swagger, telling Trump to \u201cman up\u201d and debate Harris, could be seen as a sop towards that kind of messaging too. It\u2019s not just about the message, though; it\u2019s also about trusted messengers, says Robinson of Black Male Voter Project: \u201cThese young men don\u2019t take marching orders from anyone.\u201d He says turnout is a real issue, especially among non-college-educated Black men, among whom the distrust in both parties is so high that even having a Black candidate in Harris won\u2019t make a difference. He says higher turnout can only come with grassroots organization \u2013 earning trust \u2013 that goes beyond election years. \u201c[Our organization] doesn\u2019t do that \u2018Washington DC told us this is what works\u2019 shit with Black men. Black men are suffering from not having their basic needs met \u2026 The Black men we engage with have no delusion that their vote is going to fix everything that\u2019s plaguing them. But they do understand that when a vote becomes the tool to address the hunger, it starts yielding fruit.\u201d Or, as he later put it, \u201cif they\u2019ve got a racist police chief, they can unelect the fucking mayor.\u201d Reeves, however, says it almost doesn\u2019t matter what the message is \u2013 the mere fact of someone from the Democratic party standing up and acknowledging men would be a huge shift. \u201cTake someone like Jordan Peterson. His appeal does not lie in the brilliance of his policy proposals, or his advice. His appeal is simply in allowing a lot of young men to be heard. He says \u2018I get it, you\u2019re hurting\u2019 and he fills stadiums with that message.\u201d Can Democrats win men without losing women? Men, overall, are not the ones who are being legislated against. Over the past eight years, the Republican party, remade in Trump\u2019s image, has cruelly gutted women\u2019s right to abortion. It has decimated female representation at every level of government. It has given unwavering support to the police, even as police sexual assault against women reaches epidemic levels and police routinely murder Black women. They have emboldened the most misogynistic corners of the internet by putting forward a presidential nominee who has been found liable for sexual abuse, has bragged about sexual assault and rates women on a 1-10 scale (\u201cin the same way that we do\u201d, wrote the pick-up artist and alt-right blogger Roosh V after Trump won in 2016). \u201cThe messaging of the Republican convention was a message of male supremacy, of female submission. Women are afterthoughts in reproductive policy, health policy, the proposed marriage policy of no divorce,\u201d says Bonnie Honig, professor of culture, media and political science at Brown University and author of Shell Shocked: Feminist Criticism After Trump. When women\u2019s very safety is at stake, should the Democrats really be worrying about how to appeal to disaffected men? First, Honig says, it\u2019s a mistake to think of abortion purely as a women\u2019s issue: \u201cThe loss of women\u2019s rights is a loss for men.\u201d She suggests that Democrats should start using the line \u201cwomen\u2019s health is not a women\u2019s issue\u201d, adding that \u201cwomen who don\u2019t have choices, in my opinion anyway, are not fun to live with\u201d. More broadly, she feels that the Democrats need to avoid falling into the young men v young women dichotomy laid out by the Republicans \u2013 and pollsters. \u201cTo over-extrapolate from these polls risks feminizing the Democratic party, which is what Republicans want to do, so that they can claim to embody a kind of masculinity that is fascist-forward.\u201d Republicans have used this gendered messaging before. \u201cThey made Obama into a representative of a kind of feminized liberal man,\u201d Honig says. \u201cWith Biden, there was an objective fact of his age, but that was turned into saying he had aged out of any masculinity he might once have had. They did something quite similar to John Kerry, who was a war hero, but by the time they were done with him, he was just a guy who was married to a wealthy woman.\u201d Rather than trying to appeal to young men as an aggrieved demographic group, she suggests, Democrats should try to think beyond gender to the other economic, class and community groups young men are part of: unions, professions, students, parents. \u201cI think by supporting the United Auto Workers, for example, [Democrats] are supporting men between the ages of 18 and 30.\u201d Three months out from the election, the political reality remains that Republicans have nothing to offer men legislatively, but lots to offer in messaging. The Democrats have lots to offer in policy but are afraid to say the \u201cm\u201d word. But things can change quickly. After the far right performed so well in the European elections, Emmanuel Macron called snap French parliamentary elections \u2013 an incredibly risky strategy that paid off. Among voters 18-24, the far-right National Rally still did well, with 33% of first round votes. But the leftwing New Popular Front fared even better, winning 48%. It did so by promising to invest in public services, freeze prices, raise the minimum wage and embargo arms to Israel. America is not in the same political reality as France, but its election is not a done deal either. Young men\u2019s votes are still up for grabs. \u201cDemocrats are missing a huge opportunity to say that they see and hear the issues of a certain kind of young man,\u201d Reeves says, \u201cand that they are at least open to acknowledging them.\u201d"

            "content": "A feminist entrepreneur who started an investment fund with the musician Bj\u00f6rk at the height of Iceland\u2019s 2008 financial crisis and gave a TED talk on applying \u201cfeminine values\u201d to finance is to become her country\u2019s president on Thursday. Halla T\u00f3masd\u00f3ttir won just more than 34% of the vote in elections in June, beating a crowded field that included Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, who resigned as prime minister to run. She will replace Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson, who despite considerable popularity is stepping down after eight years in office. Halla was previously the chief executive of The B Team, a non-profit co-founded by Sir Richard Branson. She was also the head of Iceland\u2019s chamber of commerce and co-founded the now defunct financial services company Au\u00f0ur Capital. She first ran for president eight years ago. This time the 55-year-old campaigned on issues including artificial intelligence, tourism and the effect of social media on mental health. Afterwards, she said that people had \u201cvoted with their hearts\u201d. \u201cGenerational equality is important to me. The issues I have put to the forefront in my campaign are because I want the next generation to take over a society and a country that gives them at least equal opportunities to those we have enjoyed,\u201d Halla told the Icelandic news website mbl.is. But she has also attracted criticism after appearing in a Facebook post of a car dealership where she bought an electric car. In a statement last week, Halla said she did not receive a discount in return for publicity \u2013 but that she did receive a discount \u2013 and that the picture was shared without her knowledge. For his final reception at Bessasta\u00f0ir, the official residence of the president of Iceland, on Tuesday, Gu\u00f0ni invited 300 workers who were involved in the construction of defence walls and other infrastructure on the Reykjanes peninsula after a series of volcanic eruptions near the town of Grindav\u00edk. In June, he held an \u201copen house\u201d for members of the public to see inside Bessasta\u00f0ir. Halla will become Iceland\u2019s seventh president since the formation of the republic in 1944. She will be the second woman in the role after Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir, who in 1980 became the world\u2019s first democratically elected female president. The inauguration will begin with a religious service at Reykjav\u00edk Cathedral followed by a ceremony in the Icelandic parliament next door, where Halla will be sworn in before addressing the nation. The event, which starts at 3.30pm local time, is to be attended by previous presidents, members of parliament and the media. It will be also be screened outside for the public. While Icelandic presidents are elected heads of state, the role is largely seen as ceremonial. They do, however, play an important symbolic role for the nation of about 400,000 people, particularly after the recent volcanic eruptions. \u201cWe are still in the thick of it,\u201d Gu\u00f0ni told the Guardian in February. \u201cAs we speak now, land is rising close to Grindav\u00edk, and it\u2019s a clear sign that magma is gathering right under the surface of the Earth. And soon, based on the experience of the last few years, it will find its way up.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 1 August 2024 to reflect Icelandic naming conventions."

            "date": "2024-08-15T02:23:37Z",
            "content": "The president of Columbia University, Minouche Shafik, has resigned following months of criticism of her handling of campus protests over the war in Gaza. \u201cThis period has taken a considerable toll on my family, as it has for others in our community,\u201d Shafik wrote in an email to staff and students on Wednesday. \u201cIt has also been a period of turmoil where it has been difficult to overcome divergent views across our community.\u201d She added: \u201cOver the summer, I\u2019ve been able to reflect and have decided that my moving on at this point would best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.\u201d Her resignation, effective immediately, was unexpected, with the university\u2019s fall semester just weeks from beginning. It comes on the heels of two other Ivy League presidents\u2019 resignations in the past year. In her email, Shafik said she would be accepting a role with the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, \u201cto chair a review of the government\u2019s approach to international development\u201d. In a separate letter to the Columbia community, the co-chairs of the university\u2019s board of trustees, David Greenwald and Claire Shipman, wrote: \u201cWhile we are disappointed to see her leave us, we understand and respect her decision.\u201d They went on to announce that Katrina Armstrong, the chief executive officer of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, would serve as the interim president. \u201cAs I step into this role, I am acutely aware of the trials the University has faced over the past year,\u201d Armstrong wrote in a letter to the university community. \u201cWe should neither understate their significance, nor allow them to define who we are and what we will become.\u201d Shafik, whose tenure began in July 2023 and made her the first woman to head the prestigious university in New York City, appeared before Congress in April, in highly publicized hearings regarding allegations of on-campus antisemitism. At about the same time, her decision to call the New York police department on to campus, in response to student protests, drew the ire of students and faculty. \u201cIt has been distressing \u2013 for the community, for me as president and on a personal level \u2013 to find myself, colleagues, and students the subject of threats and abuse,\u201d Shafik said. \u201cAs President Lincoln said, \u2018A house divided against itself cannot stand\u2019 \u2013 we must do all we can to resist the forces of polarization in our community.\u201d Columbia was widely seen as the center of the student-led pro-Palestinian protests, sparking a widespread movement of demonstrations at universities across the US and abroad. The university faced criticism for its heavy-handed tactics, which included summoning police to dismantle the student protest camp, and was also accused of failing to make Jewish students feel safe. Although smaller demonstrations began in October, the university made headlines when students erected dozens of tents on the south lawn of the campus in April. As Shafik appeared before Congress, students at the encampment called for the university to divest from Israel. In response, Shafik authorized New York police to move on to campus and break up the encampments, claiming they \u201cpose a clear and present danger to the substantial functioning of the university\u201d. Forty-six students were arrested and, after students continued their occupation, many more were suspended. Media were prohibited from entering campus to cover the arrests. Hundreds of faculty members issued statements condemning Shafik\u2019s crackdown on student protesters, and walked out in support of their students. The university cancelled its commencement ceremony the following month. Immediately after the news of Shafik\u2019s resignation, reports of pro-Palestinian protesters celebrating near the university began appearing on X as some members of the Columbia community voiced their support for the change of leadership. \u201cRegardless of who leads Columbia, the students will continue their activism and actions until Columbia divests from Israeli apartheid,\u201d Mahmoud Khalil, a student negotiator on behalf of Columbia University Apartheid Divest, told the New York Times. \u201cWe want the president to be a president for Columbia students, answering to their needs and demands, rather than answering to political pressure from outside the university.\u201d On X, the Columbia chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, wrote: \u201cAfter months of chanting \u2018Minouche Shafik you can\u2019t hide\u2019 she finally got the memo. To be clear, any future president who does not pay heed to the Columbia student body\u2019s overwhelming demand for divestment will end up exactly as President Shafik did.\u201d The announcement also comes just days after the school confirmed that three deans had resigned after officials said they exchanged disparaging texts during a campus discussion about Jewish life and antisemitism. Shafik said in an 8 July letter to the school community that the messages were unprofessional and \u201cdisturbingly touched on ancient antisemitic tropes\u201d. Meanwhile, Elise Stefanik, one of the congressional representatives most critical of Shafik\u2019s handling of reports of antisemitism on campus, wrote: \u201cTHREE DOWN, so many to go,\u201d adding: \u201cAfter failing to protect Jewish students and negotiating with pro-Hamas terrorists, this forced resignation is long overdue.\u201d Agencies contributed reporting"

            "content": "The Real Sociedad president has admitted that he has held talks with Arsenal over a move for Mikel Merino, but warned that they must match the asking price for the Spain midfielder. Merino was left out of Sociedad\u2019s first game of the season at the weekend \u2013 a 2-1 defeat at home against Real Vallecano on Sunday \u2013 with the manager, Imanol Alguacil, insisting beforehand that the 28-year-old will be \u201cwith the team to the death\u201d. Talks between Arsenal\u2019s sporting director, Edu, and the Spanish club are continuing after Sociedad turned down a first formal bid believed to be worth \u20ac25m (\u00a321.4m). Sociedad are understood to be holding out for a fee of about \u20ac35m for Merino, who has one year left on his contract. Merino has rejected their offer of a new deal, having already agreed personal terms with Arsenal. The Spanish club\u2019s president, Jokin Aperribay, confirmed to the radio station Onda Vasca on Monday that the midfielder has signalled his intention to depart this summer. \u201cMerino was clear that he didn\u2019t want to say he was renewing and then leave. It wasn\u2019t a surprise to us,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, one of the teams we didn\u2019t want to show up showed up. \u201cWe will talk to Arsenal and defend the interests of La Real. When we consider that the offer is good, we will say yes. We know what Merino\u2019s wishes are, so we decided that he should not be called up [for the game on Sunday].\u201d Meanwhile, Arsenal have rejected a bid of \u00a325m from Nottingham Forest for Eddie Nketiah. The England striker, for whom Marseille had two bids rejected earlier in the summer, is thought to be valued at about \u00a330m by Arsenal. Forest are expected to return with an improved offer for the 25-year-old, who also has interest from Crystal Palace. It remains to be seen whether Oliver Glasner\u2019s side follow up their longstanding interest and make a bid."
