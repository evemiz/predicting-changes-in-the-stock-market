            "content": "Take a shot at a cat, and you\u2019d better not miss. It all started in 2021, with a remark by JD Vance, long before he became the Republicans\u2019 vice-presidential candidate. To be fair to the guy, Vance lives in a low-consequence universe, where you can hate Trump one minute and love him the next, with no ding to your credibility, so he must have been gobsmacked in July when he was called on this historic remark. \u201cIt\u2019s just a basic fact,\u201d he had told Tucker Carlson back in 2021. \u201cYou look at Kamala Harris, [transportation secretary] Pete Buttigieg, AOC [congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] \u2013 the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we\u2019ve turned our country over to people who don\u2019t really have a direct stake in it?\u201d This elision of parenthood and long-termism is the acceptable face of the childlessness taboo in politics: you can call it dumb, but you can\u2019t call it misogynistic, since it isn\u2019t gendered. However, he then blew it by saying the quiet part out loud, which, if we substitute \u201cquiet\u201d for \u201cbatshit crazy\u201d is the new Republican playbook. They\u2019re \u201ca bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they\u2019ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too\u201d. When those remarks resurfaced this summer, Harris\u2019s campaign team said that Vance was \u201cnot pro-family [but] anti-women\u201d. One of the most sincere interventions came from Jennifer Aniston, who has had a well-documented struggle with infertility, and said on Instagram: \u201cMr Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.\u201d Simultaneously, he had managed to offend all step-parents (Kamala is only childless if you don\u2019t count her two stepchildren with Doug Emhoff), all gay parents and all adoptive parents (Buttigieg has adopted two children with his husband, Chasten). But never mind the children \u2013 won\u2019t someone think of the cats? Taylor Swift is merely the highest-profile member of a large constituency that isn\u2019t just unashamed to be childless, but is actively proud of their cats. She signed off her endorsement of Harris\u2019s presidential bid on Tuesday with \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d, to which Elon Musk responded \u2013 and there\u2019s no other word for this than creepily \u2013 \u201cFine Taylor \u2026 you win \u2026 I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life.\u201d Will this hit the Republicans, electorally, and if so, where? First of all, forget about dogs since they\u2019re \u201cpurple\u201d \u2013 dog owners are equally likely to be Democrat or Republican. If Vance was trying to speak to an imagined base \u2013 \u201cWe, dog people, despise the barren keepers of cats\u201d \u2013 that won\u2019t fly. Democrats are somewhat more likely to have a cat (40%) than Republicans (35%), but that\u2019s still a significant number of red voters who, if they love their pet more than their politics, could be alienated. The numbers are very even, in terms of cat-devotion: 31.8% of Democrats and 33.3% of Republicans with a cat said it was the most important member of their family, from which I\u2019ve decided to infer that Whiskers is definitely more important than the president. Determining swing states is a dark art, but it is easy to say which states have the most cat owners: Vermont, Maine, West Virginia, Indiana, New Hampshire, Iowa, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas and Wisconsin. Per the New York Times, only one of those is a swing state (Wisconsin) but using the Nate Silver method (which I prefer not to, as he predicts a Trump landslide in electoral college votes) puts New Hampshire also in contention. If we imagine everyone with a cat, even those who also have children, falling in behind Kamala, that is at least some low-hanging fruit for the Democrats. Looking at Trump\u2019s debate with Harris this week, it is just about imaginable that his claims about Springfield, Ohio, were a last-minute attempt to reorientate his campaign as friend-to-the-cat. The peculiar thing about Trump is that you simply cannot imagine him communing with any animal, not even an iguana. A cat would be too aloof and challenge his narcissism; a dog would baffle him with affection \u2013 which, deep down, he would know he\u2019d done nothing to deserve \u2013 and would itself be baffled, because his commands would make no sense. But anyway, back to Springfield, where immigrants from Haiti are \u201ceating the dogs, the people that came in, they\u2019re eating the cats\u201d, according to Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re eating the pets of the people that live there.\u201d This false rumour has its proximal roots in a video where a Springfield resident claims that recent immigrants were eating the ducks from a pond, but it\u2019s an existing right wing trope. Repurposed to cover domestic pets, it sounds even more fanciful, but immediately sparked a load of AI-generated images, with Trump as a Francis of Assisi figure, protecting cats and dogs, and one bold billboard campaign by the Republican Party of Arizona, which read: \u201cEat less [sic] kittens \u2013 Vote Republican!\u201d Can this win back the cat vote? I\u2019m going with: not in a million years."

            "date": "2024-09-26T20:41:29Z",
            "content": "The voting machine company Smartmatic and the conservative outlet Newsmax have settled a closely watched defamation lawsuit days before it was set to go to trial in Delaware. A spokesman for the Delaware courts said the case had been settled on Thursday. He did not offer additional details. The trial was set to begin in Wilmington on Monday. The terms of the settlement are not public. \u201cNewsmax is pleased to announce it has resolved the litigation brought by Smartmatic through a confidential settlement,\u201d Bill Daddi, a spokesman for the network, said in a statement. After the 2020 election, Newsmax aired several false claims about the company, whose voting machines were only used in Los Angeles county in 2020. The network repeatedly aired false claims from Trump allies that the software was widely used across the country and that it had been hacked to change votes. Smartmatic sued Newsmax, Fox, One America News Network (OANN) and others for broadcasting their false claims. It settled the case with OANN earlier this year and the Fox case is still pending in New York. Smartmatic said in a statement: \u201cWe are very pleased to have secured the completion of the case against Newsmax. We are now looking forward to our court day against Fox Corp and Fox News for their disinformation campaign. Lying to the American people has consequences. Smartmatic will not stop until the perpetrators are held accountable.\u201d FOX responded to the settlement Thursday by attacking Smartmatic. \u201cSmartmatic unsurprisingly chose to settle its case with Newsmax on the eve of trial after a series of major setbacks devastated its case,\u201d Fox said in a statement. \u201cSmartmatic\u2019s claims against Fox are similarly impaired, unsupported by the facts and intended to chill First Amendment freedoms. We look forward to defending this case when it goes to trial.\u201d First amendment scholars were closely watching the case and several others like it to see whether libel law can be used as an effective tool to police misinformation. The case was set to be a kind of sequel to the defamation litigation between Dominion, another voting machine company, and Fox over 2020 election lies. That case was settled just before the trial was set to begin, with Fox agreeing to pay Dominion $787.5m. Eric Davis, the judge who oversaw the Fox case, was also overseeing the Newsmax case. A settlement was not surprising in the case as trial neared. Davis ruled that Smartmatic could not seek punitive damages, a decision that significantly limited any possible financial payout for Smartmatic. Davis had also ruled that Newsmax could use the \u201cneutral report privilege\u201d as a defense in the case \u2013 a legal shield that allows media outlets to broadcast allegations if they are reporting on a newsworthy event and do so in a disinterested and neutral way. Davis had not let Fox used that defense in its litigation. Smartmatic executives were indicted by the justice department earlier this year on bribery charges in the Philippines. Even though the charges were completely unrelated to the 2020 election, it offered an opportunity for Newsmax lawyers to argue that the company\u2019s poor reputation could not be attributed to what was said on its air. But Newsmax also had reasons to settle. In a pre-trial conference, a lawyer for the company had called it a \u201cbet-your-company\u201d case for the outlet. Newsmax, which is projecting $180.5m in revenue this year, saw a surge in audience under the Trump administration and a bump that caught Fox\u2019s attention after the 2020 election as it broadcast false claims about voting. \u201cThe Newsmax surge is a bit troubling \u2013 truly is an alternative universe when you watch, but it can\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Jay Wallace, a Fox executive, wrote in an email to a colleague after the 2020 election. Unlike in the Fox and Dominion litigation, only a few details emerged in the case revealing internal discussions at Newsmax as they broadcast false claims about the election. One of the messages was an internal letter from Christopher Ruddy, the network\u2019s CEO from November 2020, conceding the network did not have evidence of voter fraud. \u201cNewsmax does not have evidence of widespread voter fraud. We have no evidence of a voter fraud conspiracy nor do we make such claims on Newsmax,\u201d he wrote on 12 November 2020. \u201cWe have reported on significant evidence of widespread election irregularities and vote fraud. We will continue to report on that. We believe we should not censor allegations made by the President or his lawyers or surrogates. Our job is not to filter the news but report information and allow Americans to decide.\u201d Another exchange included Bob Sellers, a Newsmax host, and a producer, wondering how long they would have to air false claims about the election. \u201cHow long are we going to have to play along with election fraud?\u201d Sellers wrote on 9 November 2020. \u201cTrump\u2019s MO is always to play victim [] And answer this question. Is there anything at all that could result in another election? The answer is no. and are there enough votes that could be switched or thrown out from fraud or irregularities? No.\u201d The lack of a trial may rob the public of the chance to hear about the state of mind of people who were behind broadcasting election lies, said RonNell Andersen Jones, a first amendment scholar at the University of Utah who has closely followed the defamation cases filed by those harmed by 2020 election lies. Still, she noted that Davis had already ruled that the statements at issue in the case were false, and cautioned against expecting defamation cases to be a cure for misinformation. \u201cDefamation law can declare something a lie, but the question of whether a lie was told is only one of many questions that have to be asked and answered,\u201d she said in an interview earlier this week. \u201cIt is a notoriously complex area of law, which means cases can be won or lost on a lot of grounds that have nothing to do with the truth or falsity of the statement. And I am not sure that translates well to public discussion.\u201d Lyrissa Lidsky, a media law professor at the University of Florida, also cautioned against expecting libel law to be a cure-all for disinformation. \u201cDefamation law is not a panacea for election misinformation. There\u2019s just no two ways about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a small piece.\u201d"

            "title": "Can US economic statistics really affect the presidential election?",
            "date": "2024-09-08T13:00:50Z",
            "content": "As another presidential election rears into view, spare a thought for campaign operatives on the eve of the first Friday of each month. Aides used to functioning on little sleep struggle by on even less. Press releases and attack lines are meticulously prepared. As the clock clicks to 8.30am, the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is refreshed repeatedly on hundreds of laptops and phones, until it finally lands: a 40-page statistical release entitled The Employment Situation. The monthly jobs report is widely seen as a reliable indicator of the health of the US economy. But scrutiny of its contents typically reaches a whole new level in the closing stages of an election campaign. \u201cI cannot tell you the anxiety that you feel the night before, and that morning,\u201d said Teddy Goff, digital director for Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. As polling day neared, and each jobs report rolled around, there was a palpable fear that \u201cone bad month could take the entire enterprise down\u201d, he recalled. \u201cHad there been a fluky month in October 2012 of negative growth,\u201d said Goff, \u201cyou\u2019re thinking, \u2018OK, cool, we\u2019ve just lost the White House.\u2019\u201d And so, this Friday, as the first week of September drew to a close, staffers for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris waited with bated breath on the latest official jobs numbers. Employers added 142,000 jobs in August \u2013 shy of expectations \u2013 and the unemployment rate slipped from 4.3% to 4.2%. Both sides pounced. Joe Biden hailed \u201chistoric gains\u201d for American workers since he and Harris took office, with almost 16m new jobs created; the Trump campaign declared that \u201cwarning lights\u201d were flashing, as \u201cfears of Kamala-induced recession\u201d purportedly mounted. Dozens of news outlets, including the Guardian, reported on the release \u2013 and what it could mean for the election. But does it matter? \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any voter who should change their vote based on Friday\u2019s release,\u201d said Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under Obama, \u201cwith the possible exception of the 12 voting members\u201d of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting policy committee. \u201cIf you stopped the average person in the street, they would have no idea\u201d how many jobs had been created, or how many people were out of work, in any given month, observed Stephanie Kelton, a professor of economics and public policy at Stony Brook University. And even if they did, \u201cpeople are not moving between camps because of a tenth of a percentage point shift in the unemployment rate,\u201d she added. With a campaign this close, however, anything can shift the dial. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an election that\u2019s basically tied, even very small events could be the difference between winning and losing,\u201d said Furman. \u201cIn terms of economic data, there are really a very small number of big events between now and election day.\u201d Between now and 5 November, when tens of millions of Americans will cast their votes, there will be two updates to the consumer price index, the closely watched inflation gauge; two more jobs reports; and a gross domestic product (GDP) economic growth estimate for the third quarter. Each will be dissected, debated and described in great detail. The world\u2019s largest economy has reached a critical juncture at the exact moment when the US election kicks into its final gears. When inflation surged to its highest level in a generation two years ago, policymakers scrambled \u2013 and ultimately raised interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 in an attempt to cool the economy, and bring down price growth. With inflation now heading back towards more typical levels, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has signaled that the central bank would start to cut rates this month. The US labor market now faces greater \u201cdownside risks\u201d, Powell acknowledged. The apprehension about this next phase was laid bare in August, when disappointing jobs data for the previous month triggered a sharp, albeit fleeting, global stock market sell-off. The sell-off was news around the world and brought greater \u2013 negative \u2013 attention to a jobs report that while weaker than expected was still positive. While the US economy has staged a remarkable recovery from the depths of the pandemic, a majority of Americans do not appear to recognize this. A Harris poll for the Guardian in May, for example, found that 55% wrongly believed the economy was in recession. \u201cThere is a degree to which people just perceive the economy to be worse than it is,\u201d said Goff. \u201cPart of it is just that the media has a bias toward negative stuff. The individual murderer gets reported on ad nauseam in the local news. The declining murder rate over the course of three decades doesn\u2019t get any coverage. There\u2019s that same phenomenon attached to the economy.\u201d There also appears to be a disconnection between how official economic data informs voters about the economy and how voters experience it in their day-to-day lives. Does last month\u2019s inflation reading matter when your grocery bill is up by a quarter in four years? How much attention would you pay to August\u2019s nationwide unemployment rate if you, or a relative, had recently lost their job? The Trump campaign, which claims Biden has destroyed jobs and fueled inflation, is clearly seeking the support of those directly affected by economic disruption since 2021. \u201cVoters, particularly the voters that will decide elections, they don\u2019t think about the economy through the prism of any government statistics,\u201d David Plouffe, who managed Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, told the Axe Files podcast in March. He later joined the Harris campaign as senior adviser. Obama won in 2012 with the highest unemployment rate of any re-elected president since 1936. \u201cIt was coming down,\u201d Plouffe noted, \u201cso people felt good on trajectory.\u201d Should the Fed start reducing rates this month, as indicated, \u201cperhaps at the margin, in the tiniest of ways\u201d, some people might start to feel better about the economy, Kelton suggested. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a little bit of a vibe shift in having the rate-cutting cycle begin, and knowing it\u2019s under way.\u201d In a race this close, that vibe shift, or the lack of it, may well decide the race. Could the noise created by a few good or bad economic reports tip the balance? For some time already, there has been a gulf between Americans\u2019 words and actions. Right now \u201cwhen people have to put money behind their statements, they are very optimistic,\u201d said Furman, now a professor at Harvard University. \u201cThey are spending lots of money. Businesses are investing a lot.\u201d And yet, \u201cwhen they talk to pollsters and no money is at stake, they are quite negative,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they get into the ballot box, will they think more like they do in a store, or when they\u2019re talking to a pollster? No one knows.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-18T09:00:04Z",
            "content": "The US is still not prepared for inevitable Russian attacks on its elections, the former special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Russian interference in 2016 and links between Donald Trump and Moscow, warns in a new book. \u201cIt is \u2026 evident that Americans have not learned the lessons of Russia\u2019s attack on our democracy in 2016,\u201d Mueller writes in a preface to Interference: The Inside Story of Trump, Russia and the Mueller Investigation by Aaron Zebley, James Quarles and Andrew Goldstein, prosecutors who worked for Mueller from 2017 to 2019. Mueller continues: \u201cAs we detailed in our report, the evidence was clear that the Russian government engaged in multiple, systematic attacks designed to undermine our democracy and favor one candidate over the other.\u201d That candidate was Trump, the Republican who beat the Democrat, Hillary Clinton, for the White House. \u201cWe were not prepared then,\u201d Mueller writes, \u201cand, despite many efforts of dedicated people across the government, we are not prepared now. This threat deserves the attention of every American. Russia attacked us before and will do so again.\u201d Interference will be published in the US next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. Zebley, Quarles and Goldstein tell the story of the Mueller investigation, from its beginnings in May 2017 after Trump fired the FBI director, James Comey, to its conclusion in March 2019 with moves by William Barr, Trump\u2019s second attorney general, to obscure and dismiss Mueller\u2019s findings. Mueller did not establish collusion between Trump and Moscow but did initiate criminal proceedings against three Russian entities and 34 people, with those convicted including a Trump campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who was jailed. Mueller also laid out 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by Trump. Though he did not indict Trump, citing justice department policy regarding sitting presidents, Mueller said he was not clearing him either. Mueller now says Zebley, Quarles and Goldstein \u201ccare deeply about the rule of law and know the importance of making decisions with integrity and humility\u201d, adding: \u201cThese qualities matter most when some refuse to play by the rules, and others are urging you to respond in kind.\u201d The FBI director from 2001 to 2013, Mueller was 72 and widely admired for his rectitude when he was made special counsel. His former prosecutors describe a White House meeting preceding that appointment. In an atmosphere of high tension, Mueller made his entry \u201cvia a warren of passages beneath the Eisenhower Executive Office Building\u201d, thereby avoiding the press. Trump, who wanted Mueller to return as FBI director, \u201cdid most of the talking\u201d but though he praised Mueller richly, Mueller declined the offer. As the authors write, Trump \u201cwould later claim that Bob came to the meeting asking to be FBI director\u201d, and that Trump \u201cturned him down\u201d. \u201cThis was false,\u201d the prosecutors write. Soon after the White House interview, the New York Times reported memos kept by Comey about Trump\u2019s request to shut down an investigation of Michael Flynn, the national security adviser who resigned after lying about contacts with the Russian ambassador. Soon after that, Mueller was appointed special counsel. Trump escaped punishment arising from Mueller\u2019s work but did lose the White House in 2020, when he was beaten by Joe Biden. Zebley, Quarles and Goldstein\u2019s book arrives as another election looms, with Trump in a tight race with the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and shortly after US authorities outlined how pro-Trump influencers were paid large sums by Russia. On Tuesday, a new threat intelligence report from Microsoft said Russia was accelerating covert influence efforts against Harris. US presidential elections are often the subject of \u201cOctober surprises\u201d, late-breaking scandals which can tilt a race. In 2016, October brought both Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood scandal, in which he was recorded bragging about sexual assault, and the release by WikiLeaks of Democratic emails hacked by Russia. In Interference, Zebley, Quarles and Goldstein tell how the Mueller team came to its conclusion that Russia boosted Trump in 2016. They also detail attempts to interview Trump that were blocked by his attorneys, Rudy Giuliani among them. Describing how the former New York mayor betrayed a promise to keep an April 2018 meeting confidential, speaking openly if inaccurately to the press, the authors say Mueller \u201cdecided he would never again meet or speak with Giuliani \u2013 and he never did. For Bob it was a matter of trust.\u201d More than six years on, Giuliani faces criminal charges arising from his work to overturn Trump\u2019s 2020 defeat, as well as costly civil proceedings. Trump also faces civil penalties and criminal charges, having been convicted on 34 counts in New York over hush-money payments made before the 2016 election. Though Zebley, Quarles and Goldstein focus on the Russia investigation, in doing so they voice dismay regarding the US supreme court, to which Trump appointed three rightwing justices and which has this year twice cast his criminal cases into doubt. The authors describe how Mueller\u2019s team decided not to subpoena Trump for in-person testimony, given delays one Trump attorney said would result from inevitable \u201cwar\u201d on the matter. Looking ahead, the authors consider new supreme court opinions that will shape such face-offs in future. Fischer v United States, the authors say, narrows the scope of the obstruction of justice statute \u201cthat was the focus of volume II of our report\u201d. More dramatically, in Trump v United States, the court held \u201cthat a president has absolute immunity from criminal prosecution when carrying out \u2018core\u2019 constitutional functions \u2026 and has \u2018presumptive\u2019 immunity for all \u2018official actions\u2019\u201d. Though the court ruled a president was not immune for \u201cunofficial actions\u201d, Zebley, Quarles and Goldstein warn that it nonetheless \u201csharply limited the areas of presidential conduct that can be subject to criminal investigation \u2013 permitting a president to use his or her power in wholly corrupt ways without the possibility of prosecution\u201d."

            "content": "ParalympicsGB officials say they hope \u201cpolitics doesn\u2019t get in the way\u201d of a successful Los Angeles Games in four years\u2019 time, amid the prospect of a second Donald Trump presidency. The US presidential election remains on a knife-edge, with Trump \u2013 the Republican nominee who has infamously denigrated people with disabilities \u2013 and the Democratic vice\u2011president, Kamala Harris, in effect tied heading into the final weeks of the campaign. After completing a successful Games in Paris, where the British team once again finished second and ahead of the USA in the medals table, authorities insist they will take time to evaluate the approach towards LA, but said it would not be the first time that Britain had competed in a \u201cpolitically challenging\u201d environment. Asked if there were any circumstances in which not sending a team to a Games would be considered, Penny Briscoe, chef de mission of ParalympicsGB, said she hoped politics would not interfere with an event that is a crucial platform for people with disabilities. \u201cLA is probably one of the most inclusive cities in the world,\u201d she said, \u201cand their ambition, which they presented just a few days ago, is that LA is a melting pot, and their commitment to delivering an incredible Paralympic Games experience is already out there. \u201cSo from our perspective, at the moment we\u2019re really excited by the prospect of LA. We\u2019re excited by the challenge that facing the Americans on their home turf poses for us, and I really hope that politics don\u2019t impact our preparation or our Games experience in the US.\u201d One of the most notorious moments in Trump\u2019s successful presidential campaign in 2016 came when he mocked a disabled New York Times reporter at an event. \u201cYou gotta see this guy,\u201d Trump said, appearing to impersonate Serge Kovaleski, who has a congenital joint condition. More recently, Trump has mocked Joe Biden\u2019s stammer. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to discuss any details, because we don\u2019t know how it will play out,\u201d said Kate Barker, the UK Sport performance director, who oversees funding and medal ambitions for both Olympic and Paralympic teams. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what kind of governance structures will be around those Games. \u201cBut what is important is what the Olympic and Paralympic Games stand for, and they don\u2019t stand for political statements. They are deliberately against that, and I think our ability to be present at those events is really, really important, and that sometimes in and of itself can be the strongest statement that you can make. \u201cSo of course we\u2019ll discuss it as we get closer and we know what we\u2019re doing, but it won\u2019t be the first time that we\u2019re going into a Games with political challenges globally.\u201d"

For the first time in Sri Lanka\u2019s history, the election went into a runoff on Sunday after no candidate managed to get more than 50% of the votes. However, after second-choice votes were counted, Dissanayake was declared the winner in the evening. \u201cThis victory belongs to all of us,\u201d he said, writing on X. Dissanayake, 55, defeated the incumbent, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was installed as president in 2022 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to resign and flee the country amid a popular uprising. The win by Dissanayake, the leader of the hardcore leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which is a member of the broader National People Power (NPP) coalition, was seen by many to be a watershed moment for his party. It is the first time it has sat in the presidential office. The NPP had won just 3% of the votes in the last presidential election in 2019 while JVP holds just three seats in parliament. For many, the JVP had long been considered an unelectable radical fringe group due to past involvement in violent insurrections and targeted assassinations that left thousands dead in the 1980s. However, since 2022 Sri Lanka has gone through a period of prolonged economic and political tumult that has left many disenchanted with the parties and leaders that have dominated politics for the past two decades. The island nation found itself in serious economic crisis, with barely any money left in foreign reserves to import essential goods such as medicines or pay back international debts. As the country declared itself virtually bankrupt, it provoked a political uprising against Rajapaksa and his powerful family dynasty who were accused of rampant corruption and misappropriation of state assets. An uprising on the streets, known as the aragalaya [struggle] eventually led to protesters taking over Rajapaksa\u2019s presidential palace \u2013 where they swam in his pool and worked out in his gym \u2013 forcing his resignation and temporary exile from the country. Wickremesinghe, a six-time former prime minister, was appointed in his place and tasked with getting the country\u2019s economy back on track. He was credited with negotiating a $3bn loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) but as poverty rose to 25% over the past two years, he became deeply unpopular for austerity policies that were seen to hit the poorest. Dissanayake\u2019s NPP had spent the past two years building and mobilising grassroots support and had drawn in swathes of new voters with an anti-corruption and transparency agenda, as well as by toning down the more extreme Marxist messaging of the JVP. Dissanayake had also sought to distance his party from the violence of the past, apologising for the killings that took place. In an election that was primarily focused on the economy, Dissanayake appeared to successfully capitalise on the anger and frustration that had emerged during the aragalaya. He adopted the movement\u2019s critique of the political elite and called for an end to corruption and political patronage, as well as promising that those responsible for misdeeds would finally be held accountable. He has also pledged to renegotiate the terms of the IMF deal. \u201cThe election result clearly shows the uprising that we witnessed in 2022 is not over,\u201d said Pradeep Peiris, a political scientist at the University of Colombo. As the election results were announced, there was a mood of optimism on the streets of Colombo. Mohammed Dilshad, 50, who works in tourism, said that after years of voting for the same two parties, people had felt let down and angry. \u201cAnura [Dissanayake] has never ruled the country, this time people have given [him] a mandate with great hope,\u201d said Dilshad. \u201cPeople want a system change. They have promised to reduce government spending. They have to deliver all the promises.\u201d Also among those running in the election was Namal Rajapaksa, the nephew of Gotabaya, who had served in his uncle\u2019s cabinet. In a sign of how much the political environment has changed since 2019 when Rajapaksa won a landslide victory, Namal came fourth on less than 3% of the vote.

            "title": "Can US economic statistics really affect the presidential election?",
            "date": "2024-09-08T13:00:50Z",
            "content": "As another presidential election rears into view, spare a thought for campaign operatives on the eve of the first Friday of each month. Aides used to functioning on little sleep struggle by on even less. Press releases and attack lines are meticulously prepared. As the clock clicks to 8.30am, the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is refreshed repeatedly on hundreds of laptops and phones, until it finally lands: a 40-page statistical release entitled The Employment Situation. The monthly jobs report is widely seen as a reliable indicator of the health of the US economy. But scrutiny of its contents typically reaches a whole new level in the closing stages of an election campaign. \u201cI cannot tell you the anxiety that you feel the night before, and that morning,\u201d said Teddy Goff, digital director for Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. As polling day neared, and each jobs report rolled around, there was a palpable fear that \u201cone bad month could take the entire enterprise down\u201d, he recalled. \u201cHad there been a fluky month in October 2012 of negative growth,\u201d said Goff, \u201cyou\u2019re thinking, \u2018OK, cool, we\u2019ve just lost the White House.\u2019\u201d And so, this Friday, as the first week of September drew to a close, staffers for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris waited with bated breath on the latest official jobs numbers. Employers added 142,000 jobs in August \u2013 shy of expectations \u2013 and the unemployment rate slipped from 4.3% to 4.2%. Both sides pounced. Joe Biden hailed \u201chistoric gains\u201d for American workers since he and Harris took office, with almost 16m new jobs created; the Trump campaign declared that \u201cwarning lights\u201d were flashing, as \u201cfears of Kamala-induced recession\u201d purportedly mounted. Dozens of news outlets, including the Guardian, reported on the release \u2013 and what it could mean for the election. But does it matter? \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any voter who should change their vote based on Friday\u2019s release,\u201d said Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under Obama, \u201cwith the possible exception of the 12 voting members\u201d of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting policy committee. \u201cIf you stopped the average person in the street, they would have no idea\u201d how many jobs had been created, or how many people were out of work, in any given month, observed Stephanie Kelton, a professor of economics and public policy at Stony Brook University. And even if they did, \u201cpeople are not moving between camps because of a tenth of a percentage point shift in the unemployment rate,\u201d she added. With a campaign this close, however, anything can shift the dial. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an election that\u2019s basically tied, even very small events could be the difference between winning and losing,\u201d said Furman. \u201cIn terms of economic data, there are really a very small number of big events between now and election day.\u201d Between now and 5 November, when tens of millions of Americans will cast their votes, there will be two updates to the consumer price index, the closely watched inflation gauge; two more jobs reports; and a gross domestic product (GDP) economic growth estimate for the third quarter. Each will be dissected, debated and described in great detail. The world\u2019s largest economy has reached a critical juncture at the exact moment when the US election kicks into its final gears. When inflation surged to its highest level in a generation two years ago, policymakers scrambled \u2013 and ultimately raised interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 in an attempt to cool the economy, and bring down price growth. With inflation now heading back towards more typical levels, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has signaled that the central bank would start to cut rates this month. The US labor market now faces greater \u201cdownside risks\u201d, Powell acknowledged. The apprehension about this next phase was laid bare in August, when disappointing jobs data for the previous month triggered a sharp, albeit fleeting, global stock market sell-off. The sell-off was news around the world and brought greater \u2013 negative \u2013 attention to a jobs report that while weaker than expected was still positive. While the US economy has staged a remarkable recovery from the depths of the pandemic, a majority of Americans do not appear to recognize this. A Harris poll for the Guardian in May, for example, found that 55% wrongly believed the economy was in recession. \u201cThere is a degree to which people just perceive the economy to be worse than it is,\u201d said Goff. \u201cPart of it is just that the media has a bias toward negative stuff. The individual murderer gets reported on ad nauseam in the local news. The declining murder rate over the course of three decades doesn\u2019t get any coverage. There\u2019s that same phenomenon attached to the economy.\u201d There also appears to be a disconnection between how official economic data informs voters about the economy and how voters experience it in their day-to-day lives. Does last month\u2019s inflation reading matter when your grocery bill is up by a quarter in four years? How much attention would you pay to August\u2019s nationwide unemployment rate if you, or a relative, had recently lost their job? The Trump campaign, which claims Biden has destroyed jobs and fueled inflation, is clearly seeking the support of those directly affected by economic disruption since 2021. \u201cVoters, particularly the voters that will decide elections, they don\u2019t think about the economy through the prism of any government statistics,\u201d David Plouffe, who managed Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, told the Axe Files podcast in March. He later joined the Harris campaign as senior adviser. Obama won in 2012 with the highest unemployment rate of any re-elected president since 1936. \u201cIt was coming down,\u201d Plouffe noted, \u201cso people felt good on trajectory.\u201d Should the Fed start reducing rates this month, as indicated, \u201cperhaps at the margin, in the tiniest of ways\u201d, some people might start to feel better about the economy, Kelton suggested. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a little bit of a vibe shift in having the rate-cutting cycle begin, and knowing it\u2019s under way.\u201d In a race this close, that vibe shift, or the lack of it, may well decide the race. Could the noise created by a few good or bad economic reports tip the balance? For some time already, there has been a gulf between Americans\u2019 words and actions. Right now \u201cwhen people have to put money behind their statements, they are very optimistic,\u201d said Furman, now a professor at Harvard University. \u201cThey are spending lots of money. Businesses are investing a lot.\u201d And yet, \u201cwhen they talk to pollsters and no money is at stake, they are quite negative,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they get into the ballot box, will they think more like they do in a store, or when they\u2019re talking to a pollster? No one knows.\u201d"

            "content": "ParalympicsGB officials say they hope \u201cpolitics doesn\u2019t get in the way\u201d of a successful Los Angeles Games in four years\u2019 time, amid the prospect of a second Donald Trump presidency. The US presidential election remains on a knife-edge, with Trump \u2013 the Republican nominee who has infamously denigrated people with disabilities \u2013 and the Democratic vice\u2011president, Kamala Harris, in effect tied heading into the final weeks of the campaign. After completing a successful Games in Paris, where the British team once again finished second and ahead of the USA in the medals table, authorities insist they will take time to evaluate the approach towards LA, but said it would not be the first time that Britain had competed in a \u201cpolitically challenging\u201d environment. Asked if there were any circumstances in which not sending a team to a Games would be considered, Penny Briscoe, chef de mission of ParalympicsGB, said she hoped politics would not interfere with an event that is a crucial platform for people with disabilities. \u201cLA is probably one of the most inclusive cities in the world,\u201d she said, \u201cand their ambition, which they presented just a few days ago, is that LA is a melting pot, and their commitment to delivering an incredible Paralympic Games experience is already out there. \u201cSo from our perspective, at the moment we\u2019re really excited by the prospect of LA. We\u2019re excited by the challenge that facing the Americans on their home turf poses for us, and I really hope that politics don\u2019t impact our preparation or our Games experience in the US.\u201d One of the most notorious moments in Trump\u2019s successful presidential campaign in 2016 came when he mocked a disabled New York Times reporter at an event. \u201cYou gotta see this guy,\u201d Trump said, appearing to impersonate Serge Kovaleski, who has a congenital joint condition. More recently, Trump has mocked Joe Biden\u2019s stammer. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to discuss any details, because we don\u2019t know how it will play out,\u201d said Kate Barker, the UK Sport performance director, who oversees funding and medal ambitions for both Olympic and Paralympic teams. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what kind of governance structures will be around those Games. \u201cBut what is important is what the Olympic and Paralympic Games stand for, and they don\u2019t stand for political statements. They are deliberately against that, and I think our ability to be present at those events is really, really important, and that sometimes in and of itself can be the strongest statement that you can make. \u201cSo of course we\u2019ll discuss it as we get closer and we know what we\u2019re doing, but it won\u2019t be the first time that we\u2019re going into a Games with political challenges globally.\u201d"

            "content": "Good morning. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced off in a presidential debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, with Harris landing a number of blows as Trump spouted bizarre falsehoods about abortion and immigration. \u201cWorld leaders are laughing at Donald Trump,\u201d said the vice-president. \u201cI have talked to military leaders, some of whom worked with you, and they say you\u2019re a disgrace.\u201d A CNN snap poll found that voters thought Harris had won the debate by a margin of 63% to 37%. Even a Fox News analyst declared Harris the winner, as she taunted Trump about people leaving his rallies early from \u201cboredom and exhaustion\u201d, clearly rattling the former president, who took the bait again and again. What were the most memorable moments? After Harris wrapped up one remark with a jab about Trump\u2019s crowd sizes, Trump began to ramble \u2013 about immigrants eating people\u2019s pets. \u201cIn Springfield, they\u2019re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they\u2019re eating the cats,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re eating the pets of the people that live there.\u201d ABC moderators interjected to say that the city manager of Springfield, Ohio, had told the network there were no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed by individuals within the immigrant community. How did the moderators do? ABC\u2019s moderators David Muir and Linsey Daviswere largely praised for factchecking Trump\u2019s falsehoods and rerouting discussions back to the questions. When Trump falsely accused Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, of calling for abortion in the ninth month and \u201cexecution after birth\u201d, Davis responded: \u201cThere is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it\u2019s born.\u201d Another boost for Harris: After the debate concluded, Taylor Swift endorsed Harris on Instagram, signing the post as \u201cchildless cat lady\u201d in a jab at misogynistic comments made by the Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance. In other news \u2026 The family of Ay\u015fenur Ezgi Eygi, the Turkish-American activist killed at a protest against settlements in the West Bank, said that neither the White House nor Joe Biden had called them to offer condolences. Louisiana residents are bracing for the landfall of Hurricane Francine, which strengthened over extremely warm Gulf waters on Tuesday night. At least 143 people died after Typhoon Yagi battered northern Vietnam this weekend, flooding streets and forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. The Missouri state supreme court ruled on Tuesday to keep a measure on November\u2019s ballot seeking to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. Stat of the day: Smoke from wildfires sweeping through the Amazon has covered 60% of Brazil Wildfires have been burning through the Amazon rainforest in Brazil for weeks now, fuelled by the region\u2019s worst drought in 40 years. More than 340,000 people have reportedly been affected, with all 62 municipalities of the Amazonas state declaring a state of emergency. The effects of the wildfires and drought have reached as far away as Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, and an expert from Brazil\u2019s space institution, Inpe, said smoke from the fires had now covered a 5m sq km area \u2013 about 60% of the country. Don\u2019t miss this: The coal plant and the ghost town Ohio\u2019s Gavin coal plant has been called the deadliest coal plant in the US, with the Sierra Club estimating that its pollution has led to about 244 premature deaths a year. Two decades ago, it destroyed something much more: the entire town of Cheshire, Ohio. The several hundred residents here often complained about the toxic, blue-tinged fog of pollution from the plant. The solution: the company causing the pollution bought the entire town, moving people en masse from their homes. \u201cRather than deal with the source of pollution, they thought it better to buy out and bulldoze a whole town,\u201d said Neil Waggoner, an Ohio-based campaigner at the Sierra Club. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary.

Specifically, a clause of the law that goes into effect in January, which allows for legal action against any municipality that fails to curb rough sleeping, has Dean Trantalis concerned about a \u201ctsunami of lawsuits\u201d set to hit the city. Climate check: The hotel development threatening a giant tortoise habitat in Seychelles Conservationists are raising alarm over plans for an upscale resort in Seychelles, concerned that this Qatari-funded hotel development will disrupt the habitat of the largest giant tortoise population in the world. Developers for the resort on Assomption, located just 17 miles (27km) from the Unesco-protected ecosystem of the Aldabra atoll, said they would follow world-class sustainability practices.

            "title": "The election deniers with a chokehold on Georgia\u2019s state election board",
            "date": "2024-09-26T12:00:01Z",
            "content": "A rule passed last week, which bipartisan election officials in Georgia say will delay the counting of votes in November, was introduced by an election denier who appears to believe in various rightwing conspiracies and whose apparent experience in elections dates only to February. The rule \u2013 which requires poll workers to hand-count ballots at polling locations \u2013 was passed by an election-denier majority on the Georgia state election board on Friday. It was introduced by Sharlene Alexander, a Donald Trump supporter and member of the Fayette county board of elections, who was appointed to her position in February. Alexander\u2019s Facebook page alludes to a belief in election conspiracies, the Guardian has found. Alexander is one of 12 people \u2013 all election deniers \u2013 who have introduced more than 30 rules to the state election board since May, according to meeting agendas and summaries reviewed by the Guardian. Of those, the board has approved several, including two that give county election officials more discretion to refuse to certify election results, in addition to Alexander\u2019s hand-count rule. Alexander\u2019s lack of experience in elections underscores the recent phenomena of unelected, inexperienced activists in Georgia\u2019s election-denial movement successfully lobbying the state election board to pass rules favored by conspiracists. Democrats, voting rights advocates and some Republicans have said the rules are not just outside the authority of the state election board, but may result in delays in the processing and certification of results. \u201cThere is widespread, bipartisan opposition to these anti-voter rule changes and opposition from the local elections officials, as well as experts in the field,\u201d Lauren Groh-Wargo, CEO of the voting rights group Fair Fight, said in a statement. Groh-Wargo noted that Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, and bipartisan county election officials from across the state as well as former governors Nathan Deal and Roy Barnes have said the recently passed rules are \u201cdestroying confidence\u201d in Georgia\u2019s election systems. Raffensperger and other Georgia election officials have warned that Alexander\u2019s rule and the two certification rules \u201care going to make counting ballots take longer\u201d. Those delays could be used by Trump and Republicans to call results of the election into question, representatives of Raffensperger\u2019s office have said. *** Anyone can submit a rule to the state election board, but all but one of the 32 rules submitted since May have come from a small but vocal group of election officials and activists who believe in Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud, including Alexander. The board hadn\u2019t implemented a new rule since 2021, and between September 2022 and May, no rules were introduced. Since then, Alexander and a group of election-denying officials and activists \u2013 called \u201cpetitioners\u201d in the parlance of the state election board \u2013 have introduced 31 rules that will affect millions of Georgia voters. These petitioners include Julie Adams, a member of the Fulton county election board who also works for the rightwing groups Tea Party Patriots and the Election Integrity Network, which is run by prominent national election denier Cleta Mitchell; Michael Heekin, Adams\u2019 Republican colleague on the Fulton county election board, who has refused to certify results this year; David Cross, an election denier who has pressured the state election board since 2020 to take up investigations into unfounded claims of voter fraud; Garland Favorito, head of the election denier group VoterGA; David Hancock of the Gwinnett county election board; Bridget Thorne, a Fulton county commissioner who ran a secret Telegram channel in which she discussed election conspiracies; and Lucia Frazier, wife of Jason Frazier, an election denier whom Republicans in Fulton county tried and failed to appoint to the election board there, and who recently withdrew a lawsuit claiming the county had allowed ineligible voters to remain on voter rolls. Like many county election officials in Georgia, Alexander makes her beliefs in election and other rightwing conspiracies known on her personal Facebook page. Last week, she posted a claim that 53 counties in Michigan have more registered voters than citizens who are old enough to vote. The claim is part of a lawsuit brought by the Republican National Committee that seeks to purge voters from Michigan\u2019s voter rolls \u2013 one of a slew of lawsuits that Republican groups have filed across the country claiming that voter rolls are bloated with ineligible voters. Jocelyn Benson, the Michigan secretary of state, has called the lawsuit \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201cfilled with baseless accusations\u201d, noting that her office has removed more than 700,000 voters from voter rolls in her tenure. Other posts from Alexander allude to a belief in conspiracies about the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as transphobic sentiment and fear of immigrants. \u201cVote like your daughters and granddaughters chances to compete in sports and their right to have private spaces to dress and undress in it depends on it. Because it does,\u201d reads a post Alexander shared on 11 August. Alexander did not immediately respond to questions for this story. Under previous iterations of the board, rules introduced by election-denying activists were regularly dismissed, said Sara Tindall Ghazal, the lone Democrat on the board. But that began to change earlier this year, when Republicans in Georgia\u2019s legislature appointed two new members to the board \u2013 Janelle King and Rick Jeffares \u2013 after pressure from Trump to replace the former board chair, Ed Lindsey, a more moderate Republican who didn\u2019t concede to demands from deniers. Dr Janice Johnston, a driving force behind much of the board\u2019s work on behalf of the election-denial movement, was appointed to her post in 2022. Matt Mashburn, a Republican who preceded Lindsey as chair of the state election board, told the Guardian that the board\u2019s new members were in uncharted territory. \u201cThe people voting to pass these new rules at this late date don\u2019t seem to have any idea how these new rules are supposed to be implemented and they don\u2019t seem to care,\u201d Mashburn said. Bipartisan election officials across the state have asked the board to stop implementing rules so close to the November election, with the Spalding county attorney calling them \u201cunfunded mandates\u201d. But Trump has lauded the trio of Johnston, King and Jeffares, calling them \u201cpit bulls \u2026 fighting for victory\u201d at a rally in Atlanta on 3 August. As the crowd cheered, Johnston stood and waved. Since then, the three \u2013 none of whom has previous experience administering elections \u2013 have passed several more rules. In August, the board passed a rule that allows county election officials to refuse to certify results if they feel a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d is necessary to investigate claims of fraud or irregularities, and another rule that allows local officials to request a virtually unlimited number of election-related documents before certifying results. Those rules were introduced by two election deniers, Adams and Salleigh Grubbs. Adams has sued for more power to refuse to certify results with the help of the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute; Grubbs is the chair of the Cobb county Republican party whose involvement in elections stems from Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020. That year, she chased a refuse truck that she believed was carrying shredded paper ballots, the Atlantic reported. There is no evidence that paper ballots were discarded in that incident, election authorities have said. Both women are members of a behind-the-scenes network of election officials and activists who call themselves the Georgia Election Integrity Coalition, the Guardian revealed. The group has coordinated on policies and messaging key to the success of the election-denial movement in the state. Johnston has been in frequent contact with the group\u2019s members, working with them to craft at least one of the certification rules the state election Board recently passed. The movement\u2019s success continued last week when the board passed Alexander\u2019s hand-count rule. The rule requires poll workers to open boxes of ballots collected by machines and count them by hand, increasing the chance that legal chain-of-custody requirements could be violated, according to Raffensperger. Alexander and others in Georgia\u2019s election-denial community believe that the practice of hand-counting ballots will prevent falsified ballots from being scanned into voting machines \u2013 a conspiracy theory that bipartisan election officials have said has no basis in fact. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 September 2024. A previous version incorrectly stated that the Democratic former Georgia governor Roy Barnes was a Republican."

            "content": "The far right won the most votes in an Austrian election for the first time since the Nazi era on Sunday, as the Freedom party (FP\u00d6) rode a tide of public anger over migration and the cost of living to beat the centre-right People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP). The pro-Kremlin, anti-Islam FP\u00d6 won 29.2% of votes, beating the ruling \u00d6VP of the chancellor, Karl Nehammer, into second place on 26.5%, according to near-complete results. The opposition Social Democratic party scored its worst ever result \u2013 21% \u2013 while the liberal NEOS drew about 9%. Despite devastating flooding this month from Storm Boris bringing the climate crisis to the fore, the Greens, junior partners in the government coalition, tallied 8.3% in a dismal fifth place. The Communist party and the apolitical Beer party looked unlikely to clear the 4% hurdle to representation. Turnout was high at about 78%. Profiting from a rightwing surge in many parts of Europe and taking Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n as a model, the FP\u00d6 capitalised on fears around migration, asylum and crime heightened by the August cancellation of three Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna over an alleged Islamist terror plot. Mounting inflation, tepid economic growth and lingering resentment over strict government measures during Covid dovetailed into a huge leap in support for the FP\u00d6 since the last election in 2019. Its polarising lead candidate, Herbert Kickl, who campaigned using the \u201cpeople\u2019s chancellor\u201d moniker once used to describe the Austrian-born Adolf Hitler, said he was ready to form a government with \u201ceach and every one\u201d of the parties in parliament. \u201cWe have written a piece of history together today,\u201d he told cheering party supporters in Vienna. \u201cWe have opened a door to a new era.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t need to change our position, because we have always said that we\u2019re ready to lead a government, we\u2019re ready to push forward this change in Austria side by side with the people,\u201d Kickl said in an appearance alongside other party leaders on ORF public television. \u201cThe other parties should ask themselves where they stand on democracy,\u201d he added, arguing that they should \u201csleep on the result\u201d. Nehammer called the result, which will send shock waves through Europe, \u201cbitter\u201d while his defence minister, Klaudia Tanner, admitted the debacle for the governing parties was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. Because it failed to win an absolute majority, the FP\u00d6 will need a partner to govern. Unlike the other centrist parties, the \u00d6VP has not ruled out cooperating with the far right in the next government, as it has twice in the past in taboo-breaking alliances at the national level. Nehammer, however, repeated on Sunday that a scenario in which Kickl, a former hardline interior minister, became chancellor was a non-starter, setting up a potential showdown in which the FP\u00d6 would have to either jettison Kickl or take a backseat in government to win the \u00d6VP\u2019s support. \u201cWe\u2019ll see in the coming weeks which is more important to FP\u00d6 voters \u2013 claiming the chancellor\u2019s seat or Herbert Kickl,\u201d the political scientist Peter Filzmaier told ORF, adding that exit polling had shown it was issues and not personalities that had motivated voters. Kickl, a bespectacled marathon runner, was a protege of J\u00f6rg Haider. The former firebrand FP\u00d6 leader and Carinthia state premier, who died in 2008 in a drink-driving crash, transformed the party founded by ex-Nazi functionaries and SS officers into the ultra-nationalist force it is today. Migrant groups have expressed fear for the future in Austria, which critics say has failed to fully own up to its Nazi past and role in the Holocaust. Rabbi Jacob Frenkel of Vienna\u2019s Jewish Council called the election a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d. At his final rally in central Vienna on Friday, Kickl drew cheers from the crowd railing against anti-Russia EU sanctions, \u201cthe snobs, headteachers and know-it-alls\u201d, climate activists and \u201cdrag queens in schools and the early sexualisation of our children\u201d. He hailed a proposed constitutional amendment declaring the existence of only two genders. But the biggest applause line remained his call for \u201cremigration\u201d, or forced deportation of people \u201cwho think they don\u2019t have to play by the rules\u201d of Austrian society. Nehammer actively sought during the campaign to co-opt the FP\u00d6\u2019s tough stance on immigration, which the far right hopes to bring to bear at the EU level using Austria\u2019s outsized influence in Brussels due to its geographical prominence and strong alliances. Congratulations to Kickl poured in from rightwing populist parties across Europe including Germany\u2019s Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland and Hungary\u2019s ruling Fidesz party. \u201cThe government has drastically reduced asylum applications,\u201d the chancellor said on Thursday. \u201cBut we need more: asylum procedures in third countries before asylum seekers come through several European countries. And more: complete access to social welfare only after five years of residency in Austria.\u201d It was a remarkable comeback for the FP\u00d6, humiliated five years ago after the so-called Ibiza scandal in which Austria\u2019s then deputy chancellor and party leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, was caught on video at a Spanish luxury resort discussing a potential bribe from a woman purporting to be the niece of a Russian oligarch. The disgraced Strache and his parliamentary leader, Johann Gudenus, who had initiated the meeting, were forced to resign, triggering snap elections in which the \u00d6VP, then led by \u201cwunderkind\u201d chancellor Sebastian Kurz, triumphed. Two years later Kurz quit politics amid a corruption investigation. The last term has been marked by a stunning reversal for the government, an \u00d6VP coalition with the Greens, even by the baroque standards of politics in this Alpine country of 9 million. The conservatives shed 11 points in support in that time, with the FP\u00d6 leading in the polls since late 2022 and coming first in European parliament elections in June. Coalition negotiations are expected to take several weeks before a new government is in place. Regardless of the outcome, the \u00d6VP seems poised to hold on to power, either in an alliance with the far right or an unwieldy, unprecedented three-way coalition with smaller centrist parties, similar to Germany\u2019s unpopular government. A two-way alliance with the Social Democrats could eke out a wafer-thin majority but analysts said such a pact was unlikely."

            "date": "2024-09-22T18:24:04Z",
            "content": "The far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party has narrowly missed out on victory in an election in the German state of Brandenburg, according to initial results, three weeks after making historic gains in two other regions. In what had been widely interpreted as a referendum on the federal government of Olaf Scholz ahead of next autumn\u2019s general election, his Social Democratic party (SPD) appeared at the 11th hour to have clawed back its lead over the anti-immigrant populists who had been on course for months to seize victory in the state for the first time. The SPD won 30.9% to the AfD\u2019s 29.2%, according to provisional official results by the state electoral commissioner, with both parties making gains of 5 to 6 points on their performance last time. The fledgling leftist conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), a pro-Kremlin party which has called for military aid to Ukraine to be halted, secured 12%, making it a likely contender in a new administration. With much considered to be at stake in the election, turnout was high at 74%. The SPD\u2019s Dietmar Woidke, who has led Brandenburg for 11 years, had upped the ante in the run-up to Sunday\u2019s poll by pledging to resign if the AfD beat his party, in what was viewed as a high-stakes gamble based on his own popularity as \u201cfather of the state\u201d. The AfD, which has been classified as a rightwing extremist organisation in Brandenburg by domestic intelligence agencies, had also called for Scholz to resign under the same circumstances. Woidke even excluded Scholz from his election campaign \u2013 despite the fact he and his wife live in the state capital, Potsdam \u2013 fearing the negative impact of his presence. The SPD has ruled the state since reunification in 1990. All eyes had been on Brandenburg, which is population-wise one of Germany\u2019s smallest states, after strong showings for the AfD earlier this month in Thuringia, where they came top with about 33%, and in Saxony, where they came a narrow second behind the conservative CDU with 27.5%. At the Brandenburg SPD\u2019s election gathering at the Old Post, a restaurant near the state parliament in Potsdam, there were jubilant cries as the initial results came in, after weeks of a highly strung campaign. Taking to the floor shortly after 6pm local time, Woidke told supporters he was cautiously relieved, \u201cconsidering the starting position we were in\u201d. \u201cWe said we\u2019d take on this battle and we said our goal at the outset was to ensure our land didn\u2019t get a big brown stamp on it,\u201d he said, in reference to the colour associated with the far-right. But he urged SPD members to \u201cput on the euphoria brakes\u201d until the final result became clear. At the party\u2019s headquarters, the Willy Brandt house in Berlin, its general secretary, Kevin K\u00fchnert, said it was too early for \u201cfeelings of relief \u2026 it\u2019ll take several hours to get the full results, which is why I\u2019m holding back\u201d. Speaking in New York where he is attending UN meetings, Scholz reacted briefly to the election result, saying the mood at party headquarters, where he had spoken on the phone with party members, had been \u201cgood, naturally\u201d. Some members referred to Woidke\u2019s \u201ctremendous comeback\u201d and said it would set the tone ahead of next autumn\u2019s federal election, at the same time as expressing their frustration that he had given the national party a wide berth. There are broader concerns that the Woidke win will be seen as a result of him having excluded \u2013 rather than praised \u2013 Scholz. At the AfD\u2019s election gathering in Marquardt, north of Potsdam, Hans-Christoph Berndt, its main candidate, classified as rightwing extremist by domestic intelligence, claimed his party was the \u201creal victor\u201d. It appeared to have secured every third vote in the state \u201cdespite a campaign of agitation and slander\u201d against the AfD, he said, calling the result a \u201cconsolidation of support\u201d. On Telegram channels, supporters spoke of a \u201cclose race\u201d and said the \u201cfirewall\u201d established by the mainstream parties who had refused to coalesce with it would be hard to maintain as it continued to grow in strength. Several hundred anti-AfD protesters were gathered outside the venue, held back by riot police. The AfD had been running almost neck and neck with the SPD in the state, a belt of urban and rural communities that surrounds the capital, Berlin, and had led in the polls in the previous 12 months. The SPD had narrowed the gap in recent days. The conservative CDU secured just 12%, its worst result in the state\u2019s history. The Greens came in on 4.1%, just below the 5% threshold to automatically make it into state parliament. The Free Democratic party, which like the Greens partners in the increasingly fractious three-way federal government, received less than 1%. The leftwing Die Linke, on 3%, will not enter parliament for the first time since its founding in 2007. There was jubilation, however, in the BSW camp. Many of its members broke away from Die Linke to form a new party in January. Its lead candidate, Robert Crumbach, who had been a member of the SPD for several decades before joining the BSW, thanked supporters and said he was \u201cspeechless\u201d. \u201cWe had the aim to get double figures and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2024-09-18T13:00:04Z",
            "content": "Emails obtained by the Guardian reveal a behind-the-scenes network of county election officials throughout Georgia coordinating on policy and messaging to both call the results of November\u2019s election into question before a single vote is cast, and push rules and procedures favored by the election denial movement. The emails were obtained by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) as a result of a public records request sent to David Hancock, an election denier and member of the Gwinnett county board of elections. Crew shared the emails with the Guardian. Spanning a period beginning in January, the communications expose the inner workings of a group that includes some of the most ardent supporters of the former president Donald Trump\u2019s election lies as well as ongoing efforts to portray the coming election as beset with fraud. Included in the communications are agendas for meetings and efforts to coordinate on policies and messaging as the swing state has once again become a focal point of the presidential campaign. The communications include correspondence from a who\u2019s who of Georgia election denialists, including officials with ties to prominent national groups such as the Tea Party Patriots and the Election Integrity Network, a group run by Cleta Mitchell, a former attorney who acted as an informal adviser to the Trump White House during its attempts to overturn the 2020 election. The group \u2013 which includes elections officials from at least five counties \u2013 calls itself the Georgia Election Integrity Coalition. Among the oldest emails released are those regarding a 30 January article published by the United Tea Party of Georgia. Headlined \u201cGeorgia Democratic Party Threatens Georgia Election Officials\u201d, the article was posted by an unnamed \u201cadmin\u201d of the website, and came in response to letters sent to county election officials throughout Georgia who had recently refused to certify election results. \u201cIn what can only be seen as an attempt to intimidate elections officials,\u201d the article began, \u201cthe Georgia Democratic party sent a letter to individual county board of elections members threatening legal action unless they vote to certify upcoming elections \u2013 even if the board member has legitimate concerns about the results.\u201d The letter had been sent by a lawyer representing the Democratic party of Georgia to county election board members in Spalding, Cobb and DeKalb counties. Election board members in each of those counties had refused to certify the results of local elections the previous November. In their letter, Democrats sought to warn those officials that their duty to certify results was not discretionary in an attempt to prevent further certification refusals, including in the coming presidential election. In response, the United Tea Party of Georgia took issue with the letter, calling it \u201ctroubling\u201d and saying that it was \u201cOrwellian to demand that election officials certify an election even if they have unanswered questions about the vote\u201d. While the author of the article was not named on the United Tea Party of Georgia\u2019s website, the emails obtained by Crew show that it was Hancock, an outspoken election denier and member of the Gwinnett county board of elections, who has become a leading voice in the push for more power to refuse to certify results. \u201cAll right \u2013 I finished the article and posted it,\u201d Hancock wrote in an email the same day he published the article. Receiving the email were a handful of county election officials who have expressed belief in Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, and have continued to implement policies and push for rules based on the belief that widespread election fraud threatens to result in a Trump loss in Georgia in November. They include Michael Heekin, a Republican member of the Fulton county board of elections who refused to certify results this year; his colleague Julie Adams, who has twice refused to certify results this year and works for the prominent national election denier groups Tea Party Patriots and the Election Integrity Network; and Debbie Fisher of Cobb county, Nancy Jester of DeKalb county and Roy McClain of Spalding county \u2013 all of whom refused to certify results last November and who received the letter Hancock took issue with. By 4 February, Hancock apparently hadn\u2019t received much feedback from his article, and again shared it with the group. \u201c[N]o comments at all on the Democratic party of Georgia article. I guess it just wasn\u2019t picked up by anyone important,\u201d he wrote in an email to the group at 10.53pm that Sunday night, following up five minutes later with a link to the article. \u201cI think the message needs to get out, so share as you feel led.\u201d Democrats and election experts have cited Georgia court cases dating back to 1899 dictating certification as a \u201cministerial\u201d, not discretionary, duty of county election officials. At a Monday gathering of state-level election officials from several swing states, Gabe Sterling, a deputy to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, warned county election officials that they could be taken to court for refusing to certify results in November. The communications also show members of the group coordinating on messaging regarding their false claims of widespread voter fraud. Ahead of a December meeting of the group, Adams, using her TeaPartyPatriots.org email address, sent an agenda that included an item about a \u201cNew York Times reporter traveling to several counties in Georgia\u201d. Another agenda noted that the Federalist, a rightwing publication, was seeking \u201cfreelance writers (no experience needed)\u201d. The group has heard from speakers at their meetings that include the state election board member Dr Janice Johnston, an election denier who smiled and waved to the crowd at Trump\u2019s 3 August rally in Atlanta in which he praised her and two other Republicans on the board as \u201cpit bulls\u201d \u201cfighting for victory\u201d. One agenda also noted that Frank Schneider, an election denial activist who has challenged the eligibility of more than 31,000 Georgia voters, would speak at a meeting. Other speakers at the group\u2019s meetings include Garland Favorito, perhaps the state\u2019s most prominent election denial activist who constantly pressures the state election board to launch investigations into supposed election fraud as well as to implement policies and rules he and others frequently submit. (In a separate release of emails obtained by the Guardian, Favorito is seen scheduling a July lunch with the state election board\u2019s chair, John Fervier, a moderate Republican who has voted against recent denier-based rules passed by his Republican colleagues.) Another meeting speaker was Salleigh Grubbs, the chair of the Cobb county Republican party, who successfully petitioned the state election board to adopt a rule that gives county election officials more power to refuse to certify election results. Amanda Prettyman, an election denier who spoke about election conspiracies at a 2022 Macon-Bibb county election board meeting, has also spoken at meetings of the group, as have Lisa Neisler, an election denier whose X profile contains a photo of Trump supporters at a rally on 6 January before the attack on the Capitol, and Victoria Cruz, a Republican who ran for a county commission seat in May but lost. The emails back up previously released emails showing Hancock coordinating with Johnston on two rules passed by the state election board that give county election officials more power to refuse to certify results, as well as ongoing voter purges that Democrats have said are a violation of the National Voter Registration Act. Those emails also show Hancock\u2019s initial response to the letter from Georgia Democrats warning county election officials like himself that they have a legal duty to certify results. \u201cWhen you have a moment, I would really appreciate your opinion on this incredible letter from an attorney for the Democratic party of Georgia regarding voting to certify an election,\u201d Hancock wrote to Favorito on 4 January. \u201cI guess they are trying to prepare for the 2024 elections? I don\u2019t see how this stands \u2013 if the [board of elections] has no choice but to certify an election, then why require them to vote to certify the election?\u201d"

            "content": "The far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) came first in Sunday\u2019s election in Thuringia with nearly 33% of the vote and a close second in Saxony with almost 31%. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, urged mainstream parties to exclude \u201crightwing extremists\u201d. He called the results \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cworrying\u201d. The chancellor said \u201cour country cannot and must not get used to this. The AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country\u2019s reputation.\u201d Leaders of the AfD demanded that their party be included in coalition negotiations in the two states. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) said the results of the elections in Thuringia and Saxony are not only a signal for change in direction in the states, but also on the federal level. Saskia Esken, from the Social Democratic party (SPD), said that \u201call the (coalition) parties, but in particular our two coalition partners, must take the motivation from this election result to end these public arguments and pull together.\u201d Val\u00e9rie Hayer, the president of the Renew Europe group, said \u201ca dark day for Germany is a dark day for Europe.\u201d Petr Fiala, the conservative Czech prime minister, expressed concern and called for stepping up efforts to reduce illegal migration. The conservative Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, has expressed concern about the outcome of elections in the two German states, calling for faster asylum procedures outside the EU, a more effective returns policy and stricter controls. Leaders of the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland have demanded that their party be included in coalition negotiations in two states where it won nearly a third of the vote in elections on Sunday, in results that have scrambled the political landscape a year before a general election. The AfD chapters in Saxony and Thuringia have been designated as \u201crightwing extremist\u201d by the security authorities. Sunday\u2019s result in Thuringia marked the first time since the Nazi period that a far-right party has claimed the top spot in a state election, raising questions about how long the democratic parties can keep it out of power by refusing any cooperation. Given the fractured results handed back by voters, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which outperformed the remaining parties, will probably have to cobble together ideologically improbable coalitions spanning right to left in both states in order to govern. Whether such governments can prove stable and capable of addressing the patently unsatisfied electorate\u2019s main concerns will be a vexing question as the campaign for the national vote in September 2025 begins. Read the full story here. Saskia Esken, from the Social Democratic party (SPD), has insisted that \u201cOlaf Scholz is our strong chancellor and he will be our strong candidate for chancellor.\u201d \u201cWe turned things around in the final months in the last national election, and we will succeed again this time,\u201d she said, the Associated Press reported. \u201cAnd I want to say very clearly that all the (coalition) parties, but in particular our two coalition partners, must take the motivation from this election result to end these public arguments and pull together.\u201d German chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday urged parties to avoid collaborating with the far right, after the AfD made record gains in two regional polls and his own coalition suffered a heavy defeat a year before a general election. In the former East German state of Thuringia, the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam AfD became the first far-right party to win a regional election since the second world war, taking about 33% of the vote on Sunday. The AfD was headed for a close second place in neighbouring Saxony. Bild newspaper daily described the outcome as \u201ca political earthquake\u201d. Scholz, whose deeply unpopular three-party coalition received a slapdown in both states, called the results \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cworrying\u201d. \u201cThe AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country\u2019s reputation,\u201d he said. \u201cAll democratic parties are now called upon to form stable governments without right-wing extremists,\u201d he said in a message on Facebook. Coalition governments are the norm in Germany at federal and state level, and mainstream parties have always ruled out collaboration with the far right. But AfD co-leader Alice Weidel said she believed the \u201cundemocratic firewall\u201d was untenable given the party\u2019s electoral success, while fellow leader Tino Chrupalla said there would be \u201cno politics without the AfD\u201d. Here\u2019s the updated seat distribution in Saxony. The state election commission corrected the preliminary results. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) said the results of the elections in Thuringia and Saxony are not only a signal for change in direction in the states, but also on the federal level. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU)'s Friedrich Merz congratulated his party\u2019s candidates, writing that achieving their results under difficult circumstances is a great success. Daniela Schwarzer, an executive board member at the Bertelsmann Stiftung, has an interesting analysis of the foreign policy dimension of yesterday\u2019s state elections. \u201cThere is a high chance that both regions will get a CDU led government,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBSW has set out conditions for coalescing w/ the CDU in Thuringia or Saxony: Wagenknecht wants regional governments to support immeditate negotiations between Russia &amp; Ukraine instead of delivering arms to Ukraine, and refuses the deployment more US medium-range missiles in Germany,\u201d Schwarzer noted. She added: The influence of L\u00e4nder governments on foreign &amp; defence policy is arguably limited. And yet the effect of this strategic move of BSW may be huge: It may split the Christian Democrats, Germany\u2019s largest opposition party and to date supporter of Ukraine, down the middle. Here\u2019s the seat allocation in Saxony, where the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) took the most seats, followed closely by the far right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). Val\u00e9rie Hayer, a French politician who serves as president of the liberal Renew Europe, has said that \u201ca dark day for Germany is a dark day for Europe. The election result in Thuringia and Saxony is unprecedented.\u201d \u201cWe shall not let Europe give in to racist, antisemitic, misogynist and homophobic movements,\u201d she said. Similarly to countries like the United States, Germany\u2019s 16 states have considerable powers. While the federal government is responsible for foreign affairs and defence, states play a role in policymaking in areas ranging from education to policing and health care. The states have their own parliaments and coalition governments. Here\u2019s an explainer from the German Bundestag: The Federal Republic of Germany is a federal state made up of 16 constituent states - the L\u00e4nder. Accordingly, there are federal laws that apply for the whole territory of the Federation, and Land laws that only have validity in the Land in question. Land laws may not conflict with federal laws. Article 31 of the Basic Law states that \u201cFederal law shall take precedence over Land law.\u201d This is intended to ensure that, as far as possible, \u201cequitable living conditions\u201d prevail throughout the federal territory. The legislative competencies of the Federation and the L\u00e4nder are regulated in detail by the Basic Law. Articles 71 to 74 list the legislative powers of the Federation. In all other cases, the L\u00e4nder are responsible. Exclusive legislation In the fields subject to the exclusive legislation of the Federation, the L\u00e4nder only have the power to adopt legislation where they are expressly empowered to do so by a federal act. The Federation holds exclusive legislative competence in the following fields: all foreign policy issues, defence, including the protection of the civil population, citizenship, currency and money, the unity of the customs and trading area and cooperation between the Federation and the L\u00e4nder concerning criminal police work. Concurrent legislation In fields subject to concurrent legislation, the L\u00e4nder have the right to adopt legislation provided and in so far as the Federation makes no use of its legislative powers in the same field. The Federation has the right to adopt legislation in these fields provided it is intended to establish equitable living conditions in the federal territory or maintain Germany\u2019s legal and economic unity. Civil law, criminal law, the prison system, road traffic, the law of association and assembly, the law relating to the residence and establishment of foreign nationals, business law, consumer protection and the benefits granted to members of the public service are all among the fields subject to concurrent legislation. Here is the seat distribution in the Thuringia state parliament following yesterday\u2019s election. The far right won the most seats. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has urged mainstream parties to exclude \u201crightwing extremists\u201d, after preliminary results showed the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) had come top in a state election, while a new populist force on the left established a firm foothold in the country\u2019s political landscape Voters in two closely watched elections in the former communist east made clear their dissatisfaction with Germany\u2019s mainstream political parties, putting the AFD in the top spot in Thuringia, with 32.8% of the vote, and second place in Saxony, with 30.6%, according to preliminary results. Scholz called the results \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cworrying\u201d. \u201cOur country cannot and must not get used to this. The AfD is damaging Germany. It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country\u2019s reputation,\u201d Scholz said, adding that the most dire predictions, that his centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) might fall out of a state parliament for the first time, had not materialised.

            "date": "2024-09-26T12:00:01Z",
            "content": "A rule passed last week, which bipartisan election officials in Georgia say will delay the counting of votes in November, was introduced by an election denier who appears to believe in various rightwing conspiracies and whose apparent experience in elections dates only to February. The rule \u2013 which requires poll workers to hand-count ballots at polling locations \u2013 was passed by an election-denier majority on the Georgia state election board on Friday. It was introduced by Sharlene Alexander, a Donald Trump supporter and member of the Fayette county board of elections, who was appointed to her position in February. Alexander\u2019s Facebook page alludes to a belief in election conspiracies, the Guardian has found. Alexander is one of 12 people \u2013 all election deniers \u2013 who have introduced more than 30 rules to the state election board since May, according to meeting agendas and summaries reviewed by the Guardian. Of those, the board has approved several, including two that give county election officials more discretion to refuse to certify election results, in addition to Alexander\u2019s hand-count rule. Alexander\u2019s lack of experience in elections underscores the recent phenomena of unelected, inexperienced activists in Georgia\u2019s election-denial movement successfully lobbying the state election board to pass rules favored by conspiracists. Democrats, voting rights advocates and some Republicans have said the rules are not just outside the authority of the state election board, but may result in delays in the processing and certification of results. \u201cThere is widespread, bipartisan opposition to these anti-voter rule changes and opposition from the local elections officials, as well as experts in the field,\u201d Lauren Groh-Wargo, CEO of the voting rights group Fair Fight, said in a statement. Groh-Wargo noted that Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, and bipartisan county election officials from across the state as well as former governors Nathan Deal and Roy Barnes have said the recently passed rules are \u201cdestroying confidence\u201d in Georgia\u2019s election systems. Raffensperger and other Georgia election officials have warned that Alexander\u2019s rule and the two certification rules \u201care going to make counting ballots take longer\u201d. Those delays could be used by Trump and Republicans to call results of the election into question, representatives of Raffensperger\u2019s office have said. *** Anyone can submit a rule to the state election board, but all but one of the 32 rules submitted since May have come from a small but vocal group of election officials and activists who believe in Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud, including Alexander. The board hadn\u2019t implemented a new rule since 2021, and between September 2022 and May, no rules were introduced. Since then, Alexander and a group of election-denying officials and activists \u2013 called \u201cpetitioners\u201d in the parlance of the state election board \u2013 have introduced 31 rules that will affect millions of Georgia voters. These petitioners include Julie Adams, a member of the Fulton county election board who also works for the rightwing groups Tea Party Patriots and the Election Integrity Network, which is run by prominent national election denier Cleta Mitchell; Michael Heekin, Adams\u2019 Republican colleague on the Fulton county election board, who has refused to certify results this year; David Cross, an election denier who has pressured the state election board since 2020 to take up investigations into unfounded claims of voter fraud; Garland Favorito, head of the election denier group VoterGA; David Hancock of the Gwinnett county election board; Bridget Thorne, a Fulton county commissioner who ran a secret Telegram channel in which she discussed election conspiracies; and Lucia Frazier, wife of Jason Frazier, an election denier whom Republicans in Fulton county tried and failed to appoint to the election board there, and who recently withdrew a lawsuit claiming the county had allowed ineligible voters to remain on voter rolls. Like many county election officials in Georgia, Alexander makes her beliefs in election and other rightwing conspiracies known on her personal Facebook page. Last week, she posted a claim that 53 counties in Michigan have more registered voters than citizens who are old enough to vote. The claim is part of a lawsuit brought by the Republican National Committee that seeks to purge voters from Michigan\u2019s voter rolls \u2013 one of a slew of lawsuits that Republican groups have filed across the country claiming that voter rolls are bloated with ineligible voters. Jocelyn Benson, the Michigan secretary of state, has called the lawsuit \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201cfilled with baseless accusations\u201d, noting that her office has removed more than 700,000 voters from voter rolls in her tenure. Other posts from Alexander allude to a belief in conspiracies about the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as transphobic sentiment and fear of immigrants. \u201cVote like your daughters and granddaughters chances to compete in sports and their right to have private spaces to dress and undress in it depends on it. Because it does,\u201d reads a post Alexander shared on 11 August. Alexander did not immediately respond to questions for this story. Under previous iterations of the board, rules introduced by election-denying activists were regularly dismissed, said Sara Tindall Ghazal, the lone Democrat on the board. But that began to change earlier this year, when Republicans in Georgia\u2019s legislature appointed two new members to the board \u2013 Janelle King and Rick Jeffares \u2013 after pressure from Trump to replace the former board chair, Ed Lindsey, a more moderate Republican who didn\u2019t concede to demands from deniers. Dr Janice Johnston, a driving force behind much of the board\u2019s work on behalf of the election-denial movement, was appointed to her post in 2022. Matt Mashburn, a Republican who preceded Lindsey as chair of the state election board, told the Guardian that the board\u2019s new members were in uncharted territory. \u201cThe people voting to pass these new rules at this late date don\u2019t seem to have any idea how these new rules are supposed to be implemented and they don\u2019t seem to care,\u201d Mashburn said. Bipartisan election officials across the state have asked the board to stop implementing rules so close to the November election, with the Spalding county attorney calling them \u201cunfunded mandates\u201d. But Trump has lauded the trio of Johnston, King and Jeffares, calling them \u201cpit bulls \u2026 fighting for victory\u201d at a rally in Atlanta on 3 August. As the crowd cheered, Johnston stood and waved. Since then, the three \u2013 none of whom has previous experience administering elections \u2013 have passed several more rules. In August, the board passed a rule that allows county election officials to refuse to certify results if they feel a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d is necessary to investigate claims of fraud or irregularities, and another rule that allows local officials to request a virtually unlimited number of election-related documents before certifying results. Those rules were introduced by two election deniers, Adams and Salleigh Grubbs. Adams has sued for more power to refuse to certify results with the help of the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute; Grubbs is the chair of the Cobb county Republican party whose involvement in elections stems from Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020. That year, she chased a refuse truck that she believed was carrying shredded paper ballots, the Atlantic reported. There is no evidence that paper ballots were discarded in that incident, election authorities have said. Both women are members of a behind-the-scenes network of election officials and activists who call themselves the Georgia Election Integrity Coalition, the Guardian revealed. The group has coordinated on policies and messaging key to the success of the election-denial movement in the state. Johnston has been in frequent contact with the group\u2019s members, working with them to craft at least one of the certification rules the state election Board recently passed. The movement\u2019s success continued last week when the board passed Alexander\u2019s hand-count rule. The rule requires poll workers to open boxes of ballots collected by machines and count them by hand, increasing the chance that legal chain-of-custody requirements could be violated, according to Raffensperger. Alexander and others in Georgia\u2019s election-denial community believe that the practice of hand-counting ballots will prevent falsified ballots from being scanned into voting machines \u2013 a conspiracy theory that bipartisan election officials have said has no basis in fact. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 September 2024.

            "date": "2024-09-07T10:00:16Z",
            "content": "As next week\u2019s crucial presidential debate looms into view, Kamala Harris has maintained her narrow lead over Donald Trump in head-to-head polls but is locked in a tighter race in the crucial swing states needed to win the US election. Ever since Harris entered the contest \u2013 after Joe Biden dropped out following a disastrous debate performance that highlighted fears over his age and mental acuity \u2013 the vice-president has ridden a wave of support and enthusiasm, turning the race on its head. A solid but slight Trump advantage morphed into a Harris lead. But as Harris faces her first ever debate as a presidential nominee, there are signs that her upwards swing has hit a ceiling. Meanwhile, Trump will be hoping the debate offers his campaign a chance to recapture some momentum. Yet the race remains so tight in the swing states \u2013 and with a Republican advantage in the electoral college \u2013 that one commentator on Politico this week called it the \u201cequivalent of a knife fight in a phone booth\u201d. At the same time, the narrow geographical focus of the election is sharply coming into view, with the first ballots to determine the next occupant of the White House due to be mailed out to voters. North Carolina had aimed to start mailing out its presidential ballots on Friday. But in what might be seen as a metaphor for the cliffhanging nature of the contest between Harris and Trump, what should have been standard protocol was delayed by a dispute over whether Robert F Kennedy Jr, hitherto running as an independent candidate, should have a place on the ballot. Kennedy, who suspended his campaign on 23 August and endorsed Trump, is suing the North Carolina board of elections over its refusal to remove his name from the ballot in a state where surveys show the result on a knife edge. A judge on the state\u2019s supreme court ruled against him on Thursday but gave him 24 hours to appeal \u2013 resulting in a temporary delay to ballots being dispatched. And on Friday, the state\u2019s appeals court issued an interim stop on the dissemination of mail-in ballots to allow Kennedy\u2019s appeal to be heard. The postponement added another layer of suspense to a contest that could not be tighter, according to fresh Guardian analysis of recent polls. In a state with 16 electoral college votes up for grabs but where a Democratic presidential candidate has won only once since 1980, Trump and Harris are deadlocked at 48.07%. The figures illustrate why Kennedy - who is trying to help Trump after concluding that his presence in the race was draining his support - is so keen to remove his name from the ballot. A tiny number of voters putting their cross next to Kennedy\u2019s name on ballot papers could be enough to deprive Trump of the only one of seven swing states he won in his 2020 defeat at the hands of Joe Biden. The North Carolina imbroglio shows in a microcosm what has become a reality of this \u2013 and, increasingly, all \u2013 US presidential elections: that while voters will flock to the polls across all 50 states, some states matter more than others under America\u2019s unique electoral college. The system designates a set number of electors for each state based on population \u2013 with 538 for the entire country, meaning that 270 electoral college votes are needed to win. While the outcome in numerous states is a foregone conclusion \u2013 with many southern and midwestern states reliably Republican and others like New York and California solidly Democratic \u2013 the roughly equal partisan division of such states in electoral vote terms means much rests on the small number where party loyalties are evenly split. It also means that the national polling figures \u2013 while indicative of overall trends \u2013 are not what necessarily decides the election. The Guardian\u2019s latest national poll tracker, taken over a 10-day average, showed Harris at 47.5% compared with 43.9% for Trump, which is encouraging for her but probably not a big enough cushion to guarantee an electoral college win if replicated on polling day. In this context, arguably even more important than North Carolina is Pennsylvania, one of the Democrats\u2019 designated \u201cblue wall\u201d states \u2013 along with fellow battlegrounds Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 and sometimes given a \u201cRust belt\u201d label because of its status as the heartland of the US steel industry. Biden won it by slightly more than 80,000 votes in 2020, capturing its 19 electoral votes. This time, various permutations suggest that it might be key to the paths being charted by both Harris and Trump to reach the magic 270 total. That explains why the state has become such a focal point of both campaigns\u2019 activity in recent days; On Monday, Harris appeared with Biden at a Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh in their first joint campaign appearance since she replaced him atop the Democratic ticket, while Trump attended a televised town hall event hosted by Fox News and fronted by Sean Hannity on Wednesday. This Tuesday, the candidates will meet in their only scheduled presidential debate in Philadelphia, the biggest city in Pennsylvania. The data shows Harris with a wafer-thin lead in the state of 1.7% \u2013 48.9% to 47.2% \u2013 within the margin of error. Other polls show the race even tighter; a CNN survey this week had candidates tied at 47% each. The tight scenario underpins why states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina \u2013 and others like Georgia and two \u201cSun belt\u201d states, Nevada and Arizona \u2013 are now the targets of the lion\u2019s share of campaign resources. Maga Inc, a Trump-backing Super Pac, recently spent a reported $16m in adverts for North Carolina while the Trump campaign has diverted its efforts away from other less winnable locations to focus on the seven battleground states. In the war of resources and ad spending, Harris may have the advantage. Figures published on Friday showed her campaign had outraised Trump\u2019s by $361m to $130m in August, and had raised a total of $615m since she became her party\u2019s nominee in July. It seems an eye-watering sum and surely enough to sustain a message across this vast country. But the clarion call will be heard loudest in those states where the result is likely to remain too close to call even after polls close. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 September 2024. An earlier version said that there were 539 US electoral college electors instead of 538."

            "date": "2024-09-09T00:35:05Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are in effect tied heading into the final weeks of the election campaign, according to a national poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, raising the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate. Trump is up one percentage point, 48%-47%, over Harris, according to the survey released on Sunday, a difference that is within the survey\u2019s three-percentage point margin of error, meaning a win for either candidate in the election on 5 November is well within reach. Separately, a CBS/YouGov poll on Sunday showed a similarly tight race in key swing states, with Harris leading narrowly in Michigan (50%-49%) and Wisconsin (51%-49) and tied in Pennsylvania. While the Trump campaign endured a relatively rocky stretch in the weeks after Democratic President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, the most recent polling indicates his core support base is not going anywhere. The NYT poll notably showed that voters feel they need to learn more about Harris, while their opinions on Trump are largely set. In the survey, 28% of likely voters said they needed more information about the Democratic nominee, while only 9% said the same about Trump. The poll indicates that Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate could be a crucial moment. Harris will have the opportunity to give more detail of her planned policies as she spars with Trump over the course of 90 minutes. The race is so close that even a marginal boost for either candidate would be significant. In the wake of the latest polling, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, Harris\u2019s re-election campaign chair, said in an email to supporters on Sunday: \u201cAs vice-president Harris has said since day one, we are the underdogs in this race. We have a lot of work to do to make sure we win this November, and that will require us to continue aggressively raising money. \u201cThe electoral college benefits the Republican ticket. Even in 2020, when the Biden-Harris ticket won more votes than any ticket in history, the election came down to about 45,000 votes across the battleground states. This November, we anticipate margins to be similarly razor-thin. Every single vote will count.\u201d In the CBS poll, Harris enjoyed a double-digit lead over Trump when voters were asked who had the mental and cognitive health to serve as president, and 71% did not like Trump\u2019s comments about the vice-president, finding them insulting. However, the economy and inflation were shown to be major factor in voters\u2019 intention to back Trump over Harris. Among white, non-college educated voters, Trump was widely favoured to provide economic opportunities for working-class people (53%-27%). The key figures from the latest NYT poll are similar to its last comparable survey, released in late July, just after Biden decided not to seek re-election. In that poll, Trump was also up one percentage point, a difference well within the margin of error. Polls in the seven key swing states likely to determine the winner of the election have also consistently shown a razor-thin race. In the latest poll, Harris narrowly leads Trump in Wisconsin (50%-47%), Michigan (49%-47%) and Pennsylvania (49%-48%). A separate NYT/Siena poll focusing only on those key swing states last month showed Harris leading Trump by four percentage points, 50% to 46%. Since Harris replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket over the summer, she has hit the campaign trail hard, but has limited her unscripted appearances and kept interviews with the news media to a minimum.

            "title": "Kamala Harris now leads in US polls but state-level data puts race on knife-edge",
            "date": "2024-09-04T10:00:50Z",
            "content": "National polls for the US presidential race have been upended ever since Kamala Harris took over from Joe Biden to run against Donald Trump. While Biden was trailing the Republican former president nationally and in many crucial swing states, Harris has gained about three points in national polls since becoming the nominee. The Guardian\u2019s poll tracker assesses polls over a rolling 10-day period. It now has Harris leading nationally by about two points. But when comparing this performance with previous elections, data from RealClearPolitics reveals Harris\u2019s lead over Trump is weaker than those of his previous opponents. As of 30 August in their respective campaigns, Hillary Clinton led Trump by five points in 2016 and Biden was ahead of him by 6.3 points in 2020. But national polling is only part of the picture. Clinton lost the 2016 election despite winning more votes than Trump, because of the electoral system by which the president is elected. Several swing states have shifted to Harris and are on a knife-edge The US presidential election is decided by races in individual states that have a set number of electoral college votes. This means the race is decided by a handful of swing states such as Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia. Looking at data from RealClearPolitics, Harris has managed to at least close the gap on, if not overtake, Trump in the swing states. This is especially evident in Georgia and Arizona, where Harris has gained more than four points since Biden dropped out of the race. Pollsters claimed Harris\u2019s consolidation of the Democratic base, especially with voters of colour and young people who drifted from the party in Biden\u2019s final months as the presumptive Democratic nominee, had brought these states back into play. Sitting ahead of Trump by a couple of points nationally is not enough to give Harris a secure lead in any of the swing states. Trump and Harris are still within two points of each other in seven swing states \u2013 well within the margin of error for polls. Christopher Borick, a professor of political science and director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said this was key: \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a few points either way being critical [in this election]. \u201cThe polls weren\u2019t incredibly far off in 2016 or 2020 but the points by which they were off were significant. Margins of error don\u2019t acknowledge victory lines, and small errors can make a big difference.\u201d While this article analyses the latest polling average figures from RealClearPolitics, other polling averages from Silver Bulletin and FiveThirtyEight are giving Harris slightly larger leads in Michigan, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Previous polling errors give Democrats cause for concern While Harris can enjoy the favourable polling over the last few weeks, there is another uncertainty to factor in: Trump outperformed the polls in 2016 and 2020. There were several reasons for this: a lot of people made up their minds quite late in those campaigns; many Trump voters did not tell polling companies who they were supporting; and also methodological errors led to a fundamental underestimation of Trump support. Josh Clinton, the chair of the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) taskforce that produced a study on 2020 polls, told Pew Research: \u201cThe polling error was the highest in 40 years for the national popular vote and the highest in at least 20 years for state-level estimates of the vote.\u201d In 2020, certain polling averages missed the result by as much as 7.7 points in the case of FiveThirtyEight in Wisconsin. The pollster had Biden leading by 1.8 points in North Carolina, while RealClearPolitics had Trump leading by just 0.2 points. In fact, Trump carried the state with a lead of 1.3 points. The methodological errors included incorrect weighting that led to under-representation of less educated voters, as well as a lack of attention paid to voters\u2019 recalled voting patterns. Polling companies have sought to address these in this election, for example by the wide adoption of education as an additional survey weight. On top of these adjustments, 2022 gives people reason to hope. It was one of the most accurate years for polling in recent history, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight. But with Trump in the race again, there is uncertainty. Borick said \u201cthere may be a systemic underestimate of his support. We have seen this in our polls and I believe it reasonable to consider the possibility of a recurrence in 2024. The adjustments we made in 2020 such as weighting for educational attainment were ultimately helpful but did not fully correct for a dynamic that Trump seems to generate and is not fully understood. \u201cThe differences are clear when Trump is on the ballot. We should be sceptical about a sample size of two presidential elections, but there does seem to be a gravitational pull in Trump elections.\u201d How the race shapes up As things stand, the website 270toWin has seven states classed as a \u201ctoss-up\u201d. It leaves the election on a knife-edge, with the Democrats forecast to win 226 electoral college votes and the Republicans, 219. Should these states vote as predicted, Harris would only need to hold three of the Biden-backing swing states \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 to win with 270 electoral college voters. Trump, on the other hand, would need to flip at least two states from the Democrats to win. This leaves 93 electoral college votes as too close to call \u2013 and uncertainty about whether polling still could be underestimating Trump support. So while Harris can be pleased with the momentum her campaign has enjoyed over the last month, the election is still too close to call. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 September 2024 to clarify that Kamala Harris would need to hold Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to win 270 electoral college votes. A previous version left out Wisconsin."

            "title": "Democrats worried about polls undercounting Donald Trump\u2019s support",
            "date": "2024-09-23T20:24:20Z",
            "content": "Democrats are increasingly worried that pollsters are undercounting Donald Trump\u2019s voter support, rating his prospects of winning November\u2019s presidential election as much higher than headline opinion polling figures suggest. While most national surveys show consistent, though moderate, leads for Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, some supporters are unnerved by the small margin of her advantage in three northern battlegrounds \u2013 Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 which are deemed must-wins in her quest for the White House. Although some polls have shown the vice-president with leads of between four and six points in Pennsylvania \u2013 generally judged the most important swing state \u2013 others show Trump trailing by smaller deficits. Narrower gaps separate the two in Michigan and Wisconsin, where Harris\u2019s lead is just 1 or 2%, according to several different recent polls. Underpinning Democrats\u2019 fears is the knowledge that Trump greatly out-performed predictions in all three states in 2016, when he narrowly won them en route to his election triumph over Hillary Clinton, and in 2020, when he was pipped by Joe Biden by far smaller margins than forecast. The worries are compounded by the latest New York Times/Siena poll, which records Trump performing more robustly in three Sun belt battleground states \u2013 Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina \u2013 than he has in weeks. The survey shows the Republican nominee leading by five points \u2013 50 to 45% \u2013 in Arizona, which Biden won by just over 10,000 votes in 2020, and four points \u2013 49 to 45% \u2013 in Georgia, which was won by the president by a similar margin. In North Carolina, where Trump is trying to avoid being tarred by revelations over past comments by Mark Robinson, the GOP\u2019s candidate for governor, he has a smaller advantage, 49 to 47%. Putting the Democrats\u2019 worries into perspective are projections showing that Trump will win all seven designated battleground states \u2013 the seventh being Nevada \u2013 if he outstrips polling predictions by the same margins he achieved in losing the 2020 election. A separate projection by Focaldata \u2013 using a model that takes into account different demographic factors in determining the likelihood that certain cohorts will vote \u2013 reduces Harris\u2019s lead by an average of 2.4% across swing states. \u201cIn an election which could be decided by just 60,000 voters in November, this margin could easily be the difference between a right and wrong call on the election winner,\u201d writes Focaldata\u2019s Patrick Flynn. \u201cPollsters who simply rely on self-reporting [in defining likely voters] may be subject to another polling miss in Trump\u2019s favor.\u201d The one piece of encouraging news for Harris is that she will win every swing state except Georgia if the polls turn out to be as wrong as they were in the campaign for the 2022 congressional midterm elections. That has not placated some Democrats, who note that both Clinton and Biden were performing better against Trump in polling \u2013 both nationally and in swing states \u2013 than Harris is now. \u201cThat\u2019s ominous. There\u2019s no question that is concerning, but you\u2019re working as hard as you can work, no matter what,\u201d the Hill quoted one unnamed Democratic senator as saying. \u201cMy sense is there\u2019s not a lot more you can do than we\u2019re already doing.\u201d John Fetterman, the Democratic senator for Pennsylvania, told the same site that Trump was a threat despite some buoyant recent polling for Harris in his state. \u201cPolling has really been seriously damaged since 2016 \u2026 Trump is going to be tough in Pennsylvania, and that\u2019s absolutely the truth,\u201d he said. In a further worrying sign for Harris, the New York Times/Siena poll indicated that her \u201cbounce\u201d from this month\u2019s debate against Trump \u2013 which most surveys indicated she won \u2013 was the smallest enjoyed by any presidential debate-winning candidate in the 21st century. \u201cOn average, Kamala Harris is faring about one point better across 34 polls that measured the race before and after the debate,\u201d wrote the New York Times\u2019 chief polling analyst Nate Cohn, concluding that the contest remained deadlocked despite the encounter. \u201cGeorge W Bush, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Mitt Romney, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and, yes, Donald J Trump earlier this year, all peaked with gains of at least two points after their debates.\u201d"

            "content": "A Christian political operative has teamed up with charismatic preachers to enroll election skeptics as poll workers across the country, using a Donald Trump-aligned swing state tour to enlist support in the effort. Joshua Standifer, who leads the group called Lion of Judah, describes the effort as a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d strategy to get Christians in \u201ckey positions of influence in government like Election Workers\u201d, which will help them identify alleged voter fraud and serve as \u201cthe first step on the path to victory this Fall\u201d, according to his website. Standifer has been on the road with a traveling pro-Trump tent revival featuring self-styled prophets and Christian nationalist preachers that has made stops in key swing states including Michigan, Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin. He describes himself as a former Republican opposition researcher who struck out on his own after receiving a message from God to involve Christians in politics. \u201c[God] said, \u2018start a group called the Lion of Judah.

The Lion of Judah\u2019s election worker training program, which the Guardian has reviewed, features a series of modules titled \u201cFight The Fraud: How To Become An Election Worker In 4 Easy Steps!\u201d Standifer\u2019s project has so far largely flown under the radar. Matthew Taylor, a researcher with the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies, described the effort in a post on X as a \u201curgent &amp; unrecognized hazard to our democracy this fall\u201d and said he worried it had the potential to sow chaos during the election. \u201cAll it takes is one or two of those people coming forward and saying, \u2018Hey, I found election fraud\u2019 and presenting dubious evidence to throw an amazing amount of sand in the gears of the vote counting process,\u201d he told the Guardian. Standifer vehemently rejected the idea that the organization poses a threat to the electoral process and said he founded the group to empower Christians to participate in politics \u2013 not to sow doubts in elections. \u201cWe don\u2019t stand for things like that,\u201d said Standifer, who said he viewed anxieties about his project as an example of anti-Christian sentiment. \u201cI want to speak against the rise, I feel like, of bigotry towards Christians that\u2019s happening, because it\u2019s almost offensive. You know that if this was like any other faith, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s pushback.\u201d Still, the training for aspiring election workers makes no attempt at non-partisanship. In the first section of the course, participants are told that having Christians serving as election workers will form \u201cthe first step on the path to victory this Fall\u201d. As poll workers, the course promises, believers will be able to play a direct role in identifying and reporting irregularities in the process in real time. During his speech at the Wisconsin stop of the Courage Tour, Standifer referred to this strategy as \u201ca Trojan horse\u201d involving an element of surprise. \u201cThey don\u2019t see it coming,\u201d Standifer told the crowd. He repeatedly noted the value of getting as deeply involved in the electoral process as possible, noting that simply volunteering as a poll watcher would not grant them as much access. Standifer told the Guardian that Lion of Judah had recruited election workers in all of the swing states but declined to share how many people it had signed up. Although voter fraud \u2013 for example, a voter casting a ballot under someone else\u2019s name, or in two states \u2013 is exceedingly rare, Standifer\u2019s program emphasizes the unfounded claim that fraudulent voting is a persistent problem and echoes Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the 2020 election. \u201cAs an Election Worker, it is important to be vigilant and proactive in identifying and reporting any suspicious activities that may compromise the fairness of the election,\u201d reads the text of a training module titled \u201cHandling Fraud in Real Time\u201d. The training urges workers who have witnessed \u201csuspicious activities or irregularities\u201d to report them first to the Lion of Judah\u2019s \u201cfraud hotline\u201d and then to their local authorities. \u201cThe fact that they are instructed to share the \u2018evidence\u2019 of this with Lion of Judah before they reach out to state authorities and report it signals, I think, at the very least, a good deal of bad faith on their part, if not almost a conspiratorial desire to undermine the results of the election,\u201d Taylor said. The Lion of Judah training program reflects a broad push, by the Trump campaign and its allies, to insert election-doubting Trump supporters into key roles during the 2024 presidential election. The Republican National Committee (RNC), which is chaired by Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, announced earlier this year that it planned to recruit 100,000 poll watchers as part of its \u201celection integrity plan\u201d. There is no evidence that the RNC has managed to recruit the army of poll watchers they have promised, but election experts and voting rights groups worry the effort could still sow doubt and intimidate voters. Meanwhile, in Georgia, conservative members of the state\u2019s elections board have worked closely with election-denying activists to change the rules that govern the state\u2019s elections, making it easier for local officials to challenge election results. During the Courage Tour, Standifer encouraged attendees to envision its possible impact. \u201cJust imagine: it\u2019s election night. Chaos is happening. The polls are closing \u2013 they go and volunteers are getting kicked out,\u201d said Standifer. \u201cBut what if we had Christians across America, in swing states like Wisconsin, that were actually the ones counting the votes?\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-23T19:07:12Z",
            "content": "For more than 40 years, a bloody and violent shadow war has raged between Israeli intelligence services and the Lebanon-based militant Shia Islamist organisation Hezbollah. One of the earliest defeats for Israel came in November 1982, five months after its forces had invaded Lebanon set on the destruction of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, then based there. When the PLO\u2019s armed fighters were forced to leave Beirut, it appeared Israel had won a major victory. Then came a shattering blast which demolished the headquarters of the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal intelligence service, in the coastal town of Tyre. Ninety-one people died in the explosion, which authorities blamed then and for years afterwards on a gas leak. In fact, it had been a massive suicide car bombing, among the first of its kind and organised by militant Islamists from among the Shia population of southern Lebanon. Those behind the blast went on to join Hezbollah, which was founded the following summer with supervision and support from the new Iranian revolutionary regime that had taken power in Tehran in 1979. The same young radical Shias successfully bombed the Shin Bet\u2019s headquarters in Tyre once more in November 1983, killing 28 Israelis and 32 Lebanese prisoners. They also caused hundreds of US and French casualties with other massive suicide attacks that Israeli services were powerless to prevent. Thus began one of the hardest-fought clandestine conflicts of recent decades anywhere in the world. Israel\u2019s military fought against Hezbollah until forced to withdraw from Lebanon in 1999 and again during a brief war in 2006, but its secret security services have had no respite. An acute shortage of human intelligence left the Israelis in the dark about Hezbollah\u2019s plans throughout much of the 1980s. The whereabouts of one particular individual \u2013 a young Lebanese Shia called Imad Mughniyeh who masterminded bombs, hijackings and kidnappings \u2013 remained unclear. There were several near misses but it take more than 20 years for the Israelis to catch up with their quarry when a car bomb killed Mughniyeh in Damascus in 2008. A major battlefield in the early 90s was South America, where Hezbollah was able to recruit support from among the large Lebanese Shia diaspora. When Israeli attack helicopters killed Abbas al-Musawi, the new leader of Hezbollah, in southern Lebanon in February 1992, the militant Islamist organisation sought its revenge in Argentina. First, the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was bombed, killing 29, then in 1994 a suicide bomber killed 85 in a Jewish community centre in the Argentine capital. Both attacks were blamed on Hezbollah by investigators. South America also emerged as a major hub of Hezbollah financing, with a wide variety of legal and illegal activities run by supporters there generating massive funds for the organisation. The sheer scale of the operations, often run from remote locations where local security services had a limited presence or knowledge, impeded Israel\u2019s efforts to shut them down. Through recent decades, Europe has been another theatre of hostilities in the shadow war. As Hezbollah sought to extend its logistics operations on the continent through dozens of companies, Israeli intelligence services have tried to block the group\u2019s efforts. A series of low-profile operations had some success, many due to the discreet assistance of local security services. An attempt by Hezbollah to avenge the death of Mughniyeh with an attack on the Israeli embassy in Azerbaijan was thwarted. But then in July 2012 a suicide bus bombing killed five young Israelis and a driver in the Black Sea resort of Burgas in Bulgaria. Investigators found evidence of links to Hezbollah. By then, the battle was raging across the globe. In 2012, intelligence analysts in the US identified multiple Hezbollah plots against Israeli or Jewish targets \u2013 including two in Bangkok and one each in Delhi, Tbilisi, Mombasa and Cyprus \u2013 in just a six month period. A diplomat in Delhi was injured during a spate of attacks with magnetic car bombs in a complex operation involving agents in Thailand and India, several of them linked to Iran and Hezbollah. North America has been primarily a logistics hub for Hezbollah, with major financing operations a priority. These have allegedly allowed sympathisers to send hundreds of millions of dollars back to Hezbollah, an important stream of funding for its expansive social welfare budget as well as military operations. In 2011, US officials claimed proceeds from car sales and narcotics trafficking were funnelled back to Lebanon through Hezbollah-controlled money laundering channels. Last year, a high-profile art collector was put on a US Treasury sanctions list and charged in the US over claims that he uses his collection, which has included masterpieces by Pablo Picasso, Antony Gormley and Andy Warhol, to launder money for Hezbollah. Then there has been the tit-for-tat clandestine war closer to home. In 2023, David Barnea, the director of the Mossad, the main Israeli overseas intelligence service, described 27 Iranian plots against Israelis including in Georgia, Cyprus, Greece, and Germany. Hezbollah agents have been active in Iraq, Yemen and Syria, where thousands of its fighters deployed during the civil war. If there have been wins and losses on both sides over the decades, the balance appears to have tipped decisively in Israel\u2019s favour in recent months. Israeli officials have described attempts by Iranian operatives \u2013 or Hezbollah \u2013 to carry out assassinations in Israel. None have come close to success. Last week\u2019s pager and walkie-talkie attacks, which killed 42 and wounded about 3,000, are presumed to have been carried out by the Mossad and other Israeli services and have been seen by analysts as a resounding victory in the long covert conflict. At the same time, Hezbollah\u2019s high command has been decimated by a series of Israeli assassinations of senior military officials that suggest a flow of timely, precise inside intelligence, likely derived from a mix of intercepted communications, surveillance and agents within Hezbollah\u2019s ranks. \u201cThis is a huge intelligence coup \u2026 The Israelis are targeting the top and middle levels and that leaves [Hezbollah] blind, deaf and dumb,\u201d said Magnus Ranstorp, a veteran Hezbollah observer at the Swedish Defence University. The targeted assassinations also show that the Mossad and other agencies have long institutional memories. Fuad Shukr, the Hezbollah chief of staff who was killed by Israel in July, and Ibrahim Aqil, who was killed last week, were important members of Hezbollah\u2019s current military hierarchy and would have played major roles in any coming all-out war. Both were also founder members of Hezbollah and part of the network responsible for the bombings of 1982 and 1983."

            "date": "2024-09-23T17:44:11Z",
            "content": "Iran\u2019s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has accused Israel of fanning the flames of war in the Middle East and said he hoped Iran could avoid being dragged into acting in a way \u201cnot worthy\u201d of it, as he spoke to the media on his first official visit to the US. The reformist, who took office in July after winning an election on a ticket of better relations with the west, said during a roundtable with journalists as he attended the UN general assembly in New York that no one benefited from war and that anyone who said otherwise was deluding themselves. \u201cWe know more than anyone else that if a larger war were to erupt in the Middle East, it will not benefit anyone throughout the world. It is Israel that seeks to create this wider conflict,\u201d he said. Tensions soared immediately after his inauguration as the visiting political chief of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in an operation in Tehran that was widely attributed to Israel. Pezeshkian said he was repeatedly told to hold back a response to the killing because Israel was within a week or two of signing a peace agreement, but that peace remained elusive. \u201cWe tried not to respond but unfortunately that elusive week never came,\u201d he said adding that he believed Iran had been lied to. \u201cThere is no winner in warfare, everyone loses in war and conflict. We are only deluding ourselves if we think someone will be victorious in a regional war.\u201d He also said: \u201cEvery day Israel is committing more atrocities and killing more and more people \u2013 old, young, men, women, children, hospitals, other facilities.\u201d Western diplomats are still assessing Pezeshkian after two months in office dominated by conflict in the region. He did not spell out how much damage had been done to the Iran-backed Lebanese militants Hezbollah in Israel\u2019s most recent wave of attacks and did not reply directly when asked if Iran would now respond more directly to Israel. \u201cWe always keep hearing, well, Hezbollah fired a rocket. If Hezbollah didn\u2019t even do that minimum, who would defend them?\u201d he said. \u201cCuriously enough, we keep being labelled as the perpetrator of insecurity. But look at the situation for where it is.\u201d He denied that Iran had not shown its own deterrence power, arguing that in its response to Israel\u2019s destruction of the Iranian consulate in Damascus, which killed at least 11 people including a senior commander in the al-Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, Iranian forces had penetrated Israel\u2019s Iron Dome air defences and shown that it could have killed civilians. Speaking on the record for an hour to a group of almost exclusively US reporters, Pezeshkian became most animated as he accused western politicians and media of double standards in demanding human rights while at the same time remaining silent over the horrors in Gaza. \u201cWhere else in the world where countries that on the surface are committed to human rights allow these killings?\u201d he asked. He said Iran was willing to reopen talks on the nuclear deal that broke down more than a year ago, insisting the religious fatwa against Iran possessing nuclear weapons remained, and it was part of the Islamic Republic\u2019s military doctrine. He was sitting alongside the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who earlier said on Telegram that Tehran was focused on initiating a new round of nuclear negotiations. \u201cWe are prepared, and if the other parties are also prepared, we can have another beginning of the talks during this trip,\u201d Pezeshkian said. He noted that he had been among a group of MPs who had vehemently defended the Iran nuclear deal with the west, including providing the UN nuclear weapons inspectorate with unfettered access to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. \u201cWe are still ready to sign up to the framework we agreed to,\u201d he said, adding that the US withdrawal from the deal initiated by Donald Trump in 2018 was \u201cillegal, unfair, unjust and not right\u201d. Pezeshkian denied Iran was running a series of proxy militia groups hostile to Israel, saying the west aimed to present Iran with an \u201cinhumane face\u201d. The Houthis in Yemen \u201ccannot be subjected to our will\u201d, he said. \u201cHow can we ask them to abstain from reacting to these crimes?\u201d He said he was seeking talks with the west about the war in Ukraine and said that during his presidency no short-range missiles had been sent from Iran to Russia for use in Ukraine, a formulation that leaves out the US intelligence claim that a contract to send missiles was probably signed last summer by his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi. Pezeshkian said Iran did not support what he described as Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, and he said the borders of countries should be respected. He scoffed at suggestions that Iran was funding anti-Israeli demonstrations, describing the allegation as absurd and pointing out that Iran was having a hard time covering its own payroll."

            "date": "2024-09-28T10:23:56Z",
            "content": "Israel\u2019s claimed assassination of Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in a massive strike on an underground headquarters in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs marks the most alarming escalation in almost a year of war between the Shia militant organisation and Israel. Immediately after a bellicose speech by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the UN general assembly \u2013 where he appeared to directly threaten Iran as well as promise to continue \u201cdegrading\u201d Hezbollah \u2013 the first reports of a major strike began to emerge. In less than an hour, Israeli journalists with connections to the country\u2019s defence and security establishment were suggesting Nasrallah was the target and that he had been in the area of the headquarters at the time of the strike. On Saturday morning, the Israeli military said he had been killed. That the strike was regarded as highly significant was quickly confirmed soon after it happened by a series of statements from Israel \u2013 including an image showing Netanyahu ordering the attack on the phone from his New York hotel room. What is clearer than ever, after a series of Israeli escalations against Hezbollah this month \u2013 including targeted killings and the explosion of thousands of modified pagers and walkie-talkies supplied to the group \u2013 is that the long-understood ground rules governing the balance of deterrence between the two sides has been blown away. For much of the early months of the conflict with Hezbollah, which began on 8 October \u2013 a day after Hamas\u2019s attack from Gaza \u2013 it was understood Israel would not assassinate the militant group\u2019s most senior members. But in recent months those \u201cred lines\u201d have increasingly been rubbed away. As the geographic scope of attacks on both sides has moved deeper into Lebanon and Israel, so Israeli operations have aimed at ever more senior Hezbollah commanders, beyond those directly involved in launching strikes on the ground in Lebanon\u2019s south. Indeed, since the beginning of the year, diplomats and knowledgeable analysts in the region have suggested that one aim of the discreet to-and-fro between Israel and Hezbollah through US special envoy Amos Hochstein and intermediaries for the group has focused on preserving the understanding that the most senior figures in the militant group would not be targeted. On the Israeli side in the past fortnight, however, evidence has been building that a case was being made for a significant escalation. Claims of unsuccessful Hezbollah plots aimed at senior Israeli figures were made by the country\u2019s security agencies, while it was also suggested that the Israeli escalation was aimed at countering the militant group\u2019s own plans to launch a large offensive. All of which, it now seems clear, was a preamble for a long-prepared and multi-pronged effort to decapitate Hezbollah. While it may take several days to understand the full import of the fallout from Friday\u2019s strike, Netanyahu and his military chiefs have taken an enormous gamble, not simply regarding the situation in Israel\u2019s north, where tens of thousands have been displaced by the fighting, but with the wider region and with the country\u2019s relationships with its international partners. Coming in the midst of US- and French-led international efforts to broker a three-week ceasefire with Hezbollah, the move marks an emphatic slap in the face for the Biden administration, which believed it had an assurance from Netanyahu that he backed the temporary truce. Instead, it appears that Netanyahu and his military leadership were all the time secretly laying the ground for an attack timed to violently underline the rhetorical flourishes of the Israeli prime minister\u2019s warnings to Hezbollah and Iran during his thinly attended speech on Friday at the UN. Most significantly, the strikes represent a direct challenge to Tehran, for whom Nasrallah represented its most important strategic regional ally, whose tens of thousands of Iranian-supplied missiles aimed at Israel have long been seen as a key strategic foil preventing an Israeli attack on Iran itself. Now all bets are off. Despite anonymous Israeli claims \u2013 later disavowed by the IDF \u2013 that it had destroyed up to 50% of Hezbollah\u2019s missile arsenal of well over 100,000, that remains highly unlikely. And while Hezbollah\u2019s command and control has been severely damaged, it is probable that it retains a significant capacity. Other Iranian allies, including in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, have their own missiles and drones, which, while not as significant as Hezbollah\u2019s, could be brought into play \u2013 and not necessarily only against Israel but against US targets. Then there is the most important question: whether Iran can accept the strike against Nasrallah, or whether it too could be drawn into a widening conflict, and whether the strike is intended by Israel as setting the conditions for a strike against Iran. Underlying that concern, Iran\u2019s embassy in Beirut condemned Israel\u2019s airstrike, saying on Friday night \u2013 before Israel\u2019s claim that Nasrallah had been killed \u2013 that the attacks \u201crepresent a serious escalation that changes the rules of the game\u201d, and that Israel would be \u201cpunished appropriately\u201d."

The families of Col Nik Beizer and Sgt Ron Sherman, both 19, and the French-Israeli civilian Elia Toledano, 28, who were abducted by Hamas on 7 October, were informed in the last week by officials from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that a comprehensive inquiry revealed their loved ones had lost their lives as a result of IDF actions. Their bodies were recovered on 14 December from a tunnel in Jabaliya but the most likely cause of death was only recently determined, the military said. \u201cThe findings of the investigation suggest that the three, with high probability, were killed by a byproduct of an IDF airstrike,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThis is a highly probable estimate given all the data, but it is not possible to determine with certainty the circumstances of their death.\u201d The families were initially told the hostages had been killed by Hamas captors and, in January, the IDF rejected Hamas\u2019s assertions that they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. The conclusions of the investigation could add to pressure on the government to strike a deal to bring home the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The mothers of the two soldiers had pressed, since their bodies were discovered, for a full account of how their sons had died. \u201cWe have to find out the truth about everything,\u201d Maayan Sherman, the mother of Sherman, told the Wall Street Journal in May. \u201cEven if the truth is: \u2018We had to kill them.\u2019\u201d The November airstrike was aimed at al-Ghandour, who was taking cover in a tunnel.

Aqil, who was in his early 60s, had risen through the ranks and reached a senior position in the organisation. Exact details of his role are unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces described him as \u201cthe head of the Hezbollah terrorist organization\u2019s operations team, the acting commander of the Radwan [special forces] unit\u201d. \u201cHe was one of the really senior old-timers but was never really the face of anything. He was always a number two or number three, but had just been promoted in the last five to 10 years,\u201d said Hussain Abdul-Hussain, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington and an expert on extremism in Lebanon. Aqil was one of a group of young Shia men originally from the south of Lebanon but living in Beirut who were energised by the 1979 Iranian revolution and recruited by the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guards into a network known initially as Islamic Jihad and then later as Hezbollah. Their military aim, guided by their Iranian mentors, was to fight the US, which had despatched a peacekeeping force to Beirut; and Israel, which had occupied much of Lebanon. Their political objective was to turn Lebanon into an Islamic state aligned with Tehran. Almost all have been killed since, probably by Israel. Fuad Shukr was killed in an airstrike in July, almost certainly by Israeli security services working with the IDF. Shukr, who was 63 when he died, was Hezbollah\u2019s chief of staff, and reportedly tasked with obtaining its most powerful weapons. The most prominent member of the original group was Imad Mugniyeh, who was blamed for dozens of lethal attacks on US, Israeli and Jewish targets over 25 years and died in a car-bomb explosion in Damascus in 2008 that was attributed to the Mossad. The US had accused Mugniyeh of playing a central role in the bombings of the US embassy in Beirut in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and the US Marine Corps barracks in October 1983, which killed 241 US personnel. A French barracks was also bombed at that time, killing 58 people. Aqil was also accused of being involved in these operations. A US Justice Department notice describes him as \u201c a principal member of Hizballah\u2019s terrorist cell the Islamic Jihad Organization\u201d, which claimed responsibility for the two 1983 bombings in Beirut. The notice also says Aqil directed the taking of US and German hostages in Lebanon and held them there, also in the 80s. Evidence that Mugniyeh masterminded the two 1983 bombings is thin, however, and it is more likely that he and Aqil played a more minor role, leveraging their deep network of contacts and knowledge of southern Lebanon and Beirut to provide crucial logistical support. \u201cAqil was one of the nucleus of five people around Mugniyeh who were there at the start of the whole Hezbollah military enterprise,\u201d said Abdul-Hussain. Coming so soon after the extraordinary pager explosions which killed 37 people and injured thousands of ordinary Hezbollah operatives, the strike on Aqil suggests a concentrated and urgent Israeli effort to eliminate the organisation\u2019s higher command. Hezbollah will find it hard to replace men such as Shukr and Aqil, and their assassinations are likely to demoralise even committed senior members. Both men were reportedly close to the group\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah."

            "content": "Uncertainty before Labour\u2019s first budget since 2010 next month is weighing on the UK economy, according to two separate business surveys. The data company S&amp;P Global said UK private sector activity growth slowed for the second consecutive month in September, affecting the services and manufacturing industries. Some companies reported that clients were taking a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d to decision-making before the autumn budget, which is hitting investment plans, even as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, wants to encourage business investment to boost economic growth. The figures suggest that Labour\u2019s emphasis on its poor inheritance from the previous Conservative administration and the need for a tough budget on 30 October were weighing on the immediate outlook for many businesses. The S&amp;P survey found that the budget was \u201cby far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms\u201d. Export orders remained \u201crelatively subdued\u201d and total overseas sales rose only \u201cmarginally\u201d in September. The survey said: \u201cSome service providers noted higher demand from US clients, but manufacturers frequently suggested that weak EU sales had weighed on export orders.\u201d A separate survey of manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found that export order books in the three months to September were at their weakest since December 2020 \u2013 during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. In its industrial trends report, which the CBI described as \u201cuniformly disappointing\u201d, total and export order books at manufacturers deteriorated in September. A net balance of -44% of manufacturers reported that their export order books were below normal this month, compared with a reading of -22% in August. Ben Jones, the CBI lead economist, said: \u201cThe survey highlights that the recovery of the UK economy seen over the first half of 2024 remains fragile, with uneven progress seen across different sectors, and businesses increasingly cautious ahead of the budget at the end of next month.\u201d However, despite concerns of tax hikes in the budget and slowing growth, the S&amp;P survey racked up its 11th consecutive month of improving activity across the services and manufacturing sectors, and companies said their outlook over the next year was for new orders to grow. Overall, the flash UK PMI composite output index dipped to 52.9, down from August\u2019s 53.8. A figure above 50 indicates growth. Inflation is expected to moderate after companies slowed their price rises this month. The average prices charged by private sector businesses rose at the slowest rate since February 2021. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cA slight cooling of output growth across manufacturing and services in September should not be seen as too concerning, as the survey data is still consistent with the economy growing at a rate approaching 0.3% in the third quarter, which is in line with the Bank of England\u2019s forecast. \u201cBusiness optimism has also risen, albeit with concerns about the impact of the [budget] jangling nerves somewhat, notably in the manufacturing sector. Investment plans in particular are reported to have been put on ice pending clarity on the new government\u2019s policies, especially towards taxation.\u201d The UK economy has outperformed the eurozone this month, helping the pound hit a two-year high against the euro. Sterling gained half a eurocent to \u20ac1.1967, its highest level since early August 2022. A downturn in Germany, where business activity fell at the quickest rate for seven months in September, ,has pulled the wider eurozone economy into a contraction. Business activity across the euro area has decreased so far in September, with the HCOB flash eurozone PMI index dropping to 48.9, an eight-month low, and below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Hamburg Commercial Bank predicts Germany\u2019s economy will shrink by 0.2% in the July-September quarter. That would put the country into recession, as GDP fell by 0.1% in April-June."

            "date": "2024-09-20T07:19:58Z",
            "content": "Consumer confidence in the UK has fallen sharply amid growing concerns over government plans for a \u201cpainful\u201d budget, risking a hit to the economic recovery from the cost of living crisis. The latest barometer of sentiment from the data company GfK found consumer confidence fell to the lowest level since March, wiping out progress made this year to rebuild household morale. Neil Bellamy, the consumer insights director at GfK, said the \u201cmajor correction\u201d in the outlook for personal finances had come despite a return to stable inflation earlier this year, lower borrowing costs and resilient wage growth. \u201cFollowing the withdrawal of the winter fuel payments, and clear warnings of further difficult decisions to come on tax, spending and welfare, consumers are nervously awaiting the budget decisions on 30 October,\u201d he said. Keir Starmer said last month that the new government would need to take \u201cpainful\u201d decisions in the autumn budget after finding what Labour calls a \u201c\u00a322bn black hole\u201d in the public finances. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced in August she would scrap winter fuel payments for most pensioners, shelve plans for social care reform and axe road, rail and hospital investment as the first stage of a plan to reduce borrowing. However, the latest snapshot suggests the downbeat tone and prospect of tax and welfare changes hitting personal finances has the potential to hit the consumer spending recovery from the recession in the second half of last year. \u201cThis is not encouraging news for the UK\u2019s new government. Strong consumer confidence matters because it underpins economic growth and is a significant driver of shoppers\u2019 willingness to spend,\u201d Bellamy said. The figures show headline consumer confidence fell to -20, back to similar levels recorded earlier this year. The index measuring changes in personal finances over the past year was down two points at -9, while the outlook for the next 12 months was down nine points at -3. The drop by seven points from a reading of -13 in August marked the sharpest monthly decline in consumer confidence since April 2022. Despite the sharp declines, the headline snapshot remains significantly higher than in late 2022, when consumer confidence collapsed to the lowest level since records began in 1974 as high inflation battered household finances. Inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, the highest level since the early 1980s, as households faced increases in the price of energy and food, leading the Bank of England to drive up interest rates to combat fast-rising prices. The headline rate has fallen back sharply this year close to the Bank\u2019s 2% target, allowing for a first cut in borrowing costs in four years in August."

            "date": "2024-09-03T12:12:43Z",
            "content": "The government is to slash the nature-friendly farming budget in England by \u00a3100m in order to help fill what ministers say is a \u00a322bn Treasury shortfall, the Guardian can reveal. Nature groups and farmers have called this a \u201cbig mistake\u201d, saying it jeopardised the government\u2019s legally binding targets to improve nature. This cut would mean at least 239,000 fewer hectares of nature-friendly farmland, according to research by the RSPB, and this could increase if the smaller budget puts farmers off applying. Civil service sources told the Guardian ministers were blaming an underspend of \u00a3100m a year from the \u00a32.4bn budget for the cut, saying that because the Conservative government failed to spend the whole pot, it made it impossible to justify keeping it at that level to the Treasury. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has asked departments including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to each find more than \u00a31bn in savings, with others ordered to find hundreds of millions of pounds in order to help close the funding gap in the nation\u2019s budget that Reeves says was left by the Tories. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, promised earlier this year that Labour would \u201ccut through the Tory bureaucracy that has blocked farmers from receiving funding for work that includes protecting nature and wildlife habitats on their land\u201d in response to reports of the underspend, and accused the Conservatives of breaking their promise to farmers. After the UK left the EU, farmers were no longer part of the common agricultural policy subsidies scheme, which paid land managers according to the acreage they farmed. Instead the devolved nations have set up their own farming payments system. In England, this is the environment land management scheme (Elms), which pays farmers to support nature by, for example, letting hedges grow wilder, or sowing wildflowers for birds and bees on field margins. A report last month found butterflies, birds and bats are among the wildlife being boosted by the English scheme, and some areas had increased their bird numbers by 25%. Nature groups said financial support for sustainable agriculture needed to be increased, and certainly not cut, if the targets to halt species decline by 2030 were to be met. Alice Groom, the head of sustainable land use policy at the RSPB, said: \u201cWhilst we recognise the financial challenges government faces, investment in nature-friendly farming is critical, not just to meet our legally binding nature and climate targets, but also in order to underpin our national food security and the health of the economy. \u201cA \u00a3100m reduction in funding would see 239,000 hectares less nature-friendly farmland, and a failure to invest in nature and climate is predicted to shrink the economy by 12% \u2013 an impact greater than Covid and the financial crash. As the latest independent research has found, we need to increase the agriculture budget in England, from \u00a32.4bn to \u00a33.1bn a year, if we are to ensure the future of our vanishing farmland birds and wildlife, clean rivers and thriving farming and rural businesses.\u201d Vicki Hird, strategic lead on agriculture at the Wildlife Trusts, added: \u201cCutting the Elms budget would be a very big mistake. Funding for nature\u2019s recovery is absolutely critical to securing a prosperous and resilient future \u2013 to ensure that soils aren\u2019t washed away, to secure a future for pollinators, and to help farms adapt to periods of heavy rainfall and drought. Any move to reduce funding for restoring nature will put farm businesses at greater risk of suffering from the impacts of climate change and will lead to greater economic costs in the long term.\u201d The National Farmers\u2019 Union said a cut to the budget would risk further undermining farmer confidence, which was already at a record low, and weaken food security. The NFU\u2019s president, Tom Bradshaw, said: \u201cWe have seen a collapse in farmers\u2019 confidence, driven by record inflation, falls in farm income, and unprecedented weather patterns delivering relentless rain this year and a near drought last year. \u201cIn opposition the government consistently made clear its commitment to agriculture as a key driver of growth. Now it needs to deliver on that commitment. This government has said food security is national security. Now is the time to restore confidence by setting a multi-annual agriculture budget at the level needed to deliver economic growth in all that farming delivers for Britain.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing the spending audit, the chancellor has been clear that difficult decisions lie ahead on spending, welfare and tax to fix the foundations of our economy and address the \u00a322bn hole in the public finances left by the last government. Decisions on how to do that will be taken at the budget in the round.\u201d"

Her comments came as the housing and planning minister, Matthew Pennycook, said plans to scale back winter fuel payments for pensioners in England and Wales would not be watered down, after dozens of Labour MPs abstained on a key Commons vote on Tuesday night. Reeves also defended cutting winter fuel payments for all but the poorest pensioners as the \u201cright decision\u201d, as she spoke to broadcasters on a day when new figures showed the UK economy flatlined in July for the second month in a row. \u201cI\u2019ve been really clear that the budget on 30 October will require difficult decisions on tax, on spending, and on welfare,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cBut the prize \u2013 if we can bring stability back to our economy, if we can bring investment back to Britain \u2013 is economic growth, good jobs, paying decent wages in all parts of our country, to realise the huge potential that we have.\u201d Reeves said she had not wanted to strip winter fuel payments from millions of pensioners but was forced to by the \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances. Meanwhile, Pennycook defended the government\u2019s policy on the winter fuel allowance the morning after MPs voted to remove it from all but the poorest pensioners. A Conservative motion to strike down the move was defeated by 348 votes to 228. Pennycook said he appreciated the concerns many colleagues had raised, but added: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to water down that policy. We think it\u2019s the right decision to make.\u201d Asked about the government\u2019s decision to award pay increases to public sector workers while reducing winter fuel support, he told Sky News: \u201cWhat this government has done is implement the recommendations of the independent public sector pay review bodies. Now, unless the opposition in parliament are saying they would have rejected those recommendations out of hand, allowed industrial action to continue, which was extremely costly to the UK economy, they would have faced that same decision.\u201d MPs voted to reject the Conservative motion on Tuesday by a majority of 120, with about a dozen Labour MPs thought to have deliberately abstained and one, Jon Trickett, voting against. The veteran MP was joined by five of the seven Labour MPs who were suspended after voting to scrap the two-child benefit cap: Ian Byrne, Apsana Begum, Zarah Sultana, Richard Burgon and John McDonnell. Burgon said on X: \u201cFor me, this was a matter of conscience. This cut is not only going to cause even greater hardship for so many pensioners in my constituency who are already living in poverty, but it will also cost lives.\u201d However, it will be the high number of abstentions that will worry Downing Street and Labour whips, with the government trying to use the debate to reiterate its argument that removing the winter fuel allowance from all but older people who receive pensioner benefits such as pension credit was a tough but unavoidable choice. Among those who abstained after giving speeches was Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central, who has been one of the most outspoken Labour critics of the plan and called for it to be delayed and rethought. Pensioners, she said, \u201cmake the hardest budgetary decisions, harder than those of the Treasury, where there are choices. They have no choice. They have to put a roof over the head, they have to pay for their food, and they have to pay for their heating\u201d."

During talks with the club\u2019s new head coach in pre-season the Liverpool vice-captain outlined an ambition to become \u201cthe defender that no one wants to come up against in Europe\u201d. Speaking after the 3-0 victory against Bournemouth on Saturday, when he was directly involved in a Liverpool goal for the 100th time in his career, the 25\u2011year\u2011old said criticism of his defensive attributes was \u201charsh\u201d but said he is intent on improving. Slot believes he has identified how. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to judge how it has been in the years before but the only thing I know is we are talking about a player that won the Champions League and the league title so it\u2019s clear to me that he has been a good defender all his life,\u201d Slot said. \u201cBut because he is so special with the ball, the main emphasis goes on him doing special things with the ball. \u201cI think with him it is not about if he is capable of doing things, it\u2019s more can his concentration rate constantly be in 100% focus? So this is what we talk about a lot, that he has to stay active in every situation of the game, even if the ball is further away from him. But it\u2019s not that we or I taught him to defend in the last three months; he\u2019s won the league and he\u2019s won the Champions League. It\u2019s just getting him to understand all of what is necessary to play the best possible game.\u201d Liverpool, who host West Ham in the Carabao Cup third round on Wednesday, have kept four clean sheets in five Premier League matches. While encouraged by the defensive record, Slot believes his team have had a favourable fixture list and it is premature to draw conclusions. \u201cThe defence has been really good, although I think in the last game we needed our goalkeeper too many times to keep the clean sheet. Yesterday I looked at the league table and [thought]: \u2018OK, which teams did we face until now and which position are they? Are they in the top half or the bottom?\u2019 I think all of them are in the bottom half of the table, so you have to take that into account. \u201cThere are a lot of difficult teams we still have to face. After West Ham tomorrow we go for two difficult away games [against Wolves and Crystal Palace] \u2013 let\u2019s see where we are then when it comes to conceding goals because maybe the fixture schedule has been \u2018nice\u2019 to us when you see the table. And from the five games we have played three times at home, so that helps as well.\u201d Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher will again deputise for the injured Alisson, who may return from a muscle problem at Wolves on Saturday.

Fred Trump III\u2019s latest verbal salvo against his uncle came Monday on the MSNBC show Deadline: White House as Donald Trump spent much of his Labor Day weekend trying to parry criticism over his reportedly contentious 26 August visit to Arlington national cemetery, the burial place of more than 400,000 military veterans and their eligible dependents. The US army accused members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign staff of pushing aside an official who told them it was forbidden to take pictures at the graves of military members who had recently died. Trump III then discussed the episode with the MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, who said it called to mind how the elder Trump once infamously remarked that fallen military members were \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers\u201d, as his former chief of staff John Kelly said. Responding to Wallace, Trump III also alluded to how his uncle would ridicule late Republican US senator John McCain for his time as a prisoner of war while fighting in Vietnam, saying it made him undeserving of being considered a military hero. \u201cThis is a genuine hero \u2013 let\u2019s make no mistake about it,\u201d Trump III said of McCain. \u201cThe fact that Donald called him in essence a \u2018loser\u2019 \u2013 I don\u2019t get it.\u201d Asked why some in the military might continue supporting his uncle, Trump III replied: \u201cI have no idea.\u201d He described giving an interview on a radio show which is broadcast to actively serving military members and telling \u201cthe truth\u201d. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t give a shit about them,\u201d Trump III, 61, added. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t. \u201cDonald believes in Donald.\u201d Monday was definitely not the first time Trump, 78, has been unflatteringly portrayed by his nephew as he prepares to run against the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, in November\u2019s election. In a memoir published in late July, Trump III recounted how his uncle had been banished to military school as a teenager and struggled to lead after rising through the cadets\u2019 ranks. Then, at the start of his New York real estate career, he allegedly delivered a racist outburst punctuated with the N-word while looking over damage to a car of which he was fond. Trump also purportedly counseled his nephew to let his disabled son die and then \u201cmove down\u201d out of state, according to the memoir, titled All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way. The former president\u2019s campaign has denied his nephew\u2019s recollections. Nonetheless, Trump III on Monday reiterated his perception that his uncle believes \u201canyone who is disabled or anyone who he deems lesser than him is a loser\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way he is,\u201d Trump III said. \u201cThat ain\u2019t gonna change.\u201d"

The families of Col Nik Beizer and Sgt Ron Sherman, both 19, and the French-Israeli civilian Elia Toledano, 28, who were abducted by Hamas on 7 October, were informed in the last week by officials from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that a comprehensive inquiry revealed their loved ones had lost their lives as a result of IDF actions. Their bodies were recovered on 14 December from a tunnel in Jabaliya but the most likely cause of death was only recently determined, the military said. \u201cThe findings of the investigation suggest that the three, with high probability, were killed by a byproduct of an IDF airstrike,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThis is a highly probable estimate given all the data, but it is not possible to determine with certainty the circumstances of their death.\u201d The families were initially told the hostages had been killed by Hamas captors and, in January, the IDF rejected Hamas\u2019s assertions that they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. The conclusions of the investigation could add to pressure on the government to strike a deal to bring home the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The mothers of the two soldiers had pressed, since their bodies were discovered, for a full account of how their sons had died. \u201cWe have to find out the truth about everything,\u201d Maayan Sherman, the mother of Sherman, told the Wall Street Journal in May. \u201cEven if the truth is: \u2018We had to kill them.\u2019\u201d The November airstrike was aimed at al-Ghandour, who was taking cover in a tunnel. The IDF\u2019s inquiry at the time concluded that the military was unaware of the presence of hostages in the area during the strike. \u201cAt the time of the strike, the IDF did not have information about the presence of hostages in the targeted compound,\u201d the military said. \u201cFurthermore, there was information suggesting that they were located elsewhere, and thus the area was not designated as one with suspected presence of hostages.\u201d"

            "content": "Ibrahim Aqil, who is reported to have been killed by an airstrike in Beirut on Friday, was one of the last founder members of Hezbollah\u2019s military wing to have survived more than 40 years of conflict with Israel. Aqil, who was in his early 60s, had risen through the ranks and reached a senior position in the organisation. Exact details of his role are unclear, but the Israel Defense Forces described him as \u201cthe head of the Hezbollah terrorist organization\u2019s operations team, the acting commander of the Radwan [special forces] unit\u201d. \u201cHe was one of the really senior old-timers but was never really the face of anything. He was always a number two or number three, but had just been promoted in the last five to 10 years,\u201d said Hussain Abdul-Hussain, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington and an expert on extremism in Lebanon. Aqil was one of a group of young Shia men originally from the south of Lebanon but living in Beirut who were energised by the 1979 Iranian revolution and recruited by the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guards into a network known initially as Islamic Jihad and then later as Hezbollah. Their military aim, guided by their Iranian mentors, was to fight the US, which had despatched a peacekeeping force to Beirut; and Israel, which had occupied much of Lebanon. Their political objective was to turn Lebanon into an Islamic state aligned with Tehran. Almost all have been killed since, probably by Israel. Fuad Shukr was killed in an airstrike in July, almost certainly by Israeli security services working with the IDF. Shukr, who was 63 when he died, was Hezbollah\u2019s chief of staff, and reportedly tasked with obtaining its most powerful weapons. The most prominent member of the original group was Imad Mugniyeh, who was blamed for dozens of lethal attacks on US, Israeli and Jewish targets over 25 years and died in a car-bomb explosion in Damascus in 2008 that was attributed to the Mossad. The US had accused Mugniyeh of playing a central role in the bombings of the US embassy in Beirut in April 1983, which killed 63 people, and the US Marine Corps barracks in October 1983, which killed 241 US personnel. A French barracks was also bombed at that time, killing 58 people. Aqil was also accused of being involved in these operations. A US Justice Department notice describes him as \u201c a principal member of Hizballah\u2019s terrorist cell the Islamic Jihad Organization\u201d, which claimed responsibility for the two 1983 bombings in Beirut. The notice also says Aqil directed the taking of US and German hostages in Lebanon and held them there, also in the 80s. Evidence that Mugniyeh masterminded the two 1983 bombings is thin, however, and it is more likely that he and Aqil played a more minor role, leveraging their deep network of contacts and knowledge of southern Lebanon and Beirut to provide crucial logistical support. \u201cAqil was one of the nucleus of five people around Mugniyeh who were there at the start of the whole Hezbollah military enterprise,\u201d said Abdul-Hussain. Coming so soon after the extraordinary pager explosions which killed 37 people and injured thousands of ordinary Hezbollah operatives, the strike on Aqil suggests a concentrated and urgent Israeli effort to eliminate the organisation\u2019s higher command. Hezbollah will find it hard to replace men such as Shukr and Aqil, and their assassinations are likely to demoralise even committed senior members. Both men were reportedly close to the group\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah."

            "content": "Polina Melnyk and Ihor Tkachov were having breakfast on Tuesday when they heard the whistle of a missile fly low over their Poltava apartment block and, moments later, the sound of two explosions. After working out that the target of the missile had been the military communications institute in the city in east-central Ukraine, far from the war\u2019s frontlines, they jumped in the car and set off to offer their help. Melnyk and Tkachov are volunteer medics, and have worked at army stabilisation positions close to the frontline in recent months, seeing all kinds of terrible injuries. None of that prepared them for the sight they found on arrival at the institute, which had been hit by two missiles, reportedly just as morning roll-call was taking place. The strike would turn out to be one of the deadliest single strikes of the war, and the darkest day in a grim week for Ukraine as Russia continued its terror from the air. Outside the institute, Tkachov saw people loading the wounded into an open-backed truck; when it was filled it set off to the hospital, leaving a trail of blood behind. \u201cPeople were screaming that we need stretchers \u2013 but there were no stretchers,\u201d recalled Tkachov in an interview two days later. On the road outside, people staggered around bloodied and confused, while first responders carried out casualties and laid them out under a row of trees. A man missing an eye let out piercing screams; those who had lost limbs and were bleeding out moaned more quietly. \u201cThe people who were making the most noise weren\u2019t necessarily the ones who needed help fastest,\u201d said Melnyk. The volunteers tried to perform a chaotic triage, saving as many as they could by applying tourniquets before ambulances arrived to rush the patients to hospitals. Many did not make it. As of Friday morning, 55 people were reported dead in the attack, with more than 300 injured. It is not clear if any of the victims were civilians. The institute is a training facility that gives soldiers skills in electronics, cyber-warfare and battlefield communications; its graduates are \u201cthe intellectual elite of the Ukrainian armed forces\u201d, according to a poster on an information stand outside. In the current conditions of all-out war, many soldiers are sent there for a month of training before going back to the front. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said the institute trained Ukrainian soldiers \u201cinvolved in strikes on civilian objects on the territory of the Russian Federation\u201d, and pro-Kremlin Telegram channels rejoiced at the high death toll. Amid the mourning, questions are being asked about why so many people were present at a known military facility. Ukraine\u2019s ground forces command announced an investigation \u201cto determine whether enough was done to protect the lives and health of servicemen\u201d at the institute. Officials have denied claims that morning roll-call was taking place when the strike hit, and say instead that the airstrikes caught people evacuating the building, rushing to the shelter. The attack came seconds after an air-raid alarm sounded, and Ihor Mitsyuk, the head of the training centre, said the facade of the building had collapsed, causing walls to fall down and bury people under the rubble. Strikes on clear military targets often appear to be the exception rather than the norm in Russia\u2019s brutal and ruthless air campaign against Ukraine, with critical energy infrastructure and civilian neighbourhoods frequently targeted. A strike on Wednesday on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv hit a civilian neighbourhood and killed seven people, including children. \u201cThey are trying to stretch our air defences by striking all over the country in quick succession,\u201d said a Ukrainian security source. \u201cAnd by sending in waves of drones and missiles every night, they can make calculations about where the systems are at any given time based on what is shot down and recalibrate accordingly,\u201d the source added. Ukraine has for months been desperately asking for more air defence systems to keep more of the country safe from strikes. While the capital, Kyiv, and many other big cities are well-protected, there are not enough systems to protect all cities at all times. On Friday, the British government announced the transfer of 650 new missile systems to Ukraine to boost its air defences. The first batch, made by th French defence group Thales,is to be sent to Ukraine this year. The UK defence secretary, John Healey, said: \u201cIn recent days, we have seen the tragic cost of Russia\u2019s indiscriminate strikes on Poltava and Lviv \u2026 These new UK-made missiles will support Ukraine to defend its people, infrastructure, and territory.\u201d As well as requests for more air defence equipment, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is engaged in a long-running quest to persuade the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to hit targets deep inside Russia, which Kyiv says would help prevent the Russian air terror at source and minimise the threat to the country. For now, the risk of airstrikes remains acute every night, even in places such as Poltava, where most people were paying little attention to sirens as big attacks are relatively rare. As the week drew to a close, dozens of victims of the onslaught remained seriously injured in hospitals around the city. \u201cThe nurses here see blood and injuries every day, but they were crying when they saw so many young people injured,\u201d said Hrihorii Oksak, 54, the head doctor of one of Poltava\u2019s biggest hospitals, where 70 of the injured were brought on Tuesday morning, and many remain in a critical condition. Evhen and Maksym, both 27, were sharing a room on the neurosurgery ward when the Guardian visited the hospital on Thursday. Maksym worked as an IT technician until earlier this year; he was called up to fight in spring, as part of Ukraine\u2019s mobilisation drive. Evhen, who had been exempted from military service because of a medical condition, signed up anyway two months ago. Both men had been sent to the academy in Poltava for a month of training. By their bedsides, their mothers fussed nervously, having rushed to Poltava from their homes elsewhere in Ukraine when they heard the news. Evhen had been relatively lucky, receiving shrapnel wounds to the face and other minor injuries. Maksym, however, had a serious head injury that doctors said would require two months in hospital and, eventually, a titanium implant to plug a hole in his skull. Oleksandra, Maksym\u2019s mother, said her son was conscious but in unbearable pain and not able to communicate. \u201cI know that he can feel his mum is next to him but I don\u2019t think he understands what happened,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just really hope everything will be all right.\u201d"

            "content": "Israeli forces raided the office of Al Jazeera in the occupied West Bank on Sunday and issued a 45-day closure order, the Qatari broadcaster said, with footage showing heavily armed and masked troops entering the premises in Ramallah. \u201cThere is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,\u201d an Israeli soldier told Al Jazeera\u2019s West Bank bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, the network reported, citing the conversation which was broadcast live. \u201cI ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment,\u201d the soldier said. Al-Omari reported that Israeli troops brought a truck to confiscate documents, devices and office property. The broadcaster said the soldiers did not provide a reason for the closure order. Al Jazeera denounced the raid as \u201ca criminal act\u201d and said in a statement it held the Israeli government responsible for the safety of its journalists. The network added that it would take legal action to protect its rights and promised to continue its coverage. \u201cAl Jazeera rejects the draconian actions, and the unfounded allegations presented by Israeli authorities to justify these illegal raids,\u201d it said. The Israeli communications minister, Shlomo Karhi, confirmed the closure in a statement that called Al Jazeera \u201cthe mouthpiece\u201d of Gaza\u2019s Hamas and Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah. \u201cWe will continue to fight in the enemy channels and ensure the safety of our heroic fighters,\u201d he said. The move is the latest Israeli action against Al Jazeera. Last week, Israel\u2019s government announced it was revoking the press credentials of Al Jazeera journalists in the country, four months after banning the channel from operating inside Israel. In a statement, the Palestinian Journalists\u2019 Syndicate condemned the Israeli move, saying \u201cthis arbitrary military decision is considered a new violation against journalistic and media works, which has been exposing the occupation\u2019s crimes against the Palestinian people. \u201cWe affirm our full solidarity with Al Jazeera and place our headquarters and capabilities at the service of our colleagues working there\u201d. In Hamas-run Gaza, the government media office condemned the move in a statement released on Telegram, Al Jazeera reported, calling it a clear violation of international law. \u201cWe call on all media outlets and journalists around the world to declare full solidarity with Al Jazeera,\u201d it added. The Israeli military has repeatedly accused journalists from the Qatari network of being \u201cterrorist agents\u201d in Gaza affiliated with Hamas or its ally, Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera denies the Israeli government\u2019s accusations and claims that Israel systematically targets its employees in the Gaza Strip. With Agence France-Presse, Associated Press and Reuters"

            "date": "2024-09-25T17:34:25Z",
            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the United Nations that Russia is planning to attack Ukrainian nuclear power plants as he repeated his calls for unity from world leaders in order to force Russia to the negotiating table to conclude a \u201cjust peace\u201d. His comments came as Vladimir Putin on Wednesday escalated his nuclear rhetoric, telling a group of senior officials that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons if it was attacked by any state with conventional weapons. In a speech to the UN general assembly on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader said he had received information that Russia was gathering intelligence on Ukrainian nuclear power plants in preparation for a potential strike. \u201cAny missile or drone strike, any critical incident in the energy system could lead to a nuclear disaster \u2026 a day like that must never come,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an address in the general assembly hall. \u201cAnd Moscow needs to understand this, and this depends in part on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor.\u201d He added: \u201cThese are nuclear power plants, they must be safe.\u201d Zelenskyy also said that the war in Ukraine could threaten the region with instability and the potential for a nuclear catastrophe if Russia went forward with the attacks. \u201cIf, God forbid, Russia causes a nuclear disaster at one of our nuclear power plants, the radiation will not respect state borders,\u201d he said, comparing the consequences to the Chernobyl nuclear accident of 1986. \u201cAnd unfortunately, various nations could feel that devastating effects.\u201d Zelenskyy last month accused Russian forces of starting a fire on the site of the giant Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, with its six Soviet-built reactors, making it Europe\u2019s largest. Russia captured the nuclear plant soon after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the plant has come under repeated attacks that both sides have accused each other of carrying out. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly voiced concerns over the safety of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, calling for \u201cmaximum restraint from all sides\u201d. As Zelenskyy was speaking in New York, Putin addressed Russia\u2019s powerful security council on Wednesday, making his strongest warning yet to the west against allowing Ukraine to launch deep strikes into Russian territory using long-range western missiles. Putin said Russia would consider using nuclear weapons if Moscow gets \u201creliable information about start of mass cross-border attack by air from strategic and tactical aviation, cruise missiles, drones and hypersonic weapons\u201d. The Russian leader added that proposals had been made to change Russia\u2019s nuclear doctrine, and said he would like to underscore one of the proposed key changes. \u201cIt is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation,\u201d Putin said, in a thinly veiled threat to the west as foreign leaders continue to mull whether to allow Ukraine to use their long-range weapons. Putin frequently invoked Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the world\u2019s biggest, in the early days of its invasion of Ukraine, repeatedly pledging to use all means necessary to defend Russia. He later seemed to moderate his rhetoric, but officials close to the Russian president have recently warned Nato countries they risk provoking nuclear war if they were to give the green light for Ukraine to use long-range weapons. Earlier this month, Putin said the west would be directly fighting with Russia if it gave such permission to Ukraine \u2013 and that Russia would be forced to make \u201cappropriate decisions\u201d, without spelling out what those measures could be. Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Washington to present his \u201cvictory plan\u201d to Joe Biden at the White House on Thursday. The plan is a roadmap for Ukraine to end the war on its own terms, and is understood to include significant requests from the US and its allies for additional arms and economic and political support for Ukraine in the long term. The Ukrainian president is expected to meet with Kamala Harris, who is running neck and neck with Donald Trump in the US presidential election. The Republican nominee is not expected to meet with Zelenskyy during the trip, and has threatened to severely cut aid to Ukraine if elected. In campaign rallies this week, Trump reiterated that he would \u201cget out of Ukraine\u201d if elected president. In his speech, Zelenskyy said Ukraine\u2019s peace plan must be supported by world leaders, and that alternative initiatives to hold talks with Putin would simply aid the Russian president. Zelenskyy in particular targeted a joint proposal by China and Brazil, who have proposed a six-point peace plan for the Ukraine war without Kyiv\u2019s backing. \u201cIf someone in the world seeks alternatives \u2026 it likely means they themselves want to do a part of what Putin is doing \u2026 the question arises: what is the true interest?\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cEveryone must understand. You will not boost your power at Ukraine\u2019s expense.\u201d Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s president, had spoken of the plan earlier on Wednesday and Zelenskyy\u2019s remarks appeared targeted at him. \u201cMaybe somebody wants a Nobel prize for their political biography for a frozen truce instead of real peace, but the only prizes Putin will give you in return are more suffering and disasters,\u201d Zelenskyy said. In his speech, Zelensky also criticised the UN security council, saying it was \u201cimpossible to truly and fairly resolve matters of war and peace, because too much depends in the security council on the veto power\u201d. Russia is one of five permanent members of the security council and it exercises a veto power over any decisions taken by the body. Without revealing additional details about the plan, which has been kept largely secret, Zelenskyy indicated it would not be adopted directly through the UN. \u201cWhen the aggressor exercises veto power, the UN is powerless to stop the war,\u201d said Zelenskyy. \u201cBut the peace formula \u2026 there is no veto power in it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the best opportunity for peace.\u201d Russian troops are threatening the Ukrainian road-and-rail hub of Pokrovsk in an onslaught that western officials say are leading to the killing of 1,000 Russian soldiers each day. A Russian-guided bomb strike on Ukraine\u2019s eastern city of Kramatorsk on Wednesday killed at least two people and injured 12 more, including three children, according to the Donetsk region governor, Vadym Filashkin."

            "content": "Western leaders should not be intimidated by Kremlin threats of nuclear escalation, the head of the CIA said on Saturday, amid a debate over whether Anglo-French Storm Shadow missiles should be used inside Russia. Bill Burns, on a visit to London alongside the head of MI6, said the US had brushed off a previous Russian nuclear scare in autumn 2022, demonstrating that threats from Moscow should not always be taken literally. \u201cPutin\u2019s a bully. He\u2019s going to continue to sabre rattle from time to time,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWe cannot afford to be intimidated by that sabre rattling \u2026 we got to be mindful of it. The US has provided enormous support for Ukraine, and I\u2019m sure the president will consider other ways in which we can support them.\u201d The CIA director also said the US was working very hard on fresh proposals for a ceasefire in Gaza with new \u201ctexts and creative formulas\u201d. A new plan, being devised with the help of mediators from Qatar and Egypt, would emerge, he hoped, \u201cin the next several days\u201d. However, it was unclear, Burns added, whether Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and the Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar were willing to strike a deal. It was a question of political will, he said: \u201cWhether or not leaders on both sides recognise that enough is enough and that the time has come to finally make some hard choices.\u201d Israel had succeeded in \u201cseverely degrading\u201d Hamas\u2019s military capabilities over the past 11 months, Burns said, but had not eliminated the movement in a war that had created a severe humanitarian crisis. \u201cIt is also a movement and an idea,\u201d the spy chief said, and you could only \u201ckill an idea with a better idea\u201d, meaning there needed to be some long-term hope for Palestinians. On Ukraine, the veteran spy chief was asked whether there was too much nervousness in Washington and other western capitals about the risk of escalating the war by giving permission for Storm Shadow, a missile with a range of at least 190 miles, to be used inside Russia. \u201cNone of us should take lightly the risks of escalation,\u201d Burns told an audience at a Financial Times event in London \u2013 and said there had actually been a belief within the CIA that Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine in the first year of the war. \u201cThere was a moment in the fall [autumn] of 2022 when I think there was a genuine risk of potential use of tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d by Russia in Ukraine, Burns said, but he believed such concerns should not be taken too seriously. \u201cI never thought \u2026 we should be unnecessarily intimidated by that,\u201d he added. At the time, Russian troops had been pushed back in northern Ukraine and had abandoned Kherson in the south, prompting a belief that Russia might seek to use a nuclear weapon if a rout developed. In any event, the frontline stabilised shortly afterwards. Burns said that Joe Biden, the US president, had sent him to pass on a direct warning to Sergey Naryshkin, the head of the Russian foreign intelligence service, at a meeting in Turkey in November 2022 \u201cto make very clear what the consequences of that kind of escalation would be\u201d \u2013 and that a similar approach was in place today. So far, the White House has been notably hesitant about allowing the use of Storm Shadow and other long-range missiles inside Russia, such as the US-made Atacms, despite repeated pleas from Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, including one made on Friday. Burns voiced concern that Iran was considering whether to supply ballistic missiles to Russia, but would not confirm whether the CIA believed it had done so. It would be a \u201cdramatic escalation\u201d of the relationship between the two countries; Tehran so far has supplied only less effective drones for Russia to use in Ukraine. Burns and his British counterpart, the MI6 chief, Sir Richard Moore, had never appeared in public together before the surprise appearance at the event at London\u2019s Kenwood House in Hampstead. Tight security meant that audience members were told only 15 minutes in advance who would be appearing. Moore said there were concerns that Russian spies were becoming increasingly reckless in the UK, Europe and elsewhere as the war in Ukraine continues. \u201cI think Russian intelligence services have gone a bit feral, frankly,\u201d the British spy chief said, as shown by a spate of arson attacks in the UK and elsewhere in Europe."

Both support the current building of Hinkley Point C in Somerset, the planned Sizewell C station in Suffolk, an unspecified number of small modular reactors all over Britain as well as the far-off dream of nuclear fusion. However, few scientists serious about the threat of the climate crisis believe new nuclear power stations are part of the solution in reducing carbon output. Building them is too slow and costly, while solar and wind are quicker and cheaper in making a dent in fossil fuel consumption and eliminating it. While supporting nuclear expansion seems to be politically expedient, the reality on the ground appears to be different. As the 2024 World Nuclear Status report published this month points out, if Britain gets anywhere near its plan to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030, it will be producing more electricity from these sources than the country consumes. The experts also say if Rolls-Royce\u2019s \u201cheroic assumption\u201d of the cost of electricity from small modular reactors was correct, any planned construction of large stations would immediately be abandoned."

            "content": "One of the least considered hazards of climate change is the increasing frequency of hailstorms and the size and the impact of the pieces of ice they produce. This, in turn, threatens one of the most promising solutions to the climate crisis: solar farms. In the last year, the number of hailstorms in Europe exceeded 10,000 and the size of large hailstones reported from Italy and Germany increased to 10cm (4in) \u2013 enough to dent a car, smash greenhouses and break a solar panel. The frequency of storms and the size of the hail is increasing. In Texas, where hailstones come even bigger, baseball-sized holes have been knocked in solar panels, causing large-scale damage. Maintenance of solar panels is minimal, as they have no moving parts, but the threat of hail may cause that to change. Insurance companies are prepared to offer hail cover to solar farms, but only on condition that the panels have a mechanism that can turn them at least 70 degrees to the ground so hail will only strike a glancing blow. Some newer farms that had already planned a system to turn the panels towards the sun as the day progresses are modifying their operation so panels can be rendered almost upright if a hail warning is issued."

The comments marked Russia\u2019s strongest warning yet to the west against allowing Ukraine to launch deep strikes into Russian territory using long-range western missiles. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has been asking for months for permission to use British Storm Shadow missiles and US-made Atacms missiles to hit targets deeper inside Russia. Putin said that Russia would consider using nuclear weapons if Moscow received \u201creliable information\u201d about the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft or drones against it. Putin also warned that a nuclear power supporting another country\u2019s attack on Russia would be considered a participant in aggression, issuing a thinly veiled threat to the west as foreign leaders continue to mull whether to allow Ukraine to use long-range weapons. Putin said the clarifications were carefully calibrated and commensurate with the modern military threats facing Russia. \u201cWe see the modern military and political situation is dynamically changing and we must take this into consideration. Including the emergence of new sources of military threats and risks for Russia and our allies,\u201d he said. Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, dismissed the new nuclear doctrine, saying: \u201cRussia no longer has any instruments to intimidate the world apart from nuclear blackmail. These instruments will not work.\u201d Several influential foreign policy hawks have previously pressed Putin to adopt a more assertive nuclear posture towards the west, lowering its threshold for using nuclear weapons in order to deter the west against providing more direct military support to Ukraine. The current doctrine was set out by Putin in June 2020 in a six-page decree. In the early days of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin frequently invoked Moscow\u2019s nuclear arsenal, the world\u2019s biggest, repeatedly pledging to use all means necessary to defend Russia.

The government, which includes the far-right Finns party and is led by the conservative National Coalition party leader, Petteri Orpo, has proposed reversing a 2023 law that enables undocumented migrants to access full healthcare, arguing it is aligned with plans to cut spending and immigration. But the Finnish medical association has argued against the plans, which it said were \u201cvery problematic and damaging in many ways\u201d. Although there would be some exemptions \u2013 including children, people whose health is classified as \u201cextremely vulnerable\u201d and people with disabilities \u2013 doctors warn the impact of the new restrictions could be life-threatening, as people with conditions such as diabetes or asthma could be left without treatment. Aino Tuomi-Nikula, an adviser for Physicians for Social Responsibility, said: \u201cThose who tabled this proposal pretend that we don\u2019t have enough money for everyone and that full access to healthcare would invite more people to Finland. We know this is not true, and that it\u2019s actually cheaper to treat conditions in advance by primary healthcare than leaving them to emergency care. This measure is a political stunt to crack down on marginalised people and bank on public fear of migrants.\u201d Louise Bonneau, an advocacy officer for the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants, said: \u201cHealthcare is a basic human right, not a privilege reserved for some. This law, if passed, would lead to suffering and betray Finland\u2019s commitment to equality and justice. It must be rejected.\u201d Physicians for Social Responsibility have said the amendment would have a negative impact on undocumented people\u2019s health, \u201cincrease human suffering\u201d and was likely to ultimately increase healthcare costs. \u201cDoctors and nurses must be able to do their work ethically and sustainably, and the operation of healthcare units should not be made even more difficult,\u201d they said in a statement to the government. The proposal, which was strongly backed by the Finns party, had been scheduled to be presented to parliament next week.

            "content": "As unbelievable life trajectories go, British private school outcast to South American cowboy to US primetime TV naturalist to American healthcare saviour must be up there with the weirder ones. The late philanthropist Stan Brock singlehandedly disproves the old F Scott Fitzgerald dictate about American second acts by \u2013 starting in 1985 \u2013 supplying free medical treatment to millions of uninsured people through his non-profit Remote Area Medical (RAM). Related in this documentary with flashes of Boy\u2019s Own brio, this flip into altruism is all the more remarkable in light of Brock\u2019s borderline-abusive upbringing that pushed him as a young man into a stony self-reliance. Even in his 70s and ushering in-need citizens into RAM\u2019s mobile clinics, Brock still cuts a strapping, athletic figure. In his heyday, droving on the world\u2019s largest cattle ranch and wrestling anacondas on the savannah of then-British Guiana, he looks like something out of an H Rider Haggard novel. This was the brawny package that made for TV gold as a co-host for 1960s series Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom and, briefly, an action movie star in schlock such as 1976\u2019s Escape from Angola. But haunted by the death of a fellow cowboy from influenza while on the trail, Brock belatedly began feeling guilty for how little he had done for his Rupununi indigenous saddlemates. So in the 1980s, he formed RAM, initially to bring healthcare to rural Mexico, and then to start on the deprivation visible everywhere in the organisation\u2019s home state of Tennessee. Brock continually protests he doesn\u2019t have the social skills to make a natural frontman for the organisation. It is precisely this gaucheness, though, that lends him a disarming and faintly saintly air, as he points out the absurdity that prevents US healthcare practitioners from crossing state lines to provide free treatment. Director Paul Michael Angell has undoubtedly hit the documentary mother lode with this ascetic figure, who sleeps on a roll-up mattress in RAM\u2019s office. But his story is so compelling, it means Angell recounts the myth without quite probing the somewhat mysterious Brock into more illuminating personal areas. You suspect the latter suffered the intrusion of the film for the publicity it would bring the cause. But, judging by the desperate gratitude shown by so many patients here, if this film is finally PR, it is of the inarguable kind. \u2022 Medicine Man: The Stan Brock Story is on digital platforms from 1 October"

            "date": "2024-09-12T12:39:10Z",
            "content": "Spire Healthcare, one of the UK\u2019s biggest private hospital groups, has reported a jump in revenues and profits as it carries out more work for the NHS and benefits from a surge in the take-up of private insurance among working-age people. The FTSE 250-listed company, which runs 39 hospitals and more than 50 clinics, said its work with the NHS increased in the first half of the year, as the health service outsourced more procedures to the private sector and patients exercised the right to choose where they receive treatment. \u201cSpire stands ready to work with the new government to help address NHS waiting lists,\u201d said Justin Ash, the Spire chief executive. \u201cWaiting lists would be a lot longer if we weren\u2019t doing what we do.\u201d The NHS waiting list was 7.62m cases in June, with 3.13 million of these patients waiting more than 18 weeks. The median waiting time for treatment was 14.3 weeks, almost double the pre-pandemic wait of 7.5 weeks in June 2019. A review by Lord Ara Darzi, commissioned by Labour when the party came to power in July, found that years of neglect of the NHS by previous governments have led to long delays for hospital, GP and mental health services, resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths and rupturing the \u201csocial contract between the NHS and the people\u201d. Keir Starmer set out his vision for the health service on Thursday, saying it would get \u201cno more money without reform\u201d. Ash said: \u201cWe are working with ICBs [integrated care boards] and trusts specifically at the moment to help them bring down waiting lists for those who have been waiting 65 weeks.\u201d Spire has a partnership with Sussex ICB, responsible for planning health services for its local population. Long NHS waiting times are prompting more people to go private and take out health insurance. While bigger employers have long offered discounted insurance as a benefit to their staff, more small and medium-sized firms are now following suit. Spire carries out workplace health MOTs, and has invested in its mental health and physiotherapy services. Ash said more people under 35 were opting for private health insurance, either through their workplace or individually, while there had been a decline in the number of people who paid for private treatments themselves, except among the over-65s. The hospital group has seen rising demand for orthopaedics such as hip and knee replacements, mental health treatments \u2013 talking therapies for anxiety and depression \u2013 and cancer surgery and chemotherapy. NHS cancer targets continue to be missed. The percentage of patients receiving their first cancer treatment within two months was 67.4%, the latest data showed, far below the 85% target. Spire\u2019s pre-tax profit rose by 11.8% to \u00a322.7m in the first six months of the year, while revenues climbed by 12.7% to \u00a3762.5m. It expects underlying annual profits to be between \u00a3255 and \u00a3275m this year, after notching up \u00a3130.6m in the first half. Its work for the NHS made up a quarter of revenues. The firm said hospital admissions and outpatient procedures were broadly flat at 225,659. The average revenue per case rose by 4.7% to \u00a33,495. It invested \u00a351.5m in technology such as robots for orthopaedics and cancer surgery, as well as MRI machines powered by artificial intelligence, which reduce the time it takes to scan a body part like a knee from 25 minutes to seven minutes. Spire plans to open 10 new clinics in the coming years, including a second one in Harrogate later this year, and one recently opened in Abergele, north Wales."

            "date": "2024-09-21T15:00:43Z",
            "content": "Like many professional scribblers, I sometimes have to write not in a hushed study or library, but in noisy environments. So years ago I bought a set of Apple AirPods Pro, neat little gadgets that have a limited degree of noise-cancelling ability. They\u2019re not as effective as the clunky (and pricey) headphones that seasoned transcontinental airline passengers need, but they\u2019re much lighter and less obtrusive. And they have a button that enables you to switch off the noise cancellation and hear what\u2019s going on around you. I remember wondering once if a version of them could also function as hearing aids, given the right software. But then dismissed the thought: after all, hearing aids are expensive, specialised devices that are often prescribed by audiologists \u2013 and also signal to the world at large that you are hard of hearing. But guess what? On 12 September, I open my laptop, click on the Verge website and find the headline: \u201cApple gets FDA authorisation to turn the AirPods Pro into hearing aids.\u201d The new generation of the headphones will be able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids later this autumn. More importantly, they can be bought over the counter (OTC in the lingo of the healthcare industry) and they will sell for $249 in the US (and \u00a3229 in the UK). Compare that with the prices of hearing aids sold by, say, Specsavers, which start at \u00a3495 and go all the way to \u00a32,995 for the Phonak Infinio Sphere 90. Now of course price comparisons can be misleading. Vendors of conventional hearing aids will stress that customers get the undivided attention of an audiologist etc. And for customers with severe hearing difficulties, that\u2019s fine. But for people with \u201cmild to moderate hearing impairment\u201d, even the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has concluded that the customisation software provided by Apple will be adequate. It works like this. You take an on-demand hearing test on your iPhone\u2019s health app, which causes the earbuds to ping each ear with different frequencies at varying volumes. You tap the phone screen if you hear the sound. After a few minutes, the app will generate an audiogram that graphs your hearing deficits and this audiogram can then be used to program the AirPods Pro as hearing aids. Alternatively, you can upload an existing audiogram if you\u2019ve had one generated by an audiologist. Neat, eh? And also a nice example of engineering ingenuity. But, as with most things, the technology is only part of the story. The healthcare industry in the US is tightly controlled by the FDA, which insisted for years that any device that goes into a human ear needs a prescription. As Matt Stoller, an antitrust expert and campaigner, points out, since 1993, campaigners have been calling for the FDA to loosen its stance on these devices and the calls got louder over the years. In 2015, the president\u2019s council of advisers on science and technology issued a report seeking to make these devices more widely available. The next year, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine issued a similar report. But eventually, in 2017, Congress passed the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act, proposed by senators Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Grassley and requiring the FDA to allow hearing aids without a prescription \u2013 and Donald Trump signed it! The act imposed a deadline of 2020 on the FDA, but the agency continually prevaricated until 2022, after the Biden administration compelled it to act with an executive order. Only then did the dam that had been building up since 1993 break. The moral of this story, in Stoller\u2019s words, is simple: \u201cHow we deploy technology is not a function of engineering and science as much as it is how those interplay with law, in this case a law that fostered a hearing aid cartel and then a different law that broke it apart. So it\u2019s not outlandish to say that Joe Biden designed Apple\u2019s new hearing aid AirPods, with an assist from Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Grassley and Donald Trump. It\u2019s just what happened.\u201d This is perhaps a bit hyperbolic, but it captures an essential truth that Silicon Valley would prefer to ignore: technology does not exist in a vacuum, and the ways it is deployed and developed are shaped by social and political forces. Social media companies escape liability because of a 26-word clause in a 1996 law, for example. And millions of people in the US suffering from hearing impairment could have had hearing aids at affordable prices at least a decade ago. The problem was not that the technology didn\u2019t exist, but that it wasn\u2019t in the interest of the healthcare-regulatory establishment to make it available. What I\u2019ve been reading Bad press Jeff Jarvis, the veteran journalist and City University of New York emeritus professor, has an insightful analysis on his blog titled What\u2019s become of The Times &amp; Co? about why US mainstream media has gone wrong.

            "title": "Sick and suicidal children held in Queensland police watch houses for weeks without healthcare, watchdog reveals",
            "date": "2024-09-11T02:04:57Z",
            "content": "Sick and suicidal children are being held in Queensland police watch houses for weeks without receiving any medical or psychological care, according to a new report from the state\u2019s youth detention watchdog that warns of \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d. The report, tabled on Wednesday by the Queensland inspector of detention services, Anthony Reilly, followed inspections of watch houses at Cairns and Murgon. The conclusion was blunt: these places were \u201cnot suitable for detaining children\u201d. The report documents many of the issues raised in reports by Guardian Australia since January, including a series of videos and stories which revealed the distressing treatment of children in Queensland police custody, many of them disabled, and some left screaming, freezing, and struggling to breathe in isolation cells. Queensland\u2019s youth justice policies have resulted in record numbers of children in the detention system. Last year the state government suspended its own Human Rights Act to allow children to be kept for extended periods in police watch houses. Reilly\u2019s report found that facilities at Cairns and Murgon were not suitable for the extended detention of children. He documented several case studies, including Sam*, a 13-year-old girl with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder who was depicted in CCTV footage published by Guardian Australia and SBS The Feed. In another case, a child in Cairns disclosed to police after their arrest that they had attempted to cut their throat during the past two days. The child was held in the watch house for 17 days and during that time \u201cthere was no evidence of any referrals or assessment by any external mental health service provider\u201d. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email Another child, admitted to Cairns, told police they had consumed methamphetamine, had a chest infection, and had recently attempted to self-harm, including a suicide attempt while in custody. The child did not see a nurse for the chest infection for eight days, by which time they had \u201csore ribs, a blocked nose, fever and stomach cramps\u201d. \u201cWhen their condition had not improved by day 13, the nurse administered medication,\u201d the report found. There was no record of the child being administered medication for a neurological condition. Over 18 days, the child was involved in four \u201cincidents\u201d, including a serious alleged assault on another child and a watch house officer. \u201cProlonged detention of children in this type of environment can significantly affect [children\u2019s] wellbeing,\u201d the report said. \u201cWe are concerned that self-harm/suicide risks or significant health and medical issues may not be identified through the admission process. This would leave a child, who may subsequently spend many days or even weeks detained in the watch-house, with unaddressed risks or medical needs. The consequences could be catastrophic. \u201cFailing to identify significant cognitive issues may expose very vulnerable children to harm, for example, from those with whom they share a cell. \u201cThe failure to identify a serious self-harm risk may also have dire consequences. We are also concerned that Youth Justice prioritisation decisions for admission to a youth detention centre are being made with incomplete or incorrect information.\u201d At Murgon, the inspection identified a child who was effectively in isolation for 12 days straight, as they were the only child in the watch house during this period. The report said children who are placed in isolation, or in padded cells, are not protected by the same safeguards as those in youth detention centres or adult prisons. Officers can isolate children without any overarching approval process; there is no reporting or oversight of the use of isolation in watch houses and no requirement for a child to be assessed by a health practitioner before or after. The inspection assessed the physical environment in both Cairns and Murgon. In Cairns there was a lack of natural light, children \u201clocked in their cells for substantial periods of time\u201d, overcrowding and a lack of privacy. In Murgon, children had \u201cabsolutely no access to fresh air during the period of detention\u201d. In some cases, the separation of children from adults \u2013 required under police procedures and international human rights law obligations \u2013 was not occurring effectively. Boys and girls had been held in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s units at Cairns. \u201cWe are concerned that it provides an opportunity for an adult detainee to communicate with a child,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis could mean verbal abuse, threats or other inappropriate communication. \u201cIn the Cairns watch-house, we saw children using their mattresses to surround themselves in an attempt to get privacy when using the toilet. We were advised that this is a common practice, and that children do the same at Murgon. \u201cThe shower area has no door.\u201d The report said the facilities were inadequate for children, but acknowledge that due to state policies it was likely that the practice of keeping young people in watch houses would continue. \u201cBased on the information in this report, it is clear that the detention of children in watch-houses creates the risk of harm and that it should be avoided. If detained in a watch-house, children should be held for the minimum time possible, and transferred to a more suitable facility as soon as possible.

            "content": "Weaker demand for termite extermination services sent shares in Rentokil Initial crashing by 19% after the pest control company warned of lower profits caused by a slowdown in North America. The FTSE 100 company, which became the biggest pest control company in the world in 2021 with a $6.7bn (\u00a35.14bn) takeover of US rival Terminix, warned that adjusted profits were likely to be below \u00a3700m \u2013 short of the \u00a3776m expected by analysts. Revenue growth in North America was now expected to be about 1% in the second half of 2024. The profit warning sent its shares, which reached 615.4p last September, tumbling by 19% to 386.4p. Rentokil said it had over-resourced its sales and service operations in North America, which now account for half of its sales after the Terminix deal. However, the division had experienced lower-than-expected sales leads and growth over the peak summer season. Earlier this year the company launched a new \u201cTerminix It\u201d advertising campaign, but Andrew Ransom, the chief executive, told analysts that its termite business had been weaker than expected. \u201cWithin residential, commercial, termite and more broad based, the weaker of the three has been termite for us. I don\u2019t think there is a particular story there; we need to improve our termite performance,\u201d he said. Termites that damage wood and timber in buildings are a growing problem in the US, where there are more than 50 termite species that collectively cause $2bn in subterranean damage each year, according to Rentokil. The profit warning will add to growing pressure on the company, in which activist investor Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian Partners built up a stake in June. There were reports in July that Philip Jansen, a former BT chief executive, was mulling a potential bid for Rentokil as it struggled to deliver benefits from the North American acquisition. Rentokil said in the update that it continued to believe in the fundamental strength of its North America business, where the US makes up more than half of the global pest control market."

            "date": "2024-09-30T12:18:03Z",
            "content": "Police in Milan have arrested 19 people as part of an operation against hardcore \u201cultra\u201d football fans, most of whom were accused of having links to the mafia. Among those arrested were Luca Lucci and Renato Bosetti, leaders of the AC Milan and Inter Milan ultras respectively. Lucci, who was previously convicted on drug charges, was photographed shaking hands with Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, in 2018. Salvini is deputy prime minister and transport minister in Giorgia Meloni\u2019s far-right government. The investigation began after the murder of Antonio Bellocco, a powerful member of the \u2019Ndrangheta crime syndicate, in early September. Bellocco was killed during a fight outside a Milan boxing gym, allegedly by Andrea Beretta, one of Bosetti\u2019s predecessors. Beretta had a leading role in the Inter Milan ultras, known as the Curva Nord, after the career criminal Vittorio Boiocchi was shot dead outside his home in October 2022. Italy\u2019s finance police said the charges included \u201ccriminal conspiracy aggravated by mafia methods, extortion, assault and other serious crimes\u201d. Bellocco\u2019s murder heightened suspicions over the growing connection between mafia clans and ultras operating in Milan\u2019s San Siro stadium. Marco Ferdico, a close associate of Bellocco, was also arrested, as were Alex Cologno and Christian Rosiello, who were described by the Italian press as being \u201cfriends and bodyguards\u201d of the high-profile rapper Fedez. The alleged crimes include ticket touting; forced \u201cpizzo\u201d payments, or protection money, from the sellers of food and drink outside the stadium, or in return for car park spaces; and grievous bodily harm. The Milan prosecutor Marcello Viola, quoted by the Ansa news agency, said it was \u201ca complex investigation\u201d brought together by various branches of Italy\u2019s state police. He also said Milan police had banned numerous others from accessing \u201cplaces where sporting events take place\u201d. He described illicit economic activities at the San Siro stadium as being \u201cbeyond control\u201d and that this was partly due to the \u201cshortcomings\u201d in the management of fan relations. AC Milan and Inter Milan are two of Italy\u2019s most prominent football clubs. Supporters of the two teams made a \u201cnon-belligerence\u201d agreement in 1981 after the death of a 21-year-old fan. But police said the pact turned into a business deal aimed at \u201cmaking profits\u201d and jointly infiltrating \u201cevery possible profitable aspect of football\u201d. Ultras tend to be well-organised, extremely violent and racist. Ultra leaders reportedly earn thousands of euros a month in illegal activities."

            "content": "All relationships take work to help them function healthily \u2013 but what can you do when bonds urgently need repairing? Here\u2019s advice from therapists on how to build better connections with everyone in your life, from your mother to your manager. Communication is key Joanna Harrison is a couples therapist who has a private clinic and works for Tavistock Relationships. \u201cOften what I see as problems brewing are resentments that come up,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will find their way to communicate themselves, even in the most domestic things.\u201d Harrison has just had an argument with her partner about shoe polishing: \u201cIt was so not about shoes,\u201d she laughs. One way to tackle this is by getting curious about each other\u2019s mental load, she suggests, as a lot of people feel they\u2019ve got responsibility for something in the relationship that their partner doesn\u2019t acknowledge or isn\u2019t grateful for. \u201cWhether it is to do with parenting, financial concerns or just thinking about the relationship, if those things aren\u2019t recognised by a partner, that really builds up resentment.\u201d Make time to talk As a former divorce lawyer, Harrison brings a unique perspective to the therapy room. If splitting up is inevitable, Harrison helps to navigate it in \u201ca more considered way\u201d, but to avoid getting to this point, she says the first step is carving out time to talk about your problems. \u201cWe all get so busy, and time to talk about a relationship is often spontaneous, which can mean conflict,\u201d she says. Instead, set aside time to check in with each other, especially if things feel difficult. \u201cI think that is why people come to therapy, to ringfence time and space to be reflective about what is going on.\u201d Listen to and acknowledge the other person\u2019s feelings \u201cPeople think that if they come to therapy we are going to come up with some magic solution to their problems,\u201d says Harrison. \u201cWhat actually happens is that people feel acknowledged for their feelings and their points of view. People in relationships don\u2019t have to agree with each other for it to work, but if they don\u2019t acknowledge that the other person has an opinion, then it\u2019s a constant battle. You don\u2019t need to agree who is right. You need to show recognition of where the other one is coming from.\u201d One technique Harrison encourages is for each person to say how they are feeling and for the other one to repeat this back, to show that it has been acknowledged. Be yourself within relationships \u201cThe biggest problem I find that brings people to my therapy office is they edit themselves,\u201d says Andrew G Marshall, a marital therapist, author of more than 20 books and host of the podcast The Meaningful Life. \u201cSometimes it might not be worth having a fight about how often you clean the toilet, or perhaps it helps to live more peacefully together if you swallow some of your irritation about how your partner hums when they are walking around the apartment. But there comes a point where, if you are editing your feelings so as not to upset somebody, or because every time you do try to bring your feelings out you get stamped on, you become less and less of yourself. Or over time, you begin to become a person that your partner doesn\u2019t know. You think they\u2019re not really going to care about your new interest in meditation, for example, and so you don\u2019t talk to them about it, and you\u2019re actually moving away from them. Don\u2019t edit.\u201d Report rather than act out any issues Reporting, Marshall explains, is when you say, \u201c\u2018I am annoyed when you walk around humming\u2019. You are not saying \u2018I\u2019m annoyed with you all the time\u2019, rather \u2018I\u2019m just annoyed with you about this\u2019.\u201d This is important because they might be guessing the wrong thing is winding you up unless you tell them. Acting out, he says, \u201cis when you don\u2019t speak about all of this, but it just drives you up the wall, until finally the dam breaks, and then you snap at them about the humming. It is never going to go well when you\u2019re doing it from a moment of anger or frustration.\u201d Embrace arguing (occasionally) Harrison knows all about this, having written a book called Five Arguments All Couples (Need to) Have. \u201cConflict has an amazing potential to bring people closer,\u201d she says, because issues can be raised that need attention. \u201cThey are the things that each person in a relationship cares about, if they\u2019re arguing about it. It\u2019s usually not during the argument that the good stuff comes, but it might be afterwards when perhaps someone has understood something a bit better. You can then revisit the argument and say: \u2018What was that really all about?\u2019 Then suddenly you might have access to these layers of the real thing that was going on, and there is potential for greater intimacy.\u201d Lower your expectations of others \u201cThe thing that gets in the way of us having good relationships with any family member is our expectations of them,\u201d says psychotherapist Philippa Perry, who is an Observer advice columnist and author of the bestselling The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read (And Your Children Will Be Glad That You Did). This is a particular stumbling block when it comes to some sibling relationships, she says, where people tend to think: you were brought up in the same family, so why don\u2019t you think and feel like I do? With parents, we know they have had different experiences to us, says Perry, but this can still cause friction. \u201cThey come from a time before we were born that we don\u2019t know about, and that has shaped them and given them experiences and beliefs that possibly we don\u2019t share. You\u2019ve got to imagine where they\u2019re coming from with what they\u2019re telling you, and they haven\u2019t realised that the world has changed.\u201d This can be easier said than done in the heat of the moment, says Perry: \u201cDon\u2019t have expectations that people will be other than who they are \u2026 If your mother is 100% Mrs Critical, that is who she is. Don\u2019t expect her to suddenly be a glass half-full-person. Her previous experiences have taught her that it feels safe to think the worst of everything and everyone, and we need to have a bit of compassion for that.\u201d Hurtful comments can come from a place of love \u201cIf I was to say to my parents, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to write a book,\u2019 they might say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s terribly difficult\u2019,\u201d says Perry. \u201cIt is like they are passing their fear of failure on to you. But they are also trying to protect you. You have to remember they are coming from a place of love, even if it doesn\u2019t sound like that sometimes.\u201d If you aren\u2019t close to family, don\u2019t force it \u201cIn all the best relationships,\u201d says Perry, \u201cthere is mutual impact and we change each other all the time. That is the key to a close relationship. But if your parents aren\u2019t good at allowing influence, you\u2019re not going to be close, unless you think like they do about everything.\u201d You don\u2019t need to worry too much about this, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say that you have to be joined at the hip. If you don\u2019t feel particularly close to your parents, and you dread going to see them, then you might want to consider seeing them less, rather than thinking you have to put yourself through it.\u201d Although, you may risk being cut out of the will, she says. Say sorry when necessary In Perry\u2019s book, she advises apologising to children when you lose your temper or get stuff wrong. Being able to say sorry when you\u2019ve acted badly is key to any functioning relationship and yet it is something that many of us avoid. \u201cIt does not annihilate you to say, \u2018I reacted badly to that. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 When we model that behaviour, we get it back,\u201d she says. Accept that relationships with children often aren\u2019t what we hoped for Being a parent \u201cis a really strange role\u201d, says Dr Emma Svanberg, a clinical psychologist who provides therapy at The Psychology Co-operative and is author of Parenting for Humans: How to Parent the Child You Have, As the Person You Are. \u201cSimultaneously, we are expected to put that role above all else, while not bringing it into the other roles in our lives. And all of this in a context where parenting is lauded and not supported.\u201d This runs alongside the sometimes difficult task of accepting the child you have: \u201cThere may be times where we might not like aspects of their behaviour or personality, and we might also have moments of hating them. Ambivalence is a part of parenting \u2013 we might have moments of love as well as hate; joy as well as grief. Sometimes all at the same time. Accepting these emotions can allow us more space to see our children as who they are.\u201d When faced with really challenging behaviour, look back It can be overwhelming looking for answers among the innumerable parenting strategies and styles out there. When times are really tough, Svanberg says, \u201clook back on things that remind you that this is a sacred relationship. Look at a sonogram and remember all the things you felt when you knew you were going to become a parent to this child, or look at baby photos and notice the unique things that have always been present in your child. This can help us to zoom out of tricky moments, remember the essence of who this person is, and help us refocus on the relationship we want to build.\u201d Reboot yourself before you try to reboot a relationship After an argument with a child, before you even try to make amends, \u201cconnecting with yourself first can help,\u201d says Svanberg, \u201cso you\u2019re feeling grounded, energised and robust rather than run ragged and in need of the \u2018fix\u2019. This means you\u2019ve prepared yourself to be able to hold whatever emotions they might have about the disconnection, without your own getting in the way.\u201d Having a break from the parenting role, where possible, is crucial too. Schedule planning meetings Svanberg explains there is often the potential for friction over family logistics, especially as children get older and need running around all over the place, along with having a growing need for power and autonomy. So the perfect solution is to have a family meeting. \u201cI often suggest having a weekly meeting,\u201d says Svanberg, \u201cwhere you can go through what needs to happen in the week. Your kids can be involved in this too. There are really helpful tools now to help you figure out who does what. This is, to me, an essential part of co-parenting as we hear from so many parents who are stressed and resentful due to inequity in the household and this can have a profound impact on relationships in the family.\u201d Don\u2019t expect problems to be resolved quickly \u201cBecause most people don\u2019t like conflict,\u201d says Marshall, \u201cwe want to try to get it over and done with and out the door as quickly as possible. So we have a 15-minute conversation, whereas the real issues that couples have problems with \u2013 she earns more than he does, or he doesn\u2019t like her mother \u2013 are going to take some time to find a way through. So the expectation you are going to solve them quickly and easily is the wrong one. Give yourself time. You can come back to it over and over again.\u201d Avoid fighting over who is right or wrong \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for almost 40 years,\u201d says Marshall, \u201cand I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve listened to people having an \u2018I\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong\u2019 argument\u201d. Nobody has ever solved anything this way, he says. \u201cAll that happens is somebody will throw something else in, or they\u2019ll find an example of the one time the other person was wrong. And we just go round and round in circles. However much you believe that your views are right, your partner believes just as much that their beliefs are right, too. You need to understand the position of each other better; then you can both soften and a third way will emerge. \u2018I\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong\u2019 battles destroy relationships.\u201d Work out what you can change yourself \u201cIt is easy to come up with 100 reasons why your partner should change, and much harder to come up with one about why you should,\u201d says Marshall. \u201cMy number one question to people is: what could you do differently? Because you know that is within your grasp. The 100 things your partner could do differently are not.\u201d Consider whether friendships are worth salvaging Friendships are perhaps one of the most important relationships of all, says Sam Owen, a relationship coach, psychologist and author of Happy Relationships: \u201cEven just one supportive friendship can boost our resilience, wellbeing and happiness, and decrease stress, anxiety and loneliness.\u201d How can you reconnect with someone if you feel like you are drifting? First, says Owen, \u201cyou must be sure you haven\u2019t grown apart with good reason \u2013 for example, that it wasn\u2019t because you realised, albeit subconsciously, that this relationship was no longer right for you. If you know that you absolutely want this friend back in your life, then plan what you are going to say before texting or calling so that you feel calm and clear-headed rather than apprehensive and unsure. Arrange to speak over the phone or meet up so that you can actually begin the process of rebuilding the relationship; text messages back and forth won\u2019t provide that opportunity. Pick something you both enjoy doing so that it\u2019s an environment conducive to connecting and growing. \u201cIf you need to address anything to remove the awkwardness, address it head on, compassionately and respectfully, fully owning anything you need to apologise for, even if just the lack of effort you\u2019ve made with them, and explain why, so that they know you are not merely communicating hollow sentiments,\u201d Owen says. \u201cProactively make ongoing plans with them so that you can keep rebuilding. And pay mindful attention to the signals you\u2019re receiving back so that if the effort they put in along the way is not mutual, then you know whether or not you still want to keep trying to rekindle the friendship.\u201d In the workplace, treat others as you wish to be treated How can you go about fostering better relationships with those at work, from colleagues to your line manager? \u201cUnderstand that you can be compassionate with others even if you don\u2019t want to be best friends with them,\u201d advises Owen. \u201cThat can mean giving colleagues some of your time, attention and kindness and not for anything to be received in return other than mutual respect and compassion. Remember that you may not know much about them and what they are going through or have been through in their lives, given you are acquaintances rather than friends. Be patient, don\u2019t take things personally (without good reason to), and empower them to perform their best, helping them where appropriate but not at the detriment of yourself. When you empower them, it will create goodwill between you, a nicer work environment for you both and, as a bonus, they will hopefully return your kindness one day, too.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-01T00:18:08Z",
            "content": "That\u2019s it from me. Well done Wallabies and happy father\u2019s day to all the dads in Australia. Hopefully a first win in nine Rugby Championship matches for the Wallabies will serve as a tasty gift for you. It wasn\u2019t pretty, and perhaps they got a bit lucky that Argentina took their eye off the ball towards the end. But a win on the road is a mighty feather in the cap of this developing team. I\u2019ll catch you next week, but here\u2019s Angus Fontaine\u2019s match report in the meantime: That\u2019s an eight-game losing streak in the Rugby Championship that\u2019s just come to an end. One to savour, that\u2019s for sure! There\u2019ll be some controversy around this one. Referee Doleman said there would be a restart after Donaldson\u2019s penalty but then seemed to change his mind. The Pumas players weren\u2019t happy, as you\u2019d expect. Keep an ear out for any grumblings from Argentina in the week. Unreal performance from Australia. They were 10 points down and barely looked like winning the thing for most of the game. But they kept their patience \u2013 a true hallmark of a Joe Schmidt team \u2013 and were rewarded. Argentina will be kicking themselves. They should have had this sewn up but massive credit to the men in gold. This is a mighty, mighty win on the road. Donaldson nudges over the extras and the Wallabies have snatched it by a point! They triumph 19-20. 79 min: Gleeson carries well and they\u2019re five metres out. No sign of the drop goal yet. But they win a penalty! This will be the game. Vivas gives away the penalty and Donaldson will have the simplest task to nudge over the winner. 78 min: Australia have the line-out on Argentina\u2019s 22. They go to the back of the line-out and then set a maul. They\u2019re trying to win a penalty. Nothing doing so they crash it through the middle. Still they have it. Will they set a dop-goal? No, they keep hammering the line with Frost carrying big. 77 min: Matera picks up at the back of the scrum and carries into contact. Bazan Belez is taking his time to box kick. Koreoibete can\u2019t hold on so Argentina can attack. But the ball is spilled and Australia have an overlap. They just need to give it hands. Jorgensen is clear but he can\u2019t hold on and is tackled and spills the ball as he takes the hit. That was turnover ball that could have ended in an Australian try if only they were more accurate. 76 min: McDermott hoists a high box which is brilliantly fielded by Albornoz. Then Bazan Velez box kicks himself. Loloseio gets up to catch but knocks on and takes a knock himself. Scrum to Australia. That Albornoz catch might be the difference maker here. 75 min: Scrum penalty for Australia. Argentina\u2019s front row collapses so Lolesio hoofs it out towards half-way. Not a lot of distance. Still 10 metres inside his own half. But they have the line-out. 74 min: The scrum is taking a while to set. In fact they have to reset. This won\u2019t do Australia any good. They\u2019re camped inside their own 22. 73 min: Creevy enters the field for the last time as a Test player. It\u2019s his 110th appearance at 39-years-old. He\u2019s his country\u2019s most-capped player. Wouldn\u2019t it be a story if he manages to score the decisive try? 71 min: Two consecutive takes under the high ball has Argentina on the front foot. Another high kick is well held by Lolesio but he\u2019s pushed back into his own 22. It\u2019s becoming a bit of kick tennis. Lolesio has to field another tough ball under pressure. Albornoz counters witha rampaging run. Argentina are into Australia\u2019s 22 but there\u2019s a spill. Australia escape with a scrum feed. That was a mad period. Both teams are going for it. What a great end to this game. Argentina retake the lead. This is a proper ding-dong affair now. Great footy. 68 mins: Argentina shift the point of contact in the line-out and set a formidable maul. But Australia do well to stop it. They bring it down legally but then give away a penalty on the ground just five out. Argentina wrestle the ball over the line but after a double movement. Rather than go again with another line-out or a tap and go, Albornoz will take aim at the posts. 67 min: Argentina have a penalty inside Australia\u2019s 22. The Pumas are purring now and the crowd is matching their energy. Albornoz, on as a replacement on the wing, danced his way past two tacklers and Australia in their haste to halt the wave of blue and white gave away a penalty. They\u2019re close to the corner. Might they look to maul again or will they choose to kick for points? Looks like the corner. 66 min: Gallo spills the ball over the line! Wilson with a try \u2013 perhaps match \u2013 saving tackle. The big Puma prop burst through a half gap and had to simply finish the move. He dived for the line and while he was in the air Wilson put in a hit that dislodged the ball. What a moment! 65 min: A scrappy period ends with an Australian knock-on inside their own half. Some kick-tennis as both teams searched for an opening. Lolesio fields a kick and chooses to run. That proves to be the wrong decision as he invites too much pressure on himself and then Frost who collected a loose pass under pressure. Argentina swarmed, won the ball but couldn\u2019t stitch enough passes of their own to take advantage after the knock-on. Instead they\u2019ll feed the scrum about 18 metres from the line. 63 min: Gordan picks up the quick ball from the back of the scrum and hoofs a lovely touch finder. Australia \u2013 apart from the restarts \u2013 are starting to click. 61 min: Argentina drift from right to left and eventually knock it on. S Carreras had created the space as he delayed his pass, but the ball to Cinti wasn\u2019t ideal when it was delivered and the outside centre couldn\u2019t hold on. Scrum to Australia inside their 22. 60 min: AGAIN! Another restart is botched by the Wallabies. Every time they score they invite pressure back on themselves. This time a ball is dropped so Argentina have the scrum feed inside the Wallabies\u2019 22. Australia take the lead for the first time. After trailing by 10 points they have something to hold on to. 58 min: Bertranou slices his kick from the base of the scrum so it\u2019s a big net gain for the Wallabies who\u2019ll have the line-out throw on the 22. Now they have a penalty advantage from the resulting maul and could take the lead if they go for poles. Indeed they will. It\u2019s certainly in range, but the angle might make this tricky for Lolesio who\u2019ll be kicking from the left of the sticks. 55 min: Stewart spills the ball just as Australia were working through the hands inside Argentina\u2019s 22. That\u2019s frustrating but the way the Wallabies\u2019 scrum is firing this might not be such a bad outcome. A quick shout for Ikitau who is a leading light in that midfield. A wonderful game from him so far. 54 min: Another penalty for Australia and it\u2019s that man Tizzano yet again. The Wallabies line-out falters so there\u2019s a loose ball that needs getting. Bertranou pounced but Tizzano was there to get over it and secure the penalty. 53 min: Scrum penalty this time for Australia. Bell gets the better of the new man Bello. 52 min: Australia just haven\u2019t got their restarts right. Not for the first time they cough up easy possession after scoring points. Argentina look a little disjointed but they\u2019ll have the scrum feed a few out from Australia\u2019s 22. Boom! That is more like it! It\u2019s capped off by a busting burst from close range by the man they call Bobby V, but plaudits must go to Ikitau \u2013 who is having a top game \u2013 for finding space in the backline and igniting the move by losing two defenders. Gordan recycled and found the right runners before shovelling a short ball for the rampaging Valetini who would not be stopped from only a few metres out. Lolesio converts and suddenly we\u2019ve got a mighty close game on our hands. 49 min: In the blink of an eye we\u2019ve gone from Australia feeding the scrum five metres out to throwing a line-out on the half-way line. Argentina secured their own line-out and hoofed a mighty clearance up field. Australia have to be smarter than that. 48 min: What a waste! A truly poor decision as Australia choose to go down the blindside. But there was little more than five metres to play with and Argentina rallied to shove the men in gold out over the line. 47 min: Australia will have a five metre scrum. It started with a brilliant steal from Bell \u2013 are we sure he\u2019s a prop? \u2013 and then it went down through the hands. Kellaway nudged a grubber ahead and Koroibete chased and forced the covering Puma back over his own line. A wonderful opportunity here for the Wallabies. First they have to get their scrum secure. Argentina go beyond a converted try. That\u2019s a big blow for the Wallabies at the start of this second half. 44 min: Argentina win the scrum penalty and their entire pack leaps up in celebration. Big win for the home side. Tupou is the guilty party but I genuinely have no idea how the referee can make a call there. Looked like both props went down. Anyway, S Carreras will line up this gimme kick. 43 min: Great defence from Australia. They\u2019ve shown great patience when defending as well as attacking. And eventually they force the error, there\u2019s a knock-on at the base of the ruck so Australia will have the scrum feed on their own 22. 41 min: We\u2019re back and Argentina have picked up where they left off, attacking with zippy hands and an eagerness to go wide. Seven phases in and they\u2019re up to Australia\u2019s 22. Lolesio needed a mate to hold the ball steady for him but it didn\u2019t help. His penalty attempt sails wide and that\u2019ll be half-time. Scrappy, as you\u2019d expect with the conditions, but Australia did show some fight. Both teams a long way off their best. More will be needed to secure a win in the second half. Back in a bit. 38 min: Faessler goes to the front of the line-out and finds his jumper. Down the line they go. Wilson on the angle. Bell cuts against the grain. They\u2019re looking for holes on the fringe of the close exchanges. Short passes. Stiff runs. Argentina\u2019s defence holds. But Matera comes in from the side so it\u2019s a straight-arm penalty. Lolesio tells his skipper he can hit the poles from here. About 37 metres but with a breeze in his face. 37 min: Bell with a penalty on the ground! Excellent from the big unit who might be playing prop but performed the job of a loose forward there. That gives Lolesio the chance to clear upfield where the Wallabies will have another throw. 37 min: Argentina are good value for their lead, but they\u2019re also getting the bounce of the ball at the minute. A high hopeful kick lands and bounces back towards their onrushing players. Then a cross-field kick lands and bounces out inside Australia\u2019s 22, where Faessler will throw under pressure to find a jumper. Six point game. After some confusion around the shot clock, which saw a bunch of Wallabies get rather excited and wave their arms about, Argentina\u2019s fly-half calmly slots a penalty he could have knocked over with his eyes closed. 32 min: A real helter-skelter period inside Australia\u2019s 22 ends with a penalty to Argentina. Credit to the Wallabies defence which has stood firm. But a moment of ill discipline from Stewart \u2013 who illegally entered a ruck \u2013 means Argentina should stretch their lead by three. 29 min: How deflating. From the restart Australia spill the ball so Argentina have the scrum feed inside the Wallabies\u2019 22. Australia find their way through! They kept targeting the fringe of the breakdown and eventually a stiff carry breaks the wall. It\u2019s a slick inside pass from Ikitau that finds Wright against the grain. He\u2019s tackled but has the awareness to off-load for Gordan on the support line. Great try that\u2019s converted by Lolesio. 27 min: Australia are keeping their passes short with runners carrying into traffic. They\u2019re hammering the line and now have a penalty. Eight phases. This is looking good\u2026 25 min: Another penalty for Australia, this time inside Argentina\u2019s half. The Pumas had the line-out but the Wallabies did well to disrupt. Under pressure the Pumas couldn\u2019t organise themselves and there\u2019s an infringement \u2013 for off-side I think. Either way, Australia have a platform from the line-out about 15 metres out. 23 min: A big steal from Tizzano saves Australia\u2019s skins! Argentina were starting to fizz the ball through the hands and were once again threatening inside Australia\u2019s 22. But the Western Force flanker got over the ball and nicked a penalty on the deck. 21 min: Lolesio lands a brilliant clearing kick. Australia then get their hands back on the ball and choose to go through the hands past the second receiver. Much better. Oh, but they lose it. Just so frustrating. Argentina back on the attack again with a cross-field kick testing both wingers. Wright emerges with it and Gordan lands a solid box kick out of touch. 19 min: Sharp hands from Argentina has them moving the ball up field from a line-out. They\u2019re just far more incisive with ball in hand than the Wallabies. They get into Australia\u2019s 22 but there\u2019s a knock-on so the chance to set a scrum and clear for the visitors. 17 min: Another soft error. Koroibete, from the restart, takes out an Argentina player in the air so coughs up a needless penalty. The Pumas will have the throw close to half-way after a good touch finder. They secure the ball and then Australia give away another penalty after illegally interfering with the set maul. The Wallabies really need to sharpen up. Argentina are over! And it was so easy. Clean ball at the line-out, they set a solid maul. Australia\u2019s defence crumbles and the No8 at the back simply has to fall over. S Carreras converts and now it\u2019s a 10 point game. 15 min: Australia win the restart and set an attack. Quick hands from Tupou generates some go-forward. Loelsio hoists a high cross-field kick which lands on his team\u2019s side but Argentina have it back shortly after. They clear ahead and an intercept suddenly has Australian defenders back-peddling. In a flash they have their heels on their wn try line and Faessler is rushed into a ruck which he seals off illegally so Argentina have the penalty five metres out. They kick to the corner. The Gloucester man slots the penalty. First points on the board for the home side. 11 min: Australia give away a penalty as Argentina set their attack from the line-out. They\u2019re more direct with ball in hand as they look to spread it wide. But there\u2019s a spill so we\u2019ll come back for the penalty in range. Montoya points to the poles and asks S Carreras to take aim. 9 min: Australia are back on attack. Lolesio dinks a kick over the onrushing defence and they retain possession. Another kick though is fielded by Mallia and a big boot has the ball bobbling near Australia\u2019s try-line. That was a really kind bounce. Australia\u2019s return kick is hooked so Argentina have the line-out feed inside Wallaby territory. 8 min: This move is now 20 phases long but Australia aren\u2019t going anywhere. Still, they have the ball and keep hammering the blue and white wall. 25 phases now. It\u2019s all a bit too one dimensional. Wright throws a dummy but no one is buying. Eventually there\u2019s a speculative kick ahead from Lolesio and it dribbles into the in-goal area and is safely dotted down. 27 phases for nothing to show. 6 min: Wilson secures the line-out and Australia keep the ball. Valetini twice carries into traffic. Seven phases becomes eight but they\u2019re pushed back to the 22. Wilson carries again. Gordan is now well behind the 22. Ikitau tries to wriggle round the edge but again Argentina repel the men in gold. They\u2019ve gone backwards about 20 metres from where the line-out was taken. 4 min: Australia get the scrum penalty. Big shove from Tupou. Out of range for Lolesio so he boots a long touch finder. About 12 metres from the Pumas\u2019 line. 3 min: It\u2019s a poor throw from Montoya. Too short and Australia manage to steal the ball. Gordan then puts up a contestable kick which is knocked on so the Wallabies will have the scrum feed just inside half-way. 2 min: Rubiola is going off the field for an HIA and Lavanini enters the scene. He\u2019ll be a target at this line-out for Montoya. 1 min: Lolesio kicks off and Argentina have the ball. There\u2019s a long raking kick that Wright fields but the return kick is sliced. So Argentina have the throw inside Australian territory. There\u2019s a late change for Argentina. Gonzalo Garc\u00eda comes in for Lautaro Baz\u00e1n V\u00e9lez, who picked up a knock in the warm-up Intense passion from the Argentina players. They\u2019re up for this. we\u2019re seconds away from kick-off now. Time for the anthems. The players are shivering! My goodness it looks grim. It is bucketing down! Wet, windy, no doubt slipper underfoot. Might be a stodgy game. Argentina have won their last two meetings with the Wallabies. Last year they edged Australia 34-31 in Sydney and the year before that they hammered Dave Rennie\u2019s team 48-17 across a seven try demolition job in San Juan. \u201cNot good enough,\u201d was Rennie\u2019s entry into the understatement of the year award. One of my favourite rugby podcasts is optimistic about Stewart\u2019s debut. Anyone out there share this sentiment? Joe Schmidt is backing young Harry Wilson to lead with distinction. \u201cHarry\u2019s been really good for us and I think he\u2019s led himself really well,\u201d Schmidt said on Friday morning from Argentina. \u201cHe has a natural propensity to express himself well, but with very few words, and I don\u2019t think that we want to be doing too much talking, it\u2019s about the actions that he\u2019s going to deliver and lead from the front effectively. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty happy with the selection amongst the coaching group and even talking to some of the players about who would be best to step up, there was a lot of confidence around Harry.\u201d For those who missed it, the Springboks beat the All Blacks in a stunner in Johannesburg. Here\u2019s the report: Agustin Creevy will call time on his international career at the final whistle. No doubt the 39-year-old with over 100 caps for his country will make an impact when he steps on as a replacement hooker. Felipe Contepomi has selected 14 of the 15 starters who beat New Zealand in the opening round of the competition. The one change is on the wing where Santiago Cordero replaces Matias Moroni. Elsewhere it\u2019s a formidable outfit that will confront the Wallabies. The back row of Pablo Matera, Marcos Kremer and Juan Martin Gonzalez is right up there with the best combinations in the world and Santiago Carreras has the ability to unlock any game from fly-half. Argentina: Mallia; Cordero, Cinti, Chocobares, M Carreras; S Carreras, Bertranou; Gallo, Montoya (cap), Scalvi, Molina, Rubiolo, Matera, Kremer, Gonzalez. Replacements: Creevy, Vivas, Bello, Petti, Lavanini, Grondona, Bazan Velez, Albornoz. Harry Wilson becomes the fourth skipper in just the sixth match of the Joe Schmidt era. It\u2019s a remarkable turnaround for the No8 after he was left out of Eddie Jones\u2019 World Cup squad and he\u2019ll be itching to impress with the added leadership duties. There are five changes in total to the team that put in a spirited performance against the Springboks two weeks ago. Allan Allalatoa, the most recent captain, starts on the bench as Taniela Tupou starts in the front row amidst an improved looking tight five. Hamish Stewart makes his debut at inside centre as he replaces his injured Reds teammate Hunter Paisami. Australia: Wright; Kellaway, Ikitau, Stewart, Koroibete; Lolesio, Gordan; Bell, Faessler, Tupou, Frost, Salakaia-Loto, Valetini, Tizzano, Wilson (cap) Replacements: Nasser, Kailea, Alaalatoa, Williams, Gleeson, McDermott, Donaldson, Jorgensen. If the wins against Wales and Georgia were caveated by the weakness of the opposition, and the losses against the world champions Springboks were considered inevitable, then perhaps this can be regarded as the first true test of Joe Schmidt\u2019s Wallabies. World Rugby\u2019s rankings aren\u2019t perfect, but few would argue that Argentina\u2019s spot in sixth, three places above Australia, is an inaccurate reflection of their quality. The Pumas beat New Zealand in the opening round of the Rugby Championship and finished fourth in last year\u2019s World Cup. They\u2019re on a two-game winning streak against the Wallabies and will fancy themselves on their own patch this evening. Does this mean that Australia have little hope of winning? Of course not. There have been obvious improvements under Schmidt and he\u2019s named what could potentially be the best XV of his tenure so far. There\u2019s a new skipper, an imposing tight five and the knowledge that they\u2019ve arrived in Beunos Aires as underdogs. Which means the pressure is all on the home side. Having beaten the All Blacks, and with New Zealand playing two Tests in South Africa, there\u2019s an outside chance of them finishing second in the competition for the first time in their history. To do that, though, they\u2019ll need to beat Australia twice. I say this for most games in this tournament but this really could be a banger. If you\u2019re as amped for some quality footy as I am and want to share your thoughts with the group, drop me a mail or hit me up on X. How do you see this one going? Teams and further updates to follow. Kick-off at the Estadio Jorge Luis Hirschi is at 8am AEST/11pm BST/7pm local time."

            "content": "Another pandemic as big as the Covid crisis that killed 7 million people worldwide is \u201ca certainty\u201d, Prof Sir Chris Whitty has warned, as he said that the UK\u2019s lack of intensive care capacity for the sickest patients was a \u201cpolitical choice\u201d.

The warning from Whitty came after a doctor repeatedly broke down in tears at the inquiry while describing how the Covid crisis for NHS staff had been like having to respond to a \u201cterrorist attack every day\u201d, with infected patients \u201craining from the sky\u201d. Prof Kevin Fong \u2013 a former clinical adviser in emergency preparedness, resilience and response at NHS England who was on shift during the 7/7 London bombings \u2013 said the scale of deaths in hospitals at the height of the pandemic had been \u201ctruly astounding\u201d. Some intensive care units in England had been so overwhelmed that staff had had to put dead bodies in clear plastic refuse sacks after running out of body bags, and then immediately put another Covid patient in that person\u2019s bed, Fong said. Giving evidence after Fong, Whitty said expanding the capacity of the NHS could help it cope better with a surge in sick patients in future. \u201cTaking ICU [intensive care units] in particular, the UK has a very low ICU capacity compared to most of our peer nations in high-income countries,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a choice, that\u2019s a political choice. \u201cIt\u2019s a system configuration choice, but it is a choice. Therefore you have less reserve when a major emergency happens, even if it\u2019s short of something of the scale of Covid.\u201d Whitty said resolving the NHS workforce crisis was also crucial. Healthcare systems could not be \u201cscaled up\u201d in a future pandemic without \u201ctrained people\u201d, he added. \u201cYou can buy beds, you can buy space, you can even put in oxygen and things \u2026 But fundamentally, the limit to that system, as to any system, is trained people, and there is no way you can train someone in six weeks to have the experience of an experienced ICU nurse or an experienced ICU doctor. It is simply not possible. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t have it going into the emergency \u2013 if it\u2019s an emergency of this speed of onset \u2013 you should not have any illusions you\u2019re going to have it as you hit the peak.\u201d Among his other recommendations, Whitty said being able to conduct lightning-fast scientific research and reducing health inequalities deserved the most focus. \u201cIf we\u2019re not serious about trying to tackle health inequalities between pandemics, there is no way you\u2019re going to be able to do it when the pandemics occur,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest one that I think deserves slightly more emphasis is having the mechanism to be able to do research very, very fast.\u201d Referring to the development of vaccines and treatments, he added: \u201cI think people always, at the beginning of pandemics, underestimate that it\u2019s actually the science that\u2019s going to get them out of the hole, not all the other things. The other things are holding the line until the science does the work.\u201d Whitty said that, as well as direct harms from Covid such as deaths and long Covid, there were indirect harms \u201cthat come from the system being overwhelmed or at least unable to cope \u2026 all diseases, not just Covid, having higher mortality rates than they would have had\u201d. He admitted that messaging around what masks NHS staff should wear to protect themselves against Covid had been \u201cquite confused\u201d early in the pandemic. He also said officials \u201cdidn\u2019t get it across well enough\u201d that the public should continue to go to hospital for serious illnesses other than Covid. There was never going to be \u201cperfect balance\u201d when it came to stay-at-home messaging, he said. \u201cWe tried \u2026 we tweeted, we talked over the podium and so on. Whether we pushed too strongly on the messages the risks of Covid, I think that\u2019s a much harder one, actually.\u201d Whitty said he still worried today about whether the government got \u201cthe level of concern right\u201d about the dangers of Covid in 2020. \u201cWere we either overpitching it so that people were incredibly afraid of something where in fact, their actuarial risk was low, or were we not pitching it enough and therefore people didn\u2019t realise the risk they were walking into? \u201cI think that balance is really hard, and arguably some people would say we \u2013 if anything \u2013 we overdid it, rather than under, in the beginning.\u201d In a statement, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, which represents thousands of people, said the scenes described in intensive care units \u201cwere not inevitable, can never be considered acceptable, and must never be repeated\u201d."

            "date": "2024-09-19T08:50:33Z",
            "content": "There are now more than 27 million people calling Australia home \u2013 a quick jump of 1 million people in less than two years thanks to post-pandemic overseas migration. The national population grew by 2.3% to 27.1 million in the year ending 31 March, according to new data released by the Australia Bureau of Statistics on Thursday. Since 2007, it has grown on average by a million about every two-and-three-quarter years. The 27 million milestone took just one-and-three-quarter years, which Phil Browning, the ABS demography director, said was \u201cfar quicker than the average\u201d. It was also quicker than population growth for the previous milestone of 25 million to 26 million, which took just shy of four years, from September 2018 to June 2022. This plateau is attributable to Covid-era lockdowns. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email When the border opened post-pandemic, net overseas migration increased in \u201cfairly large numbers,\u201d Browning said. Overseas migration made up 83% of the past year\u2019s population growth. Net overseas migration \u2013 counting both people who have entered and left Australia \u2013 was 509,800 people. Students made up a \u201csizeable chunk\u201d of that, Browning said. \u201cThat\u2019s down from a peak of 559,900 in September 2023 \u2026 but it\u2019s still high,\u201d he said. Annual natural increase \u2013 counting both births and deaths \u2013 was 105,500 people. \u201cNatural increase is not moving a whole lot, and overseas migration is the significant driver,\u201d Browning said. The total fertility rate sits at about 1.6 births per woman, which Browning described as \u201chistorically, fairly low\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if that will continue or not, but it doesn\u2019t show any signs of going up or down at the moment.\u201d Every state and territory had positive population growth. Western Australian had the largest, at 3.1%, and Tasmania the lowest, at 0.4%. The next milestone of 28 million is projected for 2027. The ABS has predicted Australia\u2019s population could hit 30 million by the year 2033."

            "date": "2024-09-17T20:16:16Z",
            "content": "The UK can expect a \u201ctsunami of missed cancers\u201d, leading experts have said, after an international study found that diagnoses fell sharply during the pandemic. Preliminary figures from the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, presented to delegates at the World Cancer Congress in Geneva, compared data on the instance and stage of cancer diagnosis in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and the UK, before and during the pandemic. The results showed that UK nations had the biggest and most sustained falls in the diagnosis of lung, breast, colorectal and skin cancers during 2020. Particular data for Northern Ireland and Wales showed how badly they did compared with other countries studied. (Data for England and Scotland was still being collated but was expected to be as bad as the other UK nations.) While all countries reported a drop in cases diagnosed at the peak of the pandemic, most had caught up again within the year. In contrast, Wales and Northern Ireland still had not recovered their diagnosis rates by the end of 2020. The study calculated that between April and July 2020, breast diagnoses dropped by 35% in Northern Ireland and Wales, compared with 24% in Norway and 14% in Denmark. For lung cancer, over the same time period the decline was 16% in Northern Ireland and Wales, compared with 10% in Norway or 1% in New Zealand. For the most affected month, 44% of breast cancer cases and 30% of lung cancer cases were missed in Northern Ireland and Wales. There were also sharp declines in colorectal cancer diagnoses. The decline in cases diagnosed was largest for early stage cancers, partly due to the suspension of screening programmes. In Northern Ireland and Wales, stage 1 breast cancer diagnoses declined by 44% and 51%, respectively. Cancer experts said that as a result of such large drops in diagnoses, they are expecting to see many more patients presenting with more advanced, late stage cancers. \u201cThese data are a shocking wake-up call, providing the key evidence that the UK can expect a tsunami of missed cancers and a potential shift in stage that may lead to more aggressive cancers that are more difficult to treat,\u201d said Mark Lawler, professor of digital health at Queen\u2019s University Belfast and chair of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership. \u201cAnd the fact we are still way off meeting the 62-day target to treat cancer can only compound the issue.\u201d A leading oncologist and co-founder of the Catch up with Cancer campaign, Prof Pat Price, said: \u201cThese figures are a timely and devastating confirmation of the colossal cancer crisis. Without urgent action, we will see more patients diagnosed at a later stage and more patients facing delays to treatment. \u201cWe were at the bottom of the cancer league tables before the pandemic, and as this study shows, we\u2019ve simply not recovered from the backlog in diagnosis. However, it does not have to be this way, as Lord Darzi\u2019s new NHS report highlights. If ever there was a time to deliver and implement a dedicated cancer recovery plan it is now.\u201d Naser Turabi, director of evidence and implementation at Cancer Research UK, said: \u201cThese findings suggest the UK health system lacks resilience in comparison with countries such as New Zealand, leaving it more vulnerable to the impact of Covid. This could have serious consequences for cancer patients who faced delays to diagnosis as a result of over-stretched services.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWhile we recognise the additional pressures placed on the NHS during the pandemic, it is unacceptable that so many people had to wait too long for a cancer diagnosis and treatment. \u201cLord Darzi\u2019s report laid out how severe the delays for patients waiting for a cancer diagnosis continue to be. This government is determined to change that as we create the 10-year plan to reform the NHS and make it fit for the future. \u201cWe will get the NHS catching cancer on time, diagnosing it earlier and treating it faster so more patients survive this horrible set of diseases, and we will improve patients\u2019 experience across the system.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-12T15:29:28Z",
            "content": "The world\u2019s demand for oil is growing at its slowest pace since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, causing global market prices to slump to three year-lows, the International Energy Agency has said. The global energy watchdog used its closely watched monthly report to warn the industry that oil market prices could continue to fall as the leading producers kept pumping out more crude than the world could consume. The Paris-based agency said global oil demand increased by 800,000 barrels a day in the first half of the year. That was the equivalent to just over a third of the growth recorded in the same period last year, and was the smallest increase since 2020. Overall, demand this year is expected to reach 103m barrels a day (mb/d). In August, the world\u2019s oil-producing countries produced 103.5mb/d. The oversupply risks creating a glut of oil in the market. A barrel of crude has already slumped below $70 (\u00a354) to lows not seen since the global economy began recovering from the pandemic. The slow growth in global oil demand was attributed to the weakening of the Chinese economy. Demand for oil in China has decreased for four months in row this year. The IEA expects it to begin rising again, but at a slower pace than in recent years because of the country\u2019s progress in removing fossil fuels from its transport sector. A surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales in China has reduced the country\u2019s demand for road fuels, while the government\u2019s rollout of a vast national high-speed rail network has begun to reduce growth in domestic air travel, according to the report. The IEA has estimated that China\u2019s switch to EVs will outpace that in the west by the end of the decade, with almost one in three cars on Chinese roads being electric by 2030, compared with almost one in five in the US and EU. The agency said weak economic growth in the world\u2019s advanced economies could result in global oil demand this year being almost 2mb/d below pre-pandemic levels. \u201cWith the steam seemingly running out of Chinese oil demand growth, and only modest increases or declines in most other countries, current trends reinforce our expectation that global demand will plateau by the end of this decade,\u201d it said. The IEA has predicted that the world\u2019s demand for oil, gas and coal will begin to decline this decade in \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d of the fossil fuel era. Oil demand could reach highs of 105.7mb/d by 2028, it predicted, but it would probably plateau at this level before beginning a slow decline. The findings stand in contrast to forecasts produced by Opec+. The oil cartel also reduced its predictions for oil demand this year, but they remain more than double the IEA\u2019s forecasts."

            "content": "The head doctor at Sydney\u2019s medically supervised injecting centre has compared the rise of synthetic opioids to a pandemic and says she is worried the government isn\u2019t willing to make the \u201chard decisions\u201d necessary to prepare for it. Dr Marianne Jauncey began raising the alarm about the increasing prevalence of nitazenes earlier this year but was concerned the Minns Labor government had been reluctant to act because it \u201cstill feels for many like an emerging news story\u201d. She said that while New South Wales Health officials were \u201ctrying to take this seriously\u201d, she was concerned about a lack of political will to take necessary measures to combat the threat, including by rolling out drug-checking services. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cSometimes public servants are limited in what they can do by the laws of the land and the politicians of the day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether or not the politicians are prepared to make what might feel like some hard decisions, I don\u2019t know. That \u2026 is where I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Nitazenes are a type of synthetic opioid which are often mixed into other drugs without users\u2019 knowledge. They have been linked to more than 200 deaths in North America and Europe between 2019 and 2023. Earlier this year, NSW Health warned that nitazenes could be up to 500 times more potent than heroin and said four people had been hospitalised after ingesting them and suffering \u201csevere\u201d overdoses. Jauncey said the danger posed by synthetic opioids had reached a level where anyone who used illicit drugs, including \u201coccasional MDMA at a festival\u201d, should carry the opioid overdose treatment naloxone, which is free at pharmacies. \u201cIn my mind, it genuinely has got to that point,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not just that people are having some bad experiences. People are dying.\u201d Jauncey\u2019s warning comes after NSW parliament passed a motion on Wednesday, supported by the opposition and the government, to formally recognise nitazenes as a \u201cgrowing threat\u201d. Jauncey said the government should put the same energy and effort into preparing a public health response to nitazenes that they would a pandemic. \u201cI\u2019ve been in public health for 25 or more years. Everybody knows about flu pandemic planning, because even though the risk seems really small, the potential impact is so horrendous,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say we\u2019re in a similar position with nitazenes, although the risk of significant impact from nitazenes is not tiny \u2026 at all.\u201d Jauncey wasn\u2019t aware of any clients of the Uniting medically supervised injecting centre in Kings Cross using drugs there that were tainted with nitazenes. \u201cBut that begs the question, \u2018How would we know?\u2019,\u201d she said. The centre\u2019s only capacity for drug-checking was in the event of somebody having an \u201cunusual, unexpected, or really severe\u201d overdose, in which case they could send any leftover substance for testing, she said. Jauncey urged the government to introduce drug-checking services to allow people who used drugs to test their substances before taking them. The centre trialled drug-checking for six months this year through a research project run by Uniting and drug-checking advocacy and research centre The Loop, in partnership with the University of New South Wales. The findings are yet to be released. The premier, Chris Minns, has said his government will not make a decision on a drug-checking policy until after the drug summit later this year. The health minister, Ryan Park, said the government was concerned about nitazenes and it \u201ccontinues to embrace a comprehensive range of existing measures geared towards awareness, prevention and harm minimisation\u201d. Jauncey said MPs should approach the summit in good faith and act on the resulting policy recommendations rather than saying \u201cwe\u2019ll kick the can down the road\u201d."

            "date": "2024-09-26T10:07:16Z",
            "content": "For doctors and nurses fighting mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the virus itself is not the only enemy. They are also facing swirling rumours and misinformation. The first of millions of promised doses of mpox vaccine have finally started to arrive. Now the focus is on ensuring that people who need them will take them when the vaccination campaign begins next month, and teaching wider communities how to protect themselves. Conspiracy theories spreading across the country include the suggestion that mpox has been invented by white people in order to sterilise Congolese people with vaccines \u2013 or that it is just a money-making scheme from pharmaceutical companies. Mistrust in medical institutions and treatments is in many cases a legacy of racist colonial policies. \u201cYou see this kind of misinformation \u2013 and it spreads [more] quickly than the normal information,\u201d said Dr Junior Mudji, chief of research at Vanga hospital in the west of the DRC. With about 26,000 mpox cases reported across the DRC this year, officials are working to combat myths, teach people how to prevent infection and where to seek treatment, and lay the groundwork for vaccine acceptance. The immunisation campaign is likely to be highly targeted and initially offered to frontline health workers and other groups particularly at risk, including contacts of known cases. Information on prevention and self-care, however, including the importance of regular hand-washing, needs to reach everyone. Polling of almost 200,000 people in the DRC carried out this month by the UN children\u2019s agency, Unicef, found only 56% had heard of mpox. There was patchy knowledge of symptoms and of how the virus was transmitted and could be prevented. It is a challenging arena in which to spread reliable information. The DRC is a vast country with many remote areas that are hard to reach by road, and less than half of the population has a mobile phone. Many people have been displaced by conflict and, Mudji emphasised: \u201cThere is a problem of trust between politicians and the population.\u201d He recently took part in a broadcast phone-in about mpox. \u201cFrom the questions I received, it was clear that people lack good information. I told them that it is not a disease coming from US or European people \u2013 it has been in our country for a while, and now we have an outbreak.\u201d Mudji\u2019s hospital is used to seeing cases of mpox arrive from its rural surroundings, typically after people have eaten diseased bushmeat, and treats about five cases a month, typically in young children. \u201cWe know this disease,\u201d he said. But historically it has not been common across the DRC, which now finds itself the centre of an international public health emergency, thanks to a new variant that has reached as far afield as India and Sweden. That meant, Mudji said, that \u201cmany people don\u2019t know how exactly to manage these cases.\u201d Patients with mpox had long faced stigma, he said. \u201cPeople will find a reason to say, \u2018This family, they have done bad things, this is why they have been punished.\u2019 It\u2019s not easy, but the only way to fight bad information is providing good information.\u201d Conspiracy theories are also in evidence in the capital of North Kivu province, Goma. \u201cWhy is it that epidemics like Ebola and mpox are a regular occurrence in our country, but not in other countries? I think the west wants to weaken us by spreading diseases left and right,\u201d said Irankunda Alice, a 40-year-old seamstress. Gloire Kikandi, 30, a hawker, said: \u201cI believe that the epidemic diseases we have at home are manufactured by foreigners, greedy for money and eager to block Africa\u2019s demographic growth.\u201d Gershom Risasi, a 60-year-old teacher, said: \u201cJust as paracetamol manufacturers may want to sell their wares when there are several headaches, so foreign pharmaceutical companies may want to sell vaccines and make billions of dollars. Foreigners are looking for ways to weaken our health and thus take over the natural resources in the east of our country.\u201d Dr Rodriguez Kisando, a doctor from Goma, said rumours had also spread during previous epidemics such as Ebola or Covid-19. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t have access to information, they believe rumours,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the context of the Congo, epidemics occur at a time when there is a crisis of confidence between the governed and those in power. Some people even believe in conspiracy theories; people think that the epidemics have been manufactured abroad. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can\u2019t wait for epidemics to break out before we start communicating,\u201d Kisando added. Unicef is working with the government to spread accurate mpox information through a network of \u201ccommunity action cells\u201d, whose members include local chiefs, religious leaders, frontline workers, teachers, social service providers and women. Sophie Chavanel, a Unicef DRC communications expert, said: \u201cThese groups are briefed and trained and then go into communities to spread the word, either in public spaces such as markets or motorbike [taxi] stations or suchlike. \u201cBut they also visit families, house by house, to provide the right information. They take a small plastic chair and they sit with a mother or a couple of neighbours and they start having a discussion. \u201cBecause it\u2019s someone from the community, there\u2019s more trust in what they say, rather than what an outsider might say or what they hear on social media,\u201d she says. Misinformation is not an unsurmountable obstacle. The Unicef poll that found low awareness of the virus nonetheless found a relatively high willingness to take a vaccine \u2013 75% of people said they would accept one if offered. \u201cThere is not a high level of hostility per se. It\u2019s more about opening up a discussion,\u201d Chavanel said. \u201cFrom my experience, and having done this for quite some time, ensuring people have the right information goes a long way. And it\u2019s very much an exchange: listening to people\u2019s concerns and providing answers back.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-27T23:18:37Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson considered an \u201caquatic raid\u201d on a Dutch warehouse to seize Covid vaccines during the height of the pandemic, he has revealed in his memoirs. The former prime minister discussed plans with senior military officials in March 2021, according to an extract from his forthcoming book, Unleashed, published in the Daily Mail. The AstraZeneca vaccine was, at the time, at the heart of a cross-Channel row over exports, and Johnson believed the EU was treating the UK \u201cwith malice\u201d. Johnson said that he \u201chad commissioned some work on whether it might be technically feasible to launch an aquatic raid on a warehouse in Leiden, in the Netherlands, and to take that which was legally ours and which the UK desperately needed\u201d. The deputy chief of the defence staff, Lt Gen Doug Chalmers, told the prime minister the plan was \u201ccertainly feasible\u201d and would involve using rigid inflatable boats to navigate Dutch canals. \u201cThey would then rendezvous at the target; enter; secure the hostage goods, exfiltrate using an articulated lorry, and make their way to the Channel ports,\u201d Johnson wrote. However, Chalmers told Johnson it would be difficult to carry out the mission undetected, meaning the UK would \u201chave to explain why we are effectively invading a longstanding Nato ally\u201d. Johnson concluded: \u201cOf course, I knew he was right, and I secretly agreed with what they all thought, but did not want to say aloud: that the whole thing was nuts.\u201d Elsewhere in the published extracts, Johnson denied eating cake at what he described as the \u201cfeeblest event in the history of human festivity\u201d held to celebrate his 56th birthday during the Covid lockdown. He did not see or eat any cake at the event on 19 June 2020, he said, adding that it \u201cnever occurred\u201d to him or the then chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that the Partygate birthday gathering was \u201cin some way against the rules\u201d. He wrote: \u201cHere is what actually happened that day. I stood briefly at my place in the Cabinet Room, where I have meetings throughout the day, while the chancellor and assorted members of staff said happy birthday. \u201cI saw no cake. I ate no blooming cake. If this was a party, it was the feeblest event in the history of human festivity. I had only just got over Covid. I did not sing. I did not dance.\u201d Downing Street previously admitted that staff \u201cgathered briefly\u201d in the Cabinet Room for what was reportedly a surprise get-together for Johnson organised by his now-wife, Carrie. Johnson became the first prime minister to receive a criminal penalty while in office over Partygate, although an investigation by the former senior civil servant Sue Gray found that neither Johnson nor Sunak was aware of the event in advance. In the extracts from his autobiography, Johnson also said he believed he \u201cmight have carked it\u201d when he was in intensive care with Covid without the \u201cskills and experience\u201d of his nurses. Johnson spent several days in intensive care with Covid in April 2020. He described not wanting to fall asleep on his first night in intensive care \u201cpartly in case I never woke up\u201d. Following his release from hospital, the then prime minister spent some time at Chequers with his now-wife Carrie, and he recalled joining in with the clap for the NHS on a Thursday evening. \u201cI clapped with deep emotion because my lungs were telling me that I had been through something really pretty nasty, and that if it hadn\u2019t been for [his nurses] Jenny and Luis, fiddling with those oxygen tubes all night with all their skill and experience, I think I might have carked it,\u201d he wrote.

            "date": "2024-09-02T04:00:25Z",
            "content": "Pregnant women and older people across England will be routinely vaccinated against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for the first time, the NHS has said. From 1 September the NHS will vaccinate pregnant women from 28 weeks onwards and adults turning 75. Adults aged 75 to 79 will be offered a catchup vaccine to make sure they are protected. Previous studies have shown that giving pregnant women the RSV vaccine reduces the risk of babies experiencing severe lung infections in the first six months of life by about 70%. The RSV vaccine has been approved by the medicines regulators in the UK, as advised by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). RSV can cause a lung infection called bronchiolitis that can make it difficult for babies to breathe and feed. About 20,000 babies are admitted to hospital with the virus each year in England, and it is the main cause of winter pressures in children\u2019s hospitals and paediatric intensive care units. RSV cases in children have been increasing in the past couple of years, with an average of 146 young children in hospital each day in the winter of 2023, an 11% increase on the peak in previous winters. A recent study in the Lancet showed that a vaccination programme could prevent 5,000 hospitalisations and 15,000 A&amp;E attendances for infants. The same modelling suggested that the first season of the older adults catchup programme could prevent about 2,500 hospital admissions, 15,000 GP visits and 60,000 RSV illnesses. Mina Patel, 36, from Kent, said her daughter had suspected RSV as a baby in 2017, having been born premature 12 weeks early. \u201cShe had been in hospital with pneumonia and all sorts of lung infections and when she went in for pneumonia they suspected it was RSV,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hospital staff suspected it was RSV, although they didn\u2019t put it down in writing.\u201d Patel said the national supply of the vaccine would be beneficial to mothers and their babies. \u201cI think the vaccine is worth it because pneumonia and any type of lung infection is dangerous for a vulnerable baby, and so to get RSV as well, that could be detrimental.\u201d Steve Russell, the NHS national director for vaccinations and screening, said: \u201cAfter months of preparation from our hard-working staff, for the first time ever we are now offering the RSV vaccine to pregnant women and older adults at greatest risk, helping to protect the lives of those vulnerable and ease pressures across the NHS as winter approaches. \u201cGetting vaccinated is the best way you can protect yourself and those around you, and while RSV infections can occur all year round, cases usually peak in winter, so it\u2019s important that those eligible take up the offer as soon as possible this autumn when offered by the NHS.\u201d Prof Jenny Harries, the UK Health Security Agency chief executive, said: \u201cThis new vaccine offers huge opportunities to prevent severe illness in those most vulnerable to RSV, helping to protect lives and ease winter pressures for the NHS. UKHSA has provided critical scientific information to evidence the benefits of a national RSV immunisation programme and so the rollout of the vaccine is a truly positive moment for the public\u2019s health\u201d. Kate Brintworth, the chief midwifery officer for NHS England, said: \u201cVaccination is a vital means of protecting babies, women and families, as well as helping to manage increased pressures on NHS capacity during the winter period. \u201cI would like to thank all those who have been working to make this groundbreaking vaccine rollout a reality, and with almost 30 years as a midwife myself, I appreciate all the efforts across the NHS in bringing together vaccination and maternity services so that it is easy for women to get a RSV jab as soon as they\u2019re eligible.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-16T15:52:39Z",
            "content": "The UK has ordered more than 150,000 doses of vaccine against mpox to bolster its preparedness after the World Health Organization declared a surge in cases in Africa to be a global emergency. No cases of clade Ib mpox, the new strain that has spread rapidly in Africa after an initial outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), have yet been detected in the UK. However, UK health officials said at a briefing on Monday that ordering more vaccine was necessary to bolster the country\u2019s resilience against the virus, formerly known as monkeypox. They also set out three scenarios illustrating the possible impact of a UK outbreak. The first involved small clusters of cases, the second a \u201ccontrollable epidemic\u201d and the third community transmission in hospitals, care homes, prisons and schools. None of the scenarios outlined were projections or predictions, officials said. \u201cWe are preparing for any cases that we might see in the UK and vaccination plays a vital part in our defences,\u201d said Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency. \u201cAlongside vaccination, we have been working rapidly to ensure that clinicians are aware and able to recognise cases promptly, that rapid testing is available, and that protocols are developed for the safe clinical care of people who have the infection and the prevention of onward transmission.\u201d Mpox is passed on through close physical contact. The disease causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions, and is usually mild but can kill. Children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of complications. The vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, would be offered to those eligible in stages, and based on clinical need, health officials said. Gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men; certain healthcare workers and specialist healthcare and humanitarian workers who go to affected countries; and close contacts of confirmed mpox cases would be offered vaccines, officials said. Clade Ib has prompted more concern among health officials than clade IIb, which was responsible for a global outbreak of the virus in 2022. Small numbers of cases of clade IIb have been present in the UK for about two years. A vaccination programme was launched in the summer of 2022 and closed in the summer of 2023. It is understood that about 50,000 people have had two doses of the jab, which is 80% effective at preventing mpox cases, while more than 83,000 have had one dose. Steve Russell, NHS England\u2019s director for vaccinations and screening, said that while the risk of catching mpox in the UK was low, vaccination offered \u201ca vital level of protection\u201d for those most likely to be exposed. \u201cWe encourage those eligible to come forward when invited by local health services, to ensure they have the best defence,\u201d he added. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said he was closely monitoring the spread of mpox overseas. He added: \u201cNo cases of clade Ib mpox have been detected in the UK, but we are taking steps to ensure the country is prepared with a robust vaccination programme that protects those who may be at high risk.\u201d"

            "content": "Israeli soldiers halted a UN convoy involved in the recent polio vaccination drive in Gaza and detained two staff members for questioning, in an incident during which live shots were fired and vehicles damaged by a bulldozer, the UN has said. Details of the incident, which occurred at the Al Rashid checkpoint, were revealed in a statement by the office of the UN humanitarian coordinator for Palestine, Muhannad Hadi, who said the lives of UN staff in the vehicles had been endangered. He said a convoy of 12 UN staff members \u201cwhose movement was fully coordinated with Israel Defense Forces, and whose details were shared with them in advance, was stopped on its way to North Gaza to support the third phase of the Gaza Strip-wide polio vaccination campaign\u201d on Monday. According to the statement: \u201cWhile at the checkpoint the team was informed that the IDF wanted to hold two of the UN staff members in the convoy for further questioning. \u201cThe situation escalated quickly, with soldiers pointing their weapons directly towards the convoy personnel. Live shots were fired, and tanks and bulldozers approached, engaged with, and damaged UN vehicles, endangering the lives of UN staff inside the vehicles. \u201cThe convoy remained held at gunpoint while senior level UN officials engaged with the Israeli Authorities to de-escalate the situation. \u201cThe two staff were eventually questioned, one by one, and then released. After seven and a half hours at the checkpoint, the convoy returned to base without being able to fulfil its humanitarian mission to support the polio campaign. \u201cThis incident highlights the ongoing dangers and obstacles humanitarian personnel face in Gaza. Despite daily coordination of humanitarian movements with the Israel Defense Forces, our staff and assets were not provided with sufficient protection, hindering our work. \u201cUnder international humanitarian law, such protection is mandatory.\u201d The IDF said in a statement that it had acted \u201cfollowing intelligence that a number of Palestinian suspects were present in the convoy\u201d and delayed it to question them. It said the convoy was not involved in the transport of polio vaccines but was being used instead to exchange UN personnel. The incident on Monday follows previous cases in which humanitarian workers, both Palestinian and international, have been confronted with sometimes lethal violence while trying to deliver aid. Senior UN and aid officials have also complained repeatedly through the 11 months of the conflict that Israel has obstructed their efforts, a claim Israel denies. In one of the most serious incidents in April, seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen, including three Britons, were killed in an Israeli strike on their vehicles. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN\u2019s main agency for humanitarian relief in Palestine (Unrwa), said the convoy had been held on Monday for more than eight hours despite \u201cprior detailed coordination\u201d. \u201cThis significant incident is the latest in a series of violations against UN staff including shootings at convoys and arrests by the Israeli Armed Forces at checkpoints despite prior notification,\u201d he said. Unrwa said last month that 207 of its staff had been among more than 280 aid workers killed in Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the current war."

            "date": "2024-09-20T17:39:06Z",
            "content": "Mental health has overtaken cancer and obesity as the health problem most Britons worry about, a global survey has revealed. Experts said the shift in the public\u2019s perception reflected the sharp rise in recent years in mental ill-health caused by the Covid pandemic, the cost of living crisis and male violence against women. The trend is revealed in a survey of what the public in 31 countries worldwide thinks about health and the healthcare they receive, undertaken by the pollsters Ipsos. When the study began in 2018, exactly the same proportion of British participants \u2013 50% \u2013 identified cancer, obesity and mental health as among the biggest health problems facing the country. But mental health has moved up the rankings to become the illness that the most number of people (54%) in England, Scotland and Wales now say is a worry. In comparison, obesity was only mentioned in this year\u2019s edition of the research by 36%, while cancer was also cited by slightly fewer than before (49%), even though record numbers were being diagnosed. Opinion globally has had an even more dramatic increase in the priority people give to mental wellbeing. In 2018, 27% of people in the 31 countries said it was a pressing health concern. But now 45% do so \u2013 more than any other illness. Over the same time, though, the proportion of people mentioning cancer worldwide has fallen noticeably \u2013 from 52% to 38% \u2013 while the number citing obesity is also down, from 33% to 26%. Cancer concerns have fallen despite a global rise in the number of people getting the disease, which is linked to the ageing population and to lifestyle factors such as bad diet, smoking and alcohol intake. The trends represent a \u201cfundamental shift in attitudes to mental health compared to 2018. Perhaps the pandemic\u2019s biggest long-term effect on public health will be on mental heath,\u201d Ipsos said. The picture that emerges from its findings of a global population increasingly anxious about mental ill-health is underscored by a rise in those who see stress as a big health problem. The proportion citing it has risen from 12% to 17% in Britain and from 25% to 31% globally. \u201cHere in the UK we\u2019re seeing growing recognition of mental health as a major concern, with 54% of Britons now saying it\u2019s a pressing health issue facing the country\u2019, said Simon Atkinson, Ipsos\u2019s chief knowledge officer. Globally, \u201cthe pandemic is still casting a long shadow\u201d, he added. Ipsos interviewed 23,667 people in 31 countries, including the US, Malaysia and India, in July and August. That included a representative selection of 1,000 Britons. Andy Bell, the chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said the greater anxiety about wellbeing was not a surprise because \u201cthe nation\u2019s mental health has been deteriorating over the last decade, with rates of mental ill-health and referrals to mental health services rising\u201d. More than a million people in England are on a waiting list for NHS mental health care. Women were much more likely than men to see mental health as a significant worry, both in Britain and globally, Ipsos found. Worldwide, 51% of women mentioned it, but only 40% of men. Similarly, younger people referenced it more than older generations, who were more likely to cite cancer. \u201cWomen have higher rates of mental ill-health than men. Women are more likely than men to be living in poverty, and male violence heightens too many women\u2019s risk of mental health difficulties,\u201d Bell added. Cancer\u2019s sharp fall in public priority globally is a surprise. But that may reflect confidence that survival from many forms of the disease is increasing and that new treatments are emerging, such as immunotherapy, surgical advances and more precise types of radiotherapy. Naser Turabi, Cancer Research UK\u2019s director of evidence and implementation, said: \u201cThanks to decades of research into diagnosis and treatment, cancer survival in the UK has doubled over the last 50 years. But with cancer affecting nearly one in two of us in our lifetime, it remains a defining health issue and a key concern for people across the UK.\u201d"

            "content": "Hundreds more avoidable deaths than previously estimated will be uncovered in the first statutory inquiry into mental health services, its chair said on the opening day. The inquiry into mental health services in Essex was initially expected to examine about 2,000 deaths between 2000 and 2023. While opening proceedings in Chelmsford on Monday, its chair, Kate Lampard, said she expected to uncover \u201csignificantly in excess\u201d of this number. Problems collecting data on patients is one of a series of failures to be examined by the inquiry into Essex Partnership university NHS trust (Eput), North East London NHS foundation trust (Nelft) and predecessor organisations. Lady Lampard said: \u201cI find it shocking that we may never be able to say for sure how many people died within the remit of this inquiry.\u201d Nicholas Griffin KC, the counsel to the inquiry, said: \u201cFurther work done has already demonstrated that the figure previously given of 2,000 deaths will rise substantially.\u201d An updated figure would be provided in November, he said. The statutory inquiry will examine incidents of serious patient harm, including attempted suicides and physical and sexual assaults. It will focus on inpatient deaths and injury, but will include incidents that occurred in the community three months after discharge or three months after a refusal to admit a patient. Lampard said: \u201cWe\u2019re investigating alleged failings in mental healthcare on a scale that is deeply shocking.\u201d Some of them were ongoing and had national implications, she added. \u201cA number of the issues that have been identified remain of current concern and I need to address them as quickly as possible.\u201d The inquiry was put on a statutory footing after previous calls for evidence and witnesses, by a previous independent inquiry chaired by Dr Geraldine Strathdee, were ignored. Griffen said: \u201cThe response to this [call for evidence] was extremely poor.\u201d In a warning to service providers, Lampard said: \u201cWhere relevant evidence is not provided, or is not provided appropriately promptly, I will not hesitate to use my statutory powers to the fullest extent.\u201d After a minute\u2019s silence for the victims, Lampard paid tribute to the families who have campaigned for years for a statutory inquiry. \u201cI again acknowledge the instrumental role of the families in the creation of this independent statutory inquiry. Without their dedicated and tireless campaigning, it is unlikely that we would be here today.\u201d Priya Singh, a partner at Hodge Jones &amp; Allen (HJA), which represents more than 120 victims and families, said: \u201cIt has been shocking to hear that the inquiry is expecting to uncover many more deaths. There is no time to wait, people are still dying, not just in Essex, but potentially, nationally.\u201d In its opening submission to the inquiry on behalf of the families, HJA criticised Essex trusts for thwarting the previous inquiry. It said less than 30% of those regarded as essential witnesses by Strathdee agreed to attend evidence sessions. It also accused the trusts of failing to change despite numerous damning reports by regulators, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman, coroners and a criminal prosecution in 2021 over the death of 11 patients from suicide. The submission said it was disturbing that some of the healthcare professionals involved in abusing patients were still working in the NHS. It listed 21 recurring problems that it expects the inquiry to unearth. They include: inappropriate discharge of patients; failures to admit patients in desperate need; inappropriate use of force and restraint; rapid staff turnover; baseless accusations aimed at families, and poor record-keeping. It added: \u201cGiven their experience of being fobbed off when calling for a statutory inquiry, our clients ask that government takes them seriously.\u201d A number of bereaved parents and families gathered outside the inquiry venue in Chelmsford and lay placards on the pavement with photos of loved ones who had died. One banner said: \u201cWe demand truth, justice, accountability, change,\u201d and another said: \u201cFailed by Essex mental health services.\u201d The inquiry evidence sessions are expected to continue until 2026. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "An attempt by Nadine Dorries to block a statutory inquiry into thousands of mental health deaths cost more lives, a bereaved mother has told the hearing. Melanie Leahy campaigned for years for a public inquiry into the death of her 20-year-old son, Matthew, and hundreds of other people failed by mental health care in Essex. It finally began last week after a long battle with ministers, including Dorries when she was a health minister in the last government. While delivering an impact statement about the 2012 death of her son to the Lampard inquiry in Chelmsford on Tuesday, Leahy said she had been \u201cshaken to the core\u201d to discover this month that Dorries had sent WhatsApp messages in 2020 describing how she was \u201cpicking off\u201d families as part of an attempt to block their calls for a full public inquiry. In the messages, which were shown to the inquiry last week after being reported in the Daily Telegraph, Dorries told the then health secretary, Matt Hancock: \u201cWe\u2019re not going there\u201d, in relation to such calls. Referring to Leahy, Dorries said: \u201cI\u2019m picking off the other families and speaking to them one by one to get them onside to isolate her.\u201d An independent inquiry was set up in 2021 but when many potential witnesses ignored requests to cooperate, it was put on a statutory footing in 2023. Last week the new chair, Kate Lampard, said it would examine \u201csignificantly in excess\u201d of 2,000 mental health deaths between 2000 and 2023. Leahy said: \u201cIt sickens me to think an elected politician would turn grieving families against each other. \u201cThis has only served to raise even more serious concerns, but this time about my own government\u2019s transparency. This felt like nothing less than a full frontal stab in my heart.\u201d Leahy, who will deliver another impact statement on Wednesday about the subsequent death of her partner, added: \u201cIt devastates me every time I think of the additional lives which have been lost, my late partner being one of them \u2026 and other patients who have been harmed in the three years of delay which [Dorries\u2019s] decision to grant only an independent inquiry will have caused.\u201d She said the last eight days of her son\u2019s life under the care of mental health services, now run by Essex partnership university NHS trust, were \u201chell on earth\u201d. Leahy said he was \u201calone, malnourished, over-medicated, scared, bleeding, bruised, raped, injected multiple times, ignored and frightened\u201d. A jury at an inquest found there were multiple failings and missed opportunities in his care, she told the inquiry. Leahy said: \u201cI hope his death will have a positive impact on the world and that I will be afforded the truth as to how and why he died whilst he was meant to be safe. I hope justice and accountability are afforded and necessary change is made for others who, like I, looked to services when they needed safe, compassionate care for their loved ones.\u201d In a statement last week, Dorries said: \u201cI fought for that inquiry to be put in place. I\u2019m proud of my record of achievement as a health minister \u2026. I spoke to all parents individually in accordance with their own wishes.\u201d"

            "content": "The \u201cstaggering\u201d rise in anxiety among children (NHS referrals for anxiety in children more than double pre-Covid levels, 27 August) deserves a more sophisticated response than installing counsellors in every school, useful though that may be in some cases, and I say this as a mental health professional \u2013 a consultant clinical psychologist. Well-meaning awareness campaigns that encourage us to translate every feeling into a \u201cmental health issue\u201d convey the message that children have an individual deficit, while obscuring the reasons for their distress. And yet research consistently shows that their feelings are understandable in context. Your article mentions pressures from target-driven education, online bullying, poverty and uncertainty about the future. None of this will be resolved by funding extra mental health professionals, helplines and support hubs. Indeed, that is likely to perpetuate the cycle, since these are not fundamentally medical problems \u2013 they are social ones. It is particularly disappointing to see Labour failing to make these obvious links. Do we have to reach the point where every child is on a clinic waiting list before we take appropriate action on root causes? Dr Lucy Johnstone Bristol \u2022 As a clinical psychologist, and like anyone who has contact with young people, I have seen that anxiety rates have risen. But it is important not to pathologise young people more, only focusing on increasing crisis treatment. That is essentially paying people like me to be an even more expensive sticking plaster. I would argue that a lot of what is happening is not a mental health crisis, but an empowerment crisis. No matter what age they are, people can handle incredibly stressful things if they know they have the resources and the social support to handle it. Young people feel disempowered; they are aware of the stresses and dangers in the world, but don\u2019t feel they are being listened to or given the tools to handle those stresses. Most don\u2019t need more of me; they need more focus on community, fun, support, connection and engagement far earlier. Dr Helen Care Woodstock, Oxfordshire \u2022 That British children and teenagers are suffering significantly greater anxiety and unhappiness is deeply troubling. Several plausible reasons have been proposed, but I believe a potential one has been overlooked. There is a fashionable trend in ultra-gentle parenting, where children are offered high levels of comfort for feelings engendered by every setback. I recognise that my large haul of grandchildren is still a tiny sample, but the happiest and least anxious of them by far are those who have learned that not all their negative feelings will be soothed and solved by others. The support of loving parents is of course invaluable, but learning resilience is important too. Name and address supplied \u2022 In 1991, I began working in a large comprehensive school in London and immediately felt the impact of the Thatcher/Major years on our pupils. Children lived in poverty and deprivation, with very little support from social services, and this affected their mental health. We made almost the same number of calls to A&amp;E for mental health reasons as we did for playground injuries. Within the first couple of years of the Labour government from 1997, things quickly improved, with more support for schools and families. Sadly, history is repeating itself for Keir Starmer now.

            "content": "Maybe the true Greek tragedy is the temptation to interpret everything that happens in that country under the long Hellenic shadow of history. It is former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis who suggests here that the 2010s debt crisis was akin to an ancient tragedy, with the likes of him, prime minister Alexis Tsipras and a slowly strangulated populace at the mercy of overweening Olympian (or rather, European) forces. We should probably pay attention to the idea \u2013 but maybe more so to his parting suggestion that this drama doesn\u2019t completely conform to the classical pattern, either. Director Elisa Mantin\u2019s melancholic but partisan film makes it clear that the hubris was on the Euro troika side. Varoufakis, a sympathetic Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a clutch of former Syriza ministers, and others describe the ideologically motivated chastising-via-austerity of the country by a Brussels technocracy for whom, says Varoufakis, Greek democracy was an afterthought. The negotiations took place in brutalising 10-hour Eurogroup meetings that were unrecorded and unminuted \u2013 all the better to spin things in the press later. There is no counter-argument here, partly because the IMF pulled out of interviews at the last minute (making good on Varoufakis\u2019s suggestion that insiders never tell outsiders what happens on the inside). Which makes it easy for Mantin to go all-in on the Greek tragedy notion, notably in a strand that alternates politics with snapshots of the artistic and social resistance that has sustained the country during its years of hardship. But it doesn\u2019t go much beyond lots of ba\u011flama-playing and broad generalisations about the Greek soul; more precise insights about the interplay between art and politics \u2013 especially the latter as a form of theatre and how that applied to the 2010s \u2013 go begging. Twenty-first-century tragedian Varoufakis also notes one crucial difference with the classical model - the debt crisis, supposedly resolved but stretching out into a slow-motion social and psychological catastrophe that continues today, offered no cathartic ending for the Greek people. Public Enemy hints that the country\u2019s experience may have wider significance in future arenas where the fate of the commons is decided by faceless elites with inscrutable agendas. But again the film is vague and speculative on this front when that great Greek tradition, rigorous reasoning, might have provided clearer instructions on how to resist. \u2022 Public Enemy is in UK cinemas from 24 September."

Rightwing rent-a-thugs seized on the opportunity to blame their favourite scapegoat. But these things channelled an anger that was already there. Why are so many people so angry at life in this country that they are prepared to riot, and scapegoat others for it? There has been considerable research into the effect of economic inequality on social cohesion, crime and health. What it shows is that economic inequality makes all of these evils worse. This is not simply about being nice to the poor. The research shows that in highly unequal societies even the better off have a poorer quality of life than they would in more equal ones. Recent polls have shown that people are in favour of increasing taxes on the rich, and this includes the rich themselves. Inequality increased colossally under the last government, with most people\u2019s wealth and incomes decreasing while the richest doubled theirs. The change that people voted for must come, or there will be more and worse riots. The past 14 years have seen a massive transfer of wealth from the less well off to the richest. That must be reversed. Shifting the balance of taxation by a relatively small amount is essential. Reducing economic inequality should be a major goal of this government, and a Labour government above all others should not be ashamed to do it. Dr Robert Forde Retired forensic psychologist, Sheffield \u2022 I am grateful to Tim Newburn for his reminder that \u201crioting is generally an indication that all is not well in the body politic\u201d. While historians will have plenty to contribute to understanding lessons from the past in relation to the origins of such riots, I wonder if turning to literature will provide useful insights. I have been reading Charles Dickens\u2019 novel Barnaby Rudge, set in the 1780s and focused on the Gordon riots \u2013 the days of violent insurrection and looting motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment fanned by key figures in the Protestant Association, particularly the figurehead, Lord George Gordon. The parallels in Dickens\u2019 depiction with what followed from the outrageous events in Southport and elsewhere last month are striking. For social media misinformation, read incendiary and anonymous handbills in 1780. For the anti-immigrant political sentiment of the past decade, read the headstrong \u201cBloody Mary\u201d speechifying in the years leading to the Gordon riots. For the state\u2019s current robust sentencing, read the executions of those manipulated to lead the riots by hidden and unscrupulous politicians \u2013 less likely to be charged. What emerges in Dickens\u2019 depiction of such a riot is the abandonment of all civilised values resulting from the mass hysterical groupthink that \u201cothers\u201d and foreigners are causing problems. The invisible leaders remain the problem. Emeritus Professor John Butcher Bedford \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

            "title": "Can US economic statistics really affect the presidential election?",
            "date": "2024-09-08T13:00:50Z",
            "content": "As another presidential election rears into view, spare a thought for campaign operatives on the eve of the first Friday of each month. Aides used to functioning on little sleep struggle by on even less. Press releases and attack lines are meticulously prepared. As the clock clicks to 8.30am, the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics is refreshed repeatedly on hundreds of laptops and phones, until it finally lands: a 40-page statistical release entitled The Employment Situation. The monthly jobs report is widely seen as a reliable indicator of the health of the US economy. But scrutiny of its contents typically reaches a whole new level in the closing stages of an election campaign. \u201cI cannot tell you the anxiety that you feel the night before, and that morning,\u201d said Teddy Goff, digital director for Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. As polling day neared, and each jobs report rolled around, there was a palpable fear that \u201cone bad month could take the entire enterprise down\u201d, he recalled. \u201cHad there been a fluky month in October 2012 of negative growth,\u201d said Goff, \u201cyou\u2019re thinking, \u2018OK, cool, we\u2019ve just lost the White House.\u2019\u201d And so, this Friday, as the first week of September drew to a close, staffers for both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris waited with bated breath on the latest official jobs numbers. Employers added 142,000 jobs in August \u2013 shy of expectations \u2013 and the unemployment rate slipped from 4.3% to 4.2%. Both sides pounced. Joe Biden hailed \u201chistoric gains\u201d for American workers since he and Harris took office, with almost 16m new jobs created; the Trump campaign declared that \u201cwarning lights\u201d were flashing, as \u201cfears of Kamala-induced recession\u201d purportedly mounted. Dozens of news outlets, including the Guardian, reported on the release \u2013 and what it could mean for the election. But does it matter? \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any voter who should change their vote based on Friday\u2019s release,\u201d said Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the council of economic advisers under Obama, \u201cwith the possible exception of the 12 voting members\u201d of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate-setting policy committee. \u201cIf you stopped the average person in the street, they would have no idea\u201d how many jobs had been created, or how many people were out of work, in any given month, observed Stephanie Kelton, a professor of economics and public policy at Stony Brook University. And even if they did, \u201cpeople are not moving between camps because of a tenth of a percentage point shift in the unemployment rate,\u201d she added. With a campaign this close, however, anything can shift the dial. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an election that\u2019s basically tied, even very small events could be the difference between winning and losing,\u201d said Furman. \u201cIn terms of economic data, there are really a very small number of big events between now and election day.\u201d Between now and 5 November, when tens of millions of Americans will cast their votes, there will be two updates to the consumer price index, the closely watched inflation gauge; two more jobs reports; and a gross domestic product (GDP) economic growth estimate for the third quarter. Each will be dissected, debated and described in great detail. The world\u2019s largest economy has reached a critical juncture at the exact moment when the US election kicks into its final gears. When inflation surged to its highest level in a generation two years ago, policymakers scrambled \u2013 and ultimately raised interest rates to a two-decade high \u2013 in an attempt to cool the economy, and bring down price growth. With inflation now heading back towards more typical levels, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, has signaled that the central bank would start to cut rates this month. The US labor market now faces greater \u201cdownside risks\u201d, Powell acknowledged. The apprehension about this next phase was laid bare in August, when disappointing jobs data for the previous month triggered a sharp, albeit fleeting, global stock market sell-off. The sell-off was news around the world and brought greater \u2013 negative \u2013 attention to a jobs report that while weaker than expected was still positive. While the US economy has staged a remarkable recovery from the depths of the pandemic, a majority of Americans do not appear to recognize this. A Harris poll for the Guardian in May, for example, found that 55% wrongly believed the economy was in recession. \u201cThere is a degree to which people just perceive the economy to be worse than it is,\u201d said Goff. \u201cPart of it is just that the media has a bias toward negative stuff. The individual murderer gets reported on ad nauseam in the local news. The declining murder rate over the course of three decades doesn\u2019t get any coverage. There\u2019s that same phenomenon attached to the economy.\u201d There also appears to be a disconnection between how official economic data informs voters about the economy and how voters experience it in their day-to-day lives. Does last month\u2019s inflation reading matter when your grocery bill is up by a quarter in four years? How much attention would you pay to August\u2019s nationwide unemployment rate if you, or a relative, had recently lost their job? The Trump campaign, which claims Biden has destroyed jobs and fueled inflation, is clearly seeking the support of those directly affected by economic disruption since 2021. \u201cVoters, particularly the voters that will decide elections, they don\u2019t think about the economy through the prism of any government statistics,\u201d David Plouffe, who managed Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, told the Axe Files podcast in March. He later joined the Harris campaign as senior adviser. Obama won in 2012 with the highest unemployment rate of any re-elected president since 1936. \u201cIt was coming down,\u201d Plouffe noted, \u201cso people felt good on trajectory.\u201d Should the Fed start reducing rates this month, as indicated, \u201cperhaps at the margin, in the tiniest of ways\u201d, some people might start to feel better about the economy, Kelton suggested. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a little bit of a vibe shift in having the rate-cutting cycle begin, and knowing it\u2019s under way.\u201d In a race this close, that vibe shift, or the lack of it, may well decide the race. Could the noise created by a few good or bad economic reports tip the balance? For some time already, there has been a gulf between Americans\u2019 words and actions. Right now \u201cwhen people have to put money behind their statements, they are very optimistic,\u201d said Furman, now a professor at Harvard University. \u201cThey are spending lots of money. Businesses are investing a lot.\u201d And yet, \u201cwhen they talk to pollsters and no money is at stake, they are quite negative,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they get into the ballot box, will they think more like they do in a store, or when they\u2019re talking to a pollster? No one knows.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-30T10:00:11Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris\u2019s economic policies proved far more popular than Donald Trump\u2019s plans in a blind test of their proposals. Four of the top five most popular proposals were from the Democratic candidate\u2019s campaign, according to a new Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. The poll showed strong optimism from Democrats about Harris\u2019s presidential candidacy but \u2013 once again \u2013 highlighted pessimism around the US economy from both sides of the aisle. Americans surveyed were given a list of 12 policy proposals \u2013 six from Harris\u2019s campaign and six from Trump\u2019s. The poll did not say whose campaign the proposals came from. The most popular proposal was a federal ban on the price-gouging of food and groceries \u2013 a Democratic proposal that some leading economists have criticized. Nearly half (44%) of all those polled agreed that it would strengthen the economy. Harris\u2019s price gouging proposal is designed to help address the top economic issue of respondents: cost of living. A majority of those polled (66%) indicated that the cost of living was one of their biggest economic concerns right now. Other Harris proposals that voters liked included expanding the child tax credit (33%) and selected tax breaks for new small businesses (33%). The only Trump plan to break the top five was his proposal to cut taxes on social security benefits (42%). But Trump\u2019s policies are popular with his base: when asked about his proposal for the mass deportation of millions of migrants, 43% of Republicans said it would be good for the economy versus 24% of independents and 15% of Democrats. In more good news for Harris, independent voters, a key group this election, seemed to favor Harris\u2019s policies over Trump\u2019s. Four out of the five top policies selected by independents are from Harris\u2019s campaign. Since Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race two months ago, paving the way for Harris to become the Democratic candidate, she has tried to craft her own economic platform. This has involved shifting away from Bidenomics, which failed to ignite much enthusiasm on the campaign trail. In the Harris/Guardian poll conducted last September, a majority of Democrats (62%) said that while Bidenomics was good in theory, it wasn\u2019t being implemented well. Harris instead has been promoting her \u201copportunity economy\u201d, which focuses on rising costs, rather than issues like infrastructure and manufacturing, which were key components of Bidenomics. The shift in focus seems to be working. Harris\u2019s policies were particularly popular with younger Americans, an increasingly powerful voting bloc.Some 87% of millennials and gen Z voters said that at least one of Harris\u2019s proposals would be good for the economy, versus 79% of young voters who said the same for Trump. Of the four generations polled, millennial voters seemed to be the most onboard with Harris\u2019s candidacy, energized by her appointment after President Biden withdrew. The majority of millennials (59%) said that Harris\u2019s policies are better than Biden\u2019s, compared to just 36% of Boomers. Democratic voters as a whole seem to think Harris turned out to be the better candidate: when asked if their lives would be better if Harris or Biden won the election, 80% of Democratic voters went with Harris. Though Harris has received criticism for being \u201clight on policy\u201d, a majority of all voters in the poll suggested they understand her policies just fine. More than 60% of voters said they understood Harris\u2019s policies on the economy. Slightly more voters said they understood where Trump stands on certain issues more than Harris, but most of the differences were small. The widest gap was seen in how voters understand the candidate\u2019s tax policies, with 70% of voters indicating that they understood Trump\u2019s pledges, while 62% said the same for Harris. \u201cDespite some skepticism that VP Harris has yet to define where she stands, our data shows she\u2019s energized her base \u2013 particularly millennials, who will be the largest voting bloc this election \u2013 by effectively messaging and connecting with them on the issues they are facing as they move more into adulthood: childcare, housing and jobs,\u201d said John Gerzema, CEO of Harris Poll. Across the board, Americans still seem to be down about the economy \u2013 negativity that has persisted since Harris Poll and the Guardian first asked voters their thoughts about the economy last September, and again in May. Since the last poll in May, the economy improved across several key measures. Inflation fell back to 2.5% in August, the lowest it\u2019s been since 2021, and has been going down for the last five months. Though there have been some anemic job growth reports, unemployment is still relatively low at 4.2%. And the stock market has hit record highs in September. And all of this is despite the decades-high interest rates, which the US Federal Reserve only started to cut this month. But Americans are still feeling sour. When asked how they feel about the US economy now, compared with the start of the summer, 35% of respondents said they were more pessimistic, while 29% felt more optimistic (29%). Nearly three-quarters (73%) of all polled said they did not feel any positive effects of good economic news today. A majority of Americans (61%) believe inflation is increasing, when it has actually fallen significantly from its peak in 2022. And nearly half of those polled, 49%, said they believed the US economy was experiencing a recession. The US is not in recession. Though many seem to believe the economy is worse than it really is \u2013 particularly when looking at macroeconomic measures like inflation, unemployment and interest rates \u2013 most Americans are actually feeling better about their own personal financial situations. More Americans indicated they were confident in their overall personal finances (61%) and their ability to afford necessities (72%) compared with May. And when asked if they felt better off financially than their parents, 58% of those polled agreed \u2013 8% more than when the same question was asked last September. As shown with the last two Confidence Question polls, beliefs about the economy tend to be shaped by a person\u2019s political party. Democrats are far more likely to feel better about the economy than Republicans. Half of Democrats, 51%, compared with 30% of Republicans, said they feel optimistic about the future of the US economy. Something that Americans from both parties agree on: they still don\u2019t know who to trust when it comes to learning about the economy. And most respondents (78%) also agreed that most people don\u2019t know how the US economy is actually doing, despite it being their top priority in the election. This survey was conducted online within the US by the Harris Poll from 12 to 14 September 2024 among a nationally representative sample of 2,122. The margin of error for the survey is 2.6 percentage points."

            "date": "2024-09-15T06:00:48Z",
            "content": "Monday will be the 32nd anniversary of Black Wednesday. For younger readers, and older ones with ailing memories, Black Wednesday, on 16 September 1992, was the day the Tories lost their reputation for economic competence. True, they had lost it once before, when the Heath government of 1970-74 fell victim to the inflationary impact of the 1973-74 oil crisis, their economic boom that got out of control, and what became known as the disaster of the three-day week. But it did not take long for the Wilson/Callaghan Labour governments of 1974-79 to fall foul in turn of the same accusation. Public borrowing started to spiral and Labour had to go \u201ccap in hand\u201d to be rescued by a loan from the International Monetary Fund. In came the Thatcher government of 1979-90, followed by the Major government of 1990-97. I have written extensively about what I regard as the mistakes of the Thatcher period, but it was the enforced exit of the pound from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on Black Wednesday that was universally agreed to have put an end to the Conservatives\u2019 reputation for economic competence. Those were pre-euro days, and the principal motive of Lawson and Major was to tie the pound\u2019s fortunes to the Deutschmark, postwar Germany having had a well-deserved reputation for controlling inflation. Unfortunately, our entry could hardly have been worse timed. German inflation took off as a result of the enormous cost of absorbing the east German economy under the process of reunification \u2013 itself a welcome and historic event. The fact of the matter was that the pound had been attached to the D-mark at the wrong time, at the wrong exchange rate, and for the wrong reasons. The Lawson boom of 1988-89 had led to the second worst recession since the second world war, but the high interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank, the German central bank, to combat German inflation were holding back other members of the ERM. At a meeting of European finance ministers and central bank governors in Bath, Norman Lamont, who had succeeded Major as chancellor, tried to bully the Germans into reducing interest rates and therefore the pressure on the pound. Dr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, took strong exception to this. The German view was that the pound was overvalued, and that it was up to the British to deal with that problem. To cut a long story short \u2013 and the markets were going short of the pound \u2013 the belief that the UK could not maintain an overvalued currency became overwhelming, and speculation forced the pound out of the ERM. This eased our economy\u2019s competitive position, and economic recovery became sustainable. The following Sunday I suggested in my column that Schlesinger should be given a knighthood for having helped the British economy to escape from recession. Well, I can report that, although he was never awarded that honour, my friend Helmut Schlesinger is in fine fettle, and recently celebrated his 100th birthday. Within months, Lamont said he had been \u201csinging in the bath\u201d as a result of the easing of economic conditions. (He had certainly not being singing in Bath after his humiliating experience.) But Major had not been amused by the way Lamont had handled the Bath meeting, and replaced him with Kenneth Clarke, who handed over an economy in reasonable shape to Gordon Brown in 1997. There are swings and roundabouts in economic policy, and it was Labour\u2019s turn again to lose its reputation in 2010, when the Conservatives launched a brilliant, and deeply cynical, campaign to accuse Labour and its supposed overspending for having caused the 2007-09 financial crisis, when it was \u2013 as the then top Treasury official at the time, Sir Nicholas (now Lord) Macpherson, pointed out \u2013 \u201ca banking crisis, pure and simple\u201d. The result of that successful propaganda is that the current chancellor, my (almost) new friend Rachel Reeves, is obsessed by the perceived need to win back a reputation for economic competence. Unfortunately, so far she has been going about it the wrong way: penalising the poor while threatening tax increases for rich investors whom she is supposed to be wooing for investment in the UK. We await her first budget on 30 October. What she should be doing is taking a long-term view of borrowing for investment that should benefit future generations, and a long-, medium- and short-term view that we should apply to re-enter the European customs union and single market as soon as possible, thereby fulfilling the promise in the Labour manifesto (do older readers remember that?) to reduce barriers to trade \u2013 of which the most glaringly obvious is Brexit."

            "date": "2024-09-26T17:43:58Z",
            "content": "It is the season for special pleading, meaning warnings to the chancellor of the dire consequences that will follow if she fiddles with various tax reliefs in her budget next month. In the case of London\u2019s junior stock market \u2013 once known as the Alternative Investment Market, but these days just as Aim \u2013 the chorus is becoming deafening. The \u201congoing viability\u201d of Aim would be threatened if 100% business relief from inheritance tax (IHT) is jettisoned, said Julia Hoggett, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, in a letter to the Treasury reported by Sky News. Stockbroker Peel Hunt thinks the likely initial share price reaction would be \u201ca drop of 20%-30% across the [Aim] index\u201d. Are these forecasts credible and should we care? The answer to the first question is yes. The entire capitalisation of Aim is about \u00a375bn and roughly \u00a311bn can be ascribed to investors who are making use of the current system that allows 100% relief from inheritance tax on shares held for at least two years. Approximately \u00a36bn is held in IHT funds and about \u00a35bn comes from direct investments by founders, families and individuals engaged in IHT planning. It feels plausible that the bulk of that money would head to the exit if the relief was removed. One IHT fund manager says he would be \u201ca forced seller on day one\u201d. His fund, like others, is set up to deliver a tax relief to investors; if it cannot do that, he has a duty to get out. Given that liquidity on Aim isn\u2019t strong under normal conditions, one can see how a rush would become a stampede. Selling would be \u201cfurther amplified by other investors in Aim-listed companies recognising the negative fund flow and deciding to move into other investments,\u201d argues Peel Hunt persuasively. But should the rest of us really be bothered about the removal of a tax break that, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, distorts investment choices and has no inherent rationale? Removal, estimates the thinktank, could raise about \u00a31.1bn in year one for the Treasury, rising to \u00a31.6bn in 2029\u201330. Every little helps if, like Rachel Reeves, you need to fill a claimed \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d and have ruled out changes to income tax, national insurance, VAT and corporation tax. Actually, we probably should care. Aim\u2019s reputation as a lightly regulated casino may be deserved given the number of scandals and collapses that have occurred since its launch in 1995 (think Patisserie Valerie for a recent example) but, equally, one shouldn\u2019t forget about the hits. Fevertree, maker of tonics and mixers, listed a decade ago at a market capitalisation of \u00a3154m and is now worth \u00a3800m. Gamma Communications, a software and services business based in Newbury, has grown its market value tenfold to \u00a31.6bn over a decade. Learning Technologies, a workplace digital learning firm, has increased its market value from \u00a343m at listing a decade ago to \u00a3600m. In practice, many such success stories could transfer to the main London stock market without difficulty. But there would also be a chunk of family-backed businesses that would become easy prey at sunken valuations for private equity, which doesn\u2019t feel like an improvement. The point is that the end of Aim, or just a rapid descent into irrelevance, would cut off a source of funding for growing companies, which would jar with the government\u2019s \u201cgrowth first\u201d and pro-risk-taking message. For all of Aim\u2019s faults, companies have raised \u00a3135bn there since inception and there is a bias towards techie firms, which is usually deemed desirable. None of which is to deny the illogicality of the tax break. The case for survival is only the pragmatic one that sudden removal would create a funding hole in the universe of small- and medium-sized companies. If the relief has to be reformed, Reeves could make the process gradual, for example, by extending the two-year qualifying period or retaining existing rights. Nor is it to deny that Aim ain\u2019t what it used to be \u2013 it had almost 1,700 companies in 2007 and now only 700 or so. But that is also an argument for not clobbering it further."

Shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, owner of Truth Social, closed below $17 on Wednesday, reversing all their gains since the company\u2019s rapid rise took hold in January. The former president has been prohibited by a lock-up agreement from starting to sell shares in the firm until late September. While his majority stake in the firm is still worth some $2bn on paper, its value has fallen dramatically from $4.9bn in March. As a business, TMTG is not growing rapidly. It generated sales of just $4.13m in 2023, according to regulatory filings, and lost $58.2m. Nor is Truth Social growing rapidly as a platform. While TMTG has not disclosed the size of its user base, the research firm Similarweb estimated that in March it had 7.7m visits \u2013 while X, formerly Twitter, had 6.1bn. That same month, however, TMTG was valued at almost $10bn on the stock market. The former president is potentially on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of penalties following two civil trials, taking a significant chunk out of his personal fortune. Trump Media has, however, previously insisted that there is no \u201cconceivable sign anywhere\u201d that Trump plans to sell shares in TMTG. After being banned from Twitter and then eschewing the platform once the ban had been lifted, Trump recently returned to X. He participated in a lengthy interview on the platform with its owner, Elon Musk. TMTG\u2019s short-lived surge on the market was driven by its transformation into a so-called \u201cmeme stock\u201d, joining a small bevy of stocks, most famously the video games retailer GameStop, which rattled Wall Street by staging unexpected, volatile rallies. Digital World Acquisition Corp, a shell company, first announced plans to merge with TMTG and take Trump\u2019s fledgling media firm public in October 2021. But the process was stalled by a series of legal hurdles. Earlier this year, as Trump dominated the Republican primaries, and it became clear that TMTG would finally land on the stock market, Digital World\u2019s stock was drawn center stage. The volume of trading in Digital World \u2013 how many of its shares changed hands \u2013 increased exponentially. On one day in December, fewer than 100,000 shares were traded; on one day in January, 29.7m shares were traded. As with other meme stocks, interest was heightened by a flurry of internet memes, urging retail investors to buy in. What made this different was that many of the memes were being shared on Truth Social: the platform owned by the very company Digital World was set to take public. When Digital World and TMTG finally combined in March, it initially poured fuel on the fire. But as GameStop and AMC Entertainment have shown, the peaks reached during these rapid rallies typically set the stage for an almighty crash."

While TMTG is still valued at about $3bn on the stock market, after an extraordinary rally earlier this year, it has endured a steep fall in recent months \u2013 retreating more than 75% from its peak in March. Trump has a majority stake in the firm but has so far been unable to sell his shares. This is about to change. The first day that the former president can begin selling shares, if he chooses to do so, is 19 September. He owns nearly 115m shares of the company, according to a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TMTG runs the social media platform Truth Social, which Trump created after he was banned from Twitter, now X, and Facebook after the January 6 Capitol riot. Based in Sarasota, Florida, the company has been losing money and struggling to raise revenue. It lost nearly $58.2m last year while generating only $4.1m in revenue, according to regulatory filings. While TMTG has not disclosed the size of its user base, the research firm Similarweb estimated that in March it had 7.7m visits \u2013 while X, formerly Twitter, had 6.1bn. That same month, however, TMTG was valued at almost $10bn on the stock market. Shares of TMTG have been considered a meme stock by some market experts, which is a nickname given to stocks that get caught up in buzz online and shoot way beyond what traditional analysis says they\u2019re worth. The stock has fluctuated for the past several months, with trading largely driven by individual investors who are typically considered less sophisticated than day traders.

            "title": "Monday briefing: What Nvidia\u2019s stock market plunge means for the AI industry",
            "date": "2024-09-09T05:39:23Z",
            "content": "Good morning. For a long time, the only people who knew the name Nvidia were tech nerds and gamers. For about two decades the company was trundling along, carving a niche with its specialised computer chips, GPUs, which enhanced image display for computers, and making a tidy profit. But in the 2000s, experts realised Nvidia\u2019s chips could do more than process graphics for video games \u2013 the tech could also be used to process the intricate equations driving AI systems. Nvidia\u2019s decision to take a gamble on AI (and fortuitous timing), led it to eventually becoming the most valuable company in the world for a short time, overtaking Microsoft. Since the launch of ChatGPT, the company\u2019s stock has gone gangbusters, soaring by 239% in 2023. Its CEO, Jensen Huang (pictured above) has become something of a celebrity unto himself, and has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift of tech\u201d. GPUs are now the de facto way that generative AI is powered. But what goes up, inevitably, must come down. Geopolitical tensions, legal problems and concerns about an \u201cAI bubble\u201d have left the $3tn company facing an uncertain future, with $279bn (\u00a3212bn) wiped off its value in just one day last week. To unpick this story, I spoke with tech writer Chris Stokel-Walker. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Covid | A landmark study has uncovered corruption \u201cred flags\u201d in government Covid contracts worth more than \u00a315bn \u2013 representing nearly one in every three pounds awarded by the Conservative administration during the pandemic. Politics | As many as 50 Labour MPs could refuse to back the government\u2019s controversial plan to cut the winter fuel allowance, despite Keir Starmer urging back benchers to get behind a measure he has conceded is \u201cunpopular\u201d. Healthcare | Almost half of doctors internationally have been sexually harassed by patients, new research has found, prompting calls for medics to be given panic alarms to help repel such behaviour. US elections | Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are in effect tied heading into the final weeks of the election campaign, according to a national poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College, raising the stakes of Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate. Transport | Local transport authorities across England will be able to run and control bus services under a Labour overhaul designed to \u201csave vital routes\u201d, parliament will hear on Monday. The transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said the \u201cbus revolution\u201d would empower local communities as the government prepares to formally announce measures to make services more reliable. In depth: \u2018You cannot get the AI boom to work without Nvidia\u2019 To emphasise the centrality of Nvidia\u2019s products to generative AI, Chris equates its chips to oil. \u201cYou cannot get the AI boom to work without Nvidia\u2019s products\u201d, he says. Every company wants in on their tech, and it\u2019s theirs if they cough up anywhere between $30,000 to $40,000 per AI chip. And companies are more than happy to fork out those sums \u2013 Nvidia announced record revenues of $30bn in just one quarter. \u201cIf you track Nvidia from its initial public offering in 1999 to when it became the world\u2019s most valuable company, it experienced a 591,000% increase in its share price,\u201d Chris says. So, if the demand is there, why has Nvidia\u2019s value dropped so dramatically? *** Unsustainable growth For two years, Nvidia\u2019s growth has been unprecedented, and investors wanted the company to maintain its momentum. But the simplest explanation for Nvidia\u2019s plateau is that its rise has been unsustainable and time-limited. \u201cPeople thought that Nvidia was going to continue growing at that pace,\u201d Chris says. The company is now in a strange situation where, even though their growth rate is still high \u2013 their revenue was up a record-breaking 15% from last quarter \u2013 it still falls short of market expectations, with shares taking a 7% hit. \u201cPractically any other CEO in the world would be overjoyed with the growth that Nvidia is seeing, but because it\u2019s not like the obscene surges that were seen in prior years people are finding it a little bit underwhelming,\u201d he adds. The jitters around Nvidia\u2019s slowdown is mirroring a wider concern about sky-high valuations in the AI sector. For the last year and a half, Wall Street has been throwing bucket-loads of money into the sector, but now it seems that investors are slightly more reserved, as they become more clear-eyed about the extent to which generative AI is going to become a transformative, world-changing technology. \u201cI think most people still think that there will be an impact, but they maybe don\u2019t think that everything is going to change quite as quickly as many thought,\u201d Chris says. *** Supply chains While Nvidia owns the technology, they do not mine or create the raw materials themselves, leaving them vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Their primary supplier is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, and there is apprehension about possible supply chain disruption given the increasing hostility between Taiwan and China. \u201cThere is unease [about what would happen if] China decided to do something to Taiwan, then suddenly, what is already a very tight supply of chips which are being sold as fast as they\u2019re being produced, could become even tighter,\u201d Chris says. It has the potential, he says, to derail the whole supply chain. *** Legal woes A report from analytics platform CB Insights estimates that Nvidia has 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, effectively creating a monopoly. According to reports, the US justice department has begun ramping up an antitrust investigation into whether the company has breached competition laws. \u201cNvidia can, to a degree, both name its own price and terms, so there are some concerns by antitrust officials that the company could be offering perks to those who block-book with them,\u201d Chris says. The US is also highly concerned about Nvidia selling its chips to China, which, they believe, is using the technology to modernise its military capabilities. With a degree of success, Washington has set up a tech blockade by banning the export of advanced chips \u2013 but, as a New York Times investigation found, Nvidia has simply found workarounds and these chips are still ending up in China. *** Is there a bubble? Nvidia is not like one of the many so-called unicorn tech startups of the last decade that were wildly overvalued while offering very little in the way of goods, services or profit. It has sold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of its product and there continues to be huge demand. But Wall Street analysts are split about its future. \u201cSome are saying it\u2019s a boom stock, others aren\u2019t quite as negative yet but they have started winding down their expectations for growth in the last month or so,\u201d Chris says. In a situation where there is a bubble \u2013 and it does pop \u2013 the wider knock-on effect, not just on Nvidia and the tech sector but also on the broader economy, could be significant. \u201cThere is this worry in the air, where people are wondering, are we seeing a replication here of the dotcom bubble,\u201d Chris says. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t have the answer right now\u201d.

            "content": "A fall in US inflation expected to pave the way for further cuts in interest rates pushed stock markets to record highs on Friday. Ending a week of gains that began when the Chinese authorities approved a huge economic stimulus package, the S&amp;P 500 index of major US companies soared above 5,750 to register a near 34% gain on a year ago. Europe\u2019s benchmark Stoxx 600 index rose 0.5% to reach a record high, while the German Dax, France\u2019s CAC 40 and Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 all rose. US annual inflation, measured by the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred index, fell by more than expected to 2.2% in August \u2013 the lowest level since February 2021 \u2013 fuelling expectations that the central bank may cut the cost of borrowing more aggressively than previously forecast at its next meeting in November. The prospect of 0.5 percentage point reduction in the US rather than a more modest quarter-point cut came after figures showed inflation in France and Spain also fell by more than forecast, raising the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the European Central Bank before the end of the year. Recent reports by the International Monetary Fund and the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have shown global growth being held back by a sharp slowdown in the US and China. Some analysts have predicted that without extra measures to boost borrowing and investment, there could be a recession in the US next year and a sharp drop in China from the 5% growth rate target set by premier Xi Jinping. On Tuesday, China\u2019s central bank cut borrowing rates for mortgage holders and allowed investors to borrow more heavily at cheap rates. Later in the week, Chinese leaders vowed to arrest a slump in the housing market and boost growth with an increase in benefits for the poorest and extra funds to local authorities, allowing them to intervene to protect house price values. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u201cA veritable feast of economic stimulus measures has led investors to take a more optimistic view of the earnings potential for Chinese companies and foreign ones selling into the country. \u201cLower borrowing costs, smaller deposits for buying homes and more capacity for banks to lend money \u2013 these lay the foundations for greater economic activity among businesses and consumers.\u201d James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said the Fed would be under pressure to maintain the pace of cuts to interest rates after a series of indicators showed the economy was weakening. \u201cThe latest Conference Board consumer confidence report suggests households are becoming much more concerned about job security, which implies intensifying headwinds for consumer spending for all income groups,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an environment where inflation is looking much better behaved, the market pressure for ongoing substantial Fed interest rate cuts will persist.\u201d US data next week could show the unemployment rate rising to 4.3% and the number of additional jobs created falling from an average of 180,000 over the last year to below 75,000. Knightley said that with inflation low and unemployment rising, \u201cwe expect the calls for a second half-point rate cut to grow markedly\u201d. \u2022 This article and subheading were amended on 29 September 2024.

            "date": "2024-09-04T23:01:49Z",
            "content": "The government should award public sector workers \u201centirely legitimate\u201d pay restoration deals despite the tough economic backdrop to make up for more than a decade of real-terms salary cuts, the head of the Trades Union Congress has said. Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the organising body for trade unions in England and Wales, said Rachel Reeves\u2019s decision to deliver real-terms pay rises in July was a \u201ccrucial first step\u201d in dealing with staffing pressures in frontline services. But he said deals that simply reversed 14 years of wage decline \u2013 when public sector pay fell on average by 3.6% in real terms \u2013 would not go far enough to recruit and retain thousands of desperately needed staff, and above-inflation pay awards were needed. \u201cI think restoration of public sector pay is an entirely legitimate aspiration for public sector workers. It shouldn\u2019t be the limit of our ambition. I don\u2019t think that in 2010 the situation was perfect, by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d he told the Guardian. His words are likely to fuel attacks on Labour from the Conservatives, who have accused Keir Starmer of being \u201cin hock to his union paymasters\u201d after settling a series of long-running disputes with striking workers over the summer including junior doctors and train drivers. Nowak defended the summer deals, saying the Tories had \u201cplayed fast and loose\u201d with the pay review bodies over the years, while unions could have a \u201cgrown-up conversation\u201d with the new government. Speaking before the TUC\u2019s annual meeting of unions next week, Nowak said ministers would not be able to rebuild public services without staff, as employers including schools, hospitals and care homes were \u201ctrying to fill a bucket that\u2019s got a hole at the bottom\u201d. The TUC is proposing a new public sector workforce commission that would bring together unions, employers and experts to advise government on improving public services \u2013 with recruitment and retention a priority. Nowak said the unions wanted Reeves to set out a roadmap to rebuilding public services, including fair pay, in the budget in October \u2013 but added that he was \u201cnot kidding\u201d himself that it would happen overnight. While he acknowledged that the government faced a \u201chuge challenge\u201d ahead given its economic inheritance, the unions would expect \u201cbroader shoulders to do the bulk of heavy lifting\u201d on tax rises. He said there should be a \u201cnational conversation\u201d on tax, suggesting there was still scope to equalise capital gains tax with income tax, bring in new wealth taxes and make sure that online retailers paid their fair share to help raise billions for public services. Nowak suggested the \u201cdoom and gloom\u201d currently on display from government on the state of the economy was a \u201cnecessary corrective\u201d from the Rishi Sunak era. But he also appealed to Reeves to \u201cset out what we can do about it\u201d because people \u201cneed to see light at the end of the tunnel\u201d. He was particularly concerned about plans for winter fuel payments. \u201cFor those people just above the threshold, I think the chancellor will want to make sure that we go into the winter without those people feeling that they can\u2019t pay their bills or afford to turn on their heating.\u201d In response to anxiety from some business groups over Labour\u2019s new workers\u2019 rights legislation, Nowak argued that it would \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d for good employers as they already offered significant rights from day one. He suggested there was a \u201cmismatch\u201d between the business lobby and real-life employers, arguing that the latter sometimes had \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reactions against any changes. Companies he spoke with were more concerned about skills than they were about the cost of new staff. The unions \u201chope and expect\u201d the consultation would deal with implementation rather than watering down the plans, he said, and that the government would recognise \u201csiren voices\u201d in the sector for what they were. Nowak admitted frustration over the right\u2019s description of unions as Labour\u2019s paymasters. \u201cWhat they\u2019re describing is hundreds of thousands of working people who\u2019ve opted to pay 50p, 75p a week to support their union to give them a political voice. It\u2019s the cleanest money in politics.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-25T03:09:15Z",
            "content": "Inflation dived last month to its lowest rate in three years as government cost-of-living relief and cheaper petrol helped household budgets \u2013 but the Reserve Bank will wait for a more sustained drop before it starts cutting interest rates. Headline consumer price inflation in August was 2.7%, the slowest increase since August 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday. That compared with the 2.7% rate expected by economists and July\u2019s 3.5% annual pace. The underlying inflation measure, which strips out more volatile price movers, also fell. Known as the trimmed mean, this gauge came in at 3.4%, down from July\u2019s 3.8%. Electricity prices fell by a record 17.9% thanks to government rebates, while automotive fuel was 7.6% cheaper. \u201cExcluding the rebates, electricity prices would have risen 0.1% in August and 0.9% in July,\u201d said Michelle Marquardt, ABS\u2019s head of prices statistics. Renters, though, didn\u2019t get much relief, with the annual increase at 6.8%, slightly lower than previous months. Food and non-alcoholic beverages were 3.4% higher than in August 2023, easing from the 3.8% annual increase registered in July. It was the lowest reading since February 2022. While the inflation slide will be welcomed by households, it is unlikely to sway the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock. She wants to see the more comprehensive September quarter numbers, due out on 30 October, but is doubtful the drop will be enough yet to prompt an interest rate cut. \u201cThe board needs to be confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the [2-3%] target before any decisions are made about a reduction in interest rates,\u201d Bullock said on Tuesday. \u201cProgress in getting underlying inflation down has slowed and is likely to have remained slow in the September quarter.\u201d Still, Bullock\u2019s admission that the RBA board did not \u201cexplicitly\u201d consider lifting its cash rate at this week\u2019s meeting shifted market expectations. Investors bet there is about a one-in-four chance of a rate cut in November and a two-in-three chance by December, prior to today\u2019s inflation release. The inflation figures were much as the market anticipated, with the Australian dollar hovering near 18-month highs at just below 69 US cents. Stocks were little changed on the day. David Bassanese, Betashare\u2019s chief economist, noted underlying inflation was less than the 3.5% forecast by the RBA for the December quarter. \u201cIf annual trimmed mean inflation does not once again lurch higher, but continues its recent trajectory lower, there is a growing chance it could reach the mid-point of the RBA\u2019s 2-3% target band by year-end, which would be significantly better than current RBA forecasts,\u201d Bassanese said. \u201cIf so, there would be a good chance the RBA could cut interest rates before Christmas.\u201d Among other key items, the cost of building new homes or major renovations rose 5.1% from a year earlier. This gauge has remained at about 5% for the past year, \u201cwith builders passing on higher costs for labour and materials\u201d, the ABS said. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the August inflation numbers were \u201cvery welcome, very encouraging and very heartening numbers\u201d. \u201cWhether it is rent, energy rebates, our cost-of-living policies are an important part of the story but not the whole story here,\u201d Chalmers said, noting rental increases would have been at an annual pace of 8.6% without the commonwealth\u2019s rent assistance. \u201cWe are seeing right across a number of measures of inflation including underlying inflation that it has come off considerably in the new numbers that we see today,\u201d he said. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, said however that on average prices had \u201crisen by now 10% since Labor came to power\u201d, with those for \u201cworking families\u201d up by more than 18%. \u201cOur core inflation is higher than every other advanced country, peer country, in the world other than the UK and that is not one I would be wanting to compare myself with just now,\u201d Taylor said."

            "content": "Our main stories today: The anticipated post-election bounceback in the UK economy failed to materialise as activity flatlined in July for a second month, according to the latest official data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the pre-election stalling of activity in June was followed by another month in which gross domestic product remained unchanged. Although the economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to July, the weak performance of the economy during Labour\u2019s first weeks in power came as a shock to the City, which had been expecting growth of 0.2% on the month. The economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, followed by a 0.6% expansion in the second quarter, but the latest ONS figures suggest the recovery from the mild recession in late 2023 has petered out. Price growth continued to soften in the US last month, as the Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates for the first time since the start of the pandemic at next week\u2019s meeting. As inflation continues to fade, the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 2.5% in August \u2013 down from 2.9% in July, and below the 2.6% expected by economists. However, the core rate of inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, remained at 3.2%. The British steel industry has suffered a blow after confirmation that 2,500 jobs will go at the Port Talbot steelworks despite a \u00a3500m taxpayer-backed deal for the south Wales plant. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has agreed a deal in which the government will provide \u00a3500m towards the construction of a new greener electric arc furnace at the site, with the plant\u2019s Indian owners, Tata Steel, paying \u00a3750m. However, while the deal secures the long-term future of steel production at the south Wales site, the government was unable to secure guarantees that would save the 2,500 jobs at Port Talbot that Tata was likely to cut over the coming months. Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care! \u2013 JK Manchester United\u2019s new chief executive has said that the football club is working towards improving performance on and off the pitch, after posting a financial loss for the fifth year running following a poor 2023-24 season. United have embarked on a number of changes since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe acquired a 25% stake in the club and over the summer managed to secure new players, many of whom are under 25 years of age. Omar Berrada, who was appointed CEO in July after moving from Manchester City\u2019s parent company, City Football Group, said: We are working towards greater financial sustainability and making changes to our operations to make them more efficient, to ensure we are directing our resources to enhancing on-pitch performance. Our clear objective is to return the club to the top of European football. United\u2019s net loss ballooned to \u00a3113.2m in the year to 30 June, from \u00a328.7m the previous year. This is only the second time since the New York listing in 2012 that the club\u2019s annual net loss exceeded \u00a3100m. Shares were 5% lower in US premarket trading. United finished eighth in the Premier League last season, their lowest position since the league\u2019s inception. This season hasn\u2019t started any better, with two losses in the first three games. Earlier this month, Berrada said manager Erik ten Hag had the full backing of the club. For the coming year, the club expects an adjusted core profit between \u00a3145m and \u00a3160m, and revenues between \u00a3650m and \u00a3670m. It reported adjusted core profit of \u00a3147.7m on record revenues of \u00a3661.8m in the latest year. It said the estimate reflects the impact of recent restructuring initiatives, including plans for 250 job cuts. Gerrit Smit, manager of the Stonehage Fleming Global Best Ideas Equity fund, said: Although largely driven by lower energy costs, the sharp drop in US headline inflation to 2.5% for August removes all uncertainty whether the Fed will start cutting their target rate at their meeting next week. Investor focus has already shifted from inflation to economic growth considerations. James McCann, deputy chief economist at the investment firm abrdn, noted that the core measure of inflation was up a robust 0.3% month-on-month, the largest gain since March. Shelter surprised to the upside, with different measures of rents continuing to show quite a lot of heat. Other services inflation was also quite firm, although core goods prices continue to fall, providing some helpful disinflationary tailwinds to the economy. While the Fed will have wanted a softer print, there is a sense that the inflation story is starting to become yesterday\u2019s news. Indeed, with the pace of private payrolls gains slowing to a 10 year low though this summer, and the unemployment rate trending higher, the deeper concern might be that the economy is losing steam quite rapidly, reigniting the risk of a downturn. Indeed, the Fed looks set to cut rates by 25 basis points at every meeting this year with the bar for larger 50bps moves not particularly high if we were to see further growth scares. Here\u2019s our full story: Here is some instant reaction. Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, said: At first glance, today\u2019s year-over-year inflation data brings a breath of fresh air, hinting that the Fed might have room to cut rates more aggressively. Yet, there\u2019s a twist in the tale \u2013 the Core CPI numbers haven\u2019t painted such a rosy picture, throwing a wrench in the works for rate cuts. The market\u2019s response? The dollar index has found new legs, spelling trouble for gold prices. Meanwhile, equity markets are stuck in limbo as traders chew over the full implications of this mixed bag of data. Consumer price inflation in the United States has slowed more than expected to its lowest since February 2021. The headline annual rate of inflation fell to 2.5% in August, from 2.9% in July, according to official figures. This was below the 2.6% rate predicted by analysts. The US Federal Reserve has already signalled that it will cut interest rates at its meeting next week. However, the core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, stayed at 3.2%, as expected, complicating the Fed\u2019s job. Some more reaction\u2026 Ava Santina-Evans, political correspondent at PoliticsJOE, said on X: The Unite union said it was instrumental in securing the \u00a32.5bn fund for investment in steel, and is in ongoing talks on further investment which should include new lines being installed and generating jobs at both Port Talbot and Llanwern. This should be agreed over the next 12 months. The Unite regional secretary Peter Hughes said the deal avoided compulsory redundancies. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: The two stage government commitment to provide serious funding for steel in South Wales is vital for local communities and the long-term future of the steel industry. The last government was quite frankly asleep at the wheel. The present crisis is a direct result of it failing to invest in the UK steel industry and allowing the companies involved to rundown their operations and let them fall into disrepair. Conservative inaction and disdain have resulted in wholly avoidable job losses. Unite which secured the additional funding will ensure that the substantial second stage investment in South Wales means new jobs will be available and secure the future of Port Talbot and Llanwern. It is now imperative on Tata to bring forward the second stage proposals to develop increased steel capacity at its South Wales sites, a jobless transition will not occur on our watch. Speaking in parliament, Reynolds defended the deal, though. This will save more jobs. That\u2019s the point of the new investment. And for those people who are unable to get those new jobs, there will be better terms for them. The unions have recognised it as a better deal. Our Welsh Labour government has recognised it as a better deal. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has apologised, and said he recognised the deal \u201cfalls short of what would be my ideal\u201d. He told the Commons: The last government had been promising a plan for the steel industry for years. With what I\u2019m able to announce today, with the signing of a legally-binding deal that enables Tata to order their electric arc furnace as part of a significantly improved package, this government has made more progress in two months than they made over the last parliament. But even if we had started these negotiations a year ago, never mind many years ago as they had the opportunity to do, I have no doubt we would have secured an even better deal for the community, so I would like to start with an apology to the people of Port Talbot because they were let down by the previous government. Whilst this deal is much improved, I acknowledge very much it falls short of what would be my ideal. Reynolds had previously said he believed there was a \u201cbetter deal available\u201d and that Labour would ensure that job guarantees in return for investment were part of the negotiations, my colleague Jack Simpson reports. The Guardian understands that Reynolds had initially hoped to persuade Tata to keep the second blast furnace switched on at the site and secure more jobs but this was rejected by Tata because of the costs. The last blast furnace will now close on 28 September, with most employees leaving before Christmas after working their notice periods. Tata predicts that nearly all of the Port Talbot staff will be gone by March next year. Despite the job losses, Reynolds said the deal did what the previous government\u2019s deal could not do, and gave \u201chope for the future of steelmaking in south Wales\u201d. Here is our full story: The government has announced a \u00a3500m taxpayer-backed deal for the Port Talbot steelworks, securing the long-term future of steel production at the south Wales site, but was unable to secure guarantees that would save the 2,500 jobs that Tata Steel is likely to cut over the coming months. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, has agreed a deal under which the government will provide \u00a3500m towards the construction of a new greener electric arc furnace at the site, with the plant\u2019s Indian owners Tata Steel paying \u00a3750m. Reynolds claimed the deal went much further than the previous government\u2019s agreement \u2013 delivering a minimum voluntary redundancy payout of \u00a315,000 for full-time employees plus a \u00a35,000 \u2018retention\u2019 payment and offering paid-for training. The government said 2,000 workers had expressed interest in voluntary redundancy under this deal. Employees who choose redundancy will be paid 2.8 weeks\u2019 earnings for each year of service, up to a maximum of 25 years. About 500 new jobs are expected to be created to construct the Electric Arc Furnace, but this won\u2019t happen until early 2028 at the earliest. The government is putting \u00a3500m into the steelworks, but said it can claw back investment should Tata Steel not fulfil its commitments. This includes \u201cincreased penalty payments should the company not retain 5,000 jobs across its UK business post transformation\u201d. The government has also pledged \u00a32.5bn of investment to rebuild the industry and help it decarbonise, and said it would lay out a steel strategy next spring. As part of the deal, Tata Steel will release 385 acres of the site for redevelopment, which is expected to bring in more companies and employers not just from the steel sector but other industries. It comes after Tata\u2019s decision in January to close both blast furnaces at its Port Talbot site, putting 2,800 jobs at risk. The business secretary said: Port Talbot has always been and will always be a steelmaking town. This deal does what previous deals failed to do \u2013 give hope for the future of steelmaking in South Wales. Steel is fundamental to the UK\u2019s economy, sovereignty, and communities, but previous government inaction has blighted the steelmaking industry. That\u2019s why this Government is taking strong action through a new deal and strategy which will reverse the industry\u2019s stagnation and set out a long-term vision for a bright and sustainable future. We know that a cleaner, greener future for UK steelmaking is vital to the industry\u2019s long-term economic stability. The road ahead is not without its challenges but our steel strategy will set forth a positive vision for the future of the industry, backed by our manifesto commitment to \u00a33 billion of government investment. Boohoo is closing is US distribution centre just over a year after it opened in the latest sign of cost cutting at the struggling online fashion seller which owns brands including Debenhams, Warehouse and Karen Millen. Analysts said the closure of the site in Pennsylvania was likely to mean a \u00a334m profit writedown on the capital investment in the site, which had been distributing the group\u2019s Pretty Little Thing brand and had been intended to handle more brands later this year. Katie Cousins, an equity analyst at Shore Capital said: To us, the short life of the US warehouse (previously stated as a key pillar of growth for BOO) is concerning, highlighting a naivety of the American market, along with a waste of time and resources. Boohoo said it would continue to serve US customers via its UK warehouse and was testing new routes into the market including the recent launch of its Nasty Gal brand in Nordstrom department stores. These changes will result in a significant reduction in ongoing costs over the medium term. The group remains excited about the opportunity in the US. The closure of the US site comes as analysts said Boohoo\u2019s sales there were well below 2022 levels and forecasts from that time. The group racked up net debts of \u00a395m in the year to the end of February \u2013 down from almost \u00a36m of net cash a year before \u2013 after losses widened 76% to \u00a3160m and sales fell to \u00a31.8bn. Boohoo and fellow online fashion seller Asos have both been struggling amid new competition from cut-price online sellers Shein and Temu as well as the rise in popularity of secondhand clothing among young people spurred on by the likes of Vinted and Depop. Yesterday, Pretty Little Thing founder Umar Kamani, the son of Boohoo\u2019s founder and chairman Mahmud Kamani, said he was returning to run the brand, which he stepped down from in April last year. He said one of his first steps would be to reintroduce free returns for premium customers adding \u201cI sincerely apologise for any negative experiences you may have encountered during my absence.\u201d Drivers working for Bolt, the ride-hailing app operator, are seeking to be classed as workers rather than self-employed contractors at an employment tribunal. More than 12,500 drivers, who are represented by the law firm Leigh Day, are bringing the action against Bolt, an Estonia-based ride-hailing app which has been operating in the UK since 2019. The drivers claim they should be treated as workers because of the significant control Bolt has over how they work, and say they should be given the same rights and protections as typical workers. The high-profile employment rights case, which begins in central London on Wednesday, comes as the new Labour government prepares to draw up its plans to strengthen workers\u2019 rights in legislation. The TV production sector in the UK suffered a \u00a3400m fall in revenues last year as cash-strapped British broadcasters reduced spending to the lowest level since the height of the pandemic. The latest annual industry survey found that total revenues made by UK production companies fell by \u00a3392m to \u00a33.61bn in 2023. However, just as traditional broadcasters struggle, global streaming companies such as Netflix and Amazon continue to become an increasingly important income stream, the study showed. The latest bellwether census from industry body Pact said UK broadcasters such as ITV, the BBC, Channel 4 and Sky cut programming commissioning budgets due to factors such as a falling advertising market, viewers moving away from traditional TV and rising inflation. The freeze on the BBC\u2019s licence fee also led to severe spending cuts. The total amount spent on commissioning programmes by all UK-based broadcasters fell by more than 10% last year, from \u00a31.99bn to \u00a31.78bn, to the lowest level since the industry shut down during the pandemic in 2020. While spending by public service broadcasters \u2013 the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 \u2013 remained relatively resilient, budgets across multichannel broadcasters such as Sky plummeted by more than 35%. The report blamed this on part of the UK market being \u201cparticularly exposed to a difficult advertising market placing downward pressures on broadcaster margins\u201d. Bosses at Campbell Soup Company, whose cans feature in one of Andy Warhol\u2019s best-known 1960s pop artworks, have announced plans to drop \u201csoup\u201d from its name after more than 100 years. Its chief executive, Mark Clouse, said the decision to rename the group the Campbell\u2019s Company was part of a shift in focus to the other snack foods and jarred sauces it sold. The 155-year-old company started producing canned condensed soup in 1897 \u2013 believed to be the first in the US to do so \u2013 and has held the Campbell Soup Company name since 1922. Its place in US popular culture was further cemented when Warhol produced his screen prints depicting 32 cans of Campbell\u2019s soup with different flavours in the early 1960s. The PrettyLittleThing founder Umar Kamani said he was returning to the fast fashion brand, and one of his first changes will be to reintroduce free returns for its royalty customers. Retail Week described it as a \u201cshock return\u201d after he left the business last year. Britain\u2019s second-biggest drugmaker GSK has ditched its experimental vaccine for herpes after it failed in an early to intermediate stage trial \u2013 ending efforts to bring the first shot for the condition to market. The company said the trial for a therapeutic vaccine to treat the herpes simplex virus (HSV) did not meet its efficacy objective, and it won\u2019t be taken into late-stage trials. There were no safety issues. There are no approved vaccines for the virus, which causes genital herpes, although there is a shot for the herpes virus that causes chickenpox, made by the US drugs giant Merck. The Japanese virologist Michiaki Takahashi invented the first chickenpox vaccine. GSK said: Given the unmet medical need and burden associated with genital herpes, innovation in this area is still needed. GSK intends to evaluate the totality of all these data and other studies to progress future research and development of its HSV programme. GSK shares are down 0.8% on the news, but are still up by about 12% so far this year. Back to today\u2019s weaker-than-expected UK GDP figures. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said: While the relative weakness of the economy in July comes as a surprise, we are not unduly concerned over the outlook for the remainder of the year, not least because survey evidence remains positive. In addition, the positive household income background remains a helpful, if perhaps surprising story \u2013 real household disposable incomes grew by 3.3% in the year to Q1 \u2013 providing ample ammunition for continued household consumption growth. It is also worth noting that recent UK economic history is due to be rewritten on 30 September with the publication of the \u2018Blue Book\u2019 which will include revisions to GDP since 2023. Changes to the economic profile for the prior period have already been published and these showed that GDP growth in 2022 was revised up to 4.8% from 4.3%. Realistically we cannot guess the scale or even the direction of the forthcoming revisions, but we will be able to make a more definitive judgment after the new figures are released (the monthly GDP series is due on 11 October). In the context of interest rates, today\u2019s figures do raise modestly the chances that the MPC will ease policy at the next meeting on Thursday week. However the committee is more likely to want to see updated GDP data before rushing to conclusions on the economy and our base case remains that the Bank rate will be held at 5.0%. Shares in WH Smith jumped by nearly 12% after it said the latest quarter had been strong, in particular its UK stores, and announced a \u00a350m share buyback. The 230-year-old chain, which sells books and magazines as well as food and drinks, has been closing highstreet stores and is pushing into travel hubs such as railway stations and airports. It said revenues rose by 7% in the year to 31 August, fuelled by 10% growth at its travel division. Carl Cowling, the chief executive, said: We have ended the financial year in a strong position, delivering a performance in line with our expectations with good growth across our travel businesses. Our UK division performed particularly well over the peak summer trading period. We are also today announcing the launch of a \u00a350m share buyback, which reflects strong ongoing cash flow, the receipt of the pension fund buyout cash return, as well as the strength of our balance sheet, with leverage now within our target range. UK and European stocks have made some modest gains. The FTSE 100 index in London has edged 0.1% higher to 8,212 while the German, French and Italian markets are between 0.3% and 0.4% ahead. In London, mining and commodities stocks are among the main risers, led by Antofagasta, Fresnillo and Glencore. Oil prices have risen by 1.3% amid concerns about Hurricane Francine disrupting output in the US. Brent crude is trading 91 cents higher at $70.10 a barrel, while US light crude has climbed to $66.66 a barrel. REA, the Australian property company majority-owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, has made a \u00a35.6bn offer for Rightmove, the UK\u2019s biggest online real-estate portal. The Rightmove board rejected the 705p a share offer, worth 18.6% of the enlarged company post-deal, which comes a week after REA confirmed it was considering a cash and share offer for Rightmove. Shares in Rightmove closed at 555.6p on 30 August, the last trading day before news of REA\u2019s initial interest was revealed in the press, and closed at 670.8p at the end of trading on the London Stock Exchange yesterday. They rose by 1.2%, or 7.8p, to 678.6p in early trading today. REA said in a statement released on the Australian Stock Exchange today: REA confirms that on 5 September 2024 it made a non-binding indicative proposal to the board of directors of Rightmove regarding a possible cash and share offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Rightmove. REA was informed on 10 September 2024 that the Rightmove board rejected the proposal. Rightmove said: The board carefully considered the proposal, together with its financial advisers, and concluded that it was wholly opportunistic and fundamentally undervalued Rightmove and its future prospects. Accordingly, the board unanimously rejected the proposal \u2026 shareholders should take no action. Markets see a near-25% chance of an interest rate cut next week. Some economists (e.g. Capital Economics) say today\u2019s disappointing GDP data make a rate cut then a bit more likely, but overall economists still think November is more likely. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at RSM UK, said: The second consecutive month of no growth in July undershot expectations of 0.2% m/m and is clearly disappointing. But it won\u2019t be enough to convince the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to cut interest rates next month, especially as output in the services sector, where the MPC is watching price pressures like a hawk, rebounded. The next opportunity will come in November, when services inflation should have cooled enough to allow another cut. Turning to the budget on 30 October, he said: Disappointing growth will also add to the chancellor\u2019s misery ahead of a \u201cpainful\u201d budget next month. To really make a difference to the fiscal outlook though, she will have to convince the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that their supply side reforms to the planning system and boosting investment are going to kickstart growth. That looks unlikely without more radical reforms. The weakness in GDP was concentrated in the manufacturing sector, which fell by 1% m/m. Manufacturing is struggling globally, as surging exports from China, combined with weak global demand, especially for goods, weighs on production. Construction also dropped by 0.4% m/m as a wet July hampered construction efforts. Liz McKeown, ONS director of economic statistics, summed up the economic picture: July\u2019s monthly services growth was led by computer programmers and health, which recovered from strike action in June. These gains were partially offset by falls for advertising companies, architects and engineers. Manufacturing fell, overall, with a particularly poor month for car and machinery firms, while construction also declined. The 0.1% rise in service sector output in July was driven by retail sales rebounding and fewer strike days, although economists had expected a 0.2% rise. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, has crunched the numbers. Wholesale and retail output gained by 0.5%. Health and social work also rose by 0.5%, recovering half of the ground lost in June as junior doctors were on strike for two days in July compared to three in June. With no further doctors strikes planned, healthcare output is expected to jump again in August. Accommodation and food services did better than expected, rising by 0.9% month-to-month, stronger than the soft industry surveys had signalled. The downside surprise in services came in the powerhouse professional services sector, where output dropped by 1.3%. Wood said: That was a correction for unusually strong growth in the first half, when professional services output grew 4.4%. We expect this sector to return to growth in August. Isaac Stell, investment manager at the Wealth Club, said: A reversal in the fortunes for the manufacturing and construction sectors is a blow to the new Labour Government that has growth as a central pillar of its agenda. The usual bright spot was the bounce back in growth for the services sector with the health sector one of the leading contributors, springing back to life following strike action in June. A notable slowdown in advertising and architects may be indicative of a wider slowdown. With the canaries beginning to look a bit peaky, the chancellor may need to tread more carefully in October. A September interest rate cut is not certain despite the downbeat GDP data, said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. He explained: These figures confirm that the UK economy struggled for momentum in the aftermath of the general election as falling manufacturing and construction output caused overall activity to flatline in July. The UK\u2019s growth trajectory should slow further in the coming months with higher energy bills and expected tax rises likely to trigger renewed restraint in spending and investment, despite a boost from subdued inflation. Despite these downbeat figures, a September rate cut is not certain given that some rate setters are still sufficiently nervous over lingering price pressures to delay loosening policy again, at least until November. \u201cThe July GDP print was disappointing: despite the modest boost from the Euros, the UK saw broad-based weakness across the economy,\u201d said Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. Growth is normalising from the rapid pace set in the first half of 2024 \u2013 this much should be expected. The pace of the slowdown, however, is a little faster than we anticipated \u2013 especially in light of the still stellar survey data we\u2019ve seen over summer. The economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of the year, followed by a 0.6% expansion in the second quarter but the latest ONS figures suggest the recovery from the mild recession in late 2023 has lost steam. Economists say this does not mean that the UK will slip back into recession. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: The economy stagnated in July, but that doesn\u2019t mean the UK is on the cusp of another recession and we still think the stickiness of inflation will keep the Bank on hold in September. We still think a mild slowdown in GDP growth to more normal rates of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter later this year is more likely than a sudden drop back into recession. For now, we are sticking to our view that the Bank of England will keep interest rates unchanged in September before cutting rates again in November. But today\u2019s data has made an interest rate cut next Thursday a bit more likely. Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at abrdn, said: The economy performed a little softer than expected in July, with GDP flatlining. Industrial production and manufacturing were also weak, rounding off a set of weak UK data. As ever, though, monthly activity numbers are very volatile month to month, often reflecting more noise than signal. The broader trend remains solid, although it is likely that the underlying pace of growth will slow somewhat over the second half of the year. Certainly, there is no reason yet for the Bank and England to feel it needs to speed up the pace of rate cuts, and we expect the Bank to keep interest rates on hold next week. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: I am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge we face and I will be honest with the British people that change will not happen overnight. Two quarters of positive economic growth does not make up for fourteen years of stagnation. That is why we are taking the long-term decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy. Manufacturing was the main culprit behind the drop in industrial output (which also comprises mining and quarrying, and utilities) in July. Manufacturing output fell by 1% from June, and declined by 0.3% in the three months to July, compared with the previous three months. Our story is here: Bloomberg\u2019s political editor Alex Wickham said on X: Services activity picked up by 0.1% in July following a 0.1% dip in June, but did not show the expected strong pick-up while industrial production declined by 0.8%. Construction output was down by 0.4% in July. Services grew more strongly, by 0.6%, in the three months to July. There was also a 1.2% increase in construction output, while production dipped by 0.1% over this period. Professional, scientific and technical activities was the largest positive contributor to the rise in services output over the three month-period, up by 2%. The next largest contribution came from wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, where output increased by 0.7%. The UK economy continued to flatline in July, but grew by 0.5% in the three months to July, according to the latest official figures. Economists had expected GDP to rise by 0.2% in July. In June, there was also zero growth. The dollar fell by more than 1% against the yen to its weakest level of the year, after Kamala Harris put Donald Trump on the defensive in the first and only television debate in the presidential race last night. The yen also got a boost from Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa, who reiterated in a speech that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates if inflation and the wider economy moved in line with its forecasts. The dollar dropped as much as 1.2% to 140.71 yen, a level not seen since 28 December before recovering slightly. Economists at Daiwa Capital Markets said: After economic output moved sideways in June, we expect a return to expansion in July with growth of 0.3% month on month, which would leave the three-month growth rate unchanged at a solid 0.6%. Growth will in part reflect the pickup in retail sales of 0.5% that month, when a long-awaited improvement in the weather boosted demand. Surveys also pointed to growth across the services sector as well as construction, while the manufacturing output PMI rose to the highest level in more than two years. So, although factory production grew in June by the most in four months, we expect the expansion in GDP in July to be broad-based. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The UK economy is expected to have returned to growth in July, after flatlining in June. The latest GDP figures from the Office for National Statistics, out at 7am, are expected to show that the economy expanded by 0.2% in July, after zero growth in June. Deutsche Bank economist Sanjay Raja, who is predicting a 0.3% rise in GDP in July, said: What\u2019s driving the increase in output? Mainly, a stronger rebound in services activity, led by a pick up in retail and leisure services. Industrial production output also likely expanded to start the third quarter, lifted in large part by an increase in oil production, and to a slightly lesser extent, manufacturing output. Last but not least, we expect the construction sector to see its third monthly consecutive rise (0.2% month on month). Where are risks to our nowcast skewed? To the downside, with our modelled estimates having a downward skew relative to our point estimate. Looking ahead, we continue to see GDP expanding at a steady clip, averaging roughly 0.4% quarter on quarter in the second half. It\u2019s early days, but risks to our quarterly nowcasts are skewed to the upside, raising upside risks to our annual growth projection too. We are also getting figures for trade and industrial production at the same time. It\u2019s also US inflation day. The annual headline rate is expected to have fallen to 2.6% from 2.9%, while the core rate, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is set to have stayed at 3.2%. Investec economist Ryan Djajasaputra said: July\u2019s outturn provided further reassurance that inflation remains on a disinflationary path, with the 2.9% print being the first below 3% since March 2021. Early consensus estimates are for a further moderation to 2.6%. Also today: The British steel industry is braced for 2,500 job cuts at the Port Talbot steelworks, with thousands more jobs at risk in the UK, as the government prepares a taxpayer-backed deal for the south Wales plant. The business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, is expected to outline this morning the details of a rescue deal which will see the government hand the historic Welsh plant\u2019s owners, Tata Steel, \u00a3500m to build a new electric furnace \u2013 but at the cost of huge redundancies from the closure of its last remaining blast furnace. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chair of Tata Group, told the Financial Times on Tuesday that talks were \u201cgoing well\u201d and it was \u201cvery close\u201d to agreeing a deal. It is understood the government, which previously promised to \u201cpush for job guarantees\u201d, has been unable to protect these jobs, with 2,500 still expected to go in the coming months. The Agenda 7am BST: UK GDP for July (forecast: 0.2%, previous: 0%) 7am BST: UK trade, industrial production for July 1.30pm BST: US inflation for August (forecast: 2.6%, previous: 2.9%)"

            "content": "Prices in UK shops are falling at the fastest rate since 2021 despite an increase in fresh food inflation as wet weather hit UK production while the cost of olive oil and sugary snacks continues to be affected by the climate crisis. Overall shop price deflation was 0.6% in September compared with 0.3% in August, according to the latest figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body. However, that was led by reductions on non-food items \u2013 especially clothing and furniture \u2013 amid low demand because of unseasonal weather and a squeeze on household budgets from high bills on essentials including energy and groceries. Fresh food inflation increased to 1.5% from 1% in August as the wet weather affected British production of salads and soft fruit while storms in the Atlantic delayed imports of more exotic fruits, driving up prices. Hefty price rises for olive oil, which is counted as fresh produce in the BRC survey, underpinned the rise. Olive oil is now more than \u00a39.12 a litre on average \u2013 up 42% year on year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics \u2013 amid a drop in global production to the lowest level in more than a decade. Greece, Morocco and Turkey have produced less as part of the natural cycle of olive growth, while in Spain and Italy, trees are suffering from extreme heat and drought and attacks by pathogens as the climate crisis wreaks havoc on harvests. Packaged food price rises remained high at 3.3% in the year to September amid hefty price rises in cocoa and sugar. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: \u201cSeptember was a good month for bargain hunters as big discounts and fierce competition pushed shop prices further into deflation. \u201cShop price inflation is now at its lowest level in over three years, with monthly prices dropping in seven of the last nine months. This was driven by non-food, with furniture and clothing showing the biggest drops in inflation as retailers tried to entice shoppers back. \u201cEasing price inflation will certainly be welcomed by consumers, but ongoing geopolitical tensions, climate change, and government-imposed regulatory costs could all reverse this trend.\u201d She called on the government to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d on business rates \u2013 a big cost for retailers with physical shops \u2013 in the budget on 30 October, saying the industry \u201cfaces a disproportionate tax burden\u201d compared with other industries."

            "date": "2024-09-23T14:40:08Z",
            "content": "Time for a recap: Uncertainty before Labour\u2019s first budget next month is weighing on the UK economy, according to two separate business surveys. The data company S&amp;P Global said UK private sector activity growth slowed for the second consecutive month in September, affecting companies in the services and manufacturing industries. Some companies reported that clients were taking a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d to decision-making before the autumn budget, which is hitting investment plans, even as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, wants to encourage business investment to boost economic growth. The figures suggest Labour\u2019s emphasis on its poor inheritance from the previous Conservative administration and the need for a tough budget on 30 October were weighing on the immediate outlook for many businesses. The S&amp;P survey found the budget was \u201cby far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms\u201d. Export orders remained \u201crelatively subdued\u201d and total overseas sales rose only \u201cmarginally\u201d in September. The survey said: \u201cSome service providers noted higher demand from US clients, but manufacturers frequently suggested that weak EU sales had weighed on export orders.\u201d A separate survey of manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found that export order books in the three months to September were at their weakest since December 2020 \u2013 during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. More here: In other news\u2026 The economic picture in Germany is weakening too, with the economy being dragged into a contraction by its shrinking manufacturing sector. Billionaire Rupert Murdoch\u2019s REA Group has added another \u00a3200m to a sweetened offer for Rightmove, valuing the UK\u2019s biggest online property portal at more than \u00a36bn. REA lifted its offer after its first two approaches were rejected by Rightmove earlier this month. JCB has reported an increase in profits last year as strong US sales made up for its exports to Russia ending and faltering demand in the UK and Germany. Britain\u2019s biggest building society, Nationwide, is to let first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings in what has been labelled a \u201cgamechanging\u201d move that ramps up the mortgage price war. The price of petrol and diesel in the UK is falling at the fastest pace this year, with households paying about \u00a34 less to fill up a family car than they did a month ago. Fifty pubs a month closed for good across England and Wales in the first half of this year, with experts warning that tax rises in 2025 could make it even harder for some businesses to keep their doors open. Research has shown that house prices were not hit by the construction of a 137-mile electricity superhighway in Scotland. Back at the Labour party conference, a union boss has said Amazon should be at risk of losing taxpayer-funded contracts if it fails to \u201ctreat workers with respect\u201d. GMB general secretary Gary Smith accused the online giant of using \u201cdespicable\u201d tactics to stop workers at its Coventry site of unionising and questioned how it could be right for the company to receive more than \u00a31 billion in public contracts in the last year. In July, the GMB announced that Amazon workers in Coventry had voted by 49.5% in favour of union recognition \u2013 falling just short of the required majority. Smith said the ambition for the new Labour Government has to be \u201chigher than just cleaning up the Tory mess\u201d, adding its \u201chuge procurement powers will be critical\u201d. \u201cGMB members have been fighting to get union recognition at Amazon in Coventry. US business activity growth remained robust in September, the latest flash survey of purchasing managers shows, but election anxiety led to a drop in hiring. Dat provider S&amp;P Global has just reported that the US services sector drove a \u201csustained robust economic upturn in September,\u201d more than making up for a decline in manufacturing. The flash US PMI Composite Output Index has slipped to 54.4, down from August\u2019s 54.6, but still a level that shows robust growth. However, business optimism waned as bosses watched to see whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris would win the race to the White House in November. The survey says: A moderation of order book growth and a deterioration in business expectations for the year ahead to a near two-year low meanwhile reflected heightened uncertainty ahead of the Presidential Election. Companies consequently held back on hiring and allowed employment to fall for a second successive month. The prices charged by US companies rose at the fastest rate for six months, pushed higher by input cost growth accelerating to a one-year high, the survey added. Tensions are rising in Europe\u2019s banking sector today, after Italy\u2019s Unicredit took steps to more than double its stake in Germany\u2019s Commerzbank to over 20%. UniCredit defied Germany\u2019s defence of Commerzbank by using derivative contracts on Monday to raise its potential stake in the German bank close to 21%, while waiting for regulatory approval to lift its stake above 9.9%. Earlier this month Unicredit surprised Commerzbank by revealing it had a 9% stake \u2013 half of which was acquired from the German government. This has sparked speculation that Europe could see a cross-border banking merger. Today, the Italian bank explained: \u201cUniCredit believes that there is substantial value that can be unlocked within Commerzbank, either stand-alone or within UniCredit, for the benefit of Germany and the bank\u2019s wider stakeholders. However, as was the case for UniCredit, such potential requires action for it to be crystalized.\u201d Unicredit\u2019s move has ruffled feathers in Germany. Today, Commerzbank board member Stefan Wittmann condemned the stake-building as a \u201ccompletely inappropriate aggressive act\u201d. But in Rome, Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani declared today \u201cit was more than legitimate\u201d for an Italian company to try to buy part of a German competitor. Tajani said: \u201cThis is the internal market, being pro-European only in words leaves something to be desired, UniCredit is a big Italian bank and it is doing well to act within the internal market.\u201d One hundred and 50 UK MPs have written to supermarket chain Asda, urging it to end pay discrimination across its business. The MPs say it is unfair that mainly female shop workers\u2019 roles are paid up to \u00a33.74 per hour less than predominantly male warehouse workers. This issue is currently being examained by a employment tribunal, which began earlier this month. Asda is fighting the case, arguing that retail and distribution are two different industry sectors that have their own distinct skill sets and pay structures.\u201d The letter says: We, the undersigned MPs, call on you to take action against pay discrimination in ASDA stores. GMB union have told us that they have estimated women workers on the shop floor earn up to \u00a33.74 per hour less than their male counterparts in warehouses. ASDA\u2019s retail workers are currently owed over \u00a32 billion in back pay. Over 60,000 current and former ASDA retail workers have lodged claims and with the equal value hearing underway, now is the time for ASDA to begin seriously considering how to address the issue of pay discrimination. We believe it is simply unfair for people to be paid differently for doing work of the same value. Everyone deserves equal pay for equal work. As MPs with ASDA stores and workers in our constituencies, we urge you to urgently commence settlement negotiations with the GMB union. Signaturies to the letter include senior Labour MPs such as Diane Abbott, Stella Creasy and Rebecca Long Bailey. It comes as Asda struggles with a falling market share, and rising debts, with veteran retailer Sir Stuart Rose stepping up to run the business. In June, more than 3,500 workers and former employees of Next have won a similar six-year equal pay claim. An employment tribunal ruled that Next failed to demonstrate that paying sales consultants (mostly women) \u2013 lower hourly pay rates than warehouse operatives (who tend to be men) was not sex discrimination. Goldman Sachs Group are predicting that the pound will continue to rally against the US dollar, and hit $1.40 within a year, Bloomberg reports. That would be a notable increase on its current level of $1.33, and the pound\u2019s highest level against the US dollar since summer 2021. The call is based on the Bank of England\u2019s reluctance to accelerate the pace of interest-rate cuts, even though central bankers in the US and eurozone are acting more aggressively to support their economies. Summer 2021 Post Office chief executive Nick Read wanted the two post office operators appointed to the company\u2019s board removed, and blocked them from meetings on issues including pay and bonuses, the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has heard. Saf Ismail was appointed to the Post Office board as a non-executive director in June 2021, along with fellow subpostmaster Elliott Jacobs, in a move to repair relations and improve oversight as part of an attempt to overhaul the organisation and \u201cright the wrongs of the past\u201d. Ismail gave scathing testimony to the inquiry saying that while the other non-executive directors on the board welcomed the new appointments, Post Office executive members did not. \u201cThe wider executive made it difficult [and there were] situations we didn\u2019t feel welcomed by the wider executive,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI was told by an individual on the wider executive that \u2018we don\u2019t want to particularly deal with you and Mr Jacobs as we feel uncomfortable with what has bee happening\u2019\u201d. Ismail said that Jane Davies, the former Post Office HR director that accused Read of bullying and an \u201cobsession\u201d with remuneration, told him that he [Read] wanted them off the board. He said: \u201cShe categorically told said to me how the chief executive was not happy with postmasters being on the board. We were too awkward, too challenging, and he wanted that to be reversed. There were times when I spoke to the previous [Post Office] chair [Henry Staunton] and Jane Davies and they particularly mentioned how the wider executive ensured myself and Mr Jacobs were blocked out of meetings that involved talking about bonuses and salaries. We were actively excluded from their meetings.\u201d An investigation by an independent barrister cleared Read on all counts of misconduct relating to Davies\u2019s accusations against him. Ismail said that despite the promises to overhaul the culture and processes at the Post Office it remains too bureaucratic, and is focused on protecting its own employees instead of exiting those involved in the wrongful prosecution of subpostmasters from the organisation. \u201cI heard Paula Vennells say [to the inquiry] that she started to try cultural change in 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve even got off the ground.\u201d He said that until recently the two subpostmaster board members were not provided documents relating to various committee meetings, and recounted an example of the hiring for a role internally where the Post Office executive ignored the recommendation of a candidate by the board, instead appointing their own choice. Ismail criticised two initiatives launched to root out staff involved in the Horizon IT scandal, Project Phoenix and Past Roles, saying that decision-making was \u201cinquiry-led\u201d with the semblance of action only being taken after events at the Post Office inquiry put a spotlight on individuals. Ismail said that while subpostmasters were immediately suspended and then pursued legally, Post Office staff involved remain employed, and are often redeployed with a new job title, instead. He said there are 23 employees on a \u201cred\u201d list, deemed high-risk given their involvement in the scandal in one way or other, none of whom who have even been suspended. \u201cTo be clear from my observations at the time there was no particular appetite to deal with this issue,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cDecisions were \u2018inquiry-led\u2019. The default position in the Post Office at this moment in time is protect. Unfortunately this business redeploys, recycles. I don\u2019t feel it is appropriate for individuals in the red category to be in the business. I feel it is an insult. This is not a witch hunt, this is parity.\u201d Britain\u2019s biggest building society is to let first-time buyers borrow up to six times their earnings in what has been labelled a \u201cgame-changing\u201d move that ramps up the mortgage price war. Weeks after it was announced that the Halifax and Lloyds would allow new buyers to take out loans worth up to 5.5 times their household annual income, Nationwide said it would now go up to six times income \u2013 a first for a major high street lender. Nationwide is also cutting its mortgage rates and increasing its maximum loan sizes, so that someone taking out a home loan for more than 90% of the property\u2019s value will now be able to borrow up to \u00a3750,000 \u2013 up from the existing \u00a3500,000, and higher than the \u00a3570,000 limit at many rivals. The moves come amid an ongoing mortgage price war that has seen lenders jostle to cut their rates in the wake of the Bank of England\u2019s 1 August interest rate cut and the expectation of more reductions to come. Disinflation and interest rate cuts will stimulate UK growth in the rest of this year, credit rating agency S&amp;P Global Ratings has forecast. In its latest report, S&amp;P predicts that consumers will spend more as price rises slow, while businesses will benefit from lower borrowing costs, encouraging investment. Looking ahead, S&amp;P predict: Supply shocks following the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine are no longer fueling inflation. The opposite is now true, with shortages, energy, and food prices representing a drag on inflation compared to before the start of the pandemic. We expect this will be the case for much of the rest of the year. They add: The period of real wage catch-up as price inflation led to higher wages, and companies raising prices and increasing profit margins in response to higher input costs, is over. The model no longer underestimates wage and price dynamics as it did from second-quarter 2022 and throughout 2023. Profit margins are narrowing and companies have had to grapple with higher financing costs and weak demand growth. Consequently, they are less willing to increase their workforce or employee salaries. Newsflash: Swedish electric car battery maker Northvolt plans to lay off 1,600 employees in Sweden, including 1,000 positions at its factory in Skelleftea in the north of the country. Northvolt, which had been Europe\u2019s great hope for a electric battery manufacturer, says it is \u201cadjusting its near-term ambitions\u201d and focusing on deeloping its lithium-ion battery gigafactory at Ett, near the Arctic Circle. This, Northvolt says, will allow it to prioritize commitments to its current automotive customers. Northvolt is cutting 1,000 positions at Skellefte\u00e5, 400 at V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, and 200 in Stockholm. Peter Carlsson, CEO and co-founder of Northvolt, says: \u201cWhile overall momentum for electrification remains strong, we need to make sure that we take the right actions at the right time in response to headwinds in the automotive market, and wider industrial climate. We now need to focus all energy and investments into our core business. Success in the ramp-up of production at Northvolt Ett is critical for delivering to our customers and enabling sustainable business operations. Recent production records at Northvolt Ett show that we are on the right path, but the decisions we\u2019re taking today, however tough, are required for Northvolt\u2019s future.\u201d Post office owner-operators from a minority ethnic background are more likely to have been threatened with suspension than those from a white background, the inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal has heard. An anonymous survey published on the first day of the final phase of the long-running inquiry also received reports from eight subpostmasters who said that they had been suspended or threatened with suspension in the last three years after issues with discrepancies with the IT system had emerged. The survey, conducted by research firm YouGov, found that 8% of a total of more than 1,000 respondents said that they had been threatened with suspension by the Post Office in the past. However, it found that 12% of subpostmasters threatened with suspension were from an ethnic minority background, and 17% of those with an Asian/Asian British background. A further 4% said that they had been suspended and subsequently re-instated. \u201cSubpostmasters surveyed from ethnic minority back grounds were more likely than white subpostmasters to have been suspended and re-instated - 6% versus 2%,\u201d said the YouGov report. \u201cAs were those who have been serving subpostmasters for 21 years or more.\u201d Gavin Ellison, the head of public sector and not-for-profit at YouGov, told the hearing that the findings were statistically significant. Last year, documents released to campaigners revealed that lawyers investigating post office operators in the Horizon computer scandal used a racist term to categorise Black workers. Investigators were asked to group suspects based on racial features, a freedom of information request found. The document, which was published between 2008 and 2011, included the term \u201cnegroid types\u201d, along with \u201cChinese/Japanese types\u201d and \u201cdark skinned European types\u201d. Ellison was asked whether there was a link between suspensions and subpostmasters finding discrepancies in their accounts using the Horizon IT system. However, while he said that while there was \u201cno causation between those two factors\u201d the survey did find respondents who said that this was the case. YouGov published an addendum document relating to the issue which contained some anonymous written statements about the issue in the past three years. One respondent said: \u201cThere were shortfalls when we first took over the post office. We had complained but we were told that the computer doesn\u2019t make mistakes. An audit [was] done a few months later and we were accused of theft and threatened to be suspended if we didn\u2019t pay back the money. We [were] already told their system had flaws.. but they still accused us. Degrading us. Calling us thieves. Majority post office auditors made postmasters feel like thieves.\u201d YouGov qualified the experiences of these subpostmasters, pointing out that 69% of the overall respondents to its survey had reported having experienced discrepancies with the Horizon IT system since January 2020. \u201cA total of eight SPMs surveyed reported being suspended or threatened with suspension in the past 3 years and all stated that they experienced an unexplained discrepancy since 2020,\u201d the research company said in the three-page document. \u201cWe can only identify correlation not causation.\u201d The YouGov report showed that the 89% of the discrepancies reported by respondents was less than \u00a31,000, although 1% reported a discrepancy of \u00a330,000 or more. Shares in UK semiconductor group Alphawave have dropped by a quarter this morning, after the company cut its guidance for full-year revenue and earnings this morning. Alphawave make customised silicon chips and also silicon \u2018building blocks\u2019 that are integrated into chip designs. It reported a 51% drop in revenues, year-on-year, in the first half 0f 2024, resulting in a pre-tax loss of almost \u00a350m, down from a \u00a36m loss a year earlier. Alphawave lowered its guidance due to \u201ca merger of two large AI customers in Korea\u201d, which led to development programmes being consolidated. Tony Pialis, president and chief executive officer of Alphawave Semi says the company plans to help drive the next generation of artificial intelligence systems: \u201cWe are successfully executing on our strategy, with a significantly expanded range of advanced connectivity solutions, including chiplets, that will enable the next generation of AI and cloud infrastructure. In the first half of the year, we have continued investing organically to support our pipeline and future revenue growth. Our leading connectivity technology and strong execution give us confidence in the prospects for our business in the second half of 2024 and beyond.\u201d Newsflash: UK factories have been hit by a slump in export orders this month. The CBI reports that export order books are now their weakest since December 2020 \u2013 during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. Its latest industrial trands report has found that total and export order books at manufacturers deteriorated in September. A net balance of 44% of manufacturers reported that their export order books were below \u201cnormal\u201d this month. That\u2019s a considerable deterioration compared to August, where the reading was -22%. Worryingly, output volumes fell sharply in the three months to September \u2013 and manufacturers expect output to decline again in the three months to December. This is the first time since November 2023 that expectations have been negative. Ben Jones, CBI lead economist, said: \u201cThis was a uniformly disappointing set of results for the manufacturing sector, with output falling over the past quarter, order books deteriorating and manufacturers expecting activity to soften further in the remaining months of the year.\u201d \u201cThe survey highlights that the recovery of the UK economy seen over the first half of 2024 remains fragile, with uneven progress seen across different sectors, and businesses increasingly cautious ahead of the Budget at the end of next month.\u201d \u201cIn the meantime, firms will be looking to the Chancellor to reaffirm the government\u2019s mission of long-term economic growth, providing them with the confidence and opportunities to invest and grow.\u201d The UK PMI report is the latest sign that uncertainty around October Budget is a concern for businesses, says Daniel Mahoney, UK economist at Handelsbanken: Mahoney also points to last Friday\u2019s data showing consumer confidence in the UK has fallen sharply. He says today: While the [PMI] release is showing a broadly positive picture for the UK\u2019s economic prospects, concerns about the upcoming Budget feature prominently in the survey. We saw last Friday that consumer confidence has taken a knock due to worries about upcoming tax measures and businesses appear to be concerned on this front, too. In both the manufacturing and service sectors there were some reports of clients adopting a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach to decision making ahead of the Autumn Budget. Moreover, the most cited concern among UK private sector firms was fiscal policy uncertainty ahead of the October Budget. We continue to hope that the hit to consumer and, to a lesser extent, business confidence is short-lived given the fundamentals of the UK economy do not warrant this kind of pessimism. The news that Rachel Reeves is ordering investigations into more than \u00a3600m worth of Covid contracts awarded under the Conservatives has been welcomed by anti-corruption campaigners. The Guardian reported this morning that the chancellor will announce today that she will refer more than half of contracts for material such as masks to the incoming Covid corruption commissioner. Daniel Bruce, chief executive of Transparency International UK says this is an \u201cimportant first step\u201d towards accountability over governent spending during the pandemic. Bruce hopes that some of the money spent on pandemic equipment can be recovered, saying: \u201cWe have repeatedly warned of the scale of corruption risk in the former government\u2019s approach to procurement during the pandemic and have identified over \u00a315 billion of high-risk contracts in need of investigation. Today\u2019s announcement is an important first step towards full accountability for the serious procurement failings we saw during the pandemic and we urge the Chancellor to launch similar investigations into the 135 contracts we\u2019ve identified. Such investigations offer an important chance for the new government to recoup some of the millions of pounds of public money wasted on these contracts and implement lessons learned to ensure this never happens again. This month\u2019s slowdown in company prices rises, according to the PMI report, may make it easier for the Bank of England to lower interest rates soon. S&amp;P\u2019s Chris Williamson explains: In the meantime, services inflation, stubbornly elevated rates of which have been the bugbear of the Bank of England, cooled in September to the lowest since February 2021 to help bring the Bank of England\u2019s 2% inflation target closer into view. The survey data therefore support the view that there is scope for interest rates to fall further in the closing months of 2024.\u201d Capital Economics predict the Bank will cut rates once more this year in November, before the pace of cuts quickens next year with rates eventually settling at 3.00%. This morning\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d eurozone PMI numbers contrast again with a more resilient UK economy, says Kyle Chapman, FX markets analyst at broker Ballinger Group. The UK maintained its growth advantage versus the eurozone in September, according to the PMIs. While the eurozone economy slipped into contraction for the first time since February at 48.9, the British surveys signalled cooler but steady growth at 52.9. The eurozone numbers are not pretty, and they are providing some validation to those at the ECB calling for a quicker pace of rate cuts to ease the deceleration in activity. The economic rebound we saw in the first half of the year has completely fizzled out, and the return to contraction attests to the fact that ECB policy is probably more restrictive than necessary. Pricing for an October rate cut is ticking higher, and without a stabilisation in the growth outlook, there will be convergence to the more dovish rate path for the Fed - especially given growing signs of layoffs in the manufacturing sector. That\u2019s not a good picture for the euro. Meanwhile, the UK economy remains relatively resilient, and the gap has widened even further versus the eurozone. Everything about the report says soft landing for the UK \u2013 growth is cooling but remains robust, and inflationary pressures are evidently easing. There are plenty of softer price indicators in the report for the Bank of England to take comfort from, with employment growth slowing and growth in end prices falling to a more than three-year low. The pound has hit a two-year high against the euro, after this morning\u2019s PMI surveys showed the UK economy outperforming the eurozone this month. Sterling has gained half a eurocent to \u20ac1.1967 this morning, its highest level since early August 2022. Although UK company growth is slowing this month, the economy doesn\u2019t seem to be sliding into a downturn, reports Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics. Kerr says that September\u2019s PMI report is consistent with GDP growth slowing from 0.6% q/q in the second quarter of this year to a more normal rate of around 0.3% q/q in the third quarter. Kerr told clients: The fall in September\u2019s composite flash PMI is not a sign that the economy is on the cusp of another downturn, but instead is further evidence that real GDP growth has slowed towards a more normal rate in Q3 after the burst of growth in the first half of the year. Uncertainty ahead of next month\u2019s budget is weighing on the UK economy, the latest survey of purchasing managers across British companies shows. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that UK private sector activity growth has slowed this month, across both services firms and manufacturers. Some companies reported that clients are taking a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d to decision-making ahead of the Autumn Budget, which is hitting investment. Fiscal policy uncertainty ahead of the budget, due on 30 October, was \u201cby far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms\u201d, the PMI survey shows. Private sector employment growth slowed for the second month running to its weakest since June. But encouragingly, firms slowed their price rises this month \u2013 with the average prices charged by private sector firms rising at the slowest rate since February 2021. Overall, the Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index dipped to 52.9, down from August\u2019s 53.8. That\u2019s a two-month low, but still in growth territory, and much cheerier than in Germany or the wider eurozone this month (see earlier posts). Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says: \u201cThe September PMI data bring encouraging news, with robust economic growth being accompanied by a cooling of inflationary pressures. The data therefore hint at a \u2018soft landing\u2019 for the UK economy, whereby the fight against inflation is showing increasing signs of being won without higher interest rates having caused a downturn. Williamson adds, though, that concerns about the budget are \u201cjangling nerves somewhat\u201d, explaining: Investment plans in particular are reported to have been put on ice pending clarity on the new government\u2019s policies, especially towards taxation. Hiring likewise has been stifled by business uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook ahead of the \u2018budget\u2019. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged this morning that there will not \u201cbe a return to austerity\u201d. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning, Reeves said: \u201cThere won\u2019t be a return to austerity, there will be real terms increases to government spending in this Parliament. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is there will not be real terms cuts to government spending, but the detailed department by department spending will be negotiated.\u201d The downturn in Germany has pulled the wider eurozone economy into a contraction this month. Business activity across the euroarea has decreased so far in September, according to the HCOB Flash Eurozone PMI index. It has dropped to 48.9 this month, an eight month low, and below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. As well as Germany\u2019s slump, the eurozone was also pulled down by a contraction in France\u2019s private sector, as an Olympics-related boost to business activity in August faded. Business confidence continued to wane, as firms reported a drop in new orders. The recovery in the UK housing market, and the prospect of more cuts to UK interest rates, makes Rightmove an attractive target for Australia\u2019s REA Group, says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown: Streeter explains: Rightmove shares had been affected by the property market downturn amid a ratcheting up in interest rates. But now, with more cuts eyed on the horizon and a recovery in prices underway, there are now many more eyes on screen. REA Group is clearly highly tempted by the sturdy fundamentals of the model, which offers an envious operating margin position of around 70%. DIY alternatives may be growing, but they are only a small slice of the market, and many estate agents can\u2019t afford not to advertise on Rightmove. That\u2019s demonstrated by their willingness to pay bigger sums to attract potential buyers. Although total membership has reduced by 1% in the last full year, average revenue per advertiser was up 9% to \u00a31,431. Newsflash: the German economy is sinking deeper into contraction, dragged down by its manufacturing sector. Thw latest HCOB \u2018flash\u2019 PMI survey compiled by S&amp;P Global, just released, shows that business activity across Germany is falling at the quickest rate for seven months in September. German businesses reported increased caution among customers, deterring them from making investments; concerns towards the health of the economy were reported to be a factor. Total inflows of new business fell at the quickest rate for nearly a year in September, and firms cut jobs for the fourth month running. This pulled Germany\u2019s flash composite PMI output index down for the fourth month in a row, to 47.2, down from August\u2019s 48.4. That\u2019s the lowest reading since February \u2013 anything below 50 shows a contraction. Manufacturing shrank at the fastest pace in a year, while the modest growth in the services sector was the weakest in six months. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, fears that a technical recession (two quarters of negative growth in a row) in Germany is now \u201cbaked in\u201d. De la Rubia says: \u201cThe downturn in the manufacturing sector has deepened again, evaporating any hope for an early recovery. Output plunged at the fastest rate in a year, with new orders collapsing. In a sign of resignation, companies have shed staff at a rate not seen since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This comes as several major automotive suppliers have announced significant job reductions. These troubling figures are likely to intensify the ongoing debate in Germany about the risk of deindustrialization and what the government should do about it. Optimism is something of the past. Manufacturers are downright depressed about their future activity, with expectations for the coming year plummeting. In a striking shift, moderate optimism in August has quickly turned into the steepest pessimism in a year by September. This rapid downturn in sentiment is most likely linked to the wave of negative headlines surrounding Volkswagen, which has cast a shadow over the broader industry. Hamburg Commercial Bank predicts Germany\u2019s economy will shrink by 0.2% in the July-September quarter. That would put the country into recession, as GDP fell by 0.1% in April-June. Newsflash: Rightmove has said it will \u201ccarefully consider\u201d the new, inproved, takeover offer from REA Group, and respond \u201cin due course\u201d. In a statement to the City, Rightmove confirms it has received a third proposal from REA, which it dubs \u201cunsolicited, non-binding and highly conditional\u201d. Rightmove says its. board will \u201ccarefully consider the Increased Proposal, together with its financial advisers.\u201d Rightmove shareholders should take no action in respect of the Increased Proposal, it says. Andrew Fisher, chair of Rightmove, reiterates that REA\u2019s first two bids were both rejected for being \u201cuncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive\u201d. Fisher says: \u201cRightmove is an exceptional company with a very clear strategy, a consistent track record of delivery and a strong management team. The Board is confident in the Company\u2019s short and long term prospects, and sees a long runway for continued shareholder value creation. \u201cBased on the implied value and structure of REA\u2019s first and second indicative non-binding proposals, we considered these proposals to be uncertain, highly opportunistic and unattractive. Accordingly, the Board unanimously rejected them. \u201cThe Board will continue to act on behalf of our shareholders and respond to the most recent proposal in due course.\u201d Rightmove also points out that the 2% drop in REA\u2019s shares today has pulled down the value of its cash and share offer, from 770p to 761p [making the offer worth around \u00a36bn]. Rightmove has jumped to the top of the risers on the FTSE 100 share index at the start of trading, after Rea Group upped its takeover offer again. Rightmove are up 3.8% at 700p. That\u2019s still some way shy of Rea\u2019s new offer, which values Rightmove at 770p per share. There\u2019s drama in the government bond markets this morning, where Sri Lanka\u2019s debt is sliding after left-wing candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the country\u2019s presidential election. Dissanayake, seen as marxist-leaning, has capitalised on the anger and frustration that had emerged following Sri Lanka\u2019s economic crisis. Having won the vote, he has pledged to preserve democracy and clean up public life, promising that a \u201cnew renaissance will rise from this shared strength and vision\u201d. But Sri Lanka\u2019s bonds have been hit, on fears that the nation\u2019s bailout by the International Monetary Fund and debt deals could be threatened. Bonds fell around three percentage points, with a security that matures in 2025 losing 3.3 cents to 49.28 cents. Spending on health and beauty products is booming despite cost-of-living pressures, a new survey shows. The latest Barclays Consumer Spend data shows health and beauty has been the highest-performing category in retail since August 2023. Last month, consumer spending on health and beauty rose 7.3% year-on-year, while overall retail spending was up 0.1%. Nearly half of consumers see such spending as \u201cessential\u201d \u2013 a category which typically includes priority purchases such as groceries and childcare, Barclays says. Karen Johnson, head of retail at Barclays, says: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see that overall beauty spending has been in growth year-on-year, with August showing the highest level of growth in the past 18 months. Our data shows that social media has proven to play a key role in influencing online purchases, a further demonstration of the rising commercial importance of these platforms. \u201cThe health and beauty sector exemplifies continuous growth, likely driven by social media, particularly among younger generations. The key to a resilient retail model is examining these trends to better understand future purchasing behaviours.\u201d Elsewhere this morning, smart sensing software company Oxford Metrics has told the City that customers are being more cautious. Oxford Metrics told shareholders that it now expects adjusted pre-tax profts to be materially below current market expectations for the financial year. It explained: While the Group continues to have a healthy pipeline, the trend of more extended buying cycles has developed in the second half against a strong prior year comparative. Globally, we are seeing customers across our markets exercising greater caution and purchasing decisions are taking longer to conclude. A number of opportunities in the pipeline have now shifted into the new financial year. Shares in REA Group have dropped by 2.1% today on the Australian stock market, after it upped its offer for Rightmove again. Having lifted their takeover offer again, Rea also disputes Rightmove\u2019s claim that its approach is \u201cwholly opportunistic\u201d. They told investors today: Rightmove\u2019s share price has lacked any sustained upward momentum for two years, with a last 24 months VWAP [volume-weighted average price]] of 540 pence, a last 12 months VWAP of 540 pence and an undisturbed share price on 30 August 2024 of 556 pence, despite being supported by its ongoing share buyback programme and revised strategy announced at last year\u2019s Capital Markets Day. This chart shows Rightmove\u2019s shares jumped at the start of this month, when REA\u2019s original approach was announced: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. When bidding for property, it\u2019s important not to take no for an answer. Australia\u2019s REA Group is taking this advice seriously, and has just launched its third offer to buy UK housing portal Rightmove. After being rebuffed twice this month, REA has upped its offer again. It is now proposing to pay around \u00a36.1bn for the UK\u2019s biggest online property portal. REA\u2019s offer is worth 770p per Rightmove share \u2013 structured as 341p in cash and 0.0422 new REA shares In a statement to the Australia stock market this morning, Owen Wilson, CEO of REA, insisted the deal made sense, saying: \u201cWe believe that the combination of our world-leading expertise and technology with the attractive Rightmove business will create an enhanced experience for agents, buyers and sellers of property. We live in a world of intensifying competition and this proposed transaction would bring together two highly complementary digital property businesses for investment and growth. Wilson added that REA is \u201cgenuinely disappointed at the lack of engagement by Rightmove\u2019s Board\u201d. REA, which is majority owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, made its first approach to Rightmove on 5 September, when it proposed paying 705p per share, or \u00a35.6bn. That was rebuffed, with Rightmove\u2019s board saying it \u201cfundamentally\u201d undervalued the company. Then on Friday night, news broke that REA had increased its offer by \u00a3300m. Rightmove weren\u2019t commenting officially on that offer yesterday, but Bloomberg reported that \u201cpeople familiar with the matter\u2019\u201d said it had been rejected. Now, Rightmove\u2019s board must ponder this third offer. The company\u2019s shares closed at 674p on Friday night (before news of the second offer broke), which values Rightmove at \u00a35.32bn. Also coming up today Surveys of purchasing managers across the UK, Eurozone and the US will show how major economies are faring this month. And in Liverpool, chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to promise \u201ca Budget to rebuild Britain\u201d in her speech to the Labour Party conference today.

            "title": "Mario Draghi warns EU at risk without \u20ac800bn a year investment boost; Germany \u2018facing three-quarters-long recession\u2019\u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2024-09-09T15:00:14Z",
            "content": "PS: Investment bank ABN Amro have just published their \u201cinitial take\u201d on Draghi\u2019s competitiveness report. They point out that the \u201cambitious proposals\u201d are effectively a plan for the future of EU integration. The call for common eurozone debt will be a political hot potato too, while Draghi\u2019s points about mis-aligned government policies are well made. Here\u2019s what ABN Amro say: Ambitious proposals are no less than a blueprint for the future of EU integration Former ECB president and Italian prime minister Mario Draghi\u2019s long-awaited report on competitiveness was finally unveiled this morning, and it was unexpectedly substantial and concrete in its proposals. The report tackles a host of critical competitiveness issues facing Europe, from energy and decarbonisation, to lowering regulatory and other barriers for high-innovating tech unicorns (which typically move to the US to achieve sufficient scale), to strengthening industrial capacity (which also has implications for defence \u2013 a topic of increasing geopolitical importance). Its flagship proposal is for \u20ac800bn in additional EU investment annually, to be partly funded by the common issuance of new common debt. Crucially, the case for common debt issuance rests not only on financing need, but also to \u201cmake the [Capital Markets Union] much easier to achieve and more complete,\u201d by: 1) facilitating the uniform pricing of corporate bonds, 2) providing a safe collateral instrument for member states, 3) a \u201clarge, liquid market\u201d for global investors \u201cenhancing the role of the euro as a reserve currency.\u201d The proposals face an uphill political struggle, to put it mildly In the press conference accompanying the report, European Commission president Von der Leyen was immediately asked for her views on the call for new common debt issuance. Her response was understandably neutral, given the political sensitivity of the topic. She stated that the first priority was to identify the \u2018common projects\u2019 where member states could cooperate, and then decide whether these should be financed through higher contributions or through \u2018new own resources\u2019. When Draghi himself was pressed on this topic, he pointed to the possibility of using the EU\u2019s enhanced cooperation mechanism \u2013 or even a separate intergovernmental agreement outside the EU structures \u2013 to allow a \u2018coalition of the willing\u2019 to forge ahead on debt issuance if unanimity could not be achieved on the issue. Given the political momentum of populist, anti-EU parties at present (see also here), the environment is hardly conducive to the proposals being adopted as they are. A memorable moment in the press conference came when a journalist asked if the report represented a \u2018do or die\u2019 moment for the EU; Draghi responded it was rather a \u2018do, or slow agony\u2019. Typically, crises are needed to push EU integration forward, and it could be that the \u2018slow agony\u2019 of the EU\u2019s competitiveness problem will not be enough to galvanise the political will to overcome it. But there is much more to the report than common debt While this was the most headline-grabbing proposal, the report made many pertinent observations with less controversial, actionable measures. For instance, in the press conference Draghi pointed out that the mandate to phase out internal combustion engine cars was not accompanied by investment in energy infrastructure to support the roll-out of EVs. Or the fact that energy taxation in Europe is relatively high as well as uneven across member states, aggravating the impact of the rise in wholesale energy prices. Policy goals are often misaligned and even compete with one another, with decarbonisation an impediment to growth rather than the growth impulse that it could be. Time for a recap: The EU should fear for its self-preservation as it faces a \u201cslow and agonising decline\u201d, according to a hard-hitting report by the former Italian prime minister Mario Draghi that calls for an \u20ac800bn-a-year spending boost to end years of stagnation. Warning that the Covid pandemic and Ukraine war had changed the rules of international trade to the EU\u2019s detriment, he said the bloc needed additional investment of \u20ac750bn-\u20ac800bn a year \u2013 equivalent to 5% of the EU\u2019s annual economic output \u2013 to build a more resilient economy and regain previously high rates of productivity growth. \u201cWe are already in crisis mode and to ignore this is to slide into a situation you don\u2019t want to have,\u201d said Draghi, who is also a former head of the European Central Bank. In a wide-ranging report, Draghi said Europe should start regularly issuing \u201ccommon safe assets\u201d to fund joint investment projects among Member States, co-ordinate better on defence spending, and improve its access to raw materials. And in a stark warning, he said: \u201cWe have to understand we are becoming ever smaller relative to the challenges we face. For the first time since the cold war we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation.\u201d German economy minister Robert Habeck welcomed the proposal, saying: \u201cThe whole of Europe is facing existential challenges that we can only overcome together.\u201d But, the Dutch government cautioned that public investments must not be seen as an \u201cend in themselves.\u201d In a gloomy day for European economic news: Swedish manufacturer Northvolt is to cut a large number of jobs and sell or seek partners for its energy storage and materials businesses. Germany has entered a three-quarter-long recession, according to investment bank Nomura Elsewhere today\u2026. In the financial markets, shares have rallied in New York and across Europe, following losses on Friday when the latest US jobs report came in below forecasts. The UK is missing out on billions of pounds of revenue each year from small retail businesses that exploit weaknesses in government systems to evade paying tax, the public spending watchdog has warned. Aldi has said the price of a basket of its goods is lower than a year ago despite ongoing grocery inflation, as the discount chain tries to fight back against increasing pressure from rivals\u2019 price-matching schemes. Barratt and Lloyds Banking Group have launched a \u00a3150m joint venture with the government body Homes England that will lead to the UK\u2019s largest housebuilder and mortgage provider capitalising on Labour\u2019s plans to build 1.5m new homes. The Bank of London, the fledgling clearing bank backed by the Labour grandee Lord Mandelson, has announced it has raised another \u00a342m from investors days after being hit by a winding-up order by tax authorities. The oil and gas supermajor BP is to use artificial intelligence to speed up the decision-making of its engineers, after signing a five-year deal with the US spy technology company Palantir. Japanese bank Nomura has a worrying prediction \u2013 they believe Germany has entered a three-quarters-long recession. It would be a relatively shallow downturn, though \u2013 Nomura predict a 0.4 percentage point drop in GDP, followed by stagnation. We already know that Germany shrank slightly in April-June; Nomura predict this contraction will continue. They say: Q2 2024 GDP growth contracted against expectations, with the expenditure breakdown indicating that the decline in domestic demand was more pronounced than expected. Official data suggest that Q3 is off to a poor start; July factory sales and industrial output fell materially, with August manufacturing surveys indicating further deterioration. Services surveys, too, have materially weakened in Q3 thus far relative to Q2. Germany\u2019s recession, in addition to France\u2019s stagnation, will weigh on euro area GDP growth, they predict \u2013 while the eurozone periphery will likely outperform due to tourism. Kim Fausing, President and CEO of Danish multinational company Danfoss, has welcomed Mario Draghi\u2019s report into Europe\u2019s competitiveness failings: Fausing says: \u201cEurope is falling behind and we need to shift gears. That\u2019s why I welcome Mr Draghi\u2019s report today and his call for a new industrial strategy for Europe. We\u2019ve known for some time that productivity in the EU is lagging behind other key markets, contributing to a decline in competitiveness. When you look at a list of 44 so-called critical technologies, Europe is not a leader in a single one. The Draghi report rightly points out that EU companies still face electricity prices that are 2-3 times those in the US and that natural gas prices paid are 4-5 times higher. This impacts production costs, and thereby also competitiveness. Fausing remains \u201ca stubborn optimist\u201d when it comes to Europe\u2019s future, but agrees that a change of mindset is needed \u2013 including a new industrial policy: We must step up and drive momentum by investing in innovation and focusing on Competitive Decarbonization. That is decarbonizing industries while making them more resilient and increasing economic competitiveness. I see a lot of momentum among industry leaders, and European companies have enormous potential if we get the right political framework and double down on energy efficiency, electrification and renewables. What I am calling for is an active, forward-looking industrial policy, which has a focus on implementation and follow-up that can create growth. Only by working together can we turn this around, ensure Europe takes a leading position in key sectors, and create high-quality jobs.\u201d Back in London, the FTSE 100 continues to rally. It\u2019s now up 71 points or 0.87% at 8252 points, more than recovering all of Friday\u2019s drop. That\u2019s despite analysts at UBS downgrading their view on UK shares to Neutral from Most Preferred. In a research note this morning, UBS says there are several reasons to be positive about UK equities \u2013 including the return of political stability, last month\u2019s interest rate cut by the Bank of England, and a likely return to earnings growth this year. Another advantage \u2013 UK stocks still suffer from \u201cundemanding valuations\u201d, with shares trading at a lower price/earnings ratio than the long-running average. So what\u2019s the problem? UBS analyst Dean Turner reckons these positive developments seem to be \u201clargely priced in\u201d, adding: \u2026.which suggests that UK equities will struggle to outperform their international peers in what we expect to be a positive year-end for stocks Turner does predict UK stocks will keep rallying, pushing the FTSE to rise to around 9,000 by year-end. That would be a new alltime high (the previous best was 8,474 points back in May). Over on Wall Street, shares have opened higher as investors try to put Friday\u2019s wobble behind them: Dow Jones Industrial Average: up 228 points or 0.57% at 40,574 points S&amp;P 500 share index: up 42 points or 0.8% at 5,451 points Nasdaq Composite, up 168 points or 1% at 16,858 points. Lucas Guttenberg, senior advisor at Bertelsmann Stiftung, says Mario Dragihi\u2019s report is \u201csurprisingly good\u201d \u2013 indeed, better than another report from another former Italian PM, Enrico Letta, into \u201cthe future of the single market\u201d. Over in Berlin, German economy minister Robert Habeck has vooiced support for Mario Draghi\u2019s proposals. Habeck says he agrees that the European Union needed massive investment, comprehensive reforms and strengthened resilience. He said: \u201cThe whole of Europe is facing existential challenges that we can only overcome together.\u201d \u201cDefence\u201d appears 90 times in Mario Draghi\u2019s report into Europe\u2019s competitiveness. Daniel Fiott, head of the defence and statecraft programme at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy, has summarised the main points: The Dutch government have given a slightly lukewarm response to Mario Draghi\u2019s proposals to fix Europe\u2019s competitiveness problems. Amsterdam says it agrees with some of Draghi\u2019s ideas, but also cautions that public investments must not be seen as an \u201cend in themselves.\u201d In remarks sent to Reuters by the Economic Affairs ministry, a spokesperson said the Netherlands was still studying the former European Central Bank chief\u2019s new report but that it agreed with the need for more integrated European policy and less \u201cregulatory burden\u201d. The Netherlands\u2019 conservative government has a reference in its governing pact that it does not support creating new instruments for sharing debt at the European level. European lithium-ion battery maker Northvolt is an illustration of the problems Mario Draghi is concerned about. Northvolt is to cut jobs and sell or seek partners for its energy storage and materials businesses, the Financial Times reports, as it tries to ride out problems in Europe\u2019s move to electric cars. The company has decided to pause its cathode active material production, selling one site and buying instead from Chinese or Korean companies, the FT says. This will help it focus on first gigafactory in northern Sweden, which began production in 2021. Peter Carlsson, Northvolt\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, has explained: \u201cBuilding a battery company from scratch is a profoundly capital-intensive and challenging endeavour. We have come a long way\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. \u2009Now it\u2019s time to focus on the core, to learn from the past and to scale up our core business to make sure that we can meet our customers\u2019 expectations and to help Europe achieve a sustainable battery ecosystem, Europe also needs to take steps to increase and secures its access to critical raw materials (CRMs), today\u2019s competition report says. Those CRMs include metals used in clean energy technologies such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. China is the single largest processer of nickel, copper, lithium and cobalt, the report says, pointing to Beijing\u2019s \u201cwillingness to use its market power\u201d: Export restrictions from the country grew by a factor of nine between 2009 and 2020. Little progress is being made so far with diversification. Europe, the report concludes, is \u201cfalling behind\u201d in the global race to secure supply chains: Alongside its dominant position in processing and refining, China is actively investing in mining assets in Africa and Latin America and overseas refining via its Belt and Road initiative. Its overseas investment in metals and mining through the Belt and Road Initiative reached a record high of $10bn in the first half of 2023 alone, and it plans to double the ownership of overseas mines containing critical minerals by Chinese companies. The US has deployed the IRA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and defence funding to develop at scale domestic processing, refining and recycling capacity, as well as using its geopolitical power to secure the global supply chain. Japan is highly dependent on other regions for CRMs, and since the 2000s it has developed a strategic approach to increase access to overseas mining projects. The Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security invests equity in mining and refining assets around the world, manages strategic stockpiling and, since the introduction of the recent economic security law, has powers to develop processing and refining facilities within Japan. Europe, by contrast, has a comparable level of dependencies, being highly dependent on one or two countries for most of its critical mineral imports. However, it is not following a similarly coordinated approach. The EU is lacking a comprehensive strategy covering all stages of the supply chain (from exploration to recycling) and, unlike its competitors, the mining and trading of commodities is largely left to private actors and the market. A key message running though Mario Draghi\u2019s report into Europe\u2019s competitiveness problems is that member states need to bolster their collective efforts and work together better. That includes combining its spending power, winning foreign direct investment together, and using its bargaining power to negotiate cheaper energy. But the most controversial part of the report could be the suggestion that Europe should start regularly issuing \u201ccommon safe assets\u201d to fund joint investment projects among Member States and to help integrate capital markets. That would be a step towards eurobonds, in which member states issue collective debt. Eurobonds were proposed as a solution to Europe\u2019s debt crisis over a decade ago \u2013 the problem is that wealthier, more frugal Northern European countries fear being responsible for debt issued for their Southern neighbours. The economic crisis in Germany, though, may mean those fears are less strong. Some collective EU debt has already been issued in recent years, under the Next Generation EU (NGEU) project to fund the recovery from the pandemic. Draghi\u2019s report suggests the NGEU model can be \u201cbuilt on\u201d, to issue common debt instruments, to finance \u201cjoint investment projects that will increase the EU\u2019s competitiveness and security\u201d. On defence, Mario Draghi argues that EU members must \u201cjoin forces\u201d to help European manufacturers. His report says points out that the EU is collectively the world\u2019s second largest military spender \u2013 but only a fifth of that money goes to EU companies: European collaborative procurement accounted for less than a fifth of spending on defence equipment procurement in 2022. We also do not favour competitive European defence companies. Between mid-2022 and mid-2023, 78% of total procurement spending went to non-EU suppliers, out of which 63% went to the US. The competition report also flags that the \u201cprolonged period of peace in Europe and the US security umbrella\u201d has allowed countries to cut defence spending (to fund other commitments). Now, only ten Member States now spend more than or equal to 2% of GDP in line with NATO commitments, although defence expenditures are rising\u2026. Skimming though Mario Draghi\u2019s report, there\u2019s a stark warning that Europe\u2019s position in the advanced technologies that will drive future growth is declining. It poounts out that only four of the world\u2019s top 50 tech companies are European and the EU\u2019s share of global tech revenues dropped from 22% to 18% between 2013 and 2023, while the US share rose from 30% to 38%. The report says: Technological change is accelerating rapidly. Europe largely missed out on the digital revolution led by the internet and the productivity gains it brought: in fact, the productivity gap between the EU and the US is largely explained by the tech sector. The EU is weak in the emerging technologies that will drive future growth. Only four of the world\u2019s top 50 tech companies are European. The Draghi report shows clearly how Europe\u2019s weak productivity growth has led to slower income growth and weaker domestic demand in Europe. On a per capita basis, real disposable income has grown almost twice as much in the US as in the EU since 2000, it says. The report says: EU economic growth has been persistently slower than in the US over the past two decades, while China has been rapidly catching up. This chart shows how Europe\u2019s economy has struggled to keep up with both the US and China since 2002: You can read Mario Draghi\u2019s new report into Europe\u2019s economic problems here: The future of European competitiveness It explains that to digitalise and decarbonise the economy and increase defence capacity, the investment share in Europe will have to rise by around 5 percentage points of GDP. That would take it back to levels last seen in the 1960s and 70s. And it\u2019s much, much larger than the Marshall Plan \u2013 which between 1948-51 amounted to around 1-2% of GDP annually. The report declares firmly that Europe faces an existential challenge, saying: If Europe cannot become more productive, we will be forced to choose. We will not be able to become, at once, a leader in new technologies, a beacon of climate responsibility and an independent player on the world stage. We will not be able to finance our social model. We will have to scale back some, if not all, of our ambitions. And in an eye-catching warning to European policymakers, the report warns that if the EU cannot deliver \u201cprosperity, equity, freedom, peace and democracy\u201d then it will have lost its reason for being. Onto questions\u2026 Q: Are the EU\u2019s rules on mergers holding back competition? Mario Draghi says his report says competition policy should consider \u201cinnovation\u201d, and \u201cresilience\u201d. It also proposes changes to the EU\u2019s state aid rules, saying: State aid should be used for projects of common interests, and commonly funded, cross-border projects But it should be stopped for other things, as it fragments the single market. The report also recommends that competition decisions are made more \u2018forward looking\u2019, rather than being \u2018prudential\u2019, and also recommends faster decisions on competition law. Draghi adds that he is confident that \u201cin our unity we will find the strength to reform\u201d. Ad then he hands his weighty report onto the President of the European Commission, Ursula von de Leyen. Mario Draghi then warns reporters in Brussels that Europe faces very serious challenges. Explaining the importance of taking the steps outlined in his new report, Draghi says: We have to understand we are becoming ever smaller relative to the challenges we face. For the first time since the Cold War we must genuinely fear for our self-preservation. Draghi touches on the question of how such massive spending is possible. He says it is unlikely that private investment alone can finance it alone \u2013 without destabilising the EU economy. So, some form of common funding, and joint safe asset, will be needed. The third part of Draghi\u2019s report looks at increasing security and reducing dependencies. That includes economic dependencies \u2013 as the raw materials Europe needs are in the hands of a few suppliers\u2026. \u2026and also security dependencies, even though geopolitics have \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d in the last 10 years. Draghi\u2019s solution \u2013 Europe must develop a \u201cforeign economic policy\u201d. That means\u2026. Cordinating preferential trade agreements and direct investments with resource-rich countries, building up stockpiles in selected critical areas, and creating industrial partnerships to secure the supply chain for key technologies. And, we need to build our defence industrial capacity. Draghi concedes that these goals are not new \u2013 member states are doing this on their own. But they are punching \u2018under our power\u2019 \u2013 Europe coould be more effective if it combined its resources and coordinated policies, he argues. Europe must also increase the supply of clean energy, Mario Draghi adds. He cites Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as an example of how incentives can be used to stimulate development of green technologies. China\u2019s state sponsored competition is a threat to developing the European clean energy sector, he says. Draghi\u2019s second recommendation is that Europe must combine \u201cdecarbonisation with competitiveness.\u201d He says decarbonisation is an opportunity for growth, but one that could be missed if European countries fail to coordinate. Draghi says Europe needs a plan to decouples the price of fossil fuels from clean energy sources, so consumers see benefits from decarbonisation in their bills. [currently, fossil fuels are still the main power plants \u201cat the margin\u201d, and hence often set the wholesale electricity price in Europe \u2013 as this paper explains]. Europe\u2019s problem is not that it lacks smart people, or good ideas, Mario Draghi continues. The problem, he argues, is that there are too many barriers to commercial innovations, and to scaling them up. Draghi then points out that since 2008, 30% of unicorns - tech firms that grow to become worth over \u20ac1bn \u2013 which started in the EU have left. The majority went to the US, Draghi adds: 30% of our most succesful innovators have moved, and this has to change. Europe must become a place where innovation flourishes, especially for digital tech. A weak tech sector will rob Europe of the growth opportunities of the AI revolution, and also hamper companies in the rest of the economy too, he warns. Mario Draghi then outlines the steps Europe must take \u2013 starting with closing the innovation gap with the United States. Innovation is the first pillar of the report, he explains, citing Europe\u2019s failure to keep up with Big Tech firms. Giving a gloomy assessment of the situation, Draghi says: Europe is nowaways stuck in a static industrial structure, populated by mid-technology companies which are already mature. The leading firms in research and investment spending are the same ones we had 20 year ago \u2013 our cars. Draghi adds that it was the same picture in the US 20 years ago- where their big R&amp;D spenders were \"autos and pharma\u201d. Now, though, it\u2019s all digital at the top, Draghi adds. Over in Brussels, Mario Draghi is calling for coordinated industrial policy and a huge increase in investment to improve the economic situation in the European Union and lift competitiveness. Draghi, the former European Central Bank chief and Italian prime minister, is presenting a new report on the future of EU competitiveness, which he has been working on for the last year. In it, he calls for a much more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment to stop Europe falling further behind the US and China. Draghi says that Europe needs to boost its investment by up to five percentage points of GDP \u2013 or up to \u20ac800bn a year - and much closer coordination between European countries to ensure the money is spent effectively. Draghi says his report proposes a \u201cnew industrial strategy for Europe\u201d, and is granular with 170 different topline proposals. Speaking in Brussels now, Draghi warns that Europe\u2019s productivity is \u201cweak, very weak\u201d, and point out that growth has been slowing down for a long time. World trade is slowing, and become less open to European countries, Draghi says, adding that Europe has also lost its main supplier of cheap energy, Russia. Also, it needs to invest more in defence, for the first time since second world war. Another hurdle, Draghi adds, is that this is the first year that Europe cannot count on population growth to lift growth. Draghi\u2019s report is likely to influence the debate on EU competitiveness, one of the priorities of the next European Commission, which is due to take office later this year. Introducing Draghi, EC president Ursula von der Leyen said there is a \u201cwide consensus\u201d that the issue of improving Europe\u2019s competitiveness must be \u201cat the top of our agenda and at the heart of our action\u201d. Investor morale across the euro area has fallen for the third month in a row. The Sentix Investor Confidence Index has dropped to -15.4 this month, down from -13.9 in August, and lower than forecast. Sentix warns that the eurozone economy is \u201cthreatening to tip into recession\u201d, and blames the economic problems in Germany. It says: The eurozone is struggling with dangerous recessionary tendencies \u2018thanks to Germany\u2019. The situation in the rest of the world is also weakening, but investors here are somewhat more optimistic in their expectations. Germany is on the brink of recession after its GDP shrank in the second quarter of this year. Its economy has been hit by high energy costs since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and its car sector has struggled to cope with competition from cheaper Chinese-built electric vehicles. Barratt and Lloyds Banking Group have launched a \u00a3150m joint venture with the government body Homes England, that will lead to the UK\u2019s largest housebuilder and mortgage provider capitalising on Labour\u2019s plans to build 1.5m new homes. The combined venture, known as the MADE Partnership, will oversee multiple large-scale projects, including town extensions, new garden village-style communities and brownfield developments, each made up of 1,000 to 100,000 homes and community facilities. The government\u2019s housing and regeneration body, Homes England, said the partnership would \u201c have the finance, tools, expertise and partners required to ensure a cohesive approach to delivering a fabulous place that people want to live and work\u201d. The venture will initially be backed by up to \u00a3150m in funding, provided by Barratt, Homes England and Lloyds, which will hold equal equity stakes. But while MADE has described as a \u201clong-term partnership\u201d, the announcement of its launch on Monday did not included any timescale or housebuilding targets. We also have worrying signs that the US jobs market is cooling. The latest UK Report on Jobs from KPMG and REC shows that the UK labour market softened in August, with vacancies falling for both permanent and temporary staff. The number of permanent staff positions fell at the fastest rate since March, for the 23rd month in a row, with reports of \u201creduced demand amongst companies for new staff\u201d. This has led to a slowdown in earnings growth \u2013 permanent salaries meanwhile continued to rise, but at the weakest pace since March. Pay for temporary positions rose at the weakest pace for three-and-a-half years. Bad news for workers \u2013 but it may cheer the Bank of England, as it looks for signs that inflationary pressures have eased. Jon Holt, chief executive and Senior Partner of KPMG in the UK, suggests the gloomy tone from the new Labour government may be deterring firms from taking on staff. Holt explains: \u201cRecent Government warnings that the UK\u2019s economy may weaken further before improving add to the overall sense of uncertainty, affecting recruitment plans. Firms holding back from hiring led to a sharp contraction in the number of people placed into permanent roles in August amid continued decline in demand, extending the downturn in the UK\u2019s labour market. \u201cThe news that while salaries rose last month it was at the weakest rate since March could help make the case for more rate cuts when the [Bank of England\u2019s] Monetary Policy Committee meets to decide the future path of interest rates. A second survey from accountancy firm BDO also shows the UK jobs market weakening. BDO\u2019s employment index has fallen for the fourteenth consecutive month, to its lowest reading since January 2013. BDO says: This reflects ongoing concerns in the job market, including falling job vacancies and more people claiming unemployment-related benefits, which reached its highest level since December 2021 according to the Office for National Statistics. Elsewhere in the airline industry, Boeing may have struck a deal to avoid a strike which would have added to its list of problems. Boeing said yesterday it has reached a tentative agreement with a union representing more than 32,000 workers in the US Pacific Northwest. The proposed four-year contract includes a general wage increase of 25%, a commitment to build the next commercial airplane in the Seattle area, and better retirement benefits. If ratified by Boeing factory workers near Seattle and Portland on Thursday, the deal could help avert a possible crippling strike set for as early as 13 September. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 called it \u201cthe best contract we\u2019ve negotiated in our history\u201d. The deal also gived the union greater input in the safety and quality of Boeing\u2019s production system \u2013 an area in the spotlight following the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners, and the loss of a cabin panel in a midair blowout. In the airline industry, Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has issued a fresh call for the chief executive of air traffic control (ATC) provider Nats to resign. O\u2019Leary urged Martin Rolfe to step down and \u201callow someone competent\u201d to take over after flights were disrupted at Gatwick Airport on Sunday due to \u201cNats staff shortages\u201d. The Ryanair chief declared: \u201cUK Nats staff shortages caused multiple flight delays and cancellations at Gatwick Airport yesterday, Sunday September 8. \u201cThis is the latest in a long line of cock-ups by UK Nats, which has yet again disrupted multiple flights and thousands of passengers at Gatwick. Airlines and passengers deserve better. \u201cRyanair again calls on UK Nats chief executive Martin Rolfe to step down and allow someone competent to run an efficient UK ATC service, which airlines and passengers are entitled to expect. \u201cIf he won\u2019t go, then (new Transport Secretary) Louise Haigh should sack him.\u201d Nats was hit by criticism last year, when a single piece of rogue data in a flight plan caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, and when staff illness forced flights to be grounded at Gatwick: The pound has slipped to its lowest level in nearly a week this morning. Sterling is down 0.2% at $1.3095, the first time it\u2019s been below $1.31 since last Tuesday. Stocks are rebounding in London at the start of trading, after the worst week of 2024 so far. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index is up 49 points, or 0.6%, at 8230 points \u2013 clawing back over three-quarters of Friday\u2019s fall. Gambling firm Entain is the top riser, up 5.6%, after reporting online revenue growth ahead of expectations this morning. Banks and mining companies are also among the risers. But luxury group Burberry is a rare faller, down 1.5%. Luxury stocks have been hit recently by concerns that China\u2019s economic recovery was faltering; Burberry is already being ejected from the FTSE 100 in the next reshuffle. Economic slowdown worries hit the oil price last week, sending it to its lowest level in almost 18 months. This morning, though, Brent crude has gained almost 1%, rising to $71.10 per barrel. This is partly due to concerns over a potential hurricane system approaching the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could possibly cause disruption to supplies. A weather system in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico is forecast to become a hurricane before it reaches the northwestern U.S. Gulf Coast, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Sunday. The U.S. Gulf Coast accounts for some 60% of U.S. refining capacity, Reuters reports. However, Morgan Stanley has cut its forecast for oil prices in the final quarter of this year. It now predicts Brent crude will average $75 a barrel in October-December, down from an earlier projection of $80/barrel. Aldi\u2019s UK boss has also revealed that its shoppers are treating themselves to more expensive products as cost of living pressures start to ease. The supermarket reports that customers are \u201ctrading up\u201d to its premium own-label products such as Wagyu steak, premium cheese, ready meals, brioche buns and smoked salmon. Aldi UK chief executive Giles Hurley has told the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s still tough out there for millions of families but inflationary pressures are easing for some. \u201cFor others, it\u2019ll be a decision not to use hospitality but to celebrate at home instead.\u201d Aldi is to open a further 23 stores this year after profits more than doubled last year to almost \u00a3537m. The supermarket has just announced it would invest \u00a3800m in the UK market through the rest of this year including opening 23 more stores, and had signed a \u00a3750m deal with Kent-based grower AC Goatham &amp; Son including establishing the first ever \u2018Aldi Orchard\u2019 on a 200-acre plot on New Green Farm in Gravesend dedicated to growing fruit for the chain. The supermarket \u2013 which opened about 30 stores last year \u2013 said sales increased 16% to \u00a317.9bn in 2023, its highest ever period of sales growth. However, since then sales growth has slowed as all the traditional grocers, including Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s, have introduced schemes to price match Aldi on key items. The group will open about 30 stores again this year in total, down from about 50 per annum in the years before 2023. The retailer, which currently has over 1,000 stores, has previously announced plans to scale to 1,500 stores across the UK. The retailer, which aims to be the cheapest in the UK, said it had invested almost \u00a3100m in over 300 price cuts in the last three months on items including fish goujons, chicken breasts, potatoes and basmati rice. Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: \u201cFor every \u00a31 of profit generated last year, we\u2019re investing \u00a32 this year - opening more stores and building the supply infrastructure to bring high-quality, affordable groceries to millions more families the length and breadth of Britain.\u201d Chinese producers continue to slash their prices, new data today shows, in a sign of weak demand. China\u2019s producer price index (PPI) \u2013 which tracks prices at the factory gate \u2013 fell by 1.8% in August compared with a year earlier. That\u2019s the largest fall in four months, and a bigger decline than expected \u2013 which will add to concerns over the health of the global economy. Junyu Tan, North Asia Economist at Coface, explains: \u201cThe ongoing deflationary pressures boil down into a broader problem of production surplus, which is still outstripping demand.\u201d However, this did not immediately feed through to consumers\u2019 pockets. China\u2019s headline CPI inflation rate rose to 0.6% in the year to August, up from 0.5% in July. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy. Here we go again (again). Investors are experiencing another bout of angst over the health of the US economy, creating a chilly feel in the markets. Spirits are low after Friday\u2019s disappointing US employment report, which showed that fewer jobs were created last month than hoped. Non-farm payrolls rose by just 142,000 in August, while the payrolls for June and July were slashed, leaving traders fretting that the US jobs market \u2013 and the wider economy \u2013 was cooling. In better news, the unemployment rate dipped to 4.2% \u2013 but the report overall has left investors baffled as to how the US Federal Reserve will react. An interest rate cut later this month feels inked in \u2013 but will it be a gentle quarter-percentage point (25 basis points) reduction, or a dramatic half-point cut? Instinctively, investors would like a larger cut in borrowing costs \u2013 except, if that happens, it implies the Fed has serious concerns over the health of the US economy. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, explains: For traders, this means more of the Fed\u2019s favourite guessing game. The report wasn\u2019t bad enough to scream \u201cpanic mode,\u201d but indeed not good enough to keep the 50 bp rate cut whispers at bay. The problem? This delicate balancing act leaves everyone wondering: will the Fed take a cautious 25 bps step, or does a bigger 50 bps cut suddenly feel more necessary? One thing\u2019s for sure: whatever the Fed does, the markets are left doing the one thing they hate most\u2014waiting in uncertainty. And we can see the impact of this in the markets. On Friday, the US S&amp;P 500 share index fell by 1.7%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite tumbled by 2.5%. This has knocked Asia-Pacific markets today, where China\u2019s main stock indices are down over 1%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng is down almost 2%, and the South Korean Kospi index is off 0.7%. Disappointing economic growth figures from Japan have added to the gloom; Japan\u2019s Q2 GDP growth rate has been revised down to an annualised rate of 2.9% for April-June, down from a preliminary estimate of 3.1%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei share index began the session with a 3% drop, but actually managed to claw its way back to finish 0.5% lower. European markets, which fell on Friday, are set for a slightly higher open: The agenda 9.30am BST: TUC Annual congress in Brighton 9.30am BST: Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence"

            "content": "Nearly 50 years ago, a rediscovered diary enchanted the nation. Edith Holden\u2019s Nature Notes for 1906 \u2013 published in 1977 as The Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady \u2013 captured the artist and schoolteacher\u2019s observations on the English countryside\u2019s changing seasons, accompanied by exquisite illustrations of its flora and fauna. My friend Richard Webb, who has died aged 81, was the man who saw the potential of a dusty manuscript and turned it into a global bestseller. He had been shown the illustrated diary in 1976 by Holden\u2019s 22-year-old great-niece Rowena, then a student at Exeter Art College, whom he had met at a party, and he brought the book out the following year. \u201cCountry Diary chimed perfectly with those times \u2013 it was rural nostalgia with a safe, beautiful look people wanted after the 1970s recession,\u201d Richard later told an interviewer. The diary sold more than 3m copies around the world and was spun off into gift merchandising ranging from dinner plates to duvet covers, as well as a 12-part television dramatisation in 1984. It transformed the fortunes of Webb &amp; Bower, the small independent Devon publisher that Richard had founded with his friend Delian Bower in 1975. The son of Lt Col Richard Webb and his wife, Iris (nee Ingram), he was born in Reigate, Surrey, where his father was stationed at the time. Although he grew up in a military rather than a literary family, Richard was an instinctive publisher. After school at Marlborough college and a very brief stint as a Royal Navy officer cadet, he studied at the City Lit in London and the London College of Printing and in 1966 landed a gofer job with Cond\u00e9 Nast. Before long he was in charge of its publishing division and nurtured books from contributors as diverse as Mary Berry and David Bailey. Richard was especially proud of his role in publishing Bailey\u2019s Goodbye Baby and Amen (1969), a photographic essay on the Swinging Sixties, which could have been Richard\u2019s own diary of life in Chelsea at that time. He had great charm and a formidable work ethic, a combination that saw him appointed publicity director of the publishing house Michael Joseph aged just 27. He worked with a wide range of authors, including James Baldwin and Spike Milligan, enjoying their company as much as they did his. Despite Richard\u2019s success in London, his heart was in the West Country, and specifically Dartmouth in Devon, where his mother came from and to where his family had returned during his childhood. By 1994, after many years living in Exeter, he headed back to Dartmouth, planning on semi-retirement in a cottage next to the river. But he was too much of a natural publisher to sit and watch the River Dart flow past his window. The local historian Don Collinson brought him a manuscript, and The Chronicles of Dartmouth: An Historical Yearly Log, 1854-1954 (2000) became the first of a dozen books he produced involving the town and its people. \u201cAs a teenager I couldn\u2019t wait to get out but I now think it\u2019s an amazing place,\u201d he would tell visiting friends. In 1992 Richard married Gilly Jenkins, and she survives him."

            "title": "Now the Australian economy is on its knees, will the RBA finally start cutting interest rates? | Greg Jericho",
            "date": "2024-09-04T15:00:42Z",
            "content": "The June quarter GDP figures released yesterday reveal just how badly the Reserve Bank has misread the economy. Its decision to sharply raise interest rates has not only failed to reduce inflation but delivered an economy reliant on population growth and government spending to stop it from going into a recession. A month ago, when announcing the bank would keep rates on hold, the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, told the media that \u201cthe board does remain concerned about the degree of excess demand in the economy\u201d. Well, she should be happy now because the latest GDP figures show there is no demand in the economy. Household spending fell in the June quarter and business investment barely did a thing. She also told reporters \u201cwhat we\u2019re dealing with is continued strong demand, particularly for services\u201d. Again, she should be ecstatic because household spending on services fell 0.3% in the June quarter (that would be a month before she was telling us we needed to be worried about the \u201cstrong demand\u201d). Also last month, the assistant governor of the RBA, Dr Sarah Hunter, suggested to a Senate committee that \u201cthe economy is running a little bit hotter than we thought previously\u201d. Well, pop the champagne, because the economy is now chilly cold. These figures show that in April, May and June \u2013 well before the fears expressed in August of \u201cstrong demand\u201d\u2013 the economy was shuddering to a halt. The June quarter figures also mean we can look at financial year growth figures, and the 2023-24 year was not one we would wish to revisit. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email The entire economy grew just 1.5%. If we ignore the abnormal 2020-21 pandemic year, it is the worst result since 1991-92. To make things worse, when we strip out population growth, GDP fell 1%. Out of the 65 financial years we have had since the Bureau of Statistics began calculating GDP, that is only the 10th time that has happened: If the graph does not display, click here So no. Not good. And no, not \u201crunning a bit hot\u201d. When we look at the quarterly figures, things are no better. Take out population growth and the economy shrank 0.4%. That makes it six consecutive quarters of falling GDP per capita. This hasn\u2019t happened before. If the graph does not display, click here Depressed enough? OK, how about we note that the only reason the total economy rose a pathetic 0.2% and an equally wretched 1.0% compared with June 2023 was because of government spending: If the graph does not display, click here That means the private sector \u2013 household spending, business investment and trade \u2013 all went backwards. This really should be a slap in the face to those who have been going around whining about a profligate government keeping inflation too high. What bull! Government spending is the only thing that is keeping us out of a recession. And the reason the private sector is going backwards is interest rates. The increase in the cash rate from 0.1% to 4.35% has meant that we are now paying on average in real terms almost as much on interest repayments as we were in June 2008 \u2013 when the cash rate was 7.25%: If the graph does not display, click here In the March 2022 quarter, Australians were paying $479 a quarter per person in interest repayments (in June 2024 dollars). Now it is $1,112. That increase has caused almost half of the drop in real household disposable income, which remains back where it was in 2014: If the graph does not display, click here The increase in rates would be somewhat palatable if we were at least seeing a nice increase in our earnings but instead the real compensation for employees is more or less flat: If the graph does not display, click here Add rising interest payments with earnings that barely keep up with inflation and it equals households not spending. In the June quarter, we actually consumed less than we did in the first three months of this year. And given households make up just over half of the economy, that does not bode well. If the graph does not display, click here Our spending on essentials \u2013 insurance, food, healthcare \u2013 rose 0.5%, but the amount of discretionary consumption \u2013 things such as recreation, travel, dining out, sport \u2013 fell 1.1%. Outside the pandemic years, that is the biggest one-quarter fall since the GFC in June 2008. So far we have not gone into a recession \u2013 but only because our population has grown and the government has kept spending, mostly on healthcare and social assistance linked to the NDIS. The next lot of GDP figures will contain the stage 3 tax cuts, which should boost household incomes. Similarly, a lack of any more interest rate rises should at least mean we\u2019re no longer getting hit, even if the pain of all the punches remains. But given the economy has clearly slowed sooner than the RBA expected, perhaps it might start to think about lowering rates sooner than previously anticipated.

            "content": "Wall Street scaled all-time highs on Thursday as global markets welcomed the US Federal Reserve\u2019s first interest rate cut in four years. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.7% to close at its first record high since July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% and also hit a record. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite rallied by 2.5%. When the Fed announced it would reduce rates from a two-decade high on Wednesday, cutting by 50 basis points, America\u2019s leading share indices closed lower. On Thursday, however, as global markets welcomed the news, they bounced back. As inflation continues to fade in the US, policymakers at the Fed also expect to cut rates by an additional 50 basis points this year, according to projections released alongside this week\u2019s announcement. Some analysts said the market could be relieved that Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, was able to thread the needle in his press conference and suggest the deeper-than-usual cut was just a \u201crecalibration\u201d of policy and not an urgent move it had to take to prevent a recession. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in the economy that suggests the likelihood of a downturn is elevated,\u201d Powell told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t see that.\u201d The FTSE 100 climbed 0.9% in London after the Bank of England opted to hold interest rates steady. The next key central banking move is due on Friday, when the Bank of Japan will announce its latest decision on rates. As the Fed sought a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d for the US economy, where price growth is normalized and recession avoided, US stock markets have enjoyed an extraordinary year. The S&amp;P 500 is up by more than 20% since the start of 2024. The Nasdaq has risen 22% over the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased 11%.

            "date": "2024-09-27T16:54:54Z",
            "content": "The US justice department unsealed criminal charges on Friday against three Iranian operatives suspected of hacking Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and disseminating stolen information to media organizations. The US attorney general, Merrick Garland, said on Friday afternoon that hackers were trying to undermine Trump\u2019s campaign, as the Republican nominee for president. He said the department was seeing \u201cincreasingly aggressive\u201d Iranian cyber activity in this presidential election cycle. The Trump campaign disclosed on 10 August that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. Multiple major news organizations that said they were leaked confidential information from inside the Trump campaign, including Politico, the New York Times and the Washington Post, declined to publish it. US intelligence officials subsequently linked Iran to a hack of the Trump election campaign and to an attempted breach of what was previously the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris campaign, before the US president dropped his re-election bid and his vice-president took over the top of the ticket for Democrats. Officials said the hack-and-dump operation was meant to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and potentially influence the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be \u201cparticularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests\u201d. Last week, officials also revealed that the Iranians in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails containing excerpts of the hacked information to people associated with the Biden campaign. None of the recipients replied. The Harris campaign said the emails resembled spam or a phishing attempt and condemned the outreach by the Iranians as \u201cunwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity\u201d. The indictment comes at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran as Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel escalate attacks against each other, raising concerns about the prospect of an all-out war, and as US officials say they continue to track physical threats by Iran against a number of people including Trump. Earlier this week, US intelligence officials briefed Trump about a suspected Iranian plot to kill him, his campaign has said. The briefing, from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), was believed to have focused on a scheme unrelated to two failed domestic assassination attempts against the Republican nominee for president, and came amid the reports suggesting that Iran was conducting an ongoing hack against Trump\u2019s campaign."

            "content": "With tears in their eyes and pain etched on their faces, the bereaved and survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire demanded \u201cnothing less\u201d than manslaughter charges against those responsible for the disaster. The families said they had been \u201crobbed of justice\u201d and feared \u201cperpetrators literally getting away with murder\u201d as they faced a wait of at least three years to find out if anyone would be convicted for the failings that led to the inferno that killed 72 people. At the culmination of the seven-year public inquiry, Tiago Alves, who survived the disaster, accused the multibillion-dollar companies whose products spread the fire of having \u201cblood on their hands\u201d while the Grenfell United group condemned the corporations as \u201clittle better than crooks and killers\u201d. At an emotional press conference in west London that opened with a minute\u2019s silence, the bereaved sat in front of photographs of their loved ones and a set of kitchen scales weighing the seven-volume, 1,700 page inquiry report that apportions blame for the tragedy. The group said that, at the end of the inquiry, all they had been left with was \u201c10kg of words on pages\u201d. The families, from the Grenfell Next of Kin group, blamed the calling of the inquiry in the immediate aftermath of the disaster for the delays in bringing prosecutions. The Met, which has been investigating the disaster, said the police investigation is independent of the public inquiry and cannot use its findings. Maria Jafari, who lost her father, Ali Yawar Jafari, in the fire, left the table in tears after condemning the report as nothing more than a \u201cbig bag of paper\u201d, saying: \u201cSeven years have passed, and we still have no justice and we have to fight again. I don\u2019t know how many more years it\u2019s going to take and nobody knows if we\u2019re going to be alive for the justice.\u201d Hisam Choucair, who lost six family members, thanked the inquiry for its findings but said: \u201cThis inquiry was forced on us \u2026 For me, as a direct kin, this inquiry hasn\u2019t taught me anything. In fact, It\u2019s delayed the justice my family deserves.\u201d He called the inquiry a \u201cjoke\u201d and fought back tears as he added: \u201cWords cannot describe the pain that I have gone through, the pain that my family has gone through, with having this inquiry running parallel to the criminal investigation. \u201cWatching the inquiry for me has been very painful. I\u2019ve seen witnesses laugh giving evidence, which burns me inside. How can they have the cheek to do that, knowing that they are partially to blame for what happened on that horrific day?\u201d Shah Aghlani said the inquiry was set up as he was going from hospital to hospital looking for his mother, who he later discovered had died in the fire. His aunt was also killed. \u201cIn no way were we involved in the beginning or consulted.\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody wanted to create a system that prevents justice you could not have created a better system than what is in place now.\u201d He said he believed that any future prosecutions would only result in \u201cminor charges with perpetrators literally getting away with murder, which is the system we have in this country\u201d. But he added that he would settle for \u201cnothing less\u201d than manslaughter charges. Kimia Zabihyan, a spokesperson for the group, told how Francis Dean had been on the phone to his friend Zainab Deen, who was trapped in the block with her toddler, Jeremiah; both died. Dean criticised the \u201cseven-year delay to justice\u201d as he told how he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and had lost his job in the aftermath of the fire. \u201cSince that night I\u2019ve not been the same person, I\u2019m messed up,\u201d he said. Earlier, Grenfell United, which represents some of the families, said Sir Martin Moore-Bick\u2019s findings showed they were \u201cfailed by calculated dishonesty and greed\u201d and that their lawyers were correct to tell the inquiry that corporate bodies such as Kingspan, Celotex and Arconic were \u201clittle better than crooks and killers\u201d. Speaking on behalf of the group after the report was published, Natasha Elcock said: \u201cWe paid the price of systematic dishonesty, institutional indifference and neglect.\u201d She added: \u201cAbove all, the judge concludes what we already knew. Every single loss of life that night was avoidable. Human life was never a priority, and we lost friends, neighbours and loved ones in the most horrific way \u2013 from greed, corruption, incompetence and negligence.\u201d Some survivors welcomed the report\u2019s recommendations but said the fight was not over. Alves, who was at home on the 13th floor when the fire broke out, said: \u201cI think it proves what we\u2019ve been screaming and shouting about since 2017, but it\u2019s good to have the evidence to back it up.\u201d He said the inquiry was an important step \u201ctowards the truth\u201d but that he hoped for prosecutions. \u201cArconic, Celotex, Kingspan, and a bunch of the other corporates, Rydon, they all have blood on their hands,\u201d he said. Survivor Nicholas Burton said he feared that those affected by the fire would still be waiting for justice on the tenth anniversary of the tragedy. \u201cWe need jail time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I break the law, I\u2019m going to jail and that\u2019s the system that we work in.\u201d"

            "content": "Polly Toynbee raises an interesting point about class and how we perceive ourselves and how others perceive us throughout our lives (Take it from me (and Keir Starmer) \u2013 you should never pretend to be more working class than you are, 26 September). Inevitably, however, this opens a whole can of worms, given the vast amount of scenarios that arise when one interrogates one\u2019s own family tree. While we concentrate on moving up the social scale, does the same happen in reverse? My maternal grandfather was born into a cotton mill-owning family in 1886, but the decline of said industry meant that his children trained and worked in occupations that may be considered working class. Was that seen as a decline in their fortunes? Certainly not by my mother and her siblings, who strove to do the best with the resources available, and allowed my siblings, cousins and I to have greater opportunity than they did. Does that now make me middle class? Maybe, but it does not mean one forgets one\u2019s origins and so, hopefully, ensures one remains empathetic to those who haven\u2019t been so fortunate. Michael Thornton Horsham, West Sussex \u2022 Polly Toynbee is right about the need for honesty about class origins. Apart from the hypocrisy, there is a more damaging consequence \u2013 people occupying positions of power that could actually go to a person with a genuine working-class background. There is another problematic dishonesty too, which comes with the shame of growing up very poor. In my first job after leaving university, I was taken out to lunch and someone mentioned \u201cThe kind of kids who grew up on council estates\u201d. I replied: \u201cYou mean people like me.\u201d I almost didn\u2019t say it for fear of being judged. I have let classist comments go at times when people have made common cause assuming I share their middle-class background. Growing up on a council estate, living in temporary accommodation, visiting pawnshops to get money for bills and seeing parental despair brought about by poverty shame, doesn\u2019t imbue huge amounts of self-confidence, no matter how far you travel. I was very lucky to work for a CEO from the same background. He knew how to build confidence when there were moments of doubt because he understood my psychology. It\u2019s another reason why we need working-class people in positions of power who can proudly talk about their background and nurture working-class talent. Caroline O\u2019Dwyer London \u2022 I enjoyed Polly Toynbee\u2019s piece. I could claim working-class credentials. I was raised in a council house by a mineworker father and a hospital auxiliary mother. But, thanks to a good, free education, I landed a white-collar job and progressed up the ranks. One day, at Sunday lunch with my parents, I was telling a story about some discussion at work where I had pronounced that I was working class and proud of it. My father cut me to the quick, saying: \u201cNo! You\u2019re middle class and I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d While I am proud of my working-class routes, I am grateful for my middle-class status and all the privilege that has allowed me to bestow on my own children. There\u2019s no shame in social mobility, let\u2019s celebrate it and champion opportunity for all. Name and address supplied \u2022 What is the embarrassment in being middle class? I\u2019m middle class and proud that my parents (both from working class backgrounds themselves) worked hard to help my brother and myself get a good state education and consequent professional jobs. What really matters is not what advantages or disadvantages you start off with, but what do you with them \u2013 do you use them for self-centred personal aggrandisement or channel them for the greater good of society?

            "date": "2024-09-19T15:35:46Z",
            "content": "In the latest round of the dispute between Elon Musk and Brazil\u2019s top court, a senior judge has accused X of a \u201cwillful, illegal and persistent\u201d effort to circumvent a court-ordered block \u2013 and imposed a fine of R$5m ($921,676) for each day the social network remains online. The social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which has been banned by court order since 30 August, on Wednesday became accessible to many users in Brazil after an update that used cloud services offered by third parties, such as Cloudflare, Fastly and Edgeuno. This allowed some Brazilian users to access X without the need for a VPN \u2013 which is also prohibited in the country. Late on Wednesday, X described its reappearance in Brazil as an \u201cinadvertent and temporary service restoration to Brazilian users\u201d. But the influential supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes \u2013 who ordered the original ban as part of an attempt to crack down on anti-democratic, far-right voices \u2013 on Thursday described the move as a deliberate attempt \u201cto circumvent the court\u2019s blocking order\u201d. Moraes said that the tactic was \u201cconfessed directly by its largest shareholder, Elon Musk, in a post on X addressed to the entire country\u201d. This was a reference to a message by Musk who on Wednesday posted: \u201cAny sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology.\u201d According to Moraes, this left \u201cno doubt that the X platform \u2013 under the direct command of Elon Musk \u2013 intends, once again, to disrespect Brazil\u2019s judiciary\u201d. Moraes also ruled that if X does not pay the fines \u2013 which occurred with the previous R$18.3m ($3,376,509) penalties applied to the platform \u2013 the obligation will fall on Musk\u2019s satellite internet provider, Starlink. The justice argued that, as the companies share the same owner and X no longer has a legal representative in Brazil \u2013 something required by Brazilian law and one of the reasons for the ban \u2013 the satellite internet provider becomes \u201cjointly liable\u201d for the fines owed by X. After a day of unrestricted use, the national telecommunications agency, Anatel, announced on Thursday that, \u201cwith the active support of Cloudflare\u201d, it was able to identify the mechanism enabling access to X. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s former far-right president, seized on the platform\u2019s temporary return to post a lengthy message defending Musk and criticising Moraes, who is handling most of the cases related to an attempted coup to keep the former army captain in power. After \u201ccongratulating everyone for the pressure they are applying in defence of democracy in Brazil\u201d, Bolsonaro wrote that \u201cX was banned for questioning judicial rulings that demanded not only the removal of specific posts but the permanent exclusion of accounts. This is prior censorship.\u201d The supreme court, which has supported Moraes\u2019s decision to ban X, has found that the social network refused to remove accounts that were disseminating false information, hate speech and incitement to crime. Among them were threats against federal police officers \u201cinvolved in investigations into digital militias and the attempted coup\u201d, the court said."

But why should we listen when it has been placed here by thieving hands? Mason, a social justice TikToker, is here to expose the artefact\u2019s hidden colonial history to the world. But, when he gets caught veering a little too close to the comb, a tragic chain reaction is forced into motion. Mason is locked away from his friends and family in a young offender institution, his voice effectively silenced in the process. Written by former Birmingham poet laureate Casey Bailey and adapted from his 2021 poetry collection of the same name, the script hums with expressive lyricism. We meet an adrenalised, boyish Mason (Tijan Sarr), eager and ready to pull apart a broken system, and watch as he is squashed down into quiet despair. He keeps himself busy with books and poetry, trying to find the words to make sense of his time inside. But any joy he finds in prison can be robbed from him, with one cruel decision. The music by Kayodeine rhythmically accompanies Mason\u2019s frustrations. As the scenes roll on, he is pushed to grow up before our eyes. But with only one actor playing all the roles, the narrative is hard to keep grasp of. Sarr darts from playing Mason, to a prison guard, to his mother visiting him in jail, by varying his voice and movements slightly. But the characters are not distinct enough to have an effect. Conversations, such as the one Mason has with his father, don\u2019t pierce as they should, and the dialogue is swallowed by the cavernous empty stage space. In a production directed by Gail Babb, he comes alive as he pushes down pillars that represent a jail cell, but in the moments of stillness, you long for more animation to fill the space. Bailey\u2019s writing, rightfully, burns with a sense of inequity and the failings of the criminal justice system are exposed in full force. But the production itself needs more fire to become a powerhouse drama. \u2022 At Belgrade theatre, Coventry, until 21 September. Then touring until 28 September."

The scale of success for both parties is even more remarkable given the many ways in which the Conservatives manipulated electoral rules in their favour. Up to 8 million people legally entitled to vote were kept off the voting registers, with little attempt to enrol them. The introduction of photo ID was a deliberate attempt at voter suppression. Party spending limits were suddenly raised by 80%, allowing the Conservatives to benefit from a total of \u00a320m from Frank Hester. There is important work to be done now to address these issues, which must be cross-party to avoid the impression that changes are again being made simply to help the governing party.

            "content": "Education unions are to warn that Ofsted cannot be trusted to reform itself, as headteachers continue to report that school inspections are leaving their staff feeling distressed. Prof Julia Waters, sister of the Reading headteacher Ruth Perry, who killed herself last year after an inspection downgraded her school from outstanding to inadequate, will call on the government to make deeper reforms of England\u2019s education inspectorate at the Labour party conference on Sunday. While welcoming the government\u2019s recent confirmation that Ofsted\u2019s single-word judgments will be scrapped, Waters, along with all four teaching unions, said the inspector still operated with a culture of \u201cfear and terror\u201d. Ahead of the conference event, Waters told the Observer that since her sister\u2019s inquest and the coroner\u2019s prevention of future deaths report, she had been told of 11 inspections this year which had left headteachers in serious distress. She said: \u201cThese headteachers\u2019 appalling experiences are shockingly reminiscent of what Ruth went through. Ofsted still seems defensive and complacent, unwilling or unable to change. They must not be allowed to reform themselves.\u201d Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cNothing short of a complete reset will be enough.\u201d He described recent evidence of traumatised headteachers as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and said it could not be allowed to continue. \u201cSchool leaders accept the need for accountability, but it must be humane, proportionate and fair,\u201d he added. \u201cThe reform that is so desperately needed cannot be left in Ofsted\u2019s hands alone.\u201d A governor at Eldon primary school in Preston said that a recent inspection had left several members of staff struggling with their mental health. Pav Akhtar, who is also a local councillor, said several members of staff had broken down during the inspection, which downgraded the school from outstanding to inadequate. \u201cTwo had suicidal thoughts and are accessing trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy,\u201d he said. Other staff are also receiving counselling. Akhtar added: \u201cThe complete disregard for staff health and wellbeing has been appalling.\u201d In line with Ofsted\u2019s new policy of allowing school leaders to ask for a pause if staff are visibly distressed, the inspection at Eldon was temporarily halted when a staff member was upset, but Akhtar said it was \u201cappalling\u201d that the \u201cresilience\u201d of the school\u2019s leadership was then questioned in the final report. Ofsted said: \u201cWe have acted with empathy and professionalism throughout our engagement with Eldon primary school. For months we took repeated and significant steps to protect the wellbeing of leaders at the school. Our top priority will always be making judgments in the best interests of children \u2013 even when those findings are uncomfortable for school leaders.\u201d The spokesperson added that Ofsted had granted an initial deferral of a planned inspection in February, then at the school\u2019s request paused the inspection when it was under way in March: \u201cInspectors returned to conclude the inspection from 15 to 18 April. And we delayed publication of the final report from July to September to allow the local authority to provide a package of support for school leaders.\u201d Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said: \u201cThe idea that this regime of fear and terror raises standards and improves things for children is a complete fantasy.\u201d Waters and the education unions will warn that the crisis in recruiting and retaining teachers cannot be fixed without further reform to Ofsted. Waters said the current inspection system must be replaced by a \u201ccollaborative, supportive\u201d system focused on improvement. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "A review of how bereaved families were treated by the authorities after their relatives died in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster has recommended an overhaul in postmortem processes and communication, and the need for \u201cempathy and understanding\u201d. The review, led by Glenn Taylor, a retired forensic scientist, heard harrowing accounts from family members of those who died about their experiences, including being told by police officers that they could not hug their loved ones because their bodies were \u201cthe property of the coroner\u201d. Several of the Hillsborough families told Taylor they were never informed that a postmortem was to be carried out on their relatives, and had suffered enduring trauma from the cold and clinical nature of the process. Margaret Aspinall said her son, James, 18, had always said he never wanted to be the subject of a postmortem, having watched the TV show Quincy, and \u201cthe fact that this happened has lived with me for the rest of my life\u201d. Taylor said in his review that while legally it was a coroner\u2019s decision on whether to hold a postmortem, families should be much better informed and it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that families had been left unaware of it. Taylor\u2019s review was commissioned by the government after the highly critical 2017 report by James Jones, the former bishop of Liverpool, into the disaster, in which 97 people were unlawfully killed due to a crush at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough stadium. Taylor completed the review but died on 6 August. His wife, Karen, was with the review team presenting its findings to families in Liverpool. Families whose relatives were killed in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing also spoke to Taylor about their experiences. He found that they, too, experienced poor and traumatic communication by the authorities, although technical pathology had improved in the almost 30 years since the Hillsborough disaster. Caroline Curry, whose son, Liam, died as a result of the Manchester Arena bombing, told Taylor that she had not wanted a postmortem done, and of her distress at a police family liaison officer informing her: \u201cBecause it was a crime scene, Liam does not belong to you and it is not my decision to make.\u201d Bereaved Hillsborough families also spoke of the enduring trauma caused by being shown explicit photographs of their loved ones without due warning, and later seeing such pictures available on police computers rather than being kept more secure. The report also highlighted that the authorities must be more sensitive over any decision to retain human tissue, another experience some Hillsborough families had found deeply traumatising. The review identified seven areas for reform, which Taylor said were common to the experience of families bereaved by the Hillsborough disaster and Manchester bombing, including: Talking to affected families so they know what to expect. Offering the opportunity to talk through the pathologist\u2019s findings. Communicating with families with empathy and understanding. Understanding the need of families to spend time with their lost one. Ensuring that forensic pathology facilitates the assessment of whether a person may have survived for longer given different circumstances. Engaging families on possible access to postmortem photographs. Avoiding any potential perception that families have not been treated consistently over the postmortem process. Taylor said lessons learned from families\u2019 experiences after Hillsborough and other public disasters could be \u201cembedded\u201d into the ongoing professional development of pathologists. In a foreword to his review, written in June this year, Taylor wrote of the Manchester families: \u201cThese families had no reason to believe that in attending the concert in Manchester Arena that night their loved ones might not return, any more than the Hillsborough families did when they waved their loved ones off to the football match. To be plunged into grief and simultaneously faced with processes, procedures, requirements and expectations from professional services is an unimaginable nightmare. \u201cForensic pathology is just one of those services where what happens is alien and opaque to families, who are given no notice that this is to be their future. Forensic pathology is a special example because a postmortem examination will involve invasive procedures just at the moment the family need to feel that they retain, not lose, their unique connection with the loved one they have lost. \u201cThese circumstances create a need for the public authorities involved to engage and communicate in ways which properly understand the experience family members will be going through \u2026 Engagement with families over the need for postmortem examinations, over what will inevitably be involved as part of those examinations, and over how the results are communicated needs to be overhauled.\u201d Responding to the review, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, paid tribute to the Hillsborough families for sharing their \u201cmost difficult and unimaginable experiences\u201d with Taylor. \u201cI can confirm we will be accepting all of the report\u2019s recommendations, which we will work at pace to deliver,\u201d she said."

            "content": "Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party has attracted a new cadre of big donors including \u00a3500,000 from Fiona Cottrell, the mother of his high-profile, unpaid aide George Cottrell. Fiona Cottrell gave the sum in two tranches shortly before the general election, making her one of the biggest donors to the party\u2019s campaign coffers, along with Richard Tice, the party\u2019s former leader, who gave \u00a3500,000. In the months before the election, Reform also received \u00a3200,000 from the businessman Zia Yusuf, who became the party\u2019s new chair last year. He is the co-founder of a concierge firm, Velocity Black. Jeremy Hosking, who has bankrolled Laurence Fox\u2019s Reclaim party, donated \u00a3125,000 to Reform in June. Fiona Cottrell, an aristocratic former girlfriend of the king in the 1970s, appears to be a first-time political donor. George Cottrell was regularly at Farage\u2019s side during the election campaign, including when he had a milkshake thrown at him in Clacton. A former head of fundraising for Ukip, Cottrell spent eight months in an American jail in 2016/2017 after being accused of offering money-laundering services on the dark web. He served time for a single count of wire fraud after 20 other charges were dropped as part of a plea deal. The crime was committed in 2014, before he worked for either the anti-EU party or Farage. More recently, he has been living in Montenegro and told Tatler in a profile interview this month that he had lost $53m in a single night a casino, following reports that he had lost $20m. He also told the magazine that he collects art by Canaletto, Van Gogh, and Picasso as well as owning a Banksy, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a picture of three monkeys, each with a sign reading, \u2018Laugh now, but one day we\u2019ll be in charge.\u2019 Banksy will hate that I own it.\u201d Cottrell, whose lawyers have previously told the Guardian that his wealth comes from a portfolio of investments and not family money, has never donated to the Reform party. However, the MPs\u2019 register of interests shows that he paid for Farage\u2019s \u00a39,250 trip to the National Conservatism conference in Brussels in April. In an interview with the Times in 2017, Fiona Cottrell said reports that her son was wealthy enough to have a \u00a3250m trust fund were \u201cridiculous, absolute rubbish\u201d. Reform has been contacted for comment."

            "date": "2024-09-09T06:35:34Z",
            "content": "Within a week of being inaugurated in April as Senegal\u2019s youngest president, Bassirou Diomaye Faye named his political mentor, Ousmane Sonko, as prime minister and announced his 25 cabinet appointments. Faye had swept to power on a leftist, anti-establishment and pan-African agenda promising radical reform, and said in his victory speech that his administration would focus on national reconciliation, easing the cost of living crisis and fighting corruption. His first-round victory in March over Amadou Ba, who represented the ruling administration, was all the more remarkable because Faye and Sonko had been released from prison only 10 days before the vote, under an amnesty announced by the previous president, Macky Sall. Sall, in power for 12 years, had tried to delay the vote, and left office with his country facing widespread poverty and almost a third of Senegal\u2019s youth unemployed. \u201cWe fought body and soul to protect [Sonko] because the project represents hope for the young Senegalese,\u201d said Moustapha Sano, a 28-year-old law and political science student at Cheikh Anta Diop University (UCAD) in Dakar, who helped Sonko\u2019s Patriots of Senegal (Pastef) party organise campus protests against the Sall administration when it started jailing opposition members. Six months on, however, the promises of far-reaching change have not come to fruition. Faye and Sonko blame parliament, where Sall\u2019s supporters still hold a majority won in 2022. Sonko has refused to present his policy agenda \u2013 known as the general policy declaration (GPD) \u2013 to parliament, on the grounds that parliament does not recognise the role of prime minister. Sall scrapped the position in 2019 and reinstated it in 2022, but MPs did not apply the reinstatement to parliamentary regulations until late August. Aminata Tour\u00e9, a former prime minister and ex-ally of Sall who joined the opposition camp three years ago, says the parliament no longer has legitimacy. \u201cWe have to align the legitimacy of 24 March when President Faye won by 54%, with the representation of the parliament,\u201d she said. Other parties in parliament think Sonko is stalling until he can gain parliamentary control. \u201c[He] wants to impose his law,\u201d said Thierno Alassane Sall, the party leader of La R\u00e9publique des Valeurs. \u201cHe forgets that he was not elected by anyone and he only draws his legitimacy \u2026 from the president of the republic who appointed him.\u201d On 4 September, Sonko said Faye would dissolve the opposition-dominated parliament in the coming days, which would pave the way for elections. Senegal\u2019s parliament cannot be dissolved by the president until it has sat for two years. According to media reports, this threshold will be reached on 12 September. Faye has been active on the diplomatic front since taking office, mediating between the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) and three countries \u2013 Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger \u2013 whose military rulers split from the bloc in January to form the Association of Sahel States. \u201cThe whole idea is to build a stronger Africa\u201d said Tour\u00e9, who urged the association to be \u201copen-minded\u201d to reconciliatory talks. \u201cIn a family, people have differences, but we remain family and I believe President [Faye] will succeed in rebuilding that family.\u201d The government\u2019s critics say Faye\u2019s diplomacy is a distraction from the domestic scene, where debt is more than 72% of its GDP, and youth unemployment remains high. Accusations of cronyism, which dogged the Sall administration, have resurfaced. Almost half of Faye\u2019s cabinet appointments \u2013 generally picked on the basis of merit, not party affiliation \u2013 are Pastef members or people linked to the party. Hopes of more gender equality have also been dashed: only 46 of the 300 appointments made by the new administration are women. In July, as Faye marked 100 days in office, the United in Hope coalition led by Sall\u2019s Alliance pour la R\u00e9publique party criticised the president\u2019s tenure for having \u201ca lack of direction\u201d and said Senegal had been on pause since the election. A month later, privately owned news outlets staged a one-day nationwide blackout to protest against the state freezing the bank accounts of media companies and seizing their equipment over alleged non-payment of taxes. On the campaign trail, Faye vowed to achieve sovereignty, including by abandoning the West African CFA franc, the currency used by eight states in West Africa. He also promised to review Senegal\u2019s relationship with its former colonial master, France, which is often thought to receive preferential treatment. But his first visit outside the continent was to Emmanuel Macron, the French president. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the left-leaning French opposition leader, has also visited Sonko in Dakar. \u201cOnce you are in a position of responsibility, whether you are entrusted with the reins of power or the reins of a country, you have a much more complex view of things,\u201d said Boubacar Ba, associate professor of public law at UCAD. \u201cSo this difference in discourse is perfectly understandable \u2026 When you\u2019re president, you have to take a lot of things into account, because today your word is binding on the credibility of the state.\u201d In April, Faye pledged to review deals with foreign partners in the extractive sector. Two months later, a decade after oil and gas was discovered off the Senegalese coast, production began at the country\u2019s first offshore oil project, a partnership with Australian firm. It is uncertain what the terms of the deal are. For Tour\u00e9, the change in rhetoric is not evidence of the new leader backtracking on his promises. \u201cThe point is, whoever we are partnering with, we\u2019re going to make sure that it\u2019s on a win-win situation. The new generation of leaders made it very clear that they want [a] more balanced relationship and that\u2019s what the people of Africa have been longing for.\u201d Indeed, many youths like Sano who rooted for Pastef are optimistic that the party can still change the country\u2019s fortunes. \u201cWe want all young Senegalese to be able to benefit from Senegal\u2019s natural resources \u2026 because we don\u2019t want to continue to see so many thousands of young people perishing in the Atlantic Ocean, perishing in the Sahara desert,\u201d he said, referring to the thousands of young people who have left for Europe in recent years."

            "date": "2024-09-12T16:58:03Z",
            "content": "The Natural History Museum in London has announced a major programme of transformation it says will mark \u201ca step-change from being a catalogue of natural history to a catalyst for change\u201d in response to the climate emergency. The scheme to renovate the museum\u2019s celebrated Victorian building and develop a new research and storage facility will build on its aim to turn visitors into \u201cadvocates for the planet\u201d, it said on Thursday. Four existing galleries will be overhauled, including its enormously popular dinosaur gallery, while the museum plans to reopen two long-closed exhibition spaces, one of which, the Old General Herbarium, has not been accessible to the public since 1948. One of them will house a new permanent exhibition that the museum\u2019s director, Doug Gurr, said would include the most explicit climate messaging it had ever offered. The exhibition, Fixing Our Broken Planet, will have the express aim of \u201cnudging\u201d visitors to change their behaviour, he said. The new exhibition spaces will be freed up by the creation of a purpose-built storage, research and digitisation centre at Thames Valley Science Park near Reading, to which more than a third of the museum\u2019s enormous natural history collection will be moved from its \u201cunsuitable, unsustainable\u201d current home. The museum said this was \u201cso we can take better care of it and more easily share its data with scientists all over the world who are finding solutions to problems like climate change, biodiversity loss and food security.\u201d Until recently, Gurr told the Guardian, the museum had seen itself as a \u201cpassive observer \u2026 our job was to collect, to conserve, to research, to display\u201d. \u201c[Then] we stepped back a bit and said: \u2018Well, hang on, if your subject matter is planet Earth and it\u2019s under that much threat, you\u2019ve got to do something about it. If you want the sporting analogy: how do you get off the sidelines and get on the pitch?\u201d In 2020 the museum declared a planetary emergency, and Gurr said the redevelopment was part of its continuing response. \u201cThe best contribution we can make is to create what we call \u2018advocates for the planet\u2019. And what that really means is: how do you inspire people at scale to care about nature and to care enough to want to do something about it? \u201cOf course, we still want people to have a brilliant, fun family day out. But if you can come out of that being a little bit more interested in nature and a little bit more aware of some of the challenges, you\u2019re a bit more likely to want to do something about it.\u201d The overhaul of the South Kensington site is due to be completed in time for the museum\u2019s 150th anniversary in 2031. The bulk of the funding will come from the government, which has already committed more than \u00a3200m to the new collections and research centre, while a further \u00a3155m will fund a museum-led programme to digitise natural science collections in the UK. In addition, the museum announced plans to raise \u00a3150m from philanthropic and commercial sponsors. Gurr said the museum was happy to \u201ctalk to everybody\u201d about potential sources of sponsorship but would not accept donations from firms it saw as unacceptable partners based on their climate record. \u201cWe are very, very clear that when we talk to [a potential sponsor], we\u2019re going to look at the actual behaviour versus the statements,\u201d he said. Gurr said the museum had turned down \u201csignificant\u201d sums in the past \u201cwhere we just felt it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to accept at this point, because we\u2019re acutely aware that you can\u2019t go around asking people to change behaviour and save the planet if you\u2019re then hypocritical in some of the gifts you accept\u201d. He would not be drawn on the position taken by other institutions such as the Science Museum and the British Museum, both of which have highly controversial funding relationships with energy firms, but he said: \u201cIt is factual that we have not accepted any funding from fossil fuel companies.\u201d The museum recently redeveloped its outdoor space into two new gardens focusing on evolution and biodiversity, and Gurr said it hoped to expand its education programme, encouraging schools to exploit their own outdoor space and enhance their climate and nature teaching."

            "content": "The Climate Change Authority determined that its incoming chairman, Matt Kean, did not have a conflict of interest despite taking a role at a climate advisory service \u2013 but he would need to make ongoing disclosures on relevant investments by the firm. Brad Archer, the authority\u2019s chief executive, said Kean \u2013 a former New South Wales treasurer and energy minister \u2013 had declared his position as a director of \u201cregulatory affairs and strategic partnerships\u201d at Wollemi Capital as \u201ca material personal interest\u201d, according to documents seen by Guardian Australia. \u201cNo conflict of interest currently exists between Mr Kean\u2019s outside interests and matters under consideration by the authority,\u201d Archer said in an accompanying letter sent to the office of opposition climate spokesman Ted O\u2019Brien, in response to a freedom of information request. Kean was asked to \u201cobtain further information on [Wollemi\u2019s] investments and provide it to the [authority\u2019s] secretariat\u201d. He should also disclose any individual investments \u201cthat may raise material conflict issues with authority work in accordance with standard meeting procedures\u201d, the document showed. The Albanese government\u2019s appointment of Kean in June sparked anger by some in the federal Coalition who saw the former deputy NSW Liberal leader as a turncoat. Others welcomed the choice of the architect of the state\u2019s renewable energy roadmap who had also advocated stronger climate change action for years. O\u2019Brien had said the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, had \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d after picking Kean. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email \u201cBowen needs to assure the Australian public that he did the appropriate checking of conflicts of interests before making this appointment,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, according to a Australian Financial Review report in August. Archer\u2019s comments were provided to O\u2019Brien\u2019s office after it sought an explanation of how the authority would handle Kean\u2019s role at Wollemi. That position commenced on 15 August, shortly after Kean took on the part-time role at the authority. Wollemi Capital was \u201ca global climate specialist investment firm\u201d and Kean\u2019s role was advisory and relationship management for which he would receive a salary and an equity stake in the company, the document said. \u201cHe will not have a decision-making role in relation to investments,\u201d it said. \u201cMr Kean\u2019s role will be to manage key stakeholder relationships, assist in identifying potential investors, and provide strategic advice within the firm, including in relation to potential investments.\u201d The \u201cintersection with authority business\u201d might come where Wollemi\u2019s interests were \u201cimpacted by advice, particularly as it relates to specific projects and technologies in which the firm invests\u201d, it said. A spokesperson for O\u2019Brien said \u201cgovernance matters and the Australian public deserve transparency on political appointments and actions,\u201d and that the government was \u201crunning a closed shop\u201d. \u201cIt has a track record of using non-disclosure agreements to hide from scrutiny, this is the same government who called for \u2018greater transparency\u2019 when in opposition,\u201d the spokesperson said. One of the documents noted some of the interests of other authority members that had been handled by the \u201cstandard procedures\u201d. These include those of Susie Smith, who was appointed by the Morrison government. Smith\u2019s interests include her role as principal of ESG &amp; Carbon Services, a consultancy. Patty Akopiantz, who was appointed at the same time as Kean, was co-founder of Assembly Climate Capital, a firm that says it is \u201ccreating answers to the generation-defining challenge of climate change\u201d. A spokesman for Bowen said the Climate Change Authority legislation envisages that its members would be across the relevant industries and sectors, and \u201cvitally ensures that these conflicts be transparently disclosed and appropriately managed\u201d. \u201cThis is reflected in the outgoing chair\u2019s [Grant King\u2019s] own external appointments being managed.\u201d He accused O\u2019Brien of making a political point rather than an \u201cearnest one of transparency\u201d."

But lately life in this supposedly Arcadian community has taken a toxic turn, as the River Madeira\u2019s waters have fallen to their lowest level since the 1960s and the skies overhead have filled with smoke from wildfires that are raging across Brazil. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it like this,\u201d said Souza, a 44-year-old subsistence farmer as her canoe glided through the murk towards her smog-shrouded hamlet, chaperoned by river dolphins whose aquatic home is growing smaller by the day. To reach Souza\u2019s wooden house in Para\u00edso Grande (Big Paradise) \u2013 a former rubber-tapping community near the port town of Humait\u00e1 \u2013 visitors must now scale a sun-scorched bluff that has been exposed by the plummeting waters. Vast, desert-like expanses of red-hot sand lie between some river-dwellers and the waters on which they depend for food, transport, education and work. Some of those beaches are hundreds of metres wide. \u201cIn the old days we used to understand the river\u2019s rise and fall \u2026 But lately man has started to affect nature to such an extent that we no longer know how things work,\u201d complained village leader Jos\u00e9 Francisco Vieira dos Santos, describing how the Amazon\u2019s annual rainy and dry seasons were being scrambled for reasons locals struggled to comprehend. \u201cEven the animals can feel the change,\u201d added Santos, 42. An Amazon catfish called the \u201cbod\u00f3\u201d used to lay its eggs in January. Now locals said it was happening as early as October. \u201cEverything has spun out of control,\u201d said Santos, who suspected construction of two hydroelectric dams further up the Madeira had added to the problem. Brazil\u2019s president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 whose administration has faced criticism over what some consider its sluggish response to the crisis \u2013 has painted his country\u2019s tribulations as part of a growing global emergency fuelled by climate change. \u201cHurricanes in the Caribbean, typhoons in Asia, drought and flooding in Africa, and torrential rain in Europe have left a trail of death and destruction,\u201d Lula told the UN general assembly last week, adding record floods, fires and drought in Brazil to that list. \u201cThe planet is no longer waiting to make the next generation pay the price and is fed up with climate deals that are not fulfilled.\u201d This year\u2019s drought \u2013 which authorities have called the most intense and widespread in Brazil\u2019s history \u2013 has brought misery to those who live along the Madeira, and other major Amazon waterways, including the Solim\u00f5es and the Negro. In Porto Velho, the largest city on the Madeira, passenger ships have found themselves high and dry because the waters are no longer deep enough to set sail. \u201cWe\u2019ve been stuck here for two weeks,\u201d said 50-year-old skipper Aurean Guimar\u00e3es, whose wooden ferry was stranded at a sun-baked port called Cai N\u2019 \u00e1gua (literally \u201cFall in the Water\u201d). \u201cThe river\u2019s so dry. There\u2019s so much sand. So many rocks \u2026 This is the first year we\u2019ve faced something like this,\u201d Guimar\u00e3es complained as the Madeira hit its lowest level since 1967. A banner hanging from the ferry\u2019s top deck declared: \u201cSOS\u201d. Indigenous communities have been hit particularly hard, with dozens of waterways drying up and dry vegetation supercharging wildfires that are ripping through their ancestral homes. Megaron Txucarram\u00e3e, an Indigenous leader from the Amazon state of Mato Grosso, said at least four territories in his region were going up in smoke, including in the Capoto Jarina area where a firefighter was killed in the blaze. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here since I was born and I\u2019ve never seen the forest burn like this \u2026 The forest is burning. Animals are burning. Trees are burning. Everything\u2019s burning,\u201d he said, lamenting how Indigenous sages who understood rain patterns were no longer alive to help out. \u201cThe firefighters aren\u2019t managing to put out these fires \u2013 only rain can do this.\u201d Erika Berenguer, a tropical forest expert from Oxford University who studies the Amazon, said she feared climate change meant that 2024\u2019s \u201capocalyptic scenario\u201d and \u201cdystopian sunsets\u201d might simply be a glimpse of an even bleaker future. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to think that this might be the best extreme drought that we have in the next 20 years. Because \u2026 in terms of the Amazon, we already have across the basin a 1.5-degree increase in temperature [since the 1970s]. Parts of the basin have a dry season that is one week longer [than before]. Parts of the basin have a dry season that is 34% drier,\u201d she said. Scientists attributed a 2023 drought that punished the Amazon to the natural climate phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o. But Berenguer noted how the strongest El Ni\u00f1o on record \u2013 1998\u2019s so-called \u201cKing Kong\u201d event \u2013 \u201cdidn\u2019t have the impacts that it\u2019s having now, either in terms of river drought or in terms of fires\u201d. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d she added. \u201cBecause from 1998 to 2024, the climate has already changed \u2026 Any extreme drought is already happening on top of [that]. So the impacts of drought are just exacerbated, and everything becomes really, really dry.\u201d Speaking at the UN, Lula admitted more needed to be done to tackle the fires and the drought and vowed to continue his crackdown on the environmental criminals growing rich from wrecking nature. In Para\u00edso Grande, where most residents declared themselves supporters of the politician they affectionately call \u201cPapai Lula\u201d (Daddy Lula), locals hope the president is true to his word and urged him to come to their rescue by sending humanitarian aid. \u201cThis heatwave is just crazy \u2013 and it\u2019s because of these folk who are just setting everything on fire,\u201d said Maria Delcy Barros de Moraes, blaming the farmers, ranchers and loggers whose use of fire to clear land has caused the wildfires to spread. \u201cWhy,\u201d she wondered, \u201cmust the righteous always pay for the sinners?\u201d"

That speech set the tone for a successful Cop26 summit in Glasgow three months later, a high water mark of global climate diplomacy and the last time the world looked unified in trying to contain the climate crisis within the relatively safe limit of a 1.5C temperature rise. The coalitions of countries that produced such progress have rapidly fallen apart since, and the 1.5C limit looks all but certain to be breached. Lammy\u2019s mission on Tuesday was to recreate that coalition and put the UK at the centre of global efforts to repair the damage done to the planet from greenhouse gas emissions and the destruction of the natural world. He vowed that tackling the climate and nature crises would be \u201ccentral to all the Foreign Office does\u201d. \u201c[These crises are] not some discrete policy area, divorced from geopolitics, conflict and insecurity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat may not feel as urgent as a terrorist or an imperialist autocrat. But it is more fundamental. It is systemic, pervasive and accelerating towards us.\u201d Like Kerry, Lammy presented the climate crisis as the existential threat of our time. Citing recent extreme weather, he warned: \u201cThese are not random events delivered from the heavens. They are failures of politics, of regulation and of international cooperation. These failures pour fuel into existing conflicts and regional rivalries, driving extremism and forced displacement. And it would be a further failure of imagination to hope that they will stay far from our shores.\u201d Also on Tuesday, the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, was addressing a conference of experts on the other side of London, arguing that economic renewal depended on resetting the power sector on a low-carbon path and generating green growth. He told the Guardian: \u201cThis is about the security of the British people. There can be no climate security for future generations unless we take international climate leadership now.\u201d And over at the Natural History Museum on Monday night, the environment secretary, Steve Reed, stood under the skeleton of a blue whale, declaring: \u201cNature and climate change are inter-related and integral to security and economic stability. The UK is back on the international stage on nature.\u201d The message could not be clearer: this government wants to tackle the climate and ecological crises head-on, reinvigorate green diplomacy and forge a global coalition for action before it is too late. The contrast with the previous government could scarcely be greater. Sunak skipped key international meetings, axed the post of climate envoy, made a U-turn on green policy and waged a \u201cculture war\u201d on the climate. Labour will not only reappoint a climate envoy, but double up, installing for the first time a nature envoy to coordinate with governments around the world on environmental protections. The diplomatic charm offensive has already begun \u2013 Miliband hosted the president of the next UN climate summit, Cop29, in London in July, and visited Brazil, host of next year\u2019s Cop30 summit, last month. Reed invited the president of the UN biodiversity summit, Colombia\u2019s Susana Muhamad, to London, and next year the UK will hold a global conference on energy security. Tone is important in international diplomacy, and Labour\u2019s stance impressed developing country observers. Harjeet Singh, global engagement director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, predicts vulnerable nations will respond positively. \u201cBuilding on its long history of supporting developing nations, the UK must deepen its commitment to helping them build resilience and tackle the harsh realities of climate change, paving the way for true global climate justice. The UK should align itself with vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu and Tuvalu, as well as fossil fuel dependent countries like Colombia, in their call for international cooperation on a just transition [away from coal, oil and gas].\u201d Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: \u201cWhat we need is for a country like the UK to really push for greater urgency, to show the energy transition can and must happen much faster and that support for the victims of climate change can\u2019t be ignored. If the UK can do that it will go a long way to earning the admiration and respect of people around the world.\u201d The UK could also fill a vacuum in climate leadership among major developed nations, with countries such as France and Germany distracted by domestic political upheavals. Paul Bledsoe, a lecturer at American University in Washington and a former White House climate official, said: \u201cFar more aggressive UK climate leadership under the new Labour government will have a tremendously positive influence globally, and will specifically be crucial to emboldening US policy should Kamala Harris be elected this November.\u201d But for all the enthusiasm that has greeted the change of government, at home and overseas Labour will have to do more than make stirring speeches and hold cosy meetings with allies to make a real impression. Tough decisions must be made, and soon. First, on the nature crisis, campaigners have said that more muscle is needed at home as well as abroad. Second, how far will the UK cut its emissions by 2035? Given that the UK is off track to meet its current 2030 emissions-cutting target, setting one that is more stringent but still credible will require a cross-government effort. Third, the pressing question of climate finance. Miliband has pledged to honour the UK\u2019s current commitment of \u00a311.6bn in climate finance by 2026, but many multiples of that will be needed, at a time when the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is cutting back across government. Fourth, the future of oil and gas. Labour has pledged to halt new licences, but campaigners would like to see more, including more detail on how to make the transition just. Robbie MacPherson, a Churchill fellow, is urging Miliband to join the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, a network of countries that are ending fossil fuel exploration and exploitation. \u201cThat would mark a positive step change in the UK\u2019s global standing.\u201d Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, says there are other major decisions the UK could make quickly that would be \u201crelatively easy wins\u201d, such as leading negotiations over a new global treaty to cut plastic pollution, ratifying the global oceans treaty and pushing to curb deep sea mining. \u201cMajor global summits in the autumn will be the first true testing ground of whether the Labour government can re-establish the UK as a progressive actor on the world stage \u2026 The key to success lies in ministers\u2019 willingness to stand up to polluting industries while showing solidarity with key allies especially in the global south,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Labour government has already started to set the record straight through its bold policy to end new oil and gas licences. It must now build on this at Cop29 to push for more taxes on oil and gas giants to support climate-impacted communities at home and abroad and advance a global fossil fuel phase-out.\u201d How Labour responds to these multiple challenges will determine whether the UK\u2019s return to the world stage on ecological diplomacy marks a true new beginning or another false start. As Lammy left the stage, the sun was still shining, but in the gardens leaves were starting to fall."

            "content": "Rachel Kyte, the new UK special representative on climate, advised the UK government as host of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, one of several globally recognised climate and governance experts to do so. But her advice appeared to make little impact on Johnson\u2019s Tory successors, especially when as prime minister Rishi Sunak dismayed allied governments and exasperated campaigners by drastically dialling down the UK\u2019s global role at climate talks. In her new role, she will have the backing of the foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, in making the UK\u2019s case for concerted climate action before it is too late. Known for her forthright manner and striking turn of phrase \u2013 she memorably told the Guardian in the lead-up to Cop26 that the UK\u2019s seemingly haphazard approach was \u201clike dad-dancing \u2013 it\u2019s not that they\u2019re evil, just very uncoordinated\u201d \u2013 Kyte has been a familiar figure at climate meetings for more than a decade. Most recently, she was professor of politics at the Blavatnik school of government, part of Oxford University. Before that, she was dean of the Fletcher school at the prestigious Tufts University in the US. She graduated in history and politics from the University of London. After leaving her role as the most senior official on climate at the World Bank in 2015, she served as special representative on sustainable energy to Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, and was chief executive of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, which aims to help the more than 1 billion people without access to electricity. She also sits on several boards and committees, including the voluntary carbon markets integrity initiative, and is an expert on reform of the development banks. In fact, according to Tom Burke, co-founder of the environmental thinktank E3G, her global recognition in climate circles could prove a source of tension with her new employers. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd appointment, as she has a higher profile and a wider network internationally than either of the sponsoring secretaries of state [Lammy and Miliband],\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s puzzling.\u201d But other climate experts and campaigners contacted by the Guardian were enthusiastic about the appointment. Prof Nicholas Stern, the economist, said: \u201cRachel Kyte is one of the truly outstanding figures in public policy on climate and energy. As well as a very clear and creative analytical mind, she has had tremendous experience in senior positions in the World Bank, in the UN, in academic life and in international negotiations. This is excellent news for the UK and the world.\u201d Areeba Hamid, co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cRachel Kyte looks to be an excellent choice as climate envoy but she has her work cut out. Her background working in climate finance will be crucial to ensure the UK is a leading voice in calling for an improved financial package, paid for by fossil fuel companies, for countries that are struggling to keep their heads above the rising tide of climate impacts. She will need true grit to keep driving for a phase-out of fossil fuels, while resisting the siren calls of petro-states, industry lobbyists and the \u2018carbon offsets\u2019 sector. But it is vital she has the full backing of the cabinet and diplomats so she can go about her work with authority and re-establish the UK\u2019s tarnished reputation as a climate leader on the world stage.\u201d In recognition of her work, Kyte was made a companion of St Michael and St George, one of the UK\u2019s top honours, in 2020."

That cost has been carefully estimated by Kevin Rennert and co-authors, writing in the journal Nature in October 2022. The logically and justly implied policy is a carbon tax at the level required to prevent us exploiting our descendants. Flights to and from the UK operated by airlines based elsewhere would have to face a commensurate levy.

            "date": "2024-09-18T19:20:09Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s biggest food and drink firms are doing too little to tackle the climate emergency and are producing \u201cstaggering\u201d amounts of greenhouse gases, campaigners claim. The 10 companies that manufacture more of the UK\u2019s food than anyone else produce more carbon emissions between them than even the aviation industry, a report says. Their total footprint worldwide in 2022 ran to 477m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions \u2013 more than the 426m tonnes produced by global air travel. Those 477m tonnes also outstripped the total emissions that the UK as a whole generated from all activities that year, which was also 426m tonnes. Many of these firms are not living up to \u201cloud claims\u201d they have made about how climate-friendly they and their products are, and are doing significant damage to planetary health, it is alleged. James Toop, the chief executive of Bite Back, the food campaign behind the analysis, which is part of the chef Jamie Oliver\u2019s organisation, said the figures were \u201ctruly alarming\u201d. He said they showed that too many global food manufacturers were falling down on their responsibility to help the UK meet its target of reaching net zero by 2050. Globally the food industry produces 30% of all emissions. That is because food production releases greenhouse gases from, for example, the clearing of land to plant crops, and in the form of the methane produced by livestock and paddy fields, and nitrous oxide from using chemical fertilisers and plastic packaging. Toop said: \u201cThe fact that food companies are responsible for such enormous amounts of greenhouse gas emissions underscores the urgent need for them to take stronger action. It\u2019s no longer acceptable for businesses to move slowly. They must prioritise both the health of people and the planet, and start delivering on their environmental commitments immediately.\u201d Bite Back reached its conclusions after teaming up with two independent environmental analysts to review commitments that the 10 food and drink companies that generate the biggest sales in the UK have made on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions globally. The 10 firms were Coca-Cola, Danone, Ferrero, Kellogg\u2019s, Kraft Heinz, Mars, Mondel\u0113z, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo and Unilever. The investigation found that: Three of the firms increased their annual emissions in 2022 \u2013 Ferrero, Kraft Heinz and PepsiCo. Seven are on course to miss meeting emissions targets they have set themselves to achieve by 2050. Only four have a verifiable commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 Danone, Mars, Mondel\u0113z and Nestl\u00e9. Nestl\u00e9 emerged from the analysis as the firm that produced the most emissions in 2022 \u2013 almost 113m tonnes. It was followed by Unilever (111.1m), PepsiCo (61.4m) and Coca-Cola (61.3m). Bite Back recommends a series of measures that it says would cut UK dietary greenhouse gas emissions by a third. They include people eating 30% more fruit and vegetables and 50% more fibre, and 30% less meat and 25% fewer foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar. The Food and Drink Federation, which represents big food producers in the UK, dismissed the findings. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe claims made in this report are misleading, as the statistics quoted represent total global greenhouse emissions, rather than the UK specifically. Around a quarter of the UK\u2019s carbon emissions comes from the food we consume; however manufacturing only contributes 6% of this. \u201cManufacturing is just one part of the food system. As a sector we\u2019re collaborating to minimise our environmental impact with our farm-to-fork commitment to achieve net zero by 2040. As the UK\u2019s largest manufacturing industry, we\u2019re keen to work in partnership with the new government to help drive the UK\u2019s net zero ambitions.\u201d Ruth Westcott, the food and farming charity Sustain\u2019s campaign manager for the climate and nature emergency, said Bite Back\u2019s findings were \u201cshocking but not surprising\u201d. She said: \u201cFood giants have been growing in size and power, flooding our streets and screens with advertising for climate damaging foods and making extortionate profits while they exploit workers and the environment. Government need to regulate food giants just like we regulate other harmful and polluting industries. There needs to be a duty on all big companies to protect the environment, and as a first step they need to report publicly on their emissions.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-30T05:00:05Z",
            "content": "More than 20 scientific experts have written to the UN\u2019s food agency expressing shock at its failure to revise or withdraw a livestock emissions report that two of its cited academics have said contained \u201cmultiple and egregious errors\u201d. The alleged inaccuracies are understood to have downplayed the potential of dietary change to reduce agricultural greenhouse gases, which make up about a quarter of total anthropogenic emissions and mostly derive from livestock. In the joint letter, which the Guardian has seen, the scientists say they are dismayed that the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has failed to remedy \u201cserious distortions\u201d originally identified by the academics Paul Behrens and Matthew Hayek, which the Guardian reported on earlier this year. Behrens and Hayek say a separate complaint has received short shrift. They say a \u201ctechnical dialogue\u201d promised by the FAO never materialised, beyond an invitation to a muted webinar where they could type questions into a Q&amp;A box. \u201cThere has been no serious response,\u201d Behrens said. \u201cThey partially addressed one of the points in the webinar in an unscientific way. But they gave no response at all to the vast majority of our complaints. Our concerns have barely been acknowledged, let alone seriously engaged with. It\u2019s been like hitting a brick wall. The FAO has made grievous errors that need urgent correction to maintain its scientific credibility.\u201d One of the signatories to the letter, Jennifer Jacquet, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami, compared the FAO\u2019s complaints process unfavourably with those of a science journal, \u201cwhere you could at least expect a correction to the article\u201d. The FAO\u2019s \u201cpathways toward lower emissions\u201d study was originally billed as \u201can updated comprehensive overview\u201d of global livestock emissions and was launched at last December\u2019s Cop28 climate summit. Behrens and Hayek said it inappropriately used their work on now outdated nationally recommended diets (NRDs), double-counted meat emissions, mixed different baseline years in analyses, and omitted the opportunity cost of carbon sequestration on non-farmed land. Correspondingly, the emissions savings from farming less livestock were underestimated by a factor of between six and 40, Hayek estimated. In an initial response to complaints, seen by the Guardian, the FAO\u2019s chief scientist, Beth Crawford, described the report\u2019s NRD-based emissions forecast for 2050 as \u201ca rough estimate\u201d. She said: \u201cThis methodological choice was made because there is no global database on dietary preferences and no policy instrument that supports the adoption of alternative diets based on balanced environmental, economic and social criteria.\u201d She did not touch on other points raised by the pair, such as alleged double counting and mixed baseline years, which Hayek said \u201care related to their misuse of our scientific data\u201d. Crawford\u2019s response said the FAO had received a \u201crigorous and thorough review\u201d supporting its conclusions from a group of scientists led by three named academics. The joint letter, which was also signed by 78 environmental groups, said: \u201cIt is not acceptable for the FAO, a respected UN institution, to gloss over these serious errors as a \u2018rough estimate\u2019 when the data and policy recommendations it provides are so internationally influential. A higher standard of scientific rigour is required.\u201d Jacquet said: \u201cIt seems clear to me that some of the choices made by the FAO in their methodology were just there to uphold the status quo of increasing meat production and consumption.\u201d The FAO was contacted for a response."

            "content": "Cows may belch methane into the atmosphere at alarming rates, but new data shows they may play an important role in renewing farm soil. Research by the Soil Association Exchange shows that farms with a mixture of arable crops and livestock have about a third more carbon stored within their soil than those with only arable crops, thanks to the animals\u2019 manure. This also has an effect on biodiversity: mixed arable and livestock farms support about 28 grassland plant species in every field, compared with 25 for arable-only and 22 for dairy-only. Joseph Gridley, chief executive of SAE, which was set up by the Soil Association in 2021 to support and measure sustainable farming, said it was unlikely that carbon captured in soil would balance out the enormous amounts of methane created by cattle. Farm livestock around the world creates about 14% of human-induced climate emissions. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unequivocal in the data that having livestock on your farm does mean you have more emissions \u2013 five or six times more emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you integrate livestock into the system, on every metric on soil health, there\u2019s an improvement, and on a lot of the biodiversity measures as well.\u201d Soils are degrading, but by how much exactly is unclear. In 2015, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation claimed that the world had only 60 harvests left, but researchers at Oxford University and Our World In Data said in 2021 that there was a complex picture, and that while there were 16% of soils with an expected lifespan of fewer than 100 years, a third were expected to last at least 5,000. Lee Reeves, UK head of agriculture at Lloyds bank, which helps fund SAE, said that the research showed farmers were taking steps to improve sustainability if they could see a direct link between a grant and a new farming practice, but this was not always obvious He suggested ministers should create a decarbonisation strategy, and a standardised carbon calculator, so that farmers and other businesses could use a single tool to calculate their carbon impacts. \u201cMoving from traditional to regenerative farming can see a dip in profitability for the first five years, so the government needs to support farmers and banks in that,\u201d he said. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has been investigating so-called methane blockers as a way to reduce emissions. Adding substances such as essential oils, probiotics and even seaweed to cattle feed can reduce the amount of burps and wind they generate. Last month the Green Alliance charity said that feeding Bovaer, a methane blocker, to a third of the UK\u2019s dairy cows would cut the country\u2019s emissions by about 1%. Yet this is not happening, the campaign group warned, because farmers were unwilling to pay extra for something they did not benefit from. It said methane blockers should be subsidised, as other green farming schemes were. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2024 to include a quote from Lee Reeves that was lost during initial editing."

            "date": "2024-09-16T12:00:24Z",
            "content": "Three US states are formally demanding that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) begin regulating PFAS \u201cforever chemical\u201d air emissions, as the toxic threat that the pollution poses to the environment and human health comes into sharper focus. So far, federal regulators have focused on water pollution, but state environmental agencies in North Carolina, New Mexico and New Jersey last week filed a petition calling for the EPA to categorize four types of PFAS compounds as hazardous air pollutants and to begin regulating them under the Clean Air Act. The petition comes after a Guardian investigation earlier this year found a Fayetteville, North Carolina, Chemours PFAS production plant is likely emitting much higher levels of the chemicals into the air than regulators and the company claimed. The air pollution is thought to be a driver of PFAS contamination in soil, water and food supplies across hundreds of square miles in the region. However, a lack of federal rules makes it difficult for states to rein in air pollution, which is a \u201ctremendous concern in our states and across the US\u201d, the states wrote in their petition to Michael Regan, the EPA administrator. \u201cAdding these forever chemicals to the list of regulated pollutants addresses a gap in our regulatory authority and makes it possible to tackle a critical part of the PFAS life cycle: air emissions,\u201d Elizabeth Biser, the secretary of the North Carolina department of environmental quality, added in a press release. PFAS are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. PFAS are dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down in the environment. Air emissions are concerning because the chemicals are widely dispersed across the region. PFAS do not naturally break down once in the environment, so when it rains, the chemicals can contaminate soil, crops and drinking water supplies. The petition states that North Carolina regulators have established a \u201ccausal link between significant air emissions of PFAS from the [Chemours plant]\u201d and widespread contamination of private drinking water wells in a 27-sq-mile area around the plant, in which testing has identified Chemours-specific PFAS. Meanwhile another state found a similar problem across a 67-sq-mile area. GenX, a PFAS produced at the Chemours plant, was detected in rainwater at high levels 90 miles away in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also suggests air pollution, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the Clean Cape Fear non-profit, a residents group that advocates for stronger regulations around the Chemours plant. The EPA this year enacted strong new drinking water limits for several PFAS compounds, but no laws exist that require Chemours to address its air pollution. Instead, a court in 2019 ordered Chemours to eliminate most of its air emissions, but no requirements are in place for other polluters. The petition is \u201clong overdue and a good first step\u201d, Donovan said. \u201cAt this point, the EPA should designate the entire class of PFAS as hazardous air pollutants,\u201d she added. The petitions call on the EPA to regulate PFOA, PFOS, PFNA and GenX, four of the most common PFAS compounds. Though thousands of the chemicals exist, technology that would be installed to remove the four chemicals would likely also remove many other PFAS. The EPA has 18 months to respond to the petition, and the dangerous toxicological effects of the four chemicals in the petition are well established, said Bob Sussman, an attorney who has litigated against Chemours. \u201cIt should not be hard to justify such a listing given the known adverse effects of PFOA, PFOS, GenX and other PFAS with extensive toxicity data,\u201d he added."

The firm said it was working with Global Reach, the firm that provided the page, to investigate and that none of its other customers, which include Openreach, Transport for London (TfL), National Highways, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the NHS Ambulance Radio Programme, had been affected. \u201cFollowing the incident affecting the public wifi at Network Rail\u2019s managed stations, Telent have been working with Network Rail and other stakeholders,\u201d Telent said. \u201cThrough investigations with Global Reach \u2026 it has been identified that an unauthorised change was made to the Network Rail landing page from a legitimate Global Reach administrator account and the matter is now subject to criminal investigations by the British Transport Police. \u201cNo personal data has been affected. As a precaution, Telent temporarily suspended all use of Global Reach services while verifying that no other Telent customers were impacted.\u201d Later on Thursday, the BTP said a man who was employed by Global Reach had been arrested under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 and offences under the Malicious Communications Act 1988. In London, 10 major train stations have been affected: King\u2019s Cross, London Bridge, Euston, Victoria, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, Liverpool Street, Clapham Junction, Waterloo and Paddington. Manchester Piccadilly, Liverpool Lime Street, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, Leeds City, Bristol Temple Meads, Edinburgh Waverley, Reading and Guildford stations were also affected. Earlier this month, TfL was hit by a cyber-attack that potentially breached thousands of customers\u2019 details. While services ran as normal, the company restricted access to live travel data that served travel apps such as Citymapper and TfL Go, and other customer services including those relating to journey history and photocard registration as it dealt with the breach. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said a 17-year-old boy from Walsall had been detained on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 in relation to the attack on TfL\u2019s systems. The teenager was released on bail after questioning by NCA officers. TfL said it was contacting about 5,000 customers as a precaution to warn that their email and bank account details could have been accessed. It is understood to relate to those who had applied for refunds on journeys made using Oyster cards. On Monday, TfL aid there was no date set for when passenger journey and live travel data would be accessible again. It added: \u201cWe can assure customers that once it is available they will be able to see their full journey history and correct any incomplete journeys or maximum fares.\u201d"

            "content": "A CrowdStrike senior executive apologized for causing a global software outage that ground the operations of hospitals, airports, payment systems and personal computers around the world to a halt in July. Adam Meyers, senior vice-president for counter-adversary operations at CrowdStrike, testified before Congress on Tuesday. Meyers will speak to the House homeland security cybersecurity and infrastructure protection subcommittee. In his testimony, he said: \u201cI am here today because, just over two months ago, on July 19, we let our customers down \u2026 On behalf of everyone at CrowdStrike, I want to apologize.\u201d He will say the company has undertaken \u201ca full review of our systems\u201d to prevent the cascade of errors from occurring again. The global software outage, which delayed flights and medical procedures and caused computers worldwide to display Microsoft\u2019s famous \u201cblue screen of death\u201d, was first thought to be the result of a sophisticated and malicious cyber-attack against the maker of Windows. The actual explanation, however, brought to mind Hanlon\u2019s razor: CrowdStrike had published an update to its Falcon sensor software, meant to detect and contain cybersecurity threats, which crashed roughly 8.5m computers running Windows instead. Meyers said the company was taking full responsibility for the crashes: \u201cThe July 19 incident stemmed from a confluence of factors that ultimately resulted in the Falcon sensor attempting to follow a threat-detection configuration for which there was no corresponding definition of what to do.\u201d Meyers said the company has implemented some changes that should prevent an outage from happening at this scale again. For instance, CrowdStrike will no longer roll out its software updates globally to all customers in a single session. The company is also allowing customers to select when they receive their updates; they can wait to be among the second- or third-round clients who receive the update. They can even choose to hold off on an update, though that could make them more vulnerable to security beaches because they won\u2019t have the most up-to-date threat assessment, Meyers warned. CrowdStrike\u2019s products rank among the world\u2019s most widely used cybersecurity software. The company has boasted on its site that it protects more than half of America\u2019s Fortune 1,000 companies. After the disastrous, botched update, however, it lost tens of billions of dollars in market value, and its CEO has conducted a months-long apology tour."

            "date": "2024-09-06T11:33:46Z",
            "content": "Poppy Gustafsson, the co-founder and chief executive of the British cybersecurity firm Darktrace, is to leave the company after its $5.3bn (\u00a34.2bn) sale to the US private equity business Thoma Bravo. Gustafsson, one of the best-known figures in the UK tech industry, founded Darktrace in Cambridge in 2013 with backing from the late billionaire Mike Lynch\u2019s Invoke Capital. In April, Thoma Bravo, which walked away from previous takeover talks in 2022, agreed a deal for the London-listed company that had been considered by analysts to be undervalued by investors. Gustafsson is to step down with immediate effect and will be replaced by Jill Popelka, Darktrace\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cDarktrace has been a huge part of my life and my identity for over a decade and I am immensely proud of everything we have achieved in that time,\u201d said Gustafsson, who was awarded an OBE for services to cybersecurity in 2019. \u201cNow is the right time to hand over the reins so Jill can lead Darktrace through its transition into private ownership and beyond. I remain Darktrace\u2019s number one fan.\u201d Like many of Darktrace\u2019s management and key staff, Gustafsson, who co-founded the firm when she was 30, was a former employee at Lynch\u2019s software company Autonomy. Hewlett-Packard sued Lynch, alleging that he duped the US company into overpaying when it struck an $11bn deal for Autonomy in 2011. HPE won a civil claim against Lynch in the English high court in 2022, but the tycoon was cleared of fraud charges in a US court in June. The 59-year-old and six others died last month when a superyacht sank off the coast of Sicily in a storm. In 2018, Darktrace was subpoenaed by US authorities for information about Invoke, warning there was a risk of money-laundering claims if its backing money included cash generated by the Autonomy sale. Gustafsson, whose favourite mode of transport is said to be a canary-coloured Vespa, floated Darktrace on the stock exchange in 2021. Shares have risen more than 70% over that period. Lynch and his wife, Angela Bacares, held a 6.8% stake in Darktrace that was worth \u00a3300m at the time of the sale. Gustafsson has been a champion of gender diversity in tech, an industry that, in the UK, is more than 70% male in terms of employment compared with a broadly 50/50 split across the wider economy. Three out of 10 of Darktrace\u2019s 2,400 employees are female, in line with the industry average of 29%. Gustafsson has spoken in the past of being at industry events and seeing \u201ca sea of men staring back at you\u201d. Her departure will reduce the number of female leaders in the UK tech industry, where women occupy just one in five senior roles, according to a recent industry survey. Darktrace\u2019s time as a publicly listed company has been dogged by controversy and a number of short-sellers and analysts have criticised the business model as sales over substance. Between 2022 and 2023, the short-sellers Shadowfall and Quintessential Capital Management (QCM) published highly critical reports. The latter alleged that questionable accounting and sales practices were used to drive up the value of the business before its flotation in 2021. Analysts at the UK investment bank Peel Hunt published a report in 2022 citing anonymous Darktrace clients calling its products \u201csnake oil\u201d. The attacks, which led to Darktrace\u2019s share price plummeting to record lows, prompted Gustafsson to publish a 1,200-word defence of the company last year in which she said it was run with the \u201cgreatest integrity\u201d. Gustafsson grew up in Cambridgeshire, where her father ran an agricultural sales business and her mother was a journalist for Farmers Weekly. After attending Hinchingbrooke secondary school \u2013 alumni include Oliver Cromwell and Samuel Pepys, and the Wolf Hall author, Hilary Mantel, was patron of its 450th anniversary \u2013 she took a maths degree at the University of Sheffield, where her first student job was building kitchen cabinets. She then qualified as an accountant at Deloitte before working for Amadeus Capital, the venture capital company run by Arm Holdings co-founder Hermann Hauser. In 2009, she moved to Lynch\u2019s Autonomy."

            "date": "2024-09-17T11:18:38Z",
            "content": "Users of Feeld, a dating app aimed at alternative relationships, could have had sensitive data including messages, private photos and details of their sexuality accessed or even edited, it has emerged, after cybersecurity experts exposed a string of security \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d. Feeld, registered in the UK, reported soaring revenues and profits this month, thanks to millions of downloads from non-monogamous, queer and kinky users across the world. But while the app has gone from strength to strength financially \u2013 and attracted plaudits for its approach to sexuality \u2013 a British cybersecurity company claims to have uncovered serious failings in Feeld\u2019s systems earlier this year. Feeld said it had dealt with the concerns \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d, resolved them within two months and that it had not seen any evidence that user data had been breached. It did not know how long the vulnerabilities had existed before it was told about them in March by the London-based cybersecurity firm Fortbridge. Fortbridge discovered the issues after \u201cpentesting\u201d, an industry term for security assessments of websites and apps to identify weaknesses that attackers could exploit. Its researchers found that it was possible to read other people\u2019s messages exchanged in chats on Feeld and even see attachments, which can include sexually explicit pictures and videos. This could be done without using a Feeld account, as long as a potential hacker had the user\u2019s \u201cstream user ID\u201d, potentially visible to anyone who could see their profile. Messages could be edited and deleted, the researchers found, and chats deleted by the users could be recovered. Time-limited photos and videos, commonly used to share explicit images that self-delete after one viewing, could be retrieved and seen indefinitely, by accessing a link available to the sender. Fortbridge said the failings could also allow a hacker to change someone else\u2019s profile information, including their name, age and sexuality. It was also possible to view other people\u2019s matches and to manually force one profile to \u201clike\u201d another. The cybersecurity company told the Guardian that the failings could have been exploited by someone with \u201cbasic technical knowledge\u201d. Adrian Tiron, a managing partner at Fortbridge, said: \u201cAlthough these aren\u2019t the most sophisticated bugs we\u2019ve found or exploited, they are certainly some of the most impactful due to Feeld\u2019s large user base, putting a significant number of users at risk. \u201cIn the industry, it\u2019s common practice for companies to share their best research with the community. We\u2019ve learned a great deal from others by reading their reports, and now it\u2019s our turn to give back. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed that many companies claim to prioritise security, but often these are just words \u2013 more action is needed.\u201d Feeld said it had not shared information about the security flaws publicly, including with users, because it did not want to \u201cinvite bad actors\u201d to manipulate private information. It said members would be told directly about how it had fixed the issues and that it was looking at sharing more \u201cproactive updates\u201d in future via its website, email and the app. Alex Lawrence-Archer, a solicitor at the data rights specialist law firm AWO, said Feeld could now face repercussions from the data regulator, the information commissioner\u2019s office, or from any user whose information was found to have been accessed. \u201cIf this is right, that personal data, including messages and private photos, was exposed in this way \u2013 or even capable of being accessed \u2013 there\u2019s a strong argument that it\u2019s in beach of the core GDPR principle that data must be processed in a secure fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing I\u2019d expect the ICO to investigate, if accurate, to get to the bottom of what\u2019s gone on and whether any remedial or enforcement action is warranted. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s photos or messages have been accessed. If it turned out that they had, such an individual would have cause of action against Feeld, for instance if they had suffered distress.\u201d Lawrence-Archer said the security vulnerabilities also raised potential concerns about identification of LGBTQ+ people in countries where homosexuality is illegal. The ICO said it had not received reports of a data breach at Feeld. Feeld said it had not informed the regulator because it had seen no evidence that anyone had accessed private data and a third-party organisation had approved its decision not to self-report. The company said it had investigated the problems brought to its attention by Fortbridge on 3 March and fixed them by 28 May but had failed to communicate adequately to Fortbridge that the issues had been resolved and were being reviewed by a third party. It said no issues were outstanding, except for one that allowed non-members to access premium features, adding that it welcomed further pentesting. \u201cOur members\u2019 safety and security is our top priority, and we welcome ongoing collaboration with the ethical hacking community to identify vulnerabilities as this only strengthens our platform for the future,\u201d said a spokesperson. It added that it had previously been unable to run the kind of tests on its systems that Fortbridge had done but was now able to do so."

            "content": "US employers added 142,000 jobs last month, the labor department announced on Friday, in one of the year\u2019s most closely watched economic news releases. The release comes as the US Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest rates for the first time since March 2020, and November\u2019s election puts a spotlight on the state of the US economy. The reading for August was shy of the average forecast increase of 163,000 jobs by economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The labor department also cut its figures for the number of new hires for June and July by a combined 86,000 jobs, a further sign that the remarkable post-pandemic hiring boom is weakening. The headline unemployment rate also decreased from 4.3% to 4.2%, in line with expectations. US stock markets fell as investors worried about a weakening economy and fears that the artificial intelligence boom may prove less lucrative than first thought. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6% with the broader S&amp;P 500 down 1.7% and Dow Jones industrial average down 1%. Over five trading sessions, the S&amp;P suffered its worst week since 2023. The Nasdaq endured its worst week since 2022. Tech companies including Nvidia, the chips giant, and Alphabet, owner of Google and YouTube, led Friday\u2019s sell-off. The economy is ranked as one of the most important issues heading into November\u2019s presidential election, amid significant unease over its strength. Donald Trump led Kamala Harris by 3% in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll on the candidates\u2019 approaches to the economy and employment. Last month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics made a significant revision, lowering the number of job created in the 12 months to March by 818,000, or 0.5%, the largest revision since 2009. The revision tapered job increase reports to about 174,000 jobs a month added, compared with the previously reported rate of about 242,000 jobs a month. The revision came amid signs that the jobs market is weakening. On Wednesday the labor department reported that the number of job openings has fallen to its lowest level in three and a half years. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, recently signaled plans to reduce interest rates when the central bank holds its next meeting on 17 and 18 September, declaring that \u201cthe time has come\u201d for the Fed to act. \u201cThe direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\u201d he said. Two years ago, when inflation was soaring during the pandemic, policymakers at the Fed scrambled to cool the US economy by raising rates to a two-decade high. Now that price growth is falling back \u2013 it rose at an annual rate of 2.9% in July, having faded from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2013 they are preparing to cut rates, but have yet to do so. Officials hope to guide the US to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, whereby inflation is normalized, and recession avoided. The Fed\u2019s target for inflation is 2%. In recent months, critics of the Fed have accused the central bank of sitting on its hands and derailing the US economy, amid unease over its direction. An unexpectedly weak jobs report for July, which came a day after the Fed again chose to hold rates steady, sparked a fleeting global sell-off. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the report showed \u201cthe labor market is clearly experiencing a marked slowdown\u201d but \u201coverall, still consistent with an economy experiencing a soft landing rather than plummeting into recession\u201d."

            "date": "2024-09-07T20:00:27Z",
            "content": "In a week dominated by headlines declaring the \u201cweakest growth in decades\u201d (excluding Covid) with an economy being \u201csmashed\u201d by the Reserve Bank, it might seem Australia teeters on the edge on an abyss. For some households and businesses, the challenge of paying stratospheric housing costs amid 13-year-high interest rates will alas be overwhelming. For the bulk of the population, though, there is an option of optimism. It might not be a Panglossian \u201cbest of possible times\u201d but the worst may already be behind us (provided large, lurking problems remain at bay). Sure, the June quarter national accounts weren\u2019t champagne-worthy. Per capita GDP fell for a record sixth quarter in a row to be 2% lower than its recent peak in the June quarter of 2022, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. However, in that statistical cherry tree, it\u2019s not hard to pick a lot of decent fruit from rotten ones. That cumulative per capita drop, for instance, wasn\u2019t great but as the seasoned economist Saul Eslake notes, four other downturns since the 1960s prompted by tighter monetary policy produced declines of between 2.8% and 6.3%. (The latter related to a painful 1981-83 recession overseen by the then treasurer John Howard who was this week busy providing advice to the current incumbent Jim Chalmers.) Media usually focuses on news. The June quarter data wasn\u2019t in fact newsy, since we\u2019ve known for months we\u2019d get the weakest growth figures in this current slowdown. (The RBA\u2019s 0.9% annual growth forecast was narrowly exceeded, nor does the governor, Michele Bullock, observe a \u201csmashed\u201d nation.) Aside from Covid-era contortions, Australia\u2019s economy has reliably grown for decades. Our swelling population has helped, as has China\u2019s voracious demand for our commodities (and university places), lifting living standards without us having to be particularly savvy. Yes, consumers are under the pump, with households saving just 0.9% of income in the year to June, the lowest since 2006-07, the ABS said. That ratio, though, should pick up this quarter and beyond as the stage-three tax cuts (revised by the Albanese government amid a storm of media angst earlier this year) do their thing. The $23bn in federal tax cuts are the equivalent of two RBA rate cuts of 25 basis points. But they\u2019re spread out over the year, and early indications \u2013 such as flat retail turnover in July \u2013 suggest households aren\u2019t in a splurging mood that would concern an RBA board still wary about ruling out another interest rate hike. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email In fact, additional savings would fatten the buffer most \u2013 but not all \u2013 families have to cope with any further economic slowdown. (Household wealth is also up almost $2tn, or 13%, since May 2022.) Bullock on Thursday said that, yes, some might be forced to sell their homes because they couldn\u2019t meet debt repayments. However, \u201cdespite the pressure on household budgets, only a small share of borrowers is currently at risk of falling behind on their mortgage repayments\u201d. Less than an hour after wrapping up her speech, the Council of Financial Regulators \u2013 of which Bullock is a member \u2013 echoed that surety. Despite global risks remaining elevated and challenging domestic conditions, Australia\u2019s financial system \u201ccontinued to display a high level of resilience\u201d, the council said in its quarterly update. \u201c[M]ost Australian household and business borrowers were managing pressure on their finances; loan arrears were picking up only gradually and from a low level,\u201d it said. Inflation, meanwhile, seems to be back trending lower, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics\u2019 gauge excluding volatile items dropping to 3.7% in July, its lowest level since January 2022. Global oil prices are wilting to one-year lows, implying good news for motorists. That other inflation bane \u2013 the rental market \u2013 is now at its weakest since the early phases of the pandemic, CoreLogic said on Friday. The case for cautious hope hinges largely on employment continuing to defy dismal consumer and business sentiment surveys. Provided people keep finding work and the hours they need, they should be able to service loans and buy necessities, at least. Since the RBA began lifting its cash rate (and the Albanese government took office) in May 2022, the economy has added almost 1m jobs, extending a run that remains perplexingly positive. Joblessness is up from 3.9% then to 4.2% in July, a rate still low by historical levels \u2013 a remarkable result, given soaring interest rates and a record share of the population (67.1%) in the labour market. Eslake says that\u2019s the story Chalmers should be trumpeting. The government is attempting to stop the economy stalling and people losing their jobs in droves. \u201cChalmers can say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s working,\u2019\u201d he says, rather than saying the RBA was \u201csmashing the economy\u201d when it\u2019s not smashed. The rosy jobs cherry might yet turn sour. One labour hire manager points to dwindling profits at Ashley Services and IT specialist PeopleIn as portents of a downturn. He also reckons corporate grief tends to be most acute a year after interest rates peak when relatively painless measures have been exhausted. Unless the RBA has another unpleasant rates whack to wield, we should be near that stress peak. Job vacancies are turning lower, and were a quarter off their peak as of May, the ABS said. This data will be updated on 26 September, two days after the RBA\u2019s next board meeting. However, the economy boasted 353,000 job openings, some 55%, or 125,000, more than in February 2020 when the pandemic began ramping up. Smaller firms are generally considered more at risk than larger ones. Judo Bank\u2019s latest survey of small- and medium-sized enterprises, released on Friday, offered another cheery cherry. Business confidence for August climbed to its highest level since January 2023 \u201cas price pressures lessened\u201d, the bank said. Business conditions were also above the 50.0 neutral mark for the first time in three months and rising at the fastest clip since April. Manufacturing, too, is preparing \u201ca major rise\u201d in investment next year, the ABS said. Signs of an upturn are vulnerable to shocks, such as China\u2019s slowdown being much worse than official data suggest (as this recent visitor contends), or US elections trigger violent disputes. More weird weather, fuelled by global heating, is a given. In the meanwhile, though, positive tidings abound \u2013 if you want to look for them.

            "content": "Uncertainty before Labour\u2019s first budget since 2010 next month is weighing on the UK economy, according to two separate business surveys. The data company S&amp;P Global said UK private sector activity growth slowed for the second consecutive month in September, affecting the services and manufacturing industries. Some companies reported that clients were taking a \u201cwait-and-see approach\u201d to decision-making before the autumn budget, which is hitting investment plans, even as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, wants to encourage business investment to boost economic growth. The figures suggest that Labour\u2019s emphasis on its poor inheritance from the previous Conservative administration and the need for a tough budget on 30 October were weighing on the immediate outlook for many businesses. The S&amp;P survey found that the budget was \u201cby far the most cited concern among UK private sector firms\u201d. Export orders remained \u201crelatively subdued\u201d and total overseas sales rose only \u201cmarginally\u201d in September. The survey said: \u201cSome service providers noted higher demand from US clients, but manufacturers frequently suggested that weak EU sales had weighed on export orders.\u201d A separate survey of manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) found that export order books in the three months to September were at their weakest since December 2020 \u2013 during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, and just before the UK signed the Brexit trade agreement. In its industrial trends report, which the CBI described as \u201cuniformly disappointing\u201d, total and export order books at manufacturers deteriorated in September. A net balance of -44% of manufacturers reported that their export order books were below normal this month, compared with a reading of -22% in August. Ben Jones, the CBI lead economist, said: \u201cThe survey highlights that the recovery of the UK economy seen over the first half of 2024 remains fragile, with uneven progress seen across different sectors, and businesses increasingly cautious ahead of the budget at the end of next month.\u201d However, despite concerns of tax hikes in the budget and slowing growth, the S&amp;P survey racked up its 11th consecutive month of improving activity across the services and manufacturing sectors, and companies said their outlook over the next year was for new orders to grow. Overall, the flash UK PMI composite output index dipped to 52.9, down from August\u2019s 53.8. A figure above 50 indicates growth. Inflation is expected to moderate after companies slowed their price rises this month. The average prices charged by private sector businesses rose at the slowest rate since February 2021. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cA slight cooling of output growth across manufacturing and services in September should not be seen as too concerning, as the survey data is still consistent with the economy growing at a rate approaching 0.3% in the third quarter, which is in line with the Bank of England\u2019s forecast. \u201cBusiness optimism has also risen, albeit with concerns about the impact of the [budget] jangling nerves somewhat, notably in the manufacturing sector. Investment plans in particular are reported to have been put on ice pending clarity on the new government\u2019s policies, especially towards taxation.\u201d The UK economy has outperformed the eurozone this month, helping the pound hit a two-year high against the euro. Sterling gained half a eurocent to \u20ac1.1967, its highest level since early August 2022. A downturn in Germany, where business activity fell at the quickest rate for seven months in September, ,has pulled the wider eurozone economy into a contraction. Business activity across the euro area has decreased so far in September, with the HCOB flash eurozone PMI index dropping to 48.9, an eight-month low, and below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. Hamburg Commercial Bank predicts Germany\u2019s economy will shrink by 0.2% in the July-September quarter. That would put the country into recession, as GDP fell by 0.1% in April-June."

            "content": "The anticipated post-election bounceback in the UK economy failed to materialise as activity flatlined in July for a second month, according to the latest official data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the pre-election stalling of activity in June was followed by another month in which gross domestic product remained unchanged. Although the economy grew by 0.5% in the three months to July, the weak performance of the economy during Labour\u2019s first weeks in power came as a shock to the City, which had been expecting growth of 0.2% on the month. The economy grew by 0.7% in the first three months of 2024, followed by a 0.6% expansion in the second quarter, but the latest ONS figures suggest the recovery from the mild recession in late 2023 has petered out. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cI am under no illusion about the scale of the challenge we face and I will be honest with the British people that change will not happen overnight. Two quarters of positive economic growth does not make up for 14 years of stagnation.\u201d There was better news for the chancellor from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has revised up its growth forecasts for the UK after the unexpectedly strong performance of the economy in the first half of 2024. The OECD, made up of 38 rich-country members, said it expected the UK to grow by 1.1% this year and by 1.2% in 2025, compared with the 0.4% for 2024 and the 1% for 2025 that it had predicted in May. But while growth was picking up, the OECD said, the chancellor needed to look at tax reform as well as as increases in her forthcoming budget. \u201cThe UK faces a challenging economic environment of high interest rates and low growth limiting macroeconomic policy options,\u201d it said in its annual economic report. The second month of zero growth slightly pushed up market expectations that the Bank of England would cut interest rates for a second time in a row when policymakers meet on 19 September. Official borrowing costs currently stand at 5%. Ruth Gregory, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cFor now, we are sticking to our view that the Bank of England will keep interest rates unchanged in September before cutting rates again in November. But today\u2019s data has made an interest rate cut next Thursday a bit more likely.\u201d Of the three main sectors of the economy, only one \u2013 services \u2013 recorded any growth in July, expanding by 0.1%. Production, which includes manufacturing, contracted by 0.8%, while there was a 0.4% drop in construction output. Liz McKeown, the ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u201cJuly\u2019s monthly services growth was led by computer programmers and health, which recovered from strike action in June. These gains were partially offset by falls for advertising companies, architects and engineers. Manufacturing fell, overall, with a particularly poor month for car and machinery firms, while construction also declined.\u201d The ONS said in the three months to July the level of GDP was 1.1% higher than in the same three months of 2023. Before the release of the ONS figures, economists had thought the slowdown witnessed in June was temporary and caused by political uncertainty. Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said it was still possible the summer slowdown was a blip but said Reeves needed to be careful in her budget next month. \u201cGiven the mood music emanating from the government and the economic inheritance it has received from the Conservatives, the government needs to be careful not to overcorrect with its narrative around tax rises and the potential this has to put off investment,\u201d James said. Anna Leach, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors business lobby group, said: \u201cIt is important that the forthcoming budget delivers a strong and positive message on growth. To reinforce business confidence to grow and invest, businesses need a predictable and efficient tax system, and growth-supporting policies.\u201d"

            "content": "Keir Starmer\u2019s warning of tax rises is probably justified (Starmer hints at tax rises as he warns of \u2018painful\u2019 budget, 27 August). But after condemning failures under the Tories, he went on to promulgate a conspiracy theory that is straight out of Daily Mail-land, and echoed years of divisive rhetoric by Tory politicians. Of the rioters, he said \u201cthey thought \u2018they\u2019ll never arrest me. And if they do, I won\u2019t be prosecuted. And if I am, I won\u2019t get much of a sentence\u2019.\u201d This is a ludicrous assertion, and came without the slightest pretence of offering evidence. If there was any truth in it, it would be a terrifying proposition that a reckless minority was well enough organised to take cynical note of the chaos in the justice system and proceed to riot on the basis of that. The suggestion is poisonous in its invitation to ordinary members of society to fear evil plots by their fellow citizens. Already we are seeing a surge of voices demanding that children should not end up with criminal records, a likely result of Starmer\u2019s populist response to the riots. It looks like more of the same: demonising the poor to cover up government failures, with reckless disregard of the likely social consequences. Jeremy Cushing Wiveliscombe, Somerset \u2022 It is unfortunate, though doubtless politically expedient, that Keir Starmer blamed the riots on the prison crisis. He could have taken this historic opportunity to blame the decades long and increasingly toxic political discourse on asylum and immigration. He could have blamed racist, far-right organisers. He could have blamed complicit social media platforms and celebrity influencers. His failure to name these elements seems to show a deliberate unwillingness to tackle these issues head-on, leaving the underlying negative narrative around asylum and immigration still firmly in place. Gideon Ben-Tovim University of Liverpool \u2022 There are clear parallels between Keir Starmer\u2019s rose garden speech and Harold Wilson\u2019s political broadcast, made immediately after he won the October 1974 election. Wilson started by saying that following the Opec oil crisis, the country was facing its gravest crisis since the war. He said that there would be no increases in living standards in the next few years, and gave a thinly disguised warning of very difficult economic decisions to come. This contrasted distinctly with his positive electioneering analysis of the country\u2019s economic problems only a few days earlier. His speech generated anticipation of a much-needed change of direction in economic policy. Yet only a month later, Denis Healey\u2019s budget failed to deliver on these threatened changes. A political opportunity to introduce unpopular, yet necessary, economic policies had been squandered. Two years later, the Labour government was forced to borrow what up to then was the largest ever amount from the International Monetary Fund and have stringent economic policies imposed on it. Thatcher won the following election. Starmer and Rachel Reeves should not flinch from making the right economic decisions. They have time on their hands and the political window to do this. If that means increases to income tax to help rectify our woeful public services, then so be it.

            "date": "2024-09-27T10:00:11Z",
            "content": "Earlier this year, at Donald Trump\u2019s hush-money trial, adult film star Stormy Daniels told jurors how at age 27, she met a 60-year-old Trump, whose wife had only recently given birth to their son, for what she thought was dinner. She arrived to find him in satin pyjamas and, during an encounter that included very \u201cbrief\u201d sex, the business magnate told Daniels that she reminded him of his daughter, Ivanka. I\u2019m not dragging all this up again to put you off your dinner. I\u2019m bringing it up to remind you that, while all these sordid details made headlines and generated jokes on late-night talkshows, they didn\u2019t move the needle with Trump\u2019s voters at all. His base, which includes evangelical Christians, simply didn\u2019t care. Nor were they bothered about Trump\u2019s association with Mark Robinson, the disgraced Republican candidate running to be North Carolina\u2019s next governor who was allegedly once active on a porn forum called Nude Africa where he boasted about being a \u201cperv\u201d. The 2024 US elections may have provided a constant stream of revelations ranging from the mildly salacious to the downright disturbing. It\u2019s not just Trump: there\u2019s the recent reports of New York magazine star reporter Olivia Nuzzi having a personal relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr during his presidential run and sitting representative Matt Gaetz being investigated for human trafficking and paying for sex with minors. Yet despite the many lurid and often unpleasant details, political sex scandals just don\u2019t seem to have much bite anymore. \u201cWe have lost our shame muscle in the United States,\u201d says Dr Alison Dagnes, professor of the political science department at Shippensburg University. She argues that because politicians aren\u2019t shamed into retiring from public life, details of these scandals remain mostly rumors and fade from the public memory. \u201cCertain politicians are realizing that if you don\u2019t apologize for something, then nobody can use it against you again. For those who are shameless, that is a very effective way to get through life.\u201d It hasn\u2019t always been like this. Being embroiled in a sex scandal used to swing an election or destroy a candidate. In 1987, Gary Hart was the presumed Democratic presidential candidate \u2013 until reports of \u201cwomanizing\u201d and being caught in an affair derailed his campaign. In 2008, North Carolina senator John Edwards, a star in the Democratic party, was on a path to the presidency until he was caught covering up an extramarital affair that resulted in a child. His career imploded and he vanished from public life. In 2014, the Washington Post analysed 38 sex scandals going back to 1974 and found that \u201cjust 39 percent of officeholders won reelection after coming under scrutiny for sexual harassment, affairs or prostitution, while the rest chose not to run, resigned or lost\u201d. While Bill Clinton may have survived his affair (if you can call the most powerful man in the world preying on an intern an \u201caffair\u201d) with Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s, he seems to have made the US a little less tolerant of impropriety. \u201cThe survival rate [for sex scandals] has plummeted since Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. In 15 scandals since 2000, just three officeholders (or 20 percent) facing personal scandals have won reelection,\u201d the Post noted. It added: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear why personal scandals that were once shrugged off \u2026 are more consequential today.\u201d Clearly, things have changed again since then. Partly this is due to the fact that America\u2019s trust in media has fallen to historic lows in recent years \u2013 a phenomenon that is linked to growing polarization. Jay Van Bavel, a professor of neural science at New York University and an expert in \u201cthe partisan brain\u201d, notes that \u201cpeople don\u2019t trust institutions and media sources that aren\u2019t aligned with them ideologically\u201d. Many of Trump\u2019s supporters simply don\u2019t believe his accusers, and don\u2019t believe the media sources reporting on his actions. Even if people do believe allegations about a politician, says Van Bavel, \u201cthey\u2019re willing to excuse bad behaviour and continue voting for a person or party member because they don\u2019t want the other party to take power\u201d. A 2020 study that he worked on, alongside 14 other prominent researchers, looked at survey data since the 1970s and found that, for the first time, contempt for the other political party is greater than affection for one\u2019s own. Voting behaviour is now essentially driven by who you hate the most. Trump, of course, is well aware of this. In 2016, the former president joked that he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and he still wouldn\u2019t lose any voters. But Trump is a unique case. There may have been a loosening of America\u2019s moral compass but there are still lines that most politicians can\u2019t cross. Some of these lines are dictated by a cultural moment. See, for example, Democratic senator Al Franken, who resigned in 2017 because of sexual misconduct allegations. Were it not for the fact that it was the start of #MeToo and Franken was a Democrat, he could probably have weathered the accusations, suggests Jodi Dean, a professor in the political science department at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. But \u201cit seems like a Democratic base want purity\u201d. And \u201cFranken had a sense of shame\u201d, so he stepped down. Mixing sex and taxpayer money also makes a scandal more difficult to weather. \u201cIf it is an issue that\u2019s a private matter, the American public is more likely to let it go,\u201d Dagnes notes. \u201cBut if there\u2019s some sort of official corruption involved, then they\u2019re less likely to.\u201d Dagnes references the recent case of Republican Anthony D\u2019Esposito who, according to a New York Times investigation, put his fiancee\u2019s daughter and a woman with whom he was having an affair on his payroll. \u201cI would expect D\u2019Esposito to really take a big polling hit,\u201d says Dagnes. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just: \u2018My fiancee and I were going through a really difficult time\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a case of: \u2018I feel so emboldened that I\u2019m going to put my mistress and my fiancee\u2019s daughter on my payroll,\u2019 which is paid by the American taxpayer. That makes voters feel duped.\u201d Gender also plays a part in how sex scandals are received, with women routinely being held to far higher standards than men. Dagnes notes, for example, that the right has been trying very hard to manufacture a scandal out of the fact that Kamala Harris, who was single at the time, had a relationship with San Francisco mayor Willie Brown, who was also single at the time, in the 1990s. Somehow they think this makes her \u201ca slut\u201d. There is, for example, a lot of merchandise for sale with the phrase \u201cJoe and the Hoe Gotta Go\u201d. This isn\u2019t to say that women, particularly attractive young white women, are always held to higher standards than men. While Nuzzi has been put on leave by New York magazine following news of her previously undisclosed relationship with RFK Jr, she has also been cut a surprising amount of slack for what is clearly professional misconduct. \u201cReporters have all sorts of compromising relationships with sources,\u201d shrugged Ben Smith from Semafor. \u201cThe most compromising of all, and the most common, is a reporter\u2019s fealty to someone who gives them information. That\u2019s the real coin of this realm. Sex barely rates.\u201d That said, Nuzzi is certainly getting dragged through the mud for the affair more than RFK Jr, who is well-known for what he has called \u201cwild impulses\u201d and \u201clust demons\u201d. Previous reports about Kennedy\u2019s private life suggest he detailed extramarital encounters with 37 women in a 2001 diary. That didn\u2019t stop him from trying to run for president, of course. But neither did allegations he once assaulted a babysitter \u2013 to which he responded by stating: \u201cI am not a church boy.\u201d Kennedy also hasn\u2019t let brain worms or dead bears get in the way of his political ambitions. The fact that sex scandals no longer seem to register with voters seems to be linked to a wider acceptance of outrageous political behaviour. \u201cPoliticians can now go out and say that they\u2019re in favor of nuking Gaza [as Senator Lindsey Graham and Representative Greg Murphy have hinted towards],\u201d Dean observes. \u201cPoliticians are openly bloodthirsty and genocidal. That\u2019s permissible speech right now. Ours is now a time where genocide is not a major scandal, where climate change is not a major scandal. We really might be over the age of where an individual\u2019s act is going to gather the same amount of tension as it once did. We\u2019re seeing a sense of right and wrong totally breaking down.\u201d"

            "content": "The Democratic party? Robert F Kennedy Jr\u2019s never heard of it. On Tuesday, the former presidential candidate issued his latest condemnation of the \u201cDemocrat party\u201d, endorsing a bizarre linguistic tradition among haters of the institution. As Donald Trump told a rally in 2018: \u201cI call it the Democrat party. It sounds better rhetorically.\u201d By \u201cbetter\u201d, of course, he meant \u201cworse\u201d, as he explained the next year: he prefers to say \u201cthe \u2018Democrat party\u2019 because it doesn\u2019t sound good\u201d. In removing two letters from \u201cDemocratic\u201d, the former president is adopting a jibe that\u2019s been around since at least the 1940s. Opponents of the party long ago decided, for some reason, that this brutal act of syllabic denial would shame their opponents. Democrats don\u2019t seem particularly devastated by the attack, but Republicans and those who love them have stuck with it. We hear it regularly from party luminaries such as JD Vance, Mike Johnson and Nikki Haley; pragmatic independents like RFK Jr; and media voices across the vast spectrum from Fox News to Infowars. Last week, even Tulsi Gabbard, once a Democratic presidential candidate herself, wrote an op-ed proudly describing her departure from the Democrat party and support for Trump. But even if the misnaming doesn\u2019t exactly leave liberal snowflakes in tears, it does serve a purpose, says Nicole Holliday, acting associate professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. It\u2019s a marker of affiliation \u2013 an indicator of the media a person consumes and the politicians they listen to. She recently heard a friend remark on \u201cDemocrat party\u201d policies and asked why they used the term; the friend wasn\u2019t even aware they had done it. \u201cLanguage is contagious, especially emotionally charged political language,\u201d Holliday says. \u201cMost of the time, we don\u2019t have the cognitive bandwidth to think very hard about every single word that we\u2019re using. We just use it because it\u2019s what other people do.\u201d That lack of awareness \u201cshows how normalized it\u2019s become\u201d, says Larry Glickman, Stephen and Evalyn Milman professor in American studies at Cornell University, who likens the term to a \u201cschoolyard taunt\u201d. It suggests the party is \u201coutside the mainstream of American politics so much so that we\u2019re not even going to call them by the name they prefer. We refuse to give them that amount of respect.\u201d It\u2019s part of a familiar pattern, as Holliday has written: \u201cIntentionally calling a set of people by something other than their official and preferred form of reference is a common tactic of opposition that is designed to confer disrespect.\u201d If someone named Christopher prefers not to be called Chris, and you do it anyway, it\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019re being rude \u2013 regardless of your politics, she says. And she and Glickman both point out that we\u2019re seeing a new version of the same unpleasant phenomenon when it comes to the pronunciation of Kamala Harris\u2019s first name. Almost half the speakers at the Republican convention got it wrong, according to the Washington Post. At a July rally, Trump said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if he mispronounced the word. Eventually, Harris\u2019s grandnieces, ages six and eight, felt compelled to offer a lesson at the Democratic convention this month. Such bullying may be a Trump trademark, but its origins are a bit fuzzy. According to Glickman, the term first came to prominence in 1946 thanks to a congressman named Brazilla Carroll Reece, who headed the Republican National Committee. Unlike Trump, Reece saw himself as a liberal \u2013 at least according to that era\u2019s definition of the term; still, he wasn\u2019t a fan of the New Deal or other recent developments. He used the term to indicate that what was once the Democratic party no longer existed: it had been commandeered by \u201cradicals\u201d. In 1948, the Republican party platform left off the \u201cic\u201d in \u201cDemocratic\u201d, and in 1952, a newspaper columnist asked: \u201cWho has taken the \u2018ic\u2019 out of the party of our fathers?\u201d Senator Joseph McCarthy, meanwhile, helped popularize the term. Over the decades, the Democratic party became associated with liberal policies, and eventually, \u201cthe \u2018Democrat party\u2019 slur became a condemnation of liberalism itself\u201d, Glickman wrote. The phrase was a huge hit in the 90s and 2000s; Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh and George W Bush played it on repeat. By the following decade, Trump was mandating the word: \u201cThe Democrat party. Not Democratic. It\u2019s Democrat. We have to do that.\u201d Removing the \u201cic\u201d does seem to suggest the party isn\u2019t about democracy. But if that\u2019s the goal, Glickman wonders: \u201cWhy not call it the undemocratic party? Like Trump used to say the Department of Injustice.\u201d And anyway, as they\u2019ve proved since 2020, democracy isn\u2019t high on the list of Republican values. Instead, Glickman suggests, it\u2019s more about a \u201cbabyish\u201d tendency to misname people. Also, as Hendrik Hertzberg wrote in the New Yorker in 2006, \u201cit fairly screams \u2018rat\u2019.\u201d So what should Democrats do? Is it time to start calling Republicans Republics? Licans? Relics? President Harry Truman tried \u201cPublicans\u201d, and it clearly didn\u2019t take off. Perhaps it\u2019s best, especially considering that many people don\u2019t even know it\u2019s an insult, to just keep ignoring it. Getting mad would be taking the bait. \u201cThis would be constructed as Democrats are weak pedants who can\u2019t take a joke and they\u2019re policing our language and see how they\u2019re so heavy-handed with regulation?\u201d Holliday says. So Democrats can let the attempts at bullying continue. Trump and his gang clearly need to blow off some steam; might as well be through the world\u2019s tiniest, oddest insult."

On one side was her team, Iowa, standard bearers for white middle America. On the other was Louisiana State University (LSU), Black America\u2019s team. When LSU went on to beat Iowa by double digits and win the most watched women\u2019s college basketball contest to date, sympathy was quick to gather around the white phenom who had given her all in defeat \u2013 and it flowed straight from the top. \u201cYou know,\u201d Jill Biden said after the game, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell Joe that I think Iowa should come too because they played such a good game.\u201d The first lady\u2019s comments, besides raising a national debate around race, were yet more evidence of how the American athlete has become not just a Rorschach test for politics, but also a giant funhouse mirror for our never-ending discourses and polarizing disagreements. During an election year in which fitness and vitality have been stubborn themes, the political surrogacy of sport has come into stark relief. In the overwhelmingly Black and gay WNBA, Clark has inadvertently become a champion to Maga Americans who fight against wokeness. At the all-inclusive Olympics, the champion gymnast Simone Biles prompted debates about work ethic and even the boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting became global culture war fodder. In the ultra-conservative NFL, Aaron Rodgers gets a green light to air his conspiracy theories on Covid and 9/11. The days when Laura Ingraham or another conservative pundit might tell an outspoken athlete to \u201cshut up and dribble\u201d are gone. Now it\u2019s more like shut up and juggle these convictions. And it translates directly to the election stage. July\u2019s Republican national convention, suspiciously light on lawmaker presenters, played out like a college pep rally. The UFC president, Dana White, gave Trump a football hero\u2019s introduction. Hulk Hogan, like a matryoshka doll, tore off one jingoistic sleeveless tee to reveal a Maga sleeveless T-shirt. At the Democratic national convention, meanwhile, the vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz provided the ticket a considerable measure of jock insurance, a sociological term of art for the masculine bona fides (football, hunting, military service) that give Walz latitude to wear his heart on his sleeve without being seen as weak. And to make his own football metaphors. He likened Project 2025, the radical tome the Heritage Foundation has proffered for Trump\u2019s re-election transition, to a playbook. \u201cThey spend a lot of time pretending they know nothing about this,\u201d Walz said of the Trump campaign\u2019s effort to distance their man from the plan. \u201cBut look, I coached high school football long enough to know, and trust me on this: when somebody takes the time to draw up a playbook, they\u2019re going to use it.\u201d In both arenas, sports and political, the stakes are only getting higher. From Muhammad Ali to the WNBA According to a 2023 Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, Americans are split on whether professional athletes should use their platform to espouse their social and political views. This is as fans are especially attuned to the views expressed in America\u2019s biggest sports leagues. The most outspoken male athletes tend to come from the NBA \u2013 an exceedingly progressive arena relative to football, baseball and Nascar. Last month\u2019s Democratic national convention tipped off with Golden State\u2019s Steve Kerr, the dean of NBA coaches, taking the stage at the United Center and delivering a full-throated endorsement of the vice-president. \u201cAfter the results are tallied, we can, in the words of the great Steph Curry, tell Donald Trump: \u2018Night, night,\u2019\u201d joked Kerr, nodding at Curry\u2019s flagrant victory pose. This was weeks after Curry himself offered his own public support of Harris when the vice-president visited with USA Basketball just before the Olympics. And when LeBron James takes a stand (\u201cWE DEMAND CHANGE!\u201d he tweeted after George Floyd), the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, often backs him up. Still, for all of the headway the NBA has made in foregrounding progressive political views and mobilizing voters, it lags well behind its sister league. The WNBA was not only first to embrace gay marriage and the social justice movement, but also led the campaign to replace the appointed Georgia lawmaker Kelly Loeffler, a team owner, with Raphael Warnock in the US Senate. Without WNBA players raising their voices in public and putting pressure on lawmakers and the Biden administrators, Brittney Griner arguably never would have made it home from Russian imprisonment. After the WNBA\u2019s mid-summer break for the Olympics, multiple players returned to work wearing T-shirts endorsing Harris for president. The current generation of athlete activists trace their roots to legendary rabble-rousers such as Muhammad Ali and Tommie Smith. Taking a stand wasn\u2019t easy back then. \u201cWe had political overtones right over our heads,\u201d says Smith, who mounted his historic Black power protest at the 1968 Olympics anyway. \u201cThe government and the Olympic Committee was laying threats on us. Fortune 500 companies were telling us we better not come home looking for no job. But I still had to go up to the podium and do what I did.\u201d The social media age has given athletes a proper platform and more latitude to speak out than ever before. But some, like Clark, are not yet comfortable weighing in on off-court matters; as far as the most recent public records can tell, she isn\u2019t even registered to vote. Because of that passivity, the discourse \u2013 whether about the WNBA\u2019s Black veterans playing Clark too tough (\u201cThis is a league that refuses to hold hostile players accountable,\u201d grandstanded the Indiana congressman Jim Banks) or about Clark earning significantly less than male peers despite her ceiling-cracking endorsement portfolio (\u201cWomen are not paid their fair share,\u201d the president tweeted) \u2013 happens totally outside of her. Clark\u2019s considered neutrality would not have seemed out of place 30 years ago, when athletes were more concerned with protecting their financial turf. But now players don\u2019t hesitate to get into the politics game. Sometimes the effort is as small as Taylor Walls \u2013 the Tampa Bay Rays shortstop who is white \u2013 celebrating an extra-base hit by aping Trump\u2019s defiant post-assassination stance to mixed live reviews (he\u2019s since reframed it as a tribute to \u201cstrength\u201d). Sometimes it\u2019s as big as Raven Saunders \u2013 the mask-wearing American female shot putter who is Black, gay and uses they/them pronouns \u2013 shocking onlookers at the Tokyo Games with her X-gesture protest on the medal stand. The gesture, they said, represented \u201cthe intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet\u201d. The NFL as the bastion of conservatism Conservative groupthink is most apparent on the football field. That was never more apparent than when the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick challenged league orthodoxy with his racial equity-driven protests of the national anthem. More recently, as college athletes have started getting paid like pros, well-heeled administrators and coaches have lined up before Congress to admonish an economic system suddenly bent on compensating a largely Black labor force that has toiled for decades essentially for free. America\u2019s unbidden appetite for all things football is how Tommy Tuberville, a slick former college coach, winds up a US senator and makes his mark blocking 400 military promotions over objections to the Pentagon\u2019s abortion policy. And football\u2019s inextricable ties to evangelical Christianity are how a recent supreme court decision favored a Washington state public high school football coach who was fired for convening post-game prayer circles on the field. When cartoon campaign ads billing a helmeted Harris as the \u201cofficial candidate of the Philadelphia Eagles\u201d began springing up on bus shelters around town, the NFL\u2019s toughest crowd was unsparing. (\u201cCan we leave politics out of sport?\u201d one complained, as the Eagles disavowed the ads and pledged to take them down.) The star quarterbacks Joe Burrow, Jared Goff and Daniel Jones were just as swift to correct the record after a series of viral social media posts had claimed they had joined a Harris fundraising call. When it comes to political messaging, football sticks with the conservative approach \u2013 a winning gameplan to most of their fans. But conservatives don\u2019t mind veering away from the field when it comes to admonishing those who don\u2019t support their causes. When the gender witch-hunt of Khelif, the Algerian boxing gold medalist, reached critical mass during the Paris Olympics, arch-conservatives moved on to interrogating the womanhood of the US swim great Katie Ledecky and rugby bronze medalist Ilona Maher, who hasn\u2019t been shy about publicly supporting Kamala Harris or advocating for women\u2019s reproductive rights. In the past eight years the right has reduced Simone Biles, universally recognized as the greatest gymnast of all time, to a hackneyed racial stereotype \u2013 the Black layabout who complains instead of pulling herself up by her bootstraps. Since she took a mental health break in the middle of the 2020 Tokyo Games, the North Carolina GOP gubernatorial challenger Mark Robinson hasn\u2019t been able to let it go. \u201cMy generation is cut from a different cloth, that I don\u2019t quit when the going gets tough,\u201d he said in a speech to the Alexander county Republican party in 2021. \u201c[But] I\u2019m not like somebody out there flipping around on TV on some monkey bars out there trying to get a gold medal for myself. I\u2019m doing this for a bigger cause.\u201d Never mind that she returned to competition, medaled and was virtually unstoppable in Paris. At this summer\u2019s Paris Olympics, Biles\u2019s silver-medal winning former teammate MyKayla Skinner reprised the Robinson line, saying that the USA Gymnastics current team \u2013 a multicultural and racially diverse gang that nicknamed themselves the Golden Girls \u2013 lacked work ethic. Biles, while nominally excluded from Skinner\u2019s analysis, took umbrage all the same and got the last laugh with her teammates when they won the women\u2019s team gold. Swamped with negative comments, Skinner beseeched her former teammate to condemn the cyberbullying. Essentially, Skinner retreated into her white privilege \u2013 going full Karen, in this case \u2013 in hopes of regaining ground in a culture war she restarted. Surprisingly, it has not worked. *** All of this has transformed sports from a neutral platform for fun and games to a politically charged arena where major movers go to prove their strength. June\u2019s presidential debate devolved into an argument over who\u2019s longer off the tee \u2013 Trump or Biden, whose \u201cDark Brandon\u201d epithet derives from the world of Nascar. At that moment, both men seemed to be borrowing from the playbook favored by Kim Jong-il, Vladimir Putin and other strongmen who embellish their sporting credentials to burnish their cult of personality. At the Republican national convention, JD Vance, a proud Ohio State grad, joked about having to earn votes from Michigan \u2013 a college football rivalry born from a revolutionary war-era border dispute. In the vastness of Fiserv Forum, home of the NBA\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks, some in the crowd looked on while wearing cheeseheads \u2013 the official headdress of Green Bay Packers fans. \u201cIt felt like a pep rally because there was literally no conversation about policy,\u201d says Carl Suddler, an Emory University professor who studies race, history and sports. \u201cIt was, \u2018My team is better than theirs.\u2019 And people eat that stuff up.\u201d What\u2019s more, it all fits with the party\u2019s cynical gameplan to reach Black men, the biggest consumers of sports television. The surprise substitution on the Democratic presidential ticket, from Biden to Harris, also has played out like the story of the quarterback on the hot seat forced off the job amid a grinding media drumbeat \u2013 down to NBA scoop merchant Shams Charania beating his rivals to the breaking news. When introducing her vice-presidential pick, Tim Walz, Harris made a point of referring to him as \u201cCoach Walz\u201d; at the Democratic national convention, his sports honorific was much preferred over his elected title: governor of Minnesota. Even those on the sidelines play a part. Before his presidential candidacy tanked in the GOP primaries, Vivek Ramaswamy waxed nostalgic about his charmed experience as a former ballboy and sometime hitting partner for Andre Agassi \u2013 the American tennis royal who has repeatedly turned down invitations from both sides of the aisle to run for Congress in his native Nevada. \u201cHis sage advice: the longest distance between two points is that between your mind &amp; your heart,\u201d Ramaswamy wrote in a post. \u201cBend the former to meet the latter.\u201d Rich talk coming from a guy who boosts the great replacement theory and claims the January 6 riot was an inside job. Politicians weren\u2019t always so shameless about forcing sports ties. Richard Nixon\u2019s obsession with the Washington Redskins was considered as deviant as his habit of taping all his conversations, while Gerald Ford, a two-way football star at Michigan, never got due respect for being the finest athlete to occupy the Oval Office. It\u2019s only since Barack Obama proclaimed himself the \u201chooper in chief\u201d that politicians have made leading with fandom their go-to play. Now both the American projections on its athletes and politicians\u2019 obsession with having their own athletic credentials are as intertwined as a ballpark funnel cake \u2013 larded, saccharine and loaded with empty calories. The paradigm has even reached the point where athletes are taking the heat for this sports bait-and-switch instead of the partisan activists who are really dialing up these plays. Asked about her unwitting role in this tense political game, Clark seemed exasperated, telling reporters: \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can control.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-25T12:10:46Z",
            "content": "When the news broke of stabbings at a children\u2019s dance class in Southport this summer, a palpable sense of grief, horror and anger rippled across the country. From the collective anguish brought on by the incident in which three young girls died, variations on the same question emerged: \u201cWho would do such a thing?\u201d Fabricated internet rumours claimed to have the answer: the man to blame was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK illegally last year and was on an M16 watchlist. There was one big problem: none of it was true. Once lit, the touchpaper of disinformation burned quickly. Although the rumour was roundly debunked, within a week riots led by the far right and fuelled by anti-immigrant hate had swept across many parts of the country, from Southport to Liverpool, Manchester, Sunderland, Hull and Leeds. In Rotherham, rioters tried to torch a hotel housing migrants. Soon, almost 30 racially motivated \u201canti-immigration demonstrations and riots\u201d erupted in 27 towns and cities in the UK. In France, the Lib\u00e9ration newspaper called Britain a \u201cDisunited Kingdom\u201d. Australia, Nigeria, Malaysia and Indonesia issued travel alerts; Elon Musk declared civil war \u201cinevitable\u201d. Within days, the same question asked of the Southport attacks was being asked of the riots that left members of minority communities fearing for their lives: who would do such a thing? Competing claims have been made about the nature of the rioters, from racists and terrorists, to left-behind communities whose legitimate anger has been warped by the far right. The Guardian has scrutinised data that provides insights into the lives of those accused of taking part in the unrest. Using court filings we have tracked the cases of almost 500 alleged rioters and cross referenced their personal details with other publicly available data. The findings provide the first comprehensive picture of those who took part in the riots \u2013 and challenge some of the assumptions made in their aftermath. The myth of the \u2018out-of-town\u2019 rioter The morning after the first riots at the scene of the Southport attacks, residents awoke to devastation on their doorsteps. The community quickly mobilised, wielding brooms. Nearby walls that had been torn down and used as ammunition were rebuilt. Among the early-morning volunteers was Norman Wallis, the chief executive of Southport Pleasureland, who voiced a common sentiment: the people piecing the streets back together were the true residents of Southport, whereas those who had ripped it apart in the first place were others, from elsewhere. \u201cThose people from out of town \u2013 they came in buses and cars and had changes of clothes. They just started to riot and do this,\u201d he said. It was a view echoed by the Labour MP for Southport, Patrick Hurley, who told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the next morning that the unrest was \u201cled by people from outside the town\u201d. It was a tempting conclusion to draw for those living in riot-hit areas. But it was not true. Data gathered by the Guardian on more than half of those charged to date shows that to be untrue. The majority of people charged in connection with the unrest were local to the disturbances in which they were accused of taking part. Analysis of the home addresses provided by those charged found that three-quarters lived within a 5-mile radius. According to Marcus North, a researcher at Hope Not Hate, this reflects the fact that the British far right is more atomised, with political parties such as the British National party or street movements such as the English Defence League no longer dominating the scene. \u201cWhile it may be comforting to believe that the riots and disturbances were primarily driven by out-of-towners, most of those involved appear to be locals who are plugged into far-right networks online,\u201d he said, adding that this reflected the \u201cpost-organisational\u201d nature of the modern far right, posing \u201cnew challenges\u201d. The longest distance between a riot and a defendant\u2019s home address in our dataset was that of George Coldicott, aged 28. Coldicott, of Leominster, was involved in the unrest in London on 31 July where he threw a metal fence panel at a police officer. He then also took part in disturbances in Bristol on 3 August. Deprived, in bad health and out of work Head north-east out of Manchester, on the road towards Oldham, and you will pass through a neighbourhood called Miles Platting. The site of slum clearances in the 1950s, the estate has had substantial recent investment to regenerate the area. The local pool closed more than a decade ago but community hubs remain: a community library, the local park, a nearby theatre \u2013 all located in the shadow of Manchester City\u2019s Etihad Campus. But Miles Platting is also the neighbourhood with the highest rate of people charged for taking part in the riots. At least six people from this estate have been prosecuted so far. The area has levels of deprivation higher than the average for both England and Manchester. Close to two-thirds of households are considered deprived, substantially above the average. It is a common trait across the neighbourhoods from which the rioters hail. Well over half of those charged with offences \u2013 most commonly violent disorder \u2013 came from the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods. But social deprivation is not the only commonality. Using census figures, the Guardian found that suspected rioters were also far more likely to live in areas with high levels of poor health. More than a third (36%) came from the 10% of neighbourhoods with the worst self-reported health levels. In the Hendon and Docks area of Sunderland where at least six residents were charged, almost 12% of people said they were in bad or very bad health in 2021, compared with 5.4% across England and Wales. More than a quarter (29%) of rioters came from the 10% of neighbourhoods with the lowest levels of qualifications. Areas that have the most residents with no qualifications or a level 1 certificate as their highest include Hendon and Docks as well as Bolton upon Dearne. There was also a correlation between where rioters lived and high proportions of people not in employment. Dr Stephanie Alice Baker, a reader in sociology at City St George\u2019s, University of London, has advised the UK parliament on online radicalisation and extremism. She observed that people who followed populist influencers expressed feeling \u201cleft behind\u201d as well as displaying a growing distrust in institutions. \u201cDecades of austerity, a cost of living crisis, the pandemic, inflation, rising rents, mortgages and energy bills have intensified collective grievances,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cAt the same time, there has been an erosion of institutional trust that was accentuated during the pandemic. People have lost faith in the system. This has resulted in many turning against the system and putting their [faith] in alternative sources of authority. It provides the conditions for social unrest.\u201d The politics of division As the riots raged on, the highest-profile new MP in the UK parliament, Nigel Farage, attracted criticism for \u201camplifying false information\u201d. Indeed, analysis of the addresses of rioters charged shows that those areas tend to have higher levels of support for Farage\u2019s Reform UK party: a third live in the 10% most Reform-voting constituencies in the country. In those constituencies that house five or more people charged, close to a quarter (22.3%) of the electorate voted Reform compared with 14.3% UK-wide. For Baker, this was not a surprise. She said: \u201cReform UK presents the narrative that Britain is broken and needs reform. The party speaks to some people\u2019s fears of inequality, rising immigration and the changing demographic of the country \u2013 and provides a solution in the form of Nigel Farage. At the same time, Farage\u2019s populist politics feeds these sentiments.\u201d But anti-immigrant sentiment predates the party, founded in 2018 as the Brexit party before a 2021 rebrand. As North pointed out: \u201cThe riots did not emerge from a vacuum but were fed by years of anti-migrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric and campaigning from the far right, from mainstream politicians and the reactionary press.\u201d No surprise, then, that in the days and weeks that followed the Southport incident there have been attempts from some of these quarters to legitimise the actions of those involved in the riots. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2013 who underwent his own rebrand to become Tommy Robinson \u2013 said in an X post that the Southport rioters were \u201cjustified in their anger\u201d; Andrew Tate, joined the chorus of those who wrongly claimed the attacker was an \u201cillegal migrant\u201d and called for people to \u201cwake up\u201d; GB News quoted the political commentator Matt Goodwin as saying: \u201cI think what is happening for a lot of people is protest. They are protesting illegal migration, the collapse of our border and being lied to.\u201d Immigration: perception v reality An often repeated claim is that the riots were, in part, a rejection of the country\u2019s policy on immigration. But if those people charged in connection with the riots were protesting against the presence of immigrants or asylum seekers, they did not appear to come from areas with appreciably high levels of either. Analysis of the neighbourhoods with a higher concentration of alleged rioters shows asylum seekers and Afghan and Ukrainian refugees made up 0.43% of the population, compared with 0.38% in the rest of the UK as of June. In areas with a smaller number of rioters, there is practically no difference between the proportion of asylum seekers housed by the local councils in which they live (0.37% in June 2024) when compared with the national average (0.38%). The perception of high numbers of migrants coming to the UK is one that research suggests is often skewed. A report by British Future and Ipsos published this week found people thought asylum made up more than five times as much of UK immigration as was actually the case. On average, the public think people seeking asylum represent more than a third of total immigration (37%) when in reality it accounts for only about 7%. Angry adults more than errant youths This summer\u2019s riots were inevitably compared with the disturbances of 13 years earlier, when widespread rioting broke out in London after the police shooting of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. As in 2024, the initial riot \u2013 in Tottenham \u2013 triggered similar disturbances in cities around the country. In both riots, the vast majority of those charged were male (only 7.5% of the 2024 sample are women). One significant difference, though, is the age profile of those who took to the streets: this time around, those rioting were significantly older. In 2011 a Ministry of Justice analysis found that only 5.6% of those brought before the courts were over the age of 40 (reflective, in part, of the fact that London is the youngest region in the UK). By comparison, more than a third of our sample of the first 500 rioters charged in 2024 \u2013 34.6% of defendants \u2013 were in that age category. The oldest person charged so far in the Guardian\u2019s data was 81. Keith Edwards, charged in connection to protests in Nottingham, pleaded not guilty to using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour during the protest. His solicitor said he had no involvement and was actually trying to help police arrest someone else. One in eight people captured in our sample are minors \u2013 a significantly lower proportion than in 2011 but still a substantial minority. Whereas the average age of rioters charged in 2011 skewed younger (although reports differ, the consensus is that they were in their early 20s) the average age of those captured in our 2024 sample is 32. The youngest person charged \u2013 who cannot be named for legal reasons \u2013 was just 12. The evolving role of social media Social media played an important role in amplifying disinformation and in the organisational sense of spreading word of flare-ups. But there is a marked difference between the online dynamics of the disturbances of the past and this summer\u2019s events, according to Baker. \u201cIn 2024, the internet ecosystem has changed. We now have a series of influencers and prominent public figures who have built large online followings around grievance-mongering and sowing division,\u201d she said. The role online commentary has played is reflected in the charges brought this time around. As of 10 September, 38 charges had been brought in connection with online activity relating to the 2024 riots, including the distribution of visual images intended to stir up racial hatred or the use of abusive words causing harm to another person. \u201cInciting violence and encouraging mass disorder online are incredibly serious offences,\u201d a spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said. \u201cOnline crimes have real-world consequences, and you will be dealt with in the same way as those physically present and inflicting the violence. These crimes are deplorable, and we will do everything in our power to bring offenders to justice.\u201d It is expected that more charges related to online offences \u2013 investigations that tend to take longer to complete \u2013 will be made in the weeks and months to come.

            "content": "Argentina\u2019s vice-president has lambasted a new UK-Argentina Falkland Islands agreement, saying her nation had been offered \u201ccrumbs\u201d. The pact, announced last week, includes resuming flights to the islands, restarting negotiations on a humanitarian project plan, and organising a trip for relatives of fallen soldiers of the Falklands war to visit their graves. Argentina\u2019s foreign minister, Diana Mondino, and her British counterpart, David Lammy, reached the agreement on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly, with both foreign offices saying the measures would \u201cimprove the bilateral relationship\u201d. Once a month, flights to the islands from S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil will stop in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, while both countries have also agreed to cooperate on the conservation of fisheries. But the vice-president, Victoria Villarruel, hit out at the plans over the weekend, saying they were \u201ccontrary to the interests of our nation\u201d. \u201cDo they take us for fools? They are getting material, concrete and immediate benefits, while they are offering us crumbs as emotional consolation and weakening our ability to negotiate,\u201d said Villarruel, a fiercely conservative politician who comes from a military family. The Falklands, known in Argentina as the Malvinas, lie 300 miles east of the South American country\u2019s coast. Sovereignty over the islands has been disputed since colonial times. Argentina has claimed sovereignty since the early 19th century, but Britain, which has also claimed sovereignty, seized the territory in 1833, expelling the few remaining Argentinian officials. A 74-day war between the two countries in 1982 ended with Argentina\u2019s surrender, and the loss of 649 members of the Argentinian military, 255 British service personnel, and three islanders. In a 2013 referendum, 99.8% of residents voted for the islands to remain a British territory. Nonetheless, sovereignty remains a fraught topic across Argentina; all public transport units must display signs reading \u201cThe Malvinas are Argentinian\u201d, while the dispute is used frequently during political campaigning. It is not the first time Villarruel \u2013 who was crucial in building the voter base that led to Javier Milei\u2019s surprising electoral success last year \u2013 has broken ranks with the president. Other disagreements have seen the pair clash over pay rises and even a football chant. Dr Julio Montero, an associate professor in political theory at the University of San Andr\u00e9s, said the dispute \u201cspeaks to the ideological tensions\u201d within Javier Milei\u2019s recently formed La Libertad Avanza party. \u201cMilei is meant to be a libertarian. Villarreal is a conservative nationalist with ties with the military,\u201d he said. Jack Ford, the chair of the Falkland Islands legislative assembly, said that \u201call parties stand to gain from this cooperation\u201d, which he said would provide substantial economic benefits, along with closure for the families who lost loved ones in the war. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2024 to clarify a detail regarding the events of 1833."

            "date": "2024-09-11T17:55:10Z",
            "content": "John Textor has compared the chance to become the new owner of Everton to being elected as president of the United States and said he is confident of completing the takeover before the 30 November deadline set in his exclusivity agreement with Farhad Moshiri. The American businessman became the fifth bidder to be granted a period of exclusivity by Blue Heaven Holdings, the company that owns Everton, last month, having initially been overlooked by Moshiri. But the \u00a3600m takeover rests on Textor \u2013 who the Guardian revealed on Tuesday is considering giving Everton fans the chance to buy shares in the club if the deal goes through \u2013 selling his 45% stake in Crystal Palace. He told Sky Sports in an interview on Wednesday that he had received two serious offers to buy his shares in Palace, with the co-owners David Blitzer and Josh Harris also potentially an option. But despite Everton being docked a total of eight points for separate breaches of the Premier League\u2019s profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) last season, Textor admitted he had been unable to fully assess the club\u2019s financial situation due to Premier League restrictions. Asked about the challenges around the deal, he said: \u201cI\u2019m in an awkward spot but we\u2019re working through it. The awkward spot is that I can understand the club\u2019s position \u2026 the accounting position and I feel it\u2019s manageable in terms of the PSR problem. \u201cI don\u2019t quite know the Premier League\u2019s perspective on that because there\u2019s a bit of a Chinese wall between me as an owner of Crystal Palace and what I\u2019m really allowed to know as a prospective owner of another team in the same division. But I do think we\u2019re developing solutions for that information gap and I feel we\u2019re in the very last days of getting our comfort around that. We just hope from the moment we arrive, we can start looking up the table, not down it.\u201d Textor also owns stakes in the Ligue 1 club Lyon, the Brazilian side Botafogo and Molenbeek in Belgium through his holding company, Eagle Football, and is planning to float on the New York stock exchange in the coming weeks. It is understood he is planning to use his own money and that of several unknown partners to fund the Everton purchase before absorbing the club into Eagle Football. \u201cNobody wakes up and thinks: \u2018I get to buy Everton,\u2019\u201d added Textor. \u201cBut if you decide football is what you want in your life and then somebody comes along and asks you if you want to become the owner of Everton, it\u2019s like someone asking you if you want to be president of the United States. Of course you do.\u201d Textor dismissed a report that he would target the Palmeiras manager, Abel Ferreira, to replace Sean Dyche if his takeover is successful despite a poor start to the season with three defeats. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to any coaches about the Everton job,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no truth to that. I don\u2019t know Sean personally but I watched him for so many years at Burnley doing wonders with no budget and so obviously he\u2019s a guy who knows how to coach in the Premier League. \u201cI\u2019d sit down with him at some point in the future and say that I\u2019m going to bring him a very different profile of player from any corner of the world and ask him if he is interested. I\u2019d ask him if he could coach this squad.\u201d Textor said moving to the new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock would help to make the club more competitive. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Everton to be bouncing around eighth place for ever. We want to win a title and so to do that you need serious capital. I\u2019ve always been very good at accessing it in my life and so the stadium is huge in that respect.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-09-17T10:00:27Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s frighteningly easy to imagine. Kamala Harris wins Georgia. The state elections board, under the sway of its new Trump-aligned commissioners, grinds the certification process to a slow halt to investigate unfounded fraud allegations, spurring the state\u2019s Republican legislature to select its own slate of electors. Perhaps long lines in Philadelphia lead to the state supreme court holding polls open until everyone has a chance to vote. Before anyone knows the results, Republicans appeal to the US supreme court using the \u201cindependent state legislature\u201d (ISL) theory, insisting that the state court overstepped its bounds and the late votes not be counted. Or maybe an election evening fire at a vote counting center in Milwaukee disrupts balloting. The progressive majority on the state supreme court attempts to establish a new location, but Republicans ask the US supreme court to shut it down. Maybe that last example was inspired by HBO\u2019s Succession. But in this crazy year, who\u2019s to say it couldn\u2019t happen? The real concern is this: if you think a repeat of Bush v Gore can\u2019t happen this year, think again. There are dozens of scenarios where Trump\u2019s endgame not only pushes a contested election into the courts, but ensures that it ends up before one court in particular: a US supreme court packed with a conservative supermajority that includes three lawyers who cut their teeth working on Bush v Gore, one whose wife colluded with Stop the Steal activists to overturn the 2020 results, and another whose spouse flew the insurrectionist flag outside their home. That\u2019s why those scenarios should cause such alarm, along with very real actions and litigation over voting rolls already under way in multiple states. Meanwhile, in Georgia, Arizona, Texas and elsewhere, Republican legislators and boards that might otherwise fly under the radar are busy changing election laws, reworking procedures, altering certification protocols, purging voters and laying the groundwork for six weeks of havoc after Americans vote on 5 November but before the electoral college gathers on 17 December. Lower courts may brush aside this mayhem, as they did after the 2020 election. But if the election comes down to just one or two states with a photo finish, a Bush v Gore redux in which the court chooses the winner feels very much in play. The court divided along partisan lines in 2000; its partisan intensity, of course, has greatly intensified in the two decades since. What\u2019s terrifying is that the court has already proved the Republican party\u2019s willing ally. The Roberts court laid much of the groundwork for this chaos in a series of voting rights decisions that reliably advantaged Republicans, empowered Maga caucuses even in swing states, then unleashed and encouraged those lawmakers to pass previously unlawful restrictions based on evidence-free claims of voter fraud. Right now in Georgia, a renegade state election board \u2013 with Trump\u2019s public gratitude \u2013 has enacted broad new rules that would make it easier for local officials to delay certifying results based on their own opinion that \u201cfraud\u201d occurred. Democrats have filed suit to block these changes; even the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has sought to rein them in. But if those efforts fail, it could create a cascade of litigation and missed deadlines in perhaps the closest state of all. That, in turn, could jeopardize the certification of Georgia\u2019s slate of electors \u2013 and even encourage the Republican state legislature, a hotbed of election denialism in 2020, to select their own. If that creates a terrifying echo of Bush v Gore, it should. In his influential 2000 concurrence, then chief justice William Rehnquist noted that Florida\u2019s legislature would have been within its rights to name electors if court challenges threatened the state\u2019s voice from being heard as the electoral college met. (A young Brett Kavanaugh explained the nascent independent state legislature theory to Americans during Bush v Gore; on the bench two decades later he would elevate it in a Moore v Harper concurrence that weaponized it for this post-election season.) Georgia\u2019s not-so-subtle chicanery was enabled by the court\u2019s 2013 decision in Shelby county v Holder, which freed state and local entities in Georgia, Arizona and elsewhere from having to seek pre-approval before making electoral changes. This was known as preclearance. It was the most crucial enforcement mechanism of the Voting Rights Act and required the states with the worst histories on voter suppression to have any changes to election procedures pre-approved by the Department of Justice or a three-judge panel in Washington DC. Its evisceration has had far-reaching consequences. Nearly all of them have helped Republicans at the ballot box by allowing Republican legislatures or other bodies to change the rules and place new barriers before minority voters, most of whom vote overwhelmingly Democratic. If preclearance remained intact, these changes \u2013 and a wide variety of voter ID schemes, voter purges in Texas, Virginia and elsewhere that confuse non-citizens and naturalized citizens and perhaps intimidate some from voting, as well as new laws about absentee ballots and when and how they are counted \u2013 would have certainly been rejected by the Biden justice department. Much of Trump\u2019s predictable post-election madness could have been brushed aside before it did damage. That\u2019s not the case now. Make no mistake: many actions underway at this very moment, with the very real risk of sabotaging the count, slowing the process and kicking everything into the courts, are Shelby\u2019s demon chaos agents, bred for precisely this purpose. Whether enabling extreme gerrymanders, freeing radicalized lawmakers to change procedures they could not touch without supervision only a few years ago, or transforming Rehnquist\u2019s footnote into the dangerous ISL theory, the conservative legal movement and the court\u2019s own decisions, time and again, have made it easier for a contested election to land on its doorstep. And in that case, 180 million Americans might vote for president this fall, but the six Republicans on the US supreme court will have the final say. It shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone if those robed partisans manufacture the theory to ensure the winner they prefer.

Further reading: Harris targets Trump for falsehoods on abortion and immigration in fiery debate Fact-checking Trump\u2019s debate claims: from abortion to Project 2025 Harris-Trump debate: key takeaways \u2018They\u2019re eating the cats\u2019: Trump rambles falsely about immigrants in debate Moira Donegan: The bar was low but Trump still didn\u2019t clear it Moira Donegan Jonathan Freedland and Nikki McCann Ramirez of Rolling Stone discuss the debate and what happened in our podcast, which you can listen to here: Here are the video highlights: And in other news you should know if you\u2019re just tuning in: Taylor Swift has endorsed Kamala Harris for president, in a post on Instagram published minutes after the US presidential debate, saying the Democratic candidate would be the \u201cwarrior\u201d to fight for the rights and causes she believes in. \u201cAs a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can,\u201d Swift wrote on Instagram to her 283 million followers late on Tuesday, adding: \u201cI will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 presidential election\u201d. \u201cI think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.\u201d In her statement, Swift encouraged her fans to register to vote. Swift also addressed AI-generated images shared by Donald Trump in late August that falsely depicted Swift and her fans endorsing his campaign for president. If you\u2019re just tuning in: presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Kamala Harris went head to head on Tuesday night in their first \u2013 and potentially only \u2013 debate before voters head to the polls on 5 November. The candidates went into the event virtually tied in the polls with just weeks to convince a small but mighty minority of unsure voters on how to cast their ballot. After weeks of arguments over the format and rules, the debate aired live on ABC from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a key swing state, with no audience in attendance and each candidate\u2019s microphone muted while their opponent spoke. This was the second presidential debate this year for Trump, who also went up against Joe Biden in June. The latter\u2019s devastating performance triggered an upheaval within the Democratic party that would ultimately push Biden to step down and position Harris to head the ticket, an outcome Trump both takes credit for and complains about at his rallies. With just 55 days until votes are tallied, Harris strived to highlight that she has a plan, and clearly responded to criticisms that she hasn\u2019t shared enough details with voters about her platform and priorities. With focused rhetoric on planning for the future, building the middle class, and reframing her record on everything from immigration to climate, Harris was able to show voters how she hopes to lead. Analysts, meanwhile, were watching Trump\u2019s demeanor and clarity. The former president repeated frequent rhetoric from his rallies \u2013 including widely disputed claims about abortion, crime, and his belief that he won the 2020 election \u2013 but shared little about how he would address key problems Americans are facing. Beyond their differences in policy positions, the candidates also displayed diverging visions of the country. Trump promised his base to restore what he sees as the glory of the past, and Harris heralded the hope of a brighter future. My colleague Gabrielle Canon has rounded up the key takeaways: You may be wondering what happened on the debate stage during the commercial breaks. According to CBS press pooler Sara Cook, during the second break, Harris made notes while Trump left the stage: The second the stage hand said they were clear for a 4 minute break, Trump turned towards the exit, gave a big sigh through closed lips, and walked off stage without looking at Harris. From the time the moderators announced they were going to break, Harris began writing on her notepad. She wrote continuously for the entire first two minutes of the break, occasionally bringing one hand to her chin or brushing hair behind her ear. She then reviewed what she wrote for the next minute, making a few tweaks, before putting the pen down and looking out around the room with her hands folded in front of her. She took a sip of water from a glass placed under the lectern. Trump walked back onstage 30 seconds before the end of break. He did not look at Harris, she did not look at him. Harris made small adjustments to her collar. Both candidates looked straight ahead until the program restarted. Again, no words were spoken.\u201d Donald Trump sidestepped a direct question at Tuesday evening\u2019s presidential debate on whether he wanted Ukraine to win in its war against Russia, underlining concerns that a second Trump administration could suspend military support for Kyiv. Asked directly by ABC\u2019s David Muir on whether or not he wants Ukraine to win the war, he did not answer the question and said simply: \u201cI want the war to stop.\u201d He focused on the war\u2019s human toll by saying that people were being killed \u201cby the millions,\u201d a number that hasn\u2019t been confirmed by any country or international organisation. He went on to say that if elected he would negotiate a deal even before becoming president and suggested the United States was \u201cplaying with World War three.\u201d Kamala Harris quickly pounced on his remarks, saying that if Trump had been president during the invasion, then \u201cPutin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe\u201d, and that in such a scenario the Russian president would move on to Poland. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favour and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks will renew concerns in Kyiv that he will cut off military and economic aid toward the country if he is reelected at a crucial moment in the war, when Kyiv is desperate for troops, financial support and for military hardware, much of it supplied by the United States and its Nato allies. Back to the map shared earlier of Google trends during the debate. The only state where abortion was not the top search term was Ohio where the top term was \u201cimmigration\u201d. Moderator David Muir had asked about immigration \u2013 Trump\u2019s favourite topic \u2013 but when Harris wrapped her remark with a jab about Trump\u2019s crowd sizes, the former president could not help but take the bait. First, Trump claimed without evidence that Harris paid people to attend her rallies. Clearly wound up, he began to ramble \u2013 about immigrants eating people\u2019s pets. \u201cIn Springfield, they\u2019re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they\u2019re eating the cats,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re eating the pets of the people that live there.\u201d Trump\u2019s claims about immigrants allegedly killing and eating the pets of US citizens originated, apparently, with a viral video of a resident of Springfield, Ohio, claiming before the town\u2019s council that immigrants in the community had killed ducks from a local park for food. The unsubstantiated and inflammatory video was shared widely on rightwing accounts, evolving quickly into a viral meme featuring AI-generated images of Trump surrounded by cats and dogs, appearing to protect them. Here is that graphic again: In his response on abortion, Trump made extremely erroneous claims, including that \u201cthe plan is, as you know, the vote is, they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia, not the current governor, who\u2019s doing an excellent job, but the governor before. He said the baby will be born and we will decide what to do with the baby. In other words, we\u2019ll execute the baby.\u201d Trump was resurfacing a claim he made in October 2020, based on comments made in 2019. Here is Reuters\u2019 fact check from the time: A meme shared by over 70,766 on Facebook misrepresents comments made by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam in 2019 when he was asked about a bill that, among other things, aimed to ease restrictions for third trimester abortions in the state. The meme falsely suggests that Northam is in favor of legalizing infanticide by leaving out some key contextual references in his remarks. Northam was referring to \u201cthird-trimester abortions\u201d that are done in cases \u201cwhere there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s non viable\u201d he said. \u201cIf a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,\u201d Northam stated. The Guardian\u2019s Nick Miller has taken a look at how google searches by US state changed during the debate \u2013 almost universally, the top search turned to abortion as the candidates spoke: Statistician Nate Silver has written on his blog that there is \u201ca strong consensus that Harris won the night.\u201d He notes that Bitcoin prices are down, \u201cwhich also implies a loss for Trump.\u201d He adds: Even the Fox News panel that I caught at the tail end of the evening seemed to concede that it was a win for Harris. Harris won the CNN snap poll of debate-watchers 63-37. You can find polling on past debates here. On average, the winner of the debate has led in this poll by 18 points, so Harris\u2019s 26-point win is toward the higher end of the range. The majority of voters participating in a CNN focus group at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, also said they thought Harris has won. \u201cThe group was made up of 13 voters who had not yet made a decision on who to vote for before the debate. When CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly asked the group who won the debate, eight of the voters said Harris won the showdown. Mattingly noted that Erie is \u201cthe swingiest county\u201d in the battleground state,\u201d CNN reports. Some conservatives, including Chris Rufo and Rod Drehrer conceded \u2013 with caveats \u2013a win for Harris, too, posting on Twitter/X: Harris also appeared to address what British political strategists termed \u201chero voters\u201d, or voters who once voted Democrat but have since switched to the Republicans, or who might be lured from a party that they feel has veered too far to the right. Keir Starmer\u2019s former pollster, Deborah Mattinson, is to meet Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign team in Washington this week to share details of how Labour pulled off its stunning election win by targeting key groups of \u201csqueezed working-class voters who wanted change\u201d. Writing in the Observer, Mattinson said many of the concerns of crucial undecided voters will be similar on both of sides of the Atlantic. \u201cThese voters \u2013 often past Labour voters \u2013 had rejected the party because they believed that it had rejected them. Often Tory voters in 2019, they made up nearly 20% of the electorate. Labour\u2019s focus on economic concerns, from affordable housing to job security, won them back. During the debate, in response to Trump stating, falsely, that Harris wanted to take guns away, Harris said that both she and Walz were gun owners. Harris said in 2019 that she owned a gun for personal safety reasons. At the time, CNN reported that an aide has said she kept the handgun safely locked up. Toward the end of the debate, Harris said, \u201cI don\u2019t ask if you\u2019re a democrat, I ask if you\u2019re ok.\u201d Earlier, she said: So for everyone watching who remembers what January 6th was, I say we don\u2019t have to go back. Let\u2019s not go back. We\u2019re not going back. It\u2019s time to turn the page. And if that was a bridge too far for you, well, there is a place in our campaign for you. To stand for country. To stand for our democracy. To stand for rule of law. And to end the chaos. And to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our democracy \u2018cause you don\u2019t like the outcome. Meanwhile Fox News said it proposed to hold a second presidential debate in October, adding it sent letters to the campaigns for both Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican rival Donald Trump before Tuesday night\u2019s debate. A spokesperson for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign said on Tuesday night that Harris and her Republican rival Donald Trump should do a second debate in October. In the spin room shortly after the debate, Trump wouldn\u2019t commit to the rematch the Harris campaign has already offered, saying, \u201cI have to think about it\u201d and that he might do it \u201cif it was on a fair network.\u201d \u201cThe reason you do a second debate is if you lose, and they lost,\u201d he told Fox News host Sean Hannity. \u201cBut I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Appearing nervous at first, Harris gained momentum when she was asked about abortion. Trump, who appeared calm at first, grew more irate as he again and again turned questions back onto the topic of immigration. Here is Harris on abortion, a topic on which she has been notably strong. Much of her response was delivered while looking into the camera, as she did often during the debate, so that it appeared that she was speaking directly to voters: Let\u2019s understand how we got here. Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe V. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care. In one state it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception even for rape and incest. Which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next. That is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body. \u2026 I have talked with women around our country. You want to talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and she\u2019s bleeding out in a car in the parking lot? She didn\u2019t want that. Her husband didn\u2019t want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to term? They don\u2019t want that. And I pledge to you when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe V. Wade as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. But understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025 there would be a national abortion ban. Understand in his project 2025 there would be a national abortion -- a monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages. I think the American people believe that certain freedoms, in particular the freedom to make decisions about one\u2019s own body, should not be made by the government. Back to the debate. Harris and Trump debated for 90 minutes on a sombrely blue-lit stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. Their mics were muted between responses, and they were given two minutes to respond to questions from ABC moderators Linsey Davis and David Muir. Tuesday\u2019s debate was the first time that Harris and Trump had met. As the two candidates took to the stage, she walked over to Trump and shook his hand before returning to the podium. The first question asked of Harris was whether the American people were better off now than they were four years ago, and she failed to answer it directly. Instead, she talked about the future, and what she calls the \u201copportunity economy\u201d. That said, her answer sought instead to explain some of her policies for the future \u2013 something voters have been saying they want more of. A New York Times/Siena poll found that 28% of likely voters \u201cfelt they needed to know more about Ms. Harris, while only 9% said they needed to know more about Mr. Trump.\u201d \u201cTwo-thirds of those who want to know more said they were eager to learn about her policies, specifically.\u201d In 2012, researchers at Northwestern University and the University of Maryland tried to establish the correlation, if any, between celebrity endorsements and votes. They used Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement of Barack Obama ahead of the 2008 Democrat primary to examine whether it had any effect on the polls. The researchers concluded that Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement was worth about a million votes for Obama, who beat his main primary challenger, Hillary Clinton, by about 270,000 votes in the states used in the sample. Swift is a popular figure nationwide; especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall, including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favourable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favourable opinion and 45% an unfavourable one. Cayce Myers, a professor of public relations at Virginia Tech said, Swift\u2019s endorsement \u201cmay have an impact on the election because it may encourage younger Gen. Z fans to vote.\u201d While Celebrity endorsements do not necessarily translate into meaningful turnout,\u201d he said, Swift\u2019s endorsement was going out to particularly large fan base, was focussed on women\u2019s rights, an issue that favours Democrats, and that the post, \u201chas the potential to raise awareness among younger voters who might be paying less attention to the presidential election.\u201d This is Helen Sullivan taking over our live US elections coverage after the first debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. I\u2019ll bring you analysis, news, responses to that celebrity endorsement (Taylor\u2019s version) for the next while. Speaking to supporters after the debate, Kamala Harris appeared to be in her stride. \u201cBut we have a lot of work to do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd tonight I think highlighted for the American people what\u2019s at stake.\u201d California governor Gavin Newsom called Harris\u2019s performance a \u201cmasterclass\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s daylight and darkness, competency versus chaos, right versus wrong, illiberal versus liberal,\u201d he said. Republicans meanwhile offered qualified praise, and bashed the moderators for fact-checking Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican presidential hopeful turned Trump surrogate and harsh Harris critic, conceded that the vice-president had had a good night, perhaps even a better night. But he insisted that Trump won on the policy. \u201cWe heard a lot of words better delivered than usual, I will admit, from Kamala Harris, but actions speak louder than words,\u201d he said, before mustering a very qualified assessment of Trump\u2019s performance. \u201cThe sad truth is, we only had a portion of this debate that was focused on policy, but for the portion of the debate that was focused on policy, which is the most important part of a presidential debate, I think in that area of it, I\u2019m not going to make an overall claim with respect to the policy aspect of this debate, Donald Trump won hands-down,\u201d he said. Tim Walz reacted to Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement in the middle of an interview with MSNBC: The Minnesota governor said her post on Instagram was \u201celoquent\u201d and called on Swifties, as her fans are known, to get on board with Harris\u2019s campaign. Donald Trump has made a surprise appearance in the spin room at the debate venue in Philadelphia, where he told reporters he felt good about his performance against Kamala Harris, but might not debate her again. \u201cIt was my best debate ever, I think,\u201d the former president said. \u201cIt showed how weak they are, how pathetic they are, and what they\u2019re doing to destroy our country, on the border, with foreign trade, with everything.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t good enough to do again, he said: \u201cNow she wants to do another one, because she got beaten tonight, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to do another one.\u201d Asked about Taylor Swift\u2019s endorsement of Harris, even Matt Gaetz, the far-right Florida representative, knew better than to attack the pop star. \u201cI love her songs, but I want to live in a world where liberals make my art and conservatives make my laws and policies,\u201d he replied. Kamala Harris is \u201cready for a second debate\u201d in October, her campaign said. \u201cUnder the bright lights, the American people got to see the choice they will face this fall at the ballot box: between moving forward with Kamala Harris, or going backwards with Trump,\u201d Harris-Walz campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s what they saw tonight and what they should see at a second debate in October. Vice-president Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?\u201d This second debate would come in addition to an October face-off between vice-presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance. In her post announcing her support for Kamala Harris, Taylor Swift said that she had been spurred to act after the Trump campaign implied that she supported him, and also was not pleased with a certain remark made by his running mate, JD Vance. \u201cRecently I was made aware that AI of \u2018me\u2019 falsely endorsing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth,\u201d Swift wrote. She signed her post, in which she posed with a long-haired cat, \u201cChildless Cat Lady\u201d. That\u2019s something Vance once said, and which is not going away: Donald Trump repeated misinformation about the result of lawsuits contesting the 2020 election results. The former president said that \u201cno judge looked at\u201d lawsuits he and allies filed about irregularities in the election. \u201cThey said we didn\u2019t have standing. A technicality. Can you imagine a system where a person in an election doesn\u2019t have standing? The president of the United States doesn\u2019t have standing. That\u2019s how we lost,\u201d Trump said. That\u2019s misleading \u2013 some lawsuits were dismissed due to a lack of standing, meaning that those who brought the lawsuits didn\u2019t have a stake in the results. Others were decided on merit. Judges found in some cases that evidence provided was speculative, or failed to show fraud. Taylor Swift, the world-famous pop superstar, just announced on Instagram that she will vote for Kamala Harris, giving the vice-president perhaps her biggest celebrity endorsement yet. \u201cI will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I\u2019m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman\u2019s right to her own body for decades,\u201d she wrote. ABC News then heard from JD Vance, the Ohio senator who is Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, and asked him for clarity on whether the former president supported national restrictions on abortion. The debate\u2019s moderators tried to get an answer out of Trump, but he instead talked about how he was proud that states were deciding the issue, while falsely claiming that Democrats supported infanticide. \u201cI think the president\u2019s been very clear that he doesn\u2019t want a national abortion ban. I think in some ways he finds the question a little bit ridiculous, because why are we asking him about legislation that\u2019s never going to actually happen, and why he would veto it or not veto it, when he says very explicitly that he doesn\u2019t support a national abortion ban and he wants these policies to be made by the states,\u201d Vance said. He then criticized Harris for debate rhetoric he described as empty, saying: You had Kamala Harris effectively echoing platitude after platitude after platitude. The American people can\u2019t pay their grocery bills on platitudes. They can\u2019t put their kids in a house on platitudes. And Kamala Harris had a lot to say but very little actual substance behind it for how she\u2019s going to lower grocery prices, secure the border and make housing more affordable in this country. She\u2019s been the vice-president for three-and-a-half years. She can\u2019t run on a record, and she apparently can\u2019t run on much of her plans either, because it\u2019s just a lot of slogans and not a whole lot of substance. In an interview with ABC News after the debate, Tim Walz, the Democratic candidate for vice-president, said Donald Trump came off as unhinged. \u201cI have to tell you, if it weren\u2019t so dangerous, it reminds you of an old man yelling at the clouds. That was his thing: \u2018Get off my yard,\u2019\u201d said Walz, the governor of Minnesota. \u201cSo, I think country can see what happened tonight. We\u2019ll keep pushing forward. That\u2019s the way that the country wants to see our politics be \u2013 she laid it out clearly. Donald Trump brought nothing tonight but anger, resentment.\u201d Women were chipping in for Harris during the debate. Harris\u2019s campaign said that during the first hour of the debate, 71% of their grassroots donors were women. The campaign has not yet provided an overall tally for her fundraising figures. In a conversation about Harris\u2019s racial identity, the vice-president said Trump had a long history of stoking racial division. She recalled that he had placed a full-page ad in the New York Times that called for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of Black and Latino teenagers who were wrongly accused of raping a white woman. It appears the reference was intentional. The Harris campaign announced that Yusef Salaam, one of the five exonerated men who is now a New York councilmember, will be in the spin room as a surrogate for the Harris campaign. While Harris held off on attacking Donald Trump in her closing statement, the former president did not do the same, instead seizing on Harris\u2019s years in the vice-presidency to argue she would be an ineffective leader. \u201cSo, she just started by saying she\u2019s going to do this, she\u2019s going to do that. She\u2019s going to do all these wonderful things. Why hasn\u2019t she done it?\u201d Trump asked. He went on: She\u2019s been there for three-and-a-half years. They\u2019ve had three-and-a-half years to fix the border. They\u2019ve had three-and-a-half years to create jobs and all the things we talked about. Why hasn\u2019t she done it? She should leave right now, go down to that beautiful White House, go to the Capitol, get everyone together and do the things you want to do, but you haven\u2019t done it and you won\u2019t do it because you believe in things that the American people don\u2019t believe in. Trump restated his downbeat view of the state of the country, which is a major part of his pitch to voters: We\u2019re a failing nation. We\u2019re a nation that\u2019s in serious decline. We\u2019re being laughed at all over the world. All over the world, they laughed. I know the leaders very well, they\u2019re coming to see me. They call me. We\u2019re laughed at all over the world. They don\u2019t understand what happened to us as a nation. He concluded by calling Harris \u201cthe worst vice-president in the history of our country\u201d. And with that, the debate concluded. We\u2019re now at the closing statements of the debate, with Kamala Harris up first. Casting herself as a unifier, she argues her background as a prosecutor made her the right person to lead the country: I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do. I\u2019ll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was the DA, I was an attorney general, United States senator and now vice-president. I only have one client: the people. And I\u2019ll tell you, as a prosecutor, I never asked a victim or a witness, are you a Republican or a Democrat? The only thing I ever asked them, are you OK? And that\u2019s the kind of president we need right now, someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first. I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next 10 and 20 years to build back up our country by investing right now in you, the American people. Donald Trump doubled down on his claims that the Central Park Five, a group of Black teenagers who were arrested in connection with the rape and assault of a white female jogger in 1989 and convicted based on police-coerced confessions. Back then, Trump called for the execution of these five children. When Kamala Harris brought up Trump\u2019s stance, he dug in: \u201cThey pled guilty \u2026 They badly hurt a person, they killed a person, ultimately.\u201d All of them were exonerated after a convicted murderer confessed to the crime in 2002. In 2014, they were awarded a $41m settlement. In 1989, before any of the boys had faced trial, Trump paid a reported $85,000 to take out advertising space in four of the city\u2019s newspapers, including the New York Times, calling for their execution. The headline read: \u201cBring Back The Death Penalty. Bring Back Our Police!\u201d and above his signature, Trump wrote: \u201cI want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence.\u201d As my colleague Oliver Laughland reported back in 2016, Trump\u2019s charge against the Central Park Five was a precursor to his divisive populism: Tuesday night\u2019s debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris could have been a mess of layered talking, unchallenged claims and wild veers off-topic. Instead, ABC\u2019s moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, kept the candidates on point. Muir and Davis took on the first matchup between the two virtually tied presidential candidates, seeking to \u201cenforce timing agreements and ensure a civilized discussion\u201d, according to debate rules from ABC that took weeks to negotiate, and it was no easy task. The two effectively rerouted discussions back to the questions they had asked, on key topics including the economy, immigration, abortion rights and the peaceful transfer of power, and made important clarifying fact-check statements when they were warranted. When Trump made the outlandish claim that Democrats supported \u201cthe execution\u201d of babies after they were born and accused Tim Walz, Harris\u2019s vice-presidential pick, of supporting abortions in the ninth month, Davis laid out the facts. \u201cThere is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it is born,\u201d Davis told viewers. Muir also pushed Trump on his connection to the 6 January attack on the US Capitol, and his belief that he won the election, despite all evidence to the contrary. Donald Trump may have been a transformational force in the GOP, but he\u2019s followed in the footsteps of many Republicans who came before him by saying his Democratic opponent wants to take away guns. \u201cShe has a plan to confiscate everybody\u2019s gun,\u201d Trump alleged at one point in the debate. A few minutes later, Harris mentioned that she is a gun owner \u2013 something she doesn\u2019t bring up often. \u201cThis business about taking everyone\u2019s guns away \u2013 Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We\u2019re not taking anybody\u2019s guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff,\u201d the vice-president said. As the debate winds into its final stretch, both candidates have stayed true to form. Donald Trump has doubled down on his tried-and-true talking points \u2013 including a barrage of misinformation about immigration and immigrants, abortion and election security. But Kamala Harris appears to have rattled him in several moments, including when she made light of his tendency to reference fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter, or to set off on difficult-to-follow tangents about windmills. Though the candidates were muted while the other was speaking, Harris also made good use of her side of the screen \u2013 putting out a range of expressions to show skepticism, concern and dismissal. Days after Harris launched her campaign, Trump alleged something that was shocking, even by his standards: that the vice-president, who is of South Asian and Black Jamaican heritage, was not actually African American. \u201cWhy do you believe it\u2019s appropriate to weigh in on the racial identity of your opponent?\u201d moderator David Muir asked. \u201cI don\u2019t, and I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care what she is. I don\u2019t care. You make a big deal out of something, I couldn\u2019t care less, whatever she wants to be is OK with me,\u201d Trump replied. Muir then asked Harris for her thoughts. She replied: Honestly, I think it\u2019s a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently, over the course of his career, attempted to use race to divide the American people. You know, I do believe that the vast majority of us know that we have so much more in common than what separates us, and we don\u2019t want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us, and especially by race. She made a point to bring up Trump\u2019s involvement in pushing for the prosecution of the Central Park Five. Here\u2019s more on that: We\u2019re now getting into a perilous topic for Harris: the US pullout from Afghanistan. Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings dropped after the chaotic departure of American troops, during which a terrorist attack killed 13 US soldiers, and Republicans have hammered his administration over the withdrawal ever since. Harris says she approved of the president\u2019s decision to end US involvement in the war, then pivoted to, once again, attacking Trump. \u201cI agreed with President Biden\u2019s decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did. And as a result, America\u2019s taxpayers are not paying the $300m a day we were paying for that endless war. And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, the first time this century,\u201d Harris says. Then, on to Trump: But let\u2019s understand how we got to where we are. Donald Trump, when he was president, negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine. He calls himself a dealmaker. Even his national security adviser said it was a weak, terrible deal, and here\u2019s how it went down: he bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists, Taliban terrorists released. Harris, no surprise, strongly defended Washington\u2019s support for Ukraine, then again attacked Trump. \u201cI believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up,\u201d the vice-president said. \u201cThrough the work that I and others did, we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its righteous defense, and because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country.\u201d She continued: If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now, and understand what that would mean, because Putin\u2019s agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our Nato allies are so thankful that you are no longer president, and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is Nato, and what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskiy and the Ukrainians to fight for their independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland. The debate just resumed after a short break, and the first question, to Trump, was about Ukraine. \u201cYou have said you would solve this war in 24 hours. You said so just before the break tonight. How exactly would you do that? And I want to ask you a very simple question tonight: do you want Ukraine to win this war?\u201d moderator David Muir asked. The former president\u2019s response wasn\u2019t exactly a yes: I want the war to stop. I want to save lives that are being uselessly. People being killed by the millions. It\u2019s the millions. It\u2019s so much worse than the numbers that you\u2019re getting, which are fake numbers. Muir pressed: \u201cJust to clarify the question, do you believe it\u2019s in the US best interest for Ukraine to win this war?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, all right, negotiate a deal, because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed,\u201d Trump said. Donald Trump claimed that crime is way up in the US \u2013 and he\u2019s wrong. Crime is actually down. Data from the FBI found that violent crime decreased during the Trump administration, spiking in 2020 during the pandemic, and continuing to trend downward afterwards. Preliminary data from the FBI found that violent crime was down 6% in 2023, and 15% in the first quarter of 2024. Violent crime decreased throughout most of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to FBI data that uses information provided by law enforcement agencies. However, it spiked in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. It has trended downward since 2020 across the US, nearing pre-pandemic levels in 2022. Preliminary FBI data for 2023 shows that violent crime overall was down another 6% that year. Though the data is preliminary, it includes numbers from 80% of the law enforcement agencies in the country. Trump got the same question, and didn\u2019t have much new to say, instead insisting that both the 7 October attack and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would not have happened if he had been president \u2013 a line from previous speeches and debate. \u201cIf I were president, it would have never started. If I were president, Russia would have never, ever, I know Putin very well. He would have never. There was no threat of it either,\u201d Trump said. The debate has now shifted into foreign policy territory, and the first question, to Harris, was how she would convince Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire. The vice-president didn\u2019t quite answer the question, instead vowing to defend Israel, while acknowledging the toll taken on civilians by Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza: Now, Israel has a right to defend itself \u2026 and how it does so matters. Because it is also true, far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed, children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end \u2026 And the way it will end is we need a ceasefire deal, and we need the hostages out, and so we will continue to work around the clock on that. Work around the clock, also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution, and in that solution, there must be security for the Israeli people and Israel, and an equal measure for the Palestinians. She added: \u201cI will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular, as it relates to Iran, and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel.\u201d Donald Trump continued to insist that he won the 2020 election, despite moderator David Muir pointing out that judges across the country had thrown out his claims of fraud. That gave Kamala Harris an opening to attack him in terms that the former The Apprentice host would well understand: Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people, so, let\u2019s be clear about that. And, clearly he is having a very difficult time processing that. But we cannot afford to have a president of the United States who attempts, as he did in the past, to upend the will of the voters in a free and fair election. And I\u2019m going to tell you that I have traveled the world as vice-president of the United States, and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump. I talked with military leaders, some of whom work with you, and they say, you\u2019re a disgrace. And when you then talk in this way in a presidential debate and deny \u2026 you have lost because you did, in fact, lose that election, it leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have, in the candidate to my right, the temperament or the ability to not be confused about facts. That\u2019s deeply troubling, and the American people deserve better. In her debate against Mike Pence four years ago, Kamala Harris memorably rebuked him when he interrupted her, by responding: \u201cMr vice-president, I\u2019m speaking.\u201d Donald Trump just deployed the line against Harris at their debate. Here\u2019s the moment: A bit more about how Harris\u2019s quip landed in 2020: Trump repeated one of his usual falsehoods: that abortions are taking place in the ninth month of pregnancy. In fact, fewer than 1% of abortions are performed past 21 weeks of pregnancy; when these abortions do take place, they often occur in medical emergencies or cases of fetal anomalies. Trump also suggested, at multiple points, that abortions take place after birth. That would be infanticide, and it is illegal in all 50 states. The FBI is still not sure why a young man opened fire at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania in July, wounding the former president and killing an attendee. But at the debate, the former president has said that Harris and other Democrats calling him a \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d sparked the attack. \u201cI probably took a bullet to the head because of the things that they say about me. They talk about democracy, I\u2019m a threat to democracy, they\u2019re the threat to democracy,\u201d Trump said, before bringing up the investigation into Russian influence that bedeviled him during his first term. Moderator David Muir then cut him off, saying: \u201cWe have a lot to get to.\u201d Donald Trump has spouted off a number of false claims about immigration and immigrants. To start, he said immigrants are \u201ctaking over the towns \u2026 They\u2019re going in violently.\u201d That\u2019s false. Although some US cities have seen an influx of immigrants, most have arrived legally, with work permits or with authorization to stay while their cases are worked out in the courts. There has been no widespread violence in these cities and overall, immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the US-born according to multiple, extensive studies, including from the conservative Cato Institute. Trump also referenced immigrants \u201ceating the dogs\u201d in Springfield, Ohio, which was live fact-checked by the debate moderators. Republicans have sometimes substituted dogs for cats when repeating this misinformation. Here\u2019s some reporting from the Guardian looking into the salacious, and completely false claim: The misinformation about migrants in Springfield comes as the Trump campaign has sought to make immigration a key issue, tying Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the towns unprepared for migrants arriving via the southern border. Springfield\u2019s mayor, Rob Rue, went on Fox to say the Biden administration was to blame for \u201cfailing cities like ours and taxing us beyond our limit\u201d. The city has seen a large number of migrants from Haiti, which has both helped the economy there with staffing concerns while also stretching the capacity of some services like clinics and schools, the New York Times reported. A Biden administration policy provided temporary protected status to hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants, who have left their home country because of ongoing violence. Some estimates say as many as 20,000 people from Haiti have come to the city, the Times said. Earlier, Harris took Trump to task for spending his rallies making strange statements, rather than talking about how he would solve Americans\u2019 problems: I\u2019m going to actually do something really unusual, and I\u2019m going to invite you to attend one of Donald Trump\u2019s rallies, because it\u2019s a really interesting thing to watch. You will see during the course of his rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about, windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you. You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams and your needs and your desires. And I\u2019ll tell you I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first. And I pledge to you that I will. The former president replied by defending the size of his events: People don\u2019t leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. That\u2019s because people want to take their country back. In perhaps the most bizarre moment of this debate so far, Trump repeated an unsubstantiated claim that immigrants are eating pets in an Ohio town, forcing the moderator to tell him that there is no proof of that. \u201cIn Springfield, they\u2019re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they\u2019re eating the cats \u2026 they\u2019re eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what\u2019s happening in our country, and it\u2019s a shame,\u201d the former president said. The story of immigrants allegedly eating pets has circulated in rightwing media in recent days, and been repeated by Trump\u2019s running mate JD Vance. \u201cYou bring up Springfield, Ohio, and ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,\u201d moderator David Muir told Trump. Here\u2019s more on this most strange story: Trump and Harris got into a back and forth, after the former president demanded that she answer whether she supports abortion in the third trimester. \u201cWill she allow abortion in the eighth month, ninth month, seventh month?\u201d Trump demanded. \u201cCome on,\u201d an annoyed Harris replied. Donald Trump, as he always does, boasted that the US experienced its \u201cbest\u201d economy under his administration, while Kamala Harris noted that Trump left the US with \u201cthe worst unemployment since the Great Depression\u201d. They\u2019re both wrong \u2013 Trump by a lot, and Harris by a shade. Though unemployment spiked to its worst levels since the Great Depression in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, it had dipped back by the time Trump left office. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s \u201cbest economy\u201d line has been the bane of fact-checkers since he was in office. \u201cBest\u201d is a very vague term \u2013 but by several measures, including GDP, unemployment and the trade deficit \u2013 the economy was far from its peak. Here are some final numbers from his term, compiled by FactCheck.org: The economy lost 2.7m jobs. The unemployment rate increased by 1.7 percentage points to 6.4%. Paychecks grew faster than inflation. Average weekly earnings for all workers were up 8.4% after inflation. After-tax corporate profits went up, and the stock market set new records. The S&amp;P 500 index rose 67.8%. The international trade deficit Trump promised to reduce went up. The US trade deficit in goods and services in 2020 was the highest since 2008 and increased 36.3% from 2016. The number of people lacking health insurance rose by 3 million. The federal debt held by the public went up, from $14.4tn to $21.6tn. Home prices rose 27.5%, and the homeownership rate increased 2.1 percentage points to 65.8%. Harris then explained her support for reinstating Roe v Wade, in much clearer terms than Trump used: Now, in over 20 states, there are Trump abortion bans, which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide healthcare. In one state, it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which, understand what that means, a survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. Next, that is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body. She vowed to sign legislation restoring the overturned precedent, if Congress approves it. Linsey Davis, a moderator of the debate, pressed Trump to explain his policy on abortion, noting that he has changed his views repeatedly. Trump responded by going through how various states have handled the issue, and claiming, falsely, that in some states, babies are killed after they are born (which is murder, and illegal everywhere). Then, he thanked the supreme court justices who voted to overturn Roe v Wade, though misstated the number \u2013 five voted to do away with the precedent, not six. Trump said: Each individual state is voting. It\u2019s the vote of the people. Now, it\u2019s not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it, and the supreme court had great courage in doing it, and I give tremendous credit to those six justices. Harris just made something of a new attack on Trump, by accusing him of being deferential to Chinese president Xi Jinping despite lingering questions over what his government knows about the origins of Covid-19. \u201cWhat Donald Trump did, let\u2019s talk about this with Covid, is, he actually thanked President Xi for what he did during Covid. Look at his tweet: \u2018Thank you, President Xi. Exclamation point\u2019, when we know that Xi was responsible for lacking and not giving us transparency about the origins of Covid,\u201d the vice-president said. As expected, Trump denied knowledge of Project 2025, a 900-page plan for the aggressive rightwing reform of nearly every aspect of the federal government. Though Trump has tried repeatedly to distance himself from the platform, which seeks to strip away reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights and voting rights, his policies align heavily with Project 2025. As my colleague Rachel Leingang reported: \u201cTrump well knows the Heritage Foundation and has spoken at their events, and [Kevin] Roberts, Heritage\u2019s leader, has previously said he and Trump have talked several times. Project 2025\u2019s authors and supporters contain a ton of former Trump administration officials.\u201d As Trump is talking, Harris appears to be looking at him and lightly shaking her head. And whenever it\u2019s Harris\u2019s turn to talk, Trump has been looking straight ahead. As the two candidates squabbled over the economy, Harris quickly brought up Project 2025, the rightwing blueprint to remake the US government authored by former Trump officials and people connected to him. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you all on this debate tonight, you\u2019re going to hear from the same old, tired book, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling. What you\u2019re going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected to again,\u201d Harris said. Trump replied by saying he has no involvement with the document: I have nothing to do with Project 2025. That\u2019s out there. I haven\u2019t read it. I don\u2019t want to read it, purposely. I\u2019m not going to read it. This was a group of people that got together. They came up with some ideas, I guess, some good, some bad. But it makes no difference. I have nothing to do. Everybody knows I\u2019m an open book. Everybody knows what I\u2019m going to do, cut taxes very substantially and create a great economy like I did. Before, we had the greatest economy, we got hit with a pandemic, and the pandemic was, not since 1917 where 100 million people died, has there been anything like it. In his rebuttal, Trump zeroed in on what his campaign believes are two of his strongest issues: inflation and undocumented people. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve had a terrible economy because inflation has, which it\u2019s really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries. We have inflation like very few people have ever seen before, probably the worst in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Trump said. That isn\u2019t quite true \u2013 inflation had been worse in the past than the bout experienced over the last three years. Then, Trump raised the issue of illegal immigration: On top of that, we have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums, and they\u2019re coming in, and they\u2019re taking jobs that are occupied right now by African Americans and Hispanics and also unions. Unions are going to be affected very soon. And you see what\u2019s happening. You see what\u2019s happening with towns throughout the United States. The first question, for Harris, was: \u201cDo you believe Americans are better off than they were four years ago?\u201d \u201cI was raised as a middle-class kid, and I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America. I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people, and that is why I imagine and have actually a plan to build what I call an opportunity economy.\u201d She also made a point to attack Trump\u2019s tax policy: My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5tn to America\u2019s deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result for middle-class families in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have just taken the stage at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. It\u2019s their first time ever meeting, and they did shake hands after Harris approached Trump\u2019s podium. The debate has begun. The candidates\u2019 top messengers are floating through the spin room to \u201cspin\u201d us ahead of the debate. So far, we\u2019ve heard Senator Rick Scott pre-emptively accuse the media of downplaying a good performance. Asked about House Republicans\u2019 report on the Afghanistan withdrawal, Senator Chris Murphy quipped that he doesn\u2019t typically read \u201cRepublican campaign documents\u201d. The reporter didn\u2019t get the joke and tried again, clarifying that he meant the \u201cofficial\u201d report. Murphy repeated the joke. RFK Jr, who recently bowed out of the race and endorsed Trump, barreled through the room, drawing a large audience as he spoke to a handful of conservative outlets. California governor Gavin Newsom, one of the Democrats\u2019 best messengers, held court, lacing into Trump and touting his fellow Californian. Surrogates from both Dakotas turned out for Trump: South Dakota governor Kristi Noem and theNorth Dakota governor, Doug Burgum. I also dropped into a revealing gaggle with Florida Representative Byron Donalds, another Trump surrogate. \u201cI\u2019m a cigar guy. I\u2019m a tequila guy. You know, I work out when I can. I hit the weights. I like movies,\u201d he told a reporter. Another cut in to ask whether he\u2019d tried Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s new whiskey, SirDavis. (He has not but appeared genuinely excited to do so.) Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, told reporters in the debate spin room that he is confident about how Harris will perform on the biggest night of the election campaign so far. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous about her debate skills,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m Donald Trump, I\u2019d be nervous. That said, he has more options because he doesn\u2019t play by the same sets of rules and so he\u2019s a very challenging person to debate in that respect. If he feels he\u2019s losing, this will get very interesting and you will feel that very quickly. My sense is we\u2019re going to feel that right out of the gate.\u201d Trump will find it especially difficult to debate a woman, Newsom continued, saying: \u201cHe has a hard time with women generally. He sure as hell has a hard time with critique, criticism. He\u2019s the most easily manipulated human being I\u2019ve ever met in my life.\u201d Newsom said he has met 30 world leaders \u201cand literally every conversation begins with, what the hell is going on in the United States of America? They\u2019re laughing behind his back. At the same time they said if he does come back, he\u2019s pretty easily manipulated. \u201cShe can easily get under his skin by just asserting herself competently and prosecuting the case against the guy who\u2019s quite literally a convicted felon. He\u2019s a fraudster and he\u2019s boring, not just boorish. He\u2019s become boring and that is showing up more and more.\u201d Asked by the Guardian whether Harris should attempt to fact-check Harris during the debate, Newsom replied: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fact-check a serial liar. There\u2019s no capacity to do that unless an AI bot is doing the debate. But there are some outlandish and outrageous things that we certainly need to push back. \u201cI do think that\u2019s the role of the moderator for those outlandish and absurd things but it\u2019s also the role of the candidate - both candidates. I expect with that ample opportunity \u2013 two minutes, a minute to respond and an opportunity for follow up \u2013 it\u2019ll be a lot more give-and-take in that respect.\u201d Here are the rules of this evening\u2019s debate, according to the host, ABC News: The debate will be 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. The two seated moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, will be the only people asking questions. A coin flip was held virtually on Tuesday, 3 September, to determine podium placement and order of closing statements; former President Donald Trump won the coin toss and chose to select the order of statements. The former president will offer the last closing statement, and Vice-President Kamala Harris selected the right podium position on screen (stage left). Candidates will be introduced by the moderators. The candidates will enter upon introduction from opposite sides of the stage; the incumbent party will be introduced first. There will be no opening statements; closing statements will be two minutes per candidate. Candidates will stand behind podiums for the duration of the debate. Props or pre-written notes are not allowed on stage. No topics or questions will be shared in advance with campaigns or candidates. Candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water. Candidates will be given two minutes to answer questions, two minutes for rebuttals, and one extra minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses. Candidates\u2019 microphones will be live only for the candidate whose turn it is to speak and muted when the time belongs to another candidate. Candidates will not be permitted to ask questions of each other. Campaign staff may not interact with candidates during commercial breaks. Moderators will seek to enforce timing agreements and ensure a civilized discussion. There will be no audience in the room. Here\u2019s more on what we can expect when Trump and Kamala Harris take the stage in just a few minutes: Gaza solidarity protesters have taken to the streets today near the venue where the two candidates are having their debate: Kamala Harris\u2019s motorcade has arrived at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, where she\u2019ll debate Donald Trump in about 12 minutes. So, too, did Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign, who had several high-profile Democrats giving interviews at the debate: Donald Trump\u2019s campaign had a host of surrogates talking with reporters before the debate: Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, has urged Kamala Harris to communicate a vision of hope and inclusion to millions of viewers watching tonight\u2019s debate. \u201cShe\u2019s got to show the American people tonight that she\u2019s not Joe Biden. She sure as hell is not Donald Trump,\u201d Newsom told reporters in the debate spin room. \u201cShe is a new generation of leader and that\u2019s her opportunity. She shows up on stage. You see that. You feel that. And now she\u2019s got to express it in a way that communicates a vision where people feel hope and included. \u201cShe\u2019s got to talk to the extent that she is specifically talking to the people watching \u2013 they feel that she\u2019s talking about them. Donald Trump in contrast \u2013 we know, you know \u2013 he\u2019ll be talking about himself. That is a powerful, powerful contrast.\u201d Newsom, who was seen as a potential replacement for Biden before the party consolidated around Harris, added: \u201cShe\u2019s not the status quo. She\u2019s not Joe Biden. She\u2019s her own person. She\u2019s always been her own person. Trust me, I\u2019ve known Kamala Harris for 30 years. She is her own person. She has unique skill sets that are unique and distinctive from Joe Biden.\u201d Meanwhile, Doug Emhoff, Harris\u2019s husband, is with Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, riling up supporters outside the debate venue. Robert F Kennedy Jr, who recently endorsed Donald Trump after abandoning his independent run for president, was in the debate spin room with the Trump campaign. Donald Trump has done the most prep sessions before the ABC presidential debate tonight of any of his prior seven debates, according to people familiar with the matter. The former president has been practicing primarily with his pal Matt Gaetz, a Republican representative, and Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic representative. Yesterday, ABC News released a photo of the debate stage where Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are to meet: One imagines they\u2019ll turn the lights up when the candidates are on stage. The Trump campaign is already playing the refs and suggesting that, if the moderators fail to sufficiently challenge Kamala Harris on her record, \u201cyou can throw the whole debate out\u201d. Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota and a Trump surrogate, told reporters in the debate spin room that ABC News\u2019s moderators have \u201ca responsibility to the American people, and part of their responsibility is to actually ask Vice-President Harris real questions and tough questions. This is historic. She\u2019s a historic candidate but for a different reason. \u201cShe\u2019s historic because she\u2019s 55 days away from the election and she\u2019s done one short interview and has never done a debate and this may be the only one. I think America is going to be outraged if we find out a few hours from tonight that she got through a debate and nobody asked her tough questions about her past positions and why her anonymous aides are saying no, she doesn\u2019t believe in all this anymore on issues that are critical, whether it\u2019s energy policy, the border, whether fentanyl should be legal.\u201d Burgum, who was on Trump\u2019s shortlist for running mate until senator JD Vance got the nod, added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about plastic straws that she supported. She needs to be asked tough questions tonight, and that\u2019s one of the things that I\u2019m going to be looking for. If the moderators don\u2019t come through, then you can throw the whole debate out because it was a three-on-one tilted playing field from the start.\u201d Burgum called for close scrutiny of Harris\u2019s past record, saying: \u201cShe\u2019s a dangerously progressive liberal from California, and people should understand that when they\u2019re voting. Is that a direction she wants to take the country? Because the last time I checked, California\u2019s losing population. One of the states where people are leaving, voting with their feet.\u201d Donald Trump arrived in Philadelphia earlier today for his debate with Kamala Harris. Photographers captured him and his entourage deplaning: The debate takes place at Philadelphia\u2019s National Constitution Center. Here are some scenes from the area: The Harris campaign will be fact-checking the debate in real time, on X. ABC, meanwhile, has said that the debate moderators will facilitate the debate but not fact-check. Rick Klein, ABC News\u2019 political director, told the New York Times: \u201cWe\u2019re not making a commitment to fact-check everything, or fact-check nothing, in either direction. We\u2019re there to keep a conversation going, and to facilitate a good solid debate.\u201d For truly unbiased fact-checking of both candidates, follow along here on the Guardian US liveblog! Speaking to reporters in Philadelphia, Rick Scott, the Republican senator from Florida, said Donald Trump has been \u201cvery clear\u201d about his position on abortion, after the former president sought to moderate on an issue he fears will hurt Republicans in the November election. Trump recently suggested he would support a Florida ballot initiative enshrining abortion rights into the state constitution, only to say the following day, amid blowback from conservative Christians, that he would vote against it. \u201cThe supreme court made a decision. It\u2019s a state issue,\u201d Scott told reporters in the spin room, summarizing Trump\u2019s view on the matter. He said Trump would have an opportunity to turn the issue on Democrats, whom he falsely claimed support laws allowing people to get abortions after the baby is born. This is untrue: infanticide is criminalized in all 50 states. During the debate, Scott predicted that Trump would seek to tie Kamala Harris to Biden\u2019s record, and expected her to face sharp criticism from the former president over the administration\u2019s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal. He also sought to set expectations, pre-emptively accusing the press of not giving the president a fair shake. \u201cWell, first off, he\u2019s going to have a big win tonight,\u201d Scott said. \u201cNow the question will be, will the mainstream media say he\u2019s had a big win?\u201d The Harris-Walz campaign will be putting on a drone show over the Philadelphia Museum of Art prior to the debate. Per the campaign, \u201cthis drone show will serve as a perfect opener as eyes turn to the debate stage, where Vice President Harris will make her case for her popular New Way Forward agenda\u201d. The show \u201cwill echo some of the popular messaging this campaign and grassroots supporters have latched onto\u201d, according to a campaign statement. It is unclear how the drones will be spelling out or interpreting Harris\u2019s newly released policy platform, but do watch the skies over Philly and let us know! Now from Olivia Troye, a former homeland security and counter-terrorism adviser to Mike Pence, the vice-president under Donald Trump. Troye is holding a press conference as a surrogate of the Harris campaign before the debate, and was asked whether she fears retribution from the former president because of her staunch opposition to him. Troye highlighted a social media post by Trump on Saturday threatening to jail \u201ccorrupt\u201d election officials if he wins. The former president wrote: \u201cThose involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.\u201d Troye told reporters in Philadelphia: \u201cJust this weekend, he threatened to throw election workers in jail. Actually wanted law enforcement to go after them. Think about that. Take a step back and think about what that means for our elections right now, when you have a former president of the United States who seeks the Oval Office again and he\u2019s advocating attacks on our election officials.\u201d She added: \u201cBy the way, they\u2019ve already suffered from threats \u2013 we saw that in Georgia especially. Even some of the threats to Governor Kemp who just simply held the line and told the truth and stood by the 2020 election, which was a free and fair election. \u201cWhen you have someone that\u2019s speaking in that way, I think, yes, he has said there\u2019ll be retribution. I have no doubt there\u2019ll be retribution against myself and others who don\u2019t fall in line with exactly his type of cult.\u201d Young voter groups have criticized the Republican National Committee\u2019s gun store debate watch party, calling Trump\u2019s team \u201cevil\u201d and the former president \u201cout of touch\u201d for hosting the event so close to a mass school shooting site. The groups, which include Voters of Tomorrow, College Democrats of America, Leaders We Deserve, College Democrats of Georgia, Georgia High School Democrats, Young Democrats of Georgia, Path to Progress and Blue Future issued a joint statement condemning the committee\u2019s decision: Just days after students and teachers were murdered in Apalachee High School, Republicans are hosting a debate watch party an hour away at the world\u2019s largest gun store. The Trump team is evil for disrespecting the victims like this \u2013 and by continually refusing to support life-saving gun violence prevention policies. Donald Trump is out-of-touch with the vast majority of Americans on gun violence prevention. He continues to suck up to the gun lobby and insult victims, as shown by today\u2019s event. As young organizers in Georgia and across the country, and members of a generation that has been defined by mass shootings, we know Donald Trump\u2019s flagrant disregard for young Americans\u2019 lives will cost him this election. The Republican National Committee has scheduled a watch party for tonight\u2019s debate at a gun store in Georgia just miles away from Apalachee high school, where two teachers and two students were killed by a 14-year-old shooter last week. Gun-control advocacy group Moms Demand Action condemned the event on X: Adventure Outdoors, which proudly proclaims itself as \u201cthe Greatest Store on Earth\u201d, carries more than 15,000 guns and has a 17-lane shooting range. The store has hosted debate watch parties before, including last June when Donald Trump debated Joe Biden. The event, which includes dinner and refreshments, is sponsored by a slew of conservative groups, including Tea Party Patriots Action, the Fulton county Republican party and Pac Turning Point Action. Earlier, we described this race as \u201cneck and neck\u201d. We mean that literally \u2013 our polling average shows the two candidates tied nationally, at 47.3% support each. Of course, America\u2019s use of the electoral college means that seven swing states \u2013 Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 are expected to decide this election. For an idea of how Trump and Harris are faring in each, check out our poll tracker: Whether you\u2019re in the United States or abroad, we have a handy guide that\u2019ll tell you how to tune in to this evening\u2019s debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, and that covers its ground rules. Read it here: Good evening, US politics blog readers, and thanks for joining us as we cover tonight\u2019s debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, which we expect to be a milestone in what has already been a historically tumultuous presidential race. The two contenders will square off for 90 minutes at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, with ABC News hosting and their anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis moderating. The Democratic and Republican candidates are meeting as polls indicate a neck-and-neck race between them, particularly in the seven swing states expected to decide the winner. This will be the first debate between Harris and Trump. Joe Biden and Trump faced off in June, but the president put in such a poor showing that it sparked a plunge in his poll numbers and a Democratic pressure campaign that contributed to his decision to end his bid for a second term. Though Harris has been vice-president since 2021, she has done only one formal interview since launching her presidential campaign, and polls have indicated that voters are looking to find out more about her plans, if elected. This debate could present her with the opportunity to do that \u2013 while, for Trump, he\u2019ll be given the chance to make the case for his return to the White House. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll be watching out for: Will either candidate deliver a knockout blow to the other? Biden certainly received one when he encountered Trump just over two months ago, though he was far from the only candidate to emerge from a debate with their campaign hanging by a thread. Will Trump say something insensitive about Harris\u2019s racial identity? Just days after she launched her campaign, the former president claimed that the vice-president was not really Black, sparking outrage. What will Harris say about her policies? She inherited a campaign from Biden, but has slowly deviated from some of his proposals. Look out for anything she has to say about US support for Israel, and her previous stances on immigration \u2013 a subject Trump is sure to bring up."

            "title": "Iranian president accuses Israel of seeking wider conflict",
            "date": "2024-09-23T17:44:11Z",
            "content": "Iran\u2019s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has accused Israel of fanning the flames of war in the Middle East and said he hoped Iran could avoid being dragged into acting in a way \u201cnot worthy\u201d of it, as he spoke to the media on his first official visit to the US. The reformist, who took office in July after winning an election on a ticket of better relations with the west, said during a roundtable with journalists as he attended the UN general assembly in New York that no one benefited from war and that anyone who said otherwise was deluding themselves. \u201cWe know more than anyone else that if a larger war were to erupt in the Middle East, it will not benefit anyone throughout the world. It is Israel that seeks to create this wider conflict,\u201d he said. Tensions soared immediately after his inauguration as the visiting political chief of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in an operation in Tehran that was widely attributed to Israel. Pezeshkian said he was repeatedly told to hold back a response to the killing because Israel was within a week or two of signing a peace agreement, but that peace remained elusive. \u201cWe tried not to respond but unfortunately that elusive week never came,\u201d he said adding that he believed Iran had been lied to. \u201cThere is no winner in warfare, everyone loses in war and conflict. We are only deluding ourselves if we think someone will be victorious in a regional war.\u201d He also said: \u201cEvery day Israel is committing more atrocities and killing more and more people \u2013 old, young, men, women, children, hospitals, other facilities.\u201d Western diplomats are still assessing Pezeshkian after two months in office dominated by conflict in the region. He did not spell out how much damage had been done to the Iran-backed Lebanese militants Hezbollah in Israel\u2019s most recent wave of attacks and did not reply directly when asked if Iran would now respond more directly to Israel. \u201cWe always keep hearing, well, Hezbollah fired a rocket. If Hezbollah didn\u2019t even do that minimum, who would defend them?\u201d he said. \u201cCuriously enough, we keep being labelled as the perpetrator of insecurity. But look at the situation for where it is.\u201d He denied that Iran had not shown its own deterrence power, arguing that in its response to Israel\u2019s destruction of the Iranian consulate in Damascus, which killed at least 11 people including a senior commander in the al-Quds force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, Iranian forces had penetrated Israel\u2019s Iron Dome air defences and shown that it could have killed civilians. Speaking on the record for an hour to a group of almost exclusively US reporters, Pezeshkian became most animated as he accused western politicians and media of double standards in demanding human rights while at the same time remaining silent over the horrors in Gaza. \u201cWhere else in the world where countries that on the surface are committed to human rights allow these killings?\u201d he asked. He said Iran was willing to reopen talks on the nuclear deal that broke down more than a year ago, insisting the religious fatwa against Iran possessing nuclear weapons remained, and it was part of the Islamic Republic\u2019s military doctrine. He was sitting alongside the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, who earlier said on Telegram that Tehran was focused on initiating a new round of nuclear negotiations. \u201cWe are prepared, and if the other parties are also prepared, we can have another beginning of the talks during this trip,\u201d Pezeshkian said. He noted that he had been among a group of MPs who had vehemently defended the Iran nuclear deal with the west, including providing the UN nuclear weapons inspectorate with unfettered access to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. \u201cWe are still ready to sign up to the framework we agreed to,\u201d he said, adding that the US withdrawal from the deal initiated by Donald Trump in 2018 was \u201cillegal, unfair, unjust and not right\u201d. Pezeshkian denied Iran was running a series of proxy militia groups hostile to Israel, saying the west aimed to present Iran with an \u201cinhumane face\u201d. The Houthis in Yemen \u201ccannot be subjected to our will\u201d, he said. \u201cHow can we ask them to abstain from reacting to these crimes?\u201d He said he was seeking talks with the west about the war in Ukraine and said that during his presidency no short-range missiles had been sent from Iran to Russia for use in Ukraine, a formulation that leaves out the US intelligence claim that a contract to send missiles was probably signed last summer by his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi. Pezeshkian said Iran did not support what he described as Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, and he said the borders of countries should be respected. He scoffed at suggestions that Iran was funding anti-Israeli demonstrations, describing the allegation as absurd and pointing out that Iran was having a hard time covering its own payroll."
