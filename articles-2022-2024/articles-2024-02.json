            "content": "A US judge has formally postponed Donald Trump\u2019s trial on federal charges that the former president sought to overturn the 2020 election results. The trial was due to start on 4 March in Washington before the delay ordered from the federal judge Tanya Chutkan. Trial delays in general are not unusual in court cases. The delay in Trump\u2019s trial in particular stems from an appeal by the ex-president that claims he is immune to prosecution for actions taken while he was in the Oval Office. Chutkan had indicated in January that Trump\u2019s original trial date \u2013 chosen last summer \u2013 would not hold because the case had been frozen by the former president\u2019s appeal. The judge has prohibited prosecutors from filing motions while the appeal is pending and made clear that Trump\u2019s legal team would get a full seven-month period to prepare for the trial. Any time between December and the end of the appeals process would not count against that preparation period, Chutkan has also said. Trump has been grappling with more than 90 criminal charges in various jurisdictions for subversion of the 2020 election, illegal retention of government secrets after he left the Oval Office, and hush-money payments to an adult film actor who has alleged extramarital sex with him. Separately, he has also been ordered to pay about $88m in damages to the former Elle columnist E Jean Carroll after having been found liable of sexually abusing her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s as well as defaming her.

            "title": "Trump asks US supreme court to keep election interference case frozen",
            "date": "2024-02-12T22:08:25Z",
            "content": "Lawyers for Donald Trump asked the US supreme court on Monday to keep on hold the criminal case over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results while he prepares to challenge a recent appeals court ruling that found he was not immune from prosecution. The former US president also asked the nation\u2019s highest court to stay the US court of appeals for the DC circuit order that prevented him from seeking what is known as an \u201cen banc\u201d rehearing of the case by the full bench of appeals judges. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s application easily satisfies this Court\u2019s traditional factors for granting a stay of the mandate pending en banc review and review on certiorari by this Court,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers John Sauer, John Lauro and Greg Singer wrote in the 110-page petition. The petition argued that Trump had met the key tests for the supreme court to grant a stay because there was a strong likelihood it would hear the case and because without a stay, Trump would suffer \u201cirreparable injury\u201d if the case proceeded to trial in the interim. \u201cIt is axiomatic that President Trump\u2019s claim of immunity is an entitlement not to stand trial at all, and to avoid the burdens of litigation pending review of his claim,\u201d the petition said. The filing broadly expounded earlier arguments Trump had made about presidential immunity, which his legal team has viewed as the best vehicle to delay the impending trial because it was a vehicle through which Trump could pursue an appeal before trial that also triggered an automatic stay. Trump has made it no secret that his strategy for all his impending cases is to seek delay \u2013 ideally beyond the 2024 election in November, in the hopes that winning a second presidency could enable him to pardon himself or direct his attorney general to drop the charges. For months, Trump has attempted to advance a sweeping view of executive power \u2013 that he enjoyed absolute immunity from prosecution because the conduct charged by the special counsel Jack Smith fell within the \u201couter perimeter\u201d of his duties as president. The contention received short shrift from the US district judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing his case in Washington and rejected his argument. It received similar treatment from a three-judge panel at the DC circuit, which categorically rejected his position. \u201cWe cannot accept former president Trump\u2019s claim that a president has unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power,\u201d the unsigned but unanimous opinion from the three-judge panel said. \u201cAt bottom, former president Trump\u2019s stance would collapse our system of separated powers by placing the president beyond the reach of all three [government] branches,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cWe cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter.\u201d But Trump\u2019s lawyers have long viewed the immunity issue as more of a vehicle to stall the case from going to trial than an argument they would win on its merits. It was perhaps the only motion they could make that triggered an appeal before trial and came with an automatic stay. Trump was forced to appeal directly to the supreme court, instead of making an intermediary challenge that would cause further delay, after the DC circuit panel issued parameters on how Trump could use further appeals if he wanted the case to remain frozen. The panel ruled that Trump needed to petition the supreme court by Monday to keep the stay in place. The stay would remain until the supreme court either declined to hear the case or until it issued a judgment in the event it did agree to take up the matter. That effectively foreclosed Trump from pursuing an \u201cen banc\u201d rehearing \u2013 which is where the full bench of judges at the DC circuit would reconsider the decision of the three-judge panel \u2013 since pre-trial proceedings under Chutkan would resume while he waited for the DC circuit to weigh in. Over the weekend, Trump\u2019s chief appellate lawyer John Sauer prepared the application for a stay, a person familiar with the matter said. The concern in recent days among the Trump legal team has been whether the supreme court would agree to keep the case frozen while Trump made his final appeal, the person said. And even if they granted the stay, it remains unclear whether the supreme court would ultimately agree to take up the case. How the court moves next could decide whether Trump will go to trial on the federal election interference case before the 2024 presidential election. Recent public polls have shown that voters would be more inclined to vote for the Democratic incumbent Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in 2020, if Trump was convicted in this case. If the supreme court declines to hear the case, it would return jurisdiction to Chutkan in the federal district court in Washington. Chutkan scrapped the 4 March trial date she initially scheduled, but has otherwise shown a determination to proceed to trial with unusual haste. If the supreme court does accept the case, the question will be how quickly it schedules deadlines and arguments \u2013 and how quickly it issues a decision. The closer to the end of its term that the court issues a decision, the more unlikely a trial would take place before the election. The speed with which the supreme court moves has become important because Chutkan has promised Trump that he would get the full seven months to prepare his trial defense that she envisioned in her original scheduling order that set the 4 March trial date."

            "date": "2024-02-14T11:01:35Z",
            "content": "Imagine it is 6 January 2025. The bell tolls for the day of electoral college certification again. All the events of 2024 converge: The US supreme court\u2019s likely ruling in Trump v Anderson denying Colorado\u2019s disqualification of Trump under the constitution\u2019s 14th amendment, section 3; the exoneration of Joe Biden by special counsel Robert Hur for handling documents while sideswiping him as near senile; the ruling on Trump\u2019s immunity; the trial for his coup attempt; and Texas Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s defiance of federal court rulings in deploying his national guard to the border, supported by other Republican governors who have mobilized their guard units in similar acts of nullification \u2013 all these happenings could hurtle to a convulsive confrontation. The supreme court was precisely cautioned against fostering \u201cpotentially disastrous turmoil\u201d if it were to rule against Colorado, in an amicus brief submitted by Benjamin Ginsberg, who for decades was the leading Republican party attorney on elections, along with two prominent legal scholars, Richard Hasen, professor at the UCLA law school, and Edward Foley, professor at the Ohio State University law school. The brief by Ginsberg et al was unvarnished: \u201cA decision from this court leaving unresolved the question of Donald Trump\u2019s qualification to hold the office of president of the United States under section 3 of the 14th amendment until after the 2024 election would risk catastrophic political instability, chance disenfranchising millions of voters, and raise the possibility of public violence before, on, and after November 5 2024.\u201d The brief added that \u201cthe grounds for avoiding the merits are not credible: Colorado manifestly had the authority to determine Mr Trump\u2019s legal qualification for the office he seeks, and this court has jurisdiction to review that federal-law decision on its merits. To punt on the merits would invite chaos while risking great damage to the court\u2019s reputation and to the Nation as a whole.\u201d But apparently the justices failed to read this brief, just as they apparently failed to read the various amicus briefs filed by distinguished historians. Picture how the scenario might unfold as though reading it as a history from the vantage point of one year from now. The Ginsberg brief predicts the dire consequences that would flow from the supreme court ruling against Colorado. If we layer on to that prophesy the seemingly disparate events of this winter of our discontent we can see, through a mixture of fact and speculation, a disastrous unraveling. Start with the supreme court ruling that a state is not the proper body to determine a disqualification under the 14th amendment, section 3. That would, as the Ginsberg brief states, leave enforcement inevitably, by a process of elimination, to the Congress. The justices\u2019 frantic effort to escape responsibility for upholding the plain language of the 14th amendment in the name of saving the country from a hypothetical political crisis would potentially create a very real constitutional one. In that light, the election result might prove irrelevant. The reason is that now, according to this scenario, the 119th Congress, sworn in on 3 January 2025, could reject the electors from states for Trump by deciding that he is an insurrectionist. The supreme court would have set the stage. If the Democrats were to win the House, they could remove Trump. If the Republicans win control of the Senate, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, refusing to whip the vote for Trump, could allow a number of Republican senators to vote for Trump\u2019s disqualification, which would void his electoral votes by both chambers. If there is a deadlock, the Ginsberg brief argues, the House still would have an option to remove Trump. Under the Electoral Vote Reform Act, the House would establish rules under the constitution\u2019s 12th amendment in which each state delegation gets one vote in the House. But before that would have taken place, the House could vote that Trump is excluded from a 12th amendment ballot because he was disqualified under the 14th amendment, section 3. No one not on the ballot for president could be substituted. Which means that Joe Biden would be re-elected in any case. All along, throughout the entire campaign year, that would mean that Trump has never been qualified. And it would also mean that only the supreme court decision against Colorado made it seem that he was. *** In the hearing of the Colorado case earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts cast aside the pretense of the conservative doctrines of originalism and textualism on which the supreme court has eviscerated voting rights, gun control and abortion rights. He retreated into a political hypothetical that if the court ruled in Colorado\u2019s favor Biden might be subject to attempts to remove him from the ballot as an insurrectionist. Roberts prattled, \u201c\u2026 maybe they\u2019ve got a stack of papers saying here\u2019s why I think this person is guilty of insurrection, it\u2019s not a big insurrection, something that, you know, happened down \u2013 down the street, but they say this is still an insurrection \u2026 I don\u2019t know what the standard is for when it arises to that.\u201d Led by Roberts, the justices refused to define an insurrection, which was the heart of the Colorado supreme court\u2019s ruling. Roberts\u2019 hypothetical, besides tossing overboard originalism, was more than supercilious punditry. Perhaps his scenario was based on his familiarity with the tactics of the right wing. But Roberts also inadvertently revealed an implicit contempt for the federal system of justice. If a ludicrous suit were ever to be filed against Biden claiming he was an insurrectionist, it would enter into the process of that state\u2019s courts. Roberts apparently had scant confidence in the state courts, up to their supreme courts, to render a sensible decision to throw out transparently mischievous cases. And if a silly case somehow made it to the supreme court, Roberts himself could lead it to deny certiorari. But in his eagerness to find some cause to rule against Colorado, Roberts may have suffered a memory lapse about the fundamental workings of the judicial system. With a supreme court ruling against Colorado, Trump would hail it as a major political victory, brandishing it as proof that all of the charges against him were motivated by partisanship. *** Now, imagine that in the 2024 election Biden wins the popular vote for the presidency by millions. That is not such a difficulty. Only one Democrat since 1992 has lost the popular vote in a presidential election. But consider that Biden\u2019s overall vote and vote in swing states might be hurt by a lingering ill wind from the special counsel\u2019s report, blowing in suspicion that, despite his command of foreign policy, military affairs and congressional negotiations, he is too damn old, unlike his unsympathetic, malicious, despised and also elderly opponent. If that report imprinted the notion that Biden\u2019s age reflected disability, then wavering voters could fail to grant Biden the credit for his accomplishments, instead giving more weight to the image of him as incapacitated, leaving the record of his presidency unexplained. Trump\u2019s malignant rants, meanwhile, would be, as they are often now, either accepted or dismissed. Cognitive dissonance, rather than cognitive function, in the election could prove to be the critical factor. The president who lifted the country out of Trump\u2019s massive economic and social fiasco in the Covid crisis, and steered it through the resulting inflation to a fabled soft landing, would be perceived as having little to do with his own purpose and therefore weak. On the economy, it\u2019s the stupidity, stupid. The cognitive disconnect in failing to attribute results to Biden\u2019s actions would have enormous political consequences. The more Biden would try to explain the benefits of his policies, the more the Maga base and suggestible voters would disbelieve him because they have already decided he was too old to do anything, a perception reinforced not only by Fox News but also by the drumbeat of mainstream and social media. The election would then disclose the tenacity of the primitive mind. Trump\u2019s bluster would be equated with strength and his threats with energy. The more bellicose he behaves, the more he would be seen as strong; the more incoherently he babbles, the more his supporters believe he knows what he was talking about. While Biden\u2019s irrelevant gaffes have so far been held against him, Trump\u2019s stream of semiconsciousness has been credited as a sign of vigor. The primitive mind that instinctively associates ape-like bellowing with power will not be swayed. *** Special counsel Robert Hur\u2019s report on the storage of documents at the Penn Biden Center and Biden\u2019s home, published earlier this month, underscored the negative campaign attack. The report\u2019s first line was that \u201cno criminal charges are warranted\u201d. This was followed by contradictory assertions that Biden \u201cwillfully retained\u201d documents and that \u201creasonable jurors\u201d would conclude \u201cthat he did not retain them willfully\u201d, and that \u201che made an innocent mistake, rather than acting willfully \u2013 that is, with intent to break the law \u2013 as the statute requires\u201d. Having exonerated Biden, the special counsel added this snark: \u201cWe have also considered that, at trial, Mr Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\u201d The press attention to the latter part of the sentence has almost always left out the first part \u2013 the conjecture of a trial. Yet, as Hur made clear in the opening of his report, he had already decided that he would not bring charges because he lacked evidence, much less a single witness he could bring before a grand jury. When Hur wrote the line he knew there could be no trial. In Biden, Hur had a president \u201cwillfully\u201d dedicated to cooperation. He appeared for a deposition at the White House for more than five crucial hours on 8 and 9 October, immediately after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, in which he was immersed in urgent national security meetings and conversations with world leaders. There was no appearance of obstruction of justice or perjury, as there was in the documents case against Trump. Instead, Biden was willing to elevate the legal process over affairs of state. Biden\u2019s quoted statements that appeared muddled are completely familiar to anyone who has ever had a discussion with him. I have personally had long conversations with Biden since I met him nearly 40 years ago. He has a habit of ruminating, wandering and voicing fragments of thought aloud, but always returns to his subject with considerable knowledge, experience and clear views. (I know of many people who have had conversations with Biden very recently, who report that he is focused, sharp and has a cogent grasp of the many crises he is handling at once.) Hur\u2019s elaborately cute description of a doddering Biden was not gratuitous; it was carefully crafted. Hur knowingly lent the imprimatur of a Department of Justice report to character assassination. Then, Attorney General Merrick Garland naively released it unredacted to the public \u2013 red meat for the jackal pack. What was Robert Hur\u2019s state of mind? The most generous interpretation of the special counsel\u2019s innuendo may have been that he was innocent of any experience with a charming Irish American politician. The irony was surely lost on the hardwired conservative that his description of Biden fit Ronald Reagan to a T. But Hur instrumentally deployed his summary of his encounter with Biden as an excuse for his lack of evidence. Hur is a cold-blooded Javert as rightwing careerist. He is a representative man of the first generation bred entirely within the hothouse of the Federalist Society from his start to his smear. Beginning as a summer intern in 2000 at Kirkland &amp; Ellis, where he had the model of partner Brett Kavanaugh, he clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist in the period when he was issuing opinions blocking abortion clinics from using Rico to sue anti-abortion protesters for damages, in Scheidler v National Organization for Women, and striking down affirmative action to increase racial diversity in college admissions, in Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger. Hur was an associate to then deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who defended then attorney general William Barr\u2019s misrepresentation of a redacted version of the Mueller report on Russian interference in the presidential election of 2016 to assist Trump. Trump appointed Hur the US attorney for Maryland, which certainly met with the approval of the Federalist Society chair, Leonard Leo. Hur has been a featured speaker at Federalist Society events since 2007. Hur\u2019s report was not obsessional or fanatical, but professional. It was in effect his job application for the next Republican administration. *** Now, imagine, if the scenario of the Ginsberg brief is a catastrophe foretold, that all these events tumble unpredictably to 6 January 2025 and beyond. One of the analytic tools of historical understanding is to speculate on what might have happened if events took unexpected twists and turns. The proverb \u201cfor want of a nail\u201d suggests that the absence of a minor factor produced a major outcome. In chaos theory, the butterfly effect describes the impact of seemingly random occurrences that set in motion a chain reaction leading to enormous change \u2013 the flapping of a butterfly\u2019s wings that results in a distant tornado. A supreme court ruling and a special counsel\u2019s report are more than a nail and a butterfly\u2019s wings. So, consider the possible effects in a not-so-distant future: Disqualified by the Congress, an enraged Trump files a suit before the supreme court. But that is just a gesture. After the 2020 election, he incited a mob to attack the Capitol. Suppose that now he calls on the Texas governor \u2013 and other Republican governors \u2013 to send national guard units to enforce his \u201celection\u201d. Biden federalizes them, but the Republican governors proclaim that he has usurped power to keep himself in office illegitimately and that Trump is the truly elected president. Self-installed as the president of the de facto Second Confederacy, Trump\u2019s first act is to pardon himself of all federal crimes. He has called Vladimir Putin, Viktor Orb\u00e1n and Benjamin Netanyahu to request that they recognize him as the true president. Putin offers him asylum. As armies prepare to clash on a darkling plain, Trump\u2019s last-ditch appeal in the Manhattan election fraud case for paying hush money to a porn star goes against him. The New York appellate court announces it has upheld his prison sentence and fine. Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida responds that while Trump might be the president he will honor the extradition clause of the constitution to deliver him from Mar-a-Lago as a fugitive from justice. Trump flees to Texas, where Governor Abbott refuses the extradition order. Trump proclaims he is president wherever he is. The case for remanding Trump to jail in New York then goes to the supreme court. Having decided that the 14th amendment, section 3, is not self-executing, that a state cannot enforce it, the justices must now decide whether to uphold a district attorney under a state law to seize a convicted criminal under the extradition clause, which has always been pro forma. The court puts the case on its calendar several months in the future in the spring of 2025. Its conservative members are at the moment on an extended Federalist Society retreat at a private luxury lodge in Wyoming paid for by Harlan Crow. Or we click the heels of the ruby slippers. \u201cThere\u2019s no place like home.\u201d We awake from a phantasmagorical dream in a bed surrounded by Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.

            "date": "2024-02-26T12:00:02Z",
            "content": "The AI election is here. Already this year, a robocall generated using artificial intelligence targeted New Hampshire voters in the January primary, purporting to be President Joe Biden and telling them to stay home in what officials said could be the first attempt at using AI to interfere with a US election. The \u201cdeepfake\u201d calls were linked to two Texas companies, Life Corporation and Lingo Telecom. It\u2019s not clear if the deepfake calls actually prevented voters from turning out, but that doesn\u2019t really matter, said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice-president of Public Citizen, a group that\u2019s been pushing for federal and state regulation of AI\u2019s use in politics. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to wait to see how many people got deceived to understand that that was the point,\u201d Gilbert said. Examples of what could be ahead for the US are happening all over the world. In Slovakia, fake audio recordings may have swayed an election in what serves as a \u201cfrightening harbinger of the sort of interference the United States will likely experience during the 2024 presidential election\u201d, CNN reported. In Indonesia, an AI-generated avatar of a military commander helped rebrand the country\u2019s defense minister as a \u201cchubby-cheeked\u201d man who \u201cmakes Korean-style finger hearts and cradles his beloved cat, Bobby, to the delight of Gen Z voters\u201d, Reuters reported. In India, AI versions of dead politicians have been brought back to compliment elected officials, according to Al Jazeera. But US regulations aren\u2019t ready for the boom in fast-paced AI technology and how it could influence voters. Soon after the fake call in New Hampshire, the Federal Communications Commission announced a ban on robocalls that use AI audio. The FEC has yet to put rules in place to govern the use of AI in political ads, though states are moving quickly to fill the gap in regulation. The US House launched a bipartisan taskforce on 20 February that will research ways AI could be regulated and issue a report with recommendations. But with partisan gridlock ruling Congress, and US regulation trailing the pace of AI\u2019s rapid advance, it\u2019s unclear what, if anything, could be in place in time for this year\u2019s elections. Without clear safeguards, the impact of AI on the election might come down to what voters can discern as real and not real. AI \u2013 in the form of text, bots, audio, photo or video \u2013 can be used to make it look like candidates are saying or doing things they didn\u2019t do, either to damage their reputations or mislead voters. It can be used to beef up disinformation campaigns, making imagery that looks real enough to create confusion for voters. Audio content, in particular, can be even more manipulative because the technology for video isn\u2019t as advanced yet and recipients of AI-generated calls lose some of the contextual clues that something is fake that they might find in a deepfake video. Experts also fear that AI-generated calls will mimic the voices of people a caller knows in real life, which has the potential for a bigger influence on the recipient because the caller would seem like someone they know and trust. Commonly called the \u201cgrandparent\u201d scam, callers can now use AI to clone a loved one\u2019s voice to trick the target into sending money. That could theoretically be applied to politics and elections. \u201cIt could come from your family member or your neighbor and it would sound exactly like them,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cThe ability to deceive from AI has put the problem of mis- and disinformation on steroids.\u201d There are less misleading uses of the technology to underscore a message, like the recent creation of AI audio calls using the voices of kids killed in mass shootings aimed at swaying lawmakers to act on gun violence. Some political campaigns even use AI to show alternate realities to make their points, like a Republican National Committee ad that used AI to create a fake future if Biden is re-elected. But some AI-generated imagery can seem innocuous at first, like the rampant faked images of people next to carved wooden dog sculptures popping up on Facebook, but then be used to dispatch nefarious content later on. People wanting to influence elections no longer need to \u201chandcraft artisanal election disinformation\u201d, said Chester Wisniewski, a cybersecurity expert at Sophos. Now, AI tools help dispatch bots that sound like real people more quickly, \u201cwith one bot master behind the controls like the guy on the Wizard of Oz\u201d. Perhaps most concerning, though, is that the advent of AI can make people question whether anything they are seeing is real or not, introducing a heavy dose of doubt at a time when the technologies themselves are still learning how to best mimic reality. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between what AI might do and what AI is actually doing,\u201d said Katie Harbath, who formerly worked in policy at Facebook and now writes about the intersection between technology and democracy. People will start to wonder, she said, \u201cwhat if AI could do all this? Then maybe I shouldn\u2019t be trusting everything that I\u2019m seeing.\u201d Even without government regulation, companies that manage AI tools have announced and launched plans to limit its potential influence on elections, such as having their chatbots direct people to trusted sources on where to vote and not allowing chatbots that imitate candidates. A recent pact among companies such as Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI includes \u201creasonable precautions\u201d such as additional labeling of and education about AI-generated political content, though it wouldn\u2019t ban the practice. But bad actors often flout or skirt around government regulations and limitations put in place by platforms. Think of the \u201cdo not call\u201d list: even if you\u2019re on it, you still probably get some spam calls. At the national level, or with major public figures, debunking a deepfake happens fairly quickly, with outside groups and journalists jumping in to spot a spoof and spread the word that it\u2019s not real. When the scale is smaller, though, there are fewer people working to debunk something that could be AI-generated. Narratives begin to set in. In Baltimore, for example, recordings posted in January of a local principal allegedly making offensive comments could be AI-generated \u2013 it\u2019s still under investigation. In the absence of regulations from the Federal Election Commission (FEC), a handful of states have instituted laws over the use of AI in political ads, and dozens more states have filed bills on the subject. At the state level, regulating AI in elections is a bipartisan issue, Gilbert said. The bills often call for clear disclosures or disclaimers in political ads that make sure voters understand content was AI-generated; without such disclosure, the use of AI is then banned in many of the bills, she said. The FEC opened a rule-making process for AI last summer, and the agency said it expects to resolve it sometime this summer, the Washington Post has reported. Until then, political ads with AI may have some state regulations to follow, but otherwise aren\u2019t restricted by any AI-specific FEC rules. \u201cHopefully we will be able to get something in place in time, so it\u2019s not kind of a wild west,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cBut it\u2019s closing in on that point, and we need to move really fast.\u201d"

            "content": "Lawrence Lessig has a message for America: Donald Trump\u2019s assault on democracy in 2020, with his stolen-election lie and refusal to concede the White House, may have been shocking, but wait till you see what\u2019s coming next. \u201cWe are in a profoundly dangerous moment,\u201d the Harvard law professor says. \u201cThis is a catastrophic year, and the odds are not in our favor.\u201d Such a blunt warning carries the gravitas of its source. Lessig is a leading thinker on how public institutions can be corrupted, and has probed deeply into vulnerabilities that leave US democracy undefended against authoritarian attack. Lessig has teamed up with Matthew Seligman of the constitutional law center at Stanford. Their new book, How to Steal a Presidential Election, asks whether a second Trump attempt to subvert democracy could succeed. Their answer makes for uncomfortable reading. \u201cWe are convinced,\u201d they write, \u201cthat an informed and intelligent effort to undermine the results of a close, free and fair election could work in America \u2013 if the rules governing our presidential elections are not changed.\u201d It is a sign of troubled times that prominent scholars are wargaming the next election. A country that has long prided itself as an exemplar of constitutional democracy finds itself under surgical lights. Nor is this Lessig\u2019s first such thought experiment. Four years ago, months before Trump launched his stolen-election conspiracy, Lessig and Seligman devised a class at Harvard law school: Wargaming 2020. They looked at whether it would be possible to hack the presidential election and send the losing candidate to the White House. Their conclusion was that American democracy had dodged a bullet. \u201cWe discovered that Trump didn\u2019t really understand what he could have done,\u201d Lessig says. \u201cThere were obvious moves he and his team could have made, but they didn\u2019t take them.\u201d The insurrection on 6 January 2021 was tragic in its loss of life, but as a method of overturning the election it was the \u201cdumbest thing they could have possibly done. No court would ever allow the election to be decided by force of bayonets.\u201d Having repeated the wargaming exercise for the new book, Lessig is far less confident that another assault on democracy would end so positively. With the former president almost certain to secure the Republican nomination, having won in Iowa and New Hampshire, Lessig has no doubt about how far Trump is prepared to go. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that he\u2019s willing to do much, more more than we expected back in 2020,\u201d he says. Another reason for people to be \u201cvery anxious\u201d is that Trump and his inner circle have had four years to conduct their own wargames and are likely to be far more sophisticated: \u201cTrump didn\u2019t understand how to undo the structures of government. Now he\u2019s well-trained, he knows exactly what he needs to do.\u201d For their 2024 wargame, Lessig and Seligman assume the November election will be nail-bitingly close, both nationally and in at least one battleground state. That is not an outlandish precondition \u2013 you only have to think about the 537 votes that gifted Florida and the presidency to George W Bush in 2000. Given a close election, there are factors that could help stave off disaster. With the vice-presidency in the hands of Kamala Harris, there is no chance of Trump or his supporters unleashing the kind of pressure to which they subjected Mike Pence in 2020, trying to get him to block certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. In the wake of January 6, Congress also moved to close several loopholes by clarifying some of the most ambiguous wording of the 1887 Electoral Count Act. The Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act makes it harder for Congress to object to the counting of votes under the electoral college, and gives the courts a greater role in adjudicating the proper slate of electors to be returned from individual states should disputes arise. But in the Lessig-Seligman analysis, inevitable congressional compromises have left some loopholes in place, opening up opportunities for an unscrupulous, now battle-hardened candidate. Three scenarios stand out. The first relates to so-called \u201cfaithless electors\u201d: delegates chosen by parties to represent the winning candidate in each state under the arcane terms of the electoral college who decide to go against their pledge and back the loser. During Trump\u2019s first presidential run in 2016, 10 electors switched their votes. The ruse was a creative, albeit vain attempt to stave off a Trump presidency. Lessig argued on behalf of the 2016 faithless electors before the US supreme court, in a case known as Chiafolo v Washington. The court ruled against the faithless electors, ordering that states have the right to compel them to back the winners of the popular vote. The authors\u2019 concern is that the supreme court left it up to each state to decide whether or not to take up that power. Several states have yet to spell out in law that electors must abide by their pledge to vote for the victor. That leaves the door open to electors coming under massive, even violent pressure from Trump\u2019s army of Make America Great Again warriors. \u201cImagine an elector had Maga Republicans surrounding their house carrying torches and demanding they vote for Donald Trump. Who knows what the electors would do in those circumstances,\u201d Lessig says. The second scenario involves what Lessig and Seligman call a \u201crogue governor\u201d: the governor of a state who decides to flip the results of the presidential election. This route poses the greatest long-term threat of US democracy imploding, Lessig believes. Paradoxically, post-January 6 reforms in the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act heightened the danger by increasing the powers of governors to certify slates of electors sent to Congress. Both houses of Congress can vote to overrule a rogue governor, and count the correct slate representing the winner of the popular vote, but only if the House and Senate agree. Given a divided Congress, a rogue governor and rogue House working together could steal the state\u2019s electoral votes, and with it potentially the presidency. The risk of this scenario in this election cycle is minimal, Lessig concedes. Many of the highly sensitive battleground states \u2013 Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin \u2013 have Democratic governors. That leaves Georgia, which Biden won by just 11,779 votes. It has a Republican governor, Brian Kemp, but he resisted Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the result in 2020 and so is arguably less likely to go rogue this year. The third wargaming scenario is the one that really keeps Lessig up at night: what if an entire state legislature decided to go rogue? Again, the idea is not fanciful. Several legislatures in the most hotly contested states have Republican majorities firmly under Trump\u2019s sway \u2013 Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, to name just three \u2013 and conspiracy theories about rampant electoral fraud continue to circulate within them. Lessig worries that the supreme court ruling in Chiafolo, by giving state legislatures the power to tell electors how to cast their electoral votes, heightens the risk of a Maga-dominated legislature going rogue. He envisages state lawmakers claiming massive fraud in a close race and using that to justify switching its result to Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s a kind of opened hole that is going to be very hard to close in time,\u201d he says. \u2022\u2022\u2022 The Harvard professor has emerged from this journey into the dark arts of election subversion in a bleak mood. The book finishes with a raft of proposed changes to federal and state laws that the authors argue would close the loopholes they uncovered in their travels. Will those changes happen in time to prevent a second Trump blitzkrieg? \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic,\u201d Lessig says. \u201cI\u2019m not optimistic that Congress will be able to do anything in time, so the most we can hope for is that the infrastructure resists as it did last time.\u201d When he was researching the book, Lessig says he had the voice of his 13-year-old daughter ringing in his head: \u201cJust chill,\u201d as she would say. But in the event of an extremely close result, he feels he can\u2019t just chill. He stresses that none of this is partisan. He began life as a Republican and had the distinction in 1980, aged 19, of being the youngest delegate from Pennsylvania to Ronald Reagan\u2019s nominating convention. \u201cNeither of us have anything against the conservative movement in the United States, as expressed in the traditional Republican party,\u201d he says. But he looks at how the party has become \u201cdisengaged from the basic premise of democratic politics \u2013 if you win, you win, if you lose, you go home\u201d. And he sees that the number of Americans who still believe the 2020 election was stolen, against all evidence, remains steady. That scares him. \u201cMany Trump supporters have the sense that anything is justified, and that\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he says. \u201cTrump is denying every single core democratic norm, and yet his support continues to grow. That too is astonishing and terrifying.\u201d How to Steal a Presidential Election is published in the US by Yale University Press"

            "date": "2024-02-08T13:00:13Z",
            "content": "A decade ago, Taylor Swift liked to publicly mock a Jonas brother for dumping her over the phone. Today, her words may determine the future of US democracy. Over the last few weeks, Swift\u2019s endorsement has become one of the most coveted \u2013 and contested \u2013 prizes in the 2024 presidential election. After the New York Times reported that Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign was desperate to lock it down, Donald Trump\u2019s allies reportedly declared a \u201choly war\u201d on Swift. Fox News commentators started urging Swift to stay out of politics, while a sizable contingent of rightwingers spiraled into conspiracy theories: that Swift is a covert asset to bolster Biden, that she and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, are a set-up to bolster Biden, that the Super Bowl \u2013 in which Kelce will play as a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs football team \u2013 is being rigged to bolster Biden. All this fervor may seem totally out of touch. No matter how beloved she is, can a pop star from a Christmas tree farm in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, really decide the 2024 presidential elections? The answer is surprisingly complex, according to interviews with experts, self-described Swift admirers, and people who say they are indifferent to Swift. It is improbable that Swift\u2019s opinion would be the deciding factor for a voter torn between supporting Trump or Biden \u2013 if such a person exists \u2013 but the pop superstar is far more likely to propel voter turnout. And if the rematch between the two politicians, who still have to win their primaries, turns out to be close, the Swift electorate may make the difference. \u201cWe are not used to recognizing people like Taylor Swift with that much political power. That can be unnerving. We\u2019re not used to female fandoms, perhaps, having that much political power,\u201d said Ashley Hinck, an associate professor at Xavier University whose book Politics for the Love of Fandom unpacks the links between fandom, politics and civic engagement. \u201cThere\u2019s a way in which pundits, politicians, commentators and regular citizens are coming to terms with a new political culture. If you\u2019re not a part of it, you haven\u2019t seen it before \u2013 but it has been around for a long time. It\u2019s been growing for a long time.\u201d As Swift might say, it\u2019s been a long time coming. A lack of persuasion Swift first waded into politics in 2018, when she broke her career-long silence on politics to urge fans to vote for Democrats in a Tennessee election. Although one of Swift\u2019s preferred candidates lost to the Republican Marsha Blackburn, Swift endorsed Biden in 2020. She has also continued to tell fans to vote in subsequent elections, and voter registration has soared by the tens of thousands after each of her get-out-the-vote Instagram posts. Her fanbase is staggeringly large, with 53% of Americans saying they are fans and 16% identifying as \u201cavid fans\u201d, according to a March 2023 Morning Consult poll. (That poll was conducted before the launch of Swift\u2019s world-conquering Eras Tour, which has become the highest-grossing tour of all time and reportedly made Swift a billionaire.) However, Swift\u2019s fanbase is not evenly distributed across the US political spectrum: 55% of her self-avowed avid fans identify as Democrats, while 23% are Republicans and 23% are independents. Although a November 2023 NBC News poll found that 40% of registered voters said they had a positive view of Swift \u2013 more than any other figure included in the survey, including Biden, Kamala Harris and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Democrats are still more likely than Republicans to say that they like Swift. Fifty-three per cent of Democrats said that they had a positive view of Swift, while just 28% of Republicans say the same. Compared to Democrats, Republicans are also five times more likely to have a negative opinion of Swift. Experts caution that it is exceedingly difficult to ever pinpoint what makes someone choose one candidate over another. David James Jackson, a Bowling Green State University professor who has studied the effect of celebrity endorsements, was skeptical of the idea that Swift could flip Republicans for Biden. \u201cIf the policy position is already popular among the group that I\u2019m surveying, the celebrity endorsement makes it more popular. If it\u2019s unpopular, it makes it less unpopular, but it doesn\u2019t actually make it popular,\u201d Jackson said. But, he added: \u201cAre American elections really about persuasion any more?\u201d Jackson continued: \u201cIf in fact it turns out to be a Biden-Trump rematch, how many people really haven\u2019t formed an opinion about either of those two?\u201d Despite Swift\u2019s relative lack of popularity among Republicans, the rightwing attacks on her may still backfire, according to Jasmine Amussen, a 34-year-old librarian who lives in Georgia. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that they understand that when they\u2019re attacking Taylor Swift, they are actually talking about the millions of millennial women \u2013 mostly white \u2013 [in her fanbase]. But they\u2019re attacking their own daughters,\u201d Amussen said of Republicans. \u201cI think they\u2019re so confused as to how this 34-year-old woman is a billionaire, is unmarried. They just can\u2019t see past that to the underlying source of her power, which is the people who love her.\u201d Trump pressured Georgia\u2019s secretary of state to \u201cfind\u201d about 11,000 votes when he wanted to win the state in the 2020 election, as Amussen pointed out. The margins of the 2024 elections could be equally small, and a Swift endorsement could make the difference in turnout. \u201cShe can find 11,000 people to go vote when they didn\u2019t before or vote when they hadn\u2019t in a long time,\u201d Amussen said. \u201cAll it takes is a couple hundred women who were not interested before seeing these much older \u2013 gross, honestly \u2013 men talk about someone they respect and admire in that way.\u201d \u2018It will affect young people\u2019 Nearly 500 people responded to a Guardian survey about their thoughts on Swift\u2019s political influence. Asked whether a Swift endorsement could influence their vote, most respondents said no. They frequently said that they already agreed with Swift\u2019s suspected liberal politics or that they were not swayed by celebrity endorsements. But respondents often said that other voters may be more susceptible. \u201cI\u2019m not influenced by her, but my kids\u2019 generation is,\u201d one person from Massachusetts wrote. \u201cI\u2019m much too well informed,\u201d someone from Colorado added. \u201cBut it WILL affect young people.\u201d This kind of attitude is possibly an example of what Desir\u00e9e Schmuck called \u201cthe third person\u201d effect. \u201cPeople always think that there\u2019s a stronger impact on others than on themselves,\u201d said Schmuck, a professor from the University of Vienna who has studied how parasocial relationships influence youth political behavior. \u201cWe see that in interviews, they do agree that influencers have changed their behavior, not necessarily voting behavior, but rather what they buy or what they boycott, for instance, for political reasons,\u201d Schmuck said. \u201cWith voting, like with all behavior, there\u2019s not enough introspection to really know what was it in the end that caused you to do something. I don\u2019t think people want to pin it down to one factor, because they don\u2019t want to be that simple.\u201d The responses to the Guardian\u2019s survey, although extensive, by no means constitute a representative or scientific study. The survey design would probably draw in people who already have strong opinions about Swift, whether negative or positive. (A surprising number of people took the time to fill out a totally voluntary survey only to insist they had no thoughts on Swift. \u201cDo not care about her or her opinions,\u201d one 84-year-old from Georgia wrote.) Still, some academic studies have indeed uncovered a connection between celebrity endorsements and voter activity. A study that Schmuck worked on found that a German influencer\u2019s efforts to associate the climate crisis with the European Union elections \u2013 \u201ca boring election for young people\u201d, Schmuck said \u2013 was linked to a boost in youth voter turnout. Another study, which examined Oprah Winfrey\u2019s endorsement of Barack Obama before the 2008 presidential primary, uncovered that Winfrey\u2019s support led to 1m extra votes for Obama. Some people in the Guardian survey did say that Swift\u2019s opinions may influence their behavior, if not their vote. \u201cIf she came up and she said, \u2018Here\u2019s the guy running against Marsha Blackburn and I think we should really support this person,\u2019 I would cut that person a check,\u201d said Michael Dee, who works in investment banking in Dallas, Texas, and is deeply involved in politics. He knows he\u2019s voting for Biden but, he said, \u201cTaylor can highlight some candidates to help them raise money and I think that would be \u2026 a very good thing.\u201d Ultimately, complicating every calculation about Swift and her endorsement\u2019s power is the singularity of her status. Arguably, the last time musicians commanded this much attention, they were the Beatles, they were men, and there were four of them. The Beatles were also only a band for less than a decade, while Swift has been in the public eye for almost two. Many Americans started to form emotional ties to her long before they could vote. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a potential endorsement be so anticipated as this one,\u201d Jackson said."

            "content": "The Trump veepstakes is under way. Senator JD Vance and Representative Elise Stefanik prostrate themselves. Both signal they would do what Mike Pence refused: upend democracy for the sake of their Caesar. The senator is a Yale Law School alum and former US marine. Stefanik is the fourth-ranking House Republican. He was once critical of the former president. She was skeptical. Not anymore. \u201cDo I think there were problems in 2020? Yes, I do,\u201d Vance recently told ABC. \u201cIf I had been vice-president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors \u2026 I think the US Congress should have fought over it from there.\u201d Last month, Stefanik said: \u201cWe will see if this is a legal and valid election. What we saw in 2020 was unconstitutional circumventing of the constitution, not going through state legislators when it comes to changing election law.\u201d From the supreme court down, the judiciary has repeatedly rejected that contention. As the November election looms, Lawrence Lessig and Matthew Seligman offer How to Steal a Presidential Election, a granular and disturbing examination of the vulnerabilities and pressure points in the way the US selects its president. Short version: plenty can go wrong. Lessig is a chaired professor at Harvard Law School. He views a second Trump term as calamitous. \u201cHe is a pathological liar, with clear authoritarian instincts,\u201d Lessig writes. \u201cHis re-election would be worse than any political event in the history of America\u200a \u2013 \u200asave the decision of South Carolina to launch the civil war.\u201d Seligman is a fellow at the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford, focused on disputed presidential elections. He too views Trump uncharitably. \u201cFormer president Trump and his allies attempted a legal coup in 2020 \u2013 a brazen attempt to manipulate the legal system to reverse the results of a free and fair election,\u201d Seligman has said. \u201cDespite all the attention on 6 January 2021 [the attack on Congress], our legal and political systems remain dangerously unprotected against a smarter and more sophisticated attempt in 2024.\u201d The open question is whether forewarned is forearmed. On the page, Lessig and Seligman spell out seven roads to ruin, the \u201cinverting\u201d of an election to force a result that thwarts voters\u2019 expressed intentions. The authors discount the capacity of a vice-president to unilaterally overturn an election result. But they warn of the potential for havoc at state level. As they see it, the danger of pledged but not legally bound electors being coerced to vote for Trump when the electoral college convenes is \u201csignificant\u201d. They also hypothesize a state governor \u201cinterven[ing] to certify a slate of electors contrary to the apparent popular vote\u201d. Another path to perdition includes making state legislatures the final judges of election results. There is also the \u201cnuclear option\u201d, according to the authors, which is stripping the right to vote from the voters. \u201cA state legislature cancels its election before election day and chooses the state\u2019s electors directly,\u201d as Lessig and Seligman put it, a potential outcome they call a \u201cvery significant\u201d possibility under the US constitution. \u201cState legislators are free to deny their people a meaningful role in selecting our president, directly or indirectly,\u201d they write. \u201cIs there any legal argument that might prevent a legislature from formally taking the vote away from its people? We are skeptical.\u201d To say US democracy is at risk is not to indulge in hyperbole. Trump\u2019s infamous January 2021 call to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, is a vivid reminder. \u201cWhat I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes, which is one more than \u2026 we have, because we won the state.\u201d Such words continue to haunt. In an episode that casts a similar pall, Trump and Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee (RNC) chair, urged election officials in Michigan\u2019s Wayne county to block the release of final results. \u201cDo not sign it \u2026 we will get you attorneys,\u201d McDaniel told the officials, regarding certification. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of that,\u201d Trump said. Now, as he has for so many former enablers, Trump has taken care of McDaniel. She will shortly be gone from the RNC. Among Trump\u2019s supporters, discontent with democracy is no secret. During the 2016 campaign, Paul LePage, then governor of Maine, thought Trump needed to show some \u201cauthoritarian power\u201d. In 2019, Mike Johnson, then a Louisiana congressman, declared: \u201cBy the way, the United States is not a democracy. Do you know what a democracy is? Two wolves and a sheep deciding what\u2019s for dinner. You don\u2019t want to be in a democracy. Majority rule: not always a good thing.\u201d Johnson is now House speaker. For good measure, he claims God told him \u201cvery clearly\u201d to prepare to become \u201cMoses\u201d. \u201cThe Lord said step forward,\u201d Johnson says. On the right, many openly muse about a second civil war. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had one, so we know it\u2019s within the realm of possibility,\u201d James Pinkerton, a veteran of the White Houses of Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush, recently wrote in the American Conservative. \u201cIn fact, by one reckoning, the English speakers have had two other civil wars in the last four centuries, spaced out every hundred or so years. Is there some sort of deep cycle at work here? With, er, implications for our own troubled times?\u201d The election won\u2019t be pleasant. In late December, 31% of Republicans believed Joe Biden\u2019s win in 2020 was legitimate. That was eight points lower than two years before. Trump\u2019s criminal trials loom. Through that prism, Lessig and Seligman\u2019s work serves as dire warning and public service. How to Steal a Presidential Election is published in the US by Yale University Press"

The critical swing state\u2019s election will prove a test for both frontrunners, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. But a separate Republican convention held on Saturday will determine the final delegate count for the Republican party. Here are the results from the 27 February Michigan primary: Republicans running Donald Trump The former US president\u2019s campaign to retake the White House and once again grab his party\u2019s nomination got off to a slow start that was widely mocked. But after decisive wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign has steadily moved into a position of dominance. Trump declined to attend any of the Republican debates, has used his court appearances and many legal woes as a rallying cry to mobilize his base, and has run a surprisingly well-organized campaign. His extremist rhetoric, especially around his plans for a second term and the targeting of his political enemies, has sparked widespread fears over the threat to American democracy that his candidacy represents. His political style during the campaign has not shifted from his previous runs in 2016 and 2020 and, if anything, has become more extreme. Many see this as a result of his political and legal fates becoming entwined, with a return to the Oval Office being seen as Trump\u2019s best chance of nixing his legal problems. Nikki Haley The former South Carolina governor and ex-US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump has mostly hewed a fine line between being an alternative to Trump, while not outraging his base with too much direct criticism. That paid off to some extent as Haley shone in debates and rose past her competitors for the number two slot in the Republican race. But after losing by sizable margins in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Haley\u2019s chances have dwindled. Ryan Binkley Binkley, a Texas businessman, has now dropped out but is still in the ballot. Binkley was a long-shot candidate who is also a pastor at Create church. The self-proclaimed far-right fiscal conservative criticized both Democrats and Republicans for not being able to balance the federal budget, and said he would focus on health costs, immigration reform and a national volunteer movement. Democrats running Joe Biden Biden is the likely Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. He announced his campaign for re-election on 25 April 2023, exactly four years after he announced his previous, successful presidential campaign. While approval for the president remains low, hovering just above 40%, political experts say he is the most likely candidate to defeat Trump. Biden has served in politics for over five decades and is running on a platform that includes abortion rights, gun reform and healthcare. At 81, he is the oldest president in US history. Dean Phillips Dean Phillips, a three-term Democratic congressman from Minnesota, is challenging Biden, saying the next generation should have the opportunity to lead the country. Phillips is the heir to a distilling company and once co-owned a gelato company. He entered public office spurred by fighting back against Trump. Marianne Williamson Failed 2020 presidential candidate Marianne Williamson has now dropped out of the race but will still be on the ballot. Williamson, an author of self-help books, launched her long-shot bid with campaign promises to address climate change and student loan debt. She previously worked as \u201cspiritual leader\u201d of a Michigan Unity church."

But Williamson ultimately opted to continue for two more primaries. She won 2% of the vote in South Carolina and about 3% in Nevada. In her announcement on Wednesday, Williamson said her campaign had \u201carticulated deeper, more authentic truths than those regularly acknowledged by the political establishment\u201d. Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips is the last nationally known Democrat still running against Biden, who has secured large victories in South Carolina and Nevada and easily won in New Hampshire \u2013 despite not being on the ballot \u2013 after his allies mounted a write-in campaign. A Texas native who now lives in Beverly Hills, California, Williamson is the author of more than a dozen books and ran an unsuccessful independent congressional campaign in California in 2014. Williamson first ran for president in 2020 and made national headlines by calling for a \u201cmoral uprising\u201d against then-president Donald Trump while proposing the creation of a Department of Peace. She also argued that the federal government should pay large financial reparations to black Americans as atonement for centuries of slavery and discrimination. She ended her 2020 presidential run shortly before the leadoff Iowa caucuses, announcing that she didn\u2019t want to take progressive support from Bernie Sanders. Her second White House bid featured the same nontraditional campaigning style and many of the same policy proposals. She struggled to raise money and was plagued by staff departures from the earliest stages of her bid. She campaigned especially hard in New Hampshire, hoping to capitalise on state Democrats\u2019 frustration with the president. The Democratic National Committee decided last year to make South Carolina the first voting state, a move that upended a century-old tradition of New Hampshire hosting the first primary. Williamson acknowledged from the start that it was unlikely she would beat Biden, but she argued in her launch speech in March that \u201cit is our job to create a vision of justice and love that is so powerful that it will override the forces of hatred and injustice and fear.\u201d The Associated press contributed to this report"

            "content": "President Joe Biden has again won the South Carolina presidential primary, his first formal primary win of the election season. Amid low voter turnout, the Associated Press projected that Biden also won all 55 of the state\u2019s Democratic delegates. Another seven delegates are pledged by party leaders and elected officials, such as South Carolina\u2019s lone Democratic congressman, Jim Clyburn. Neither Dean Phillips, the congressman from Minnesota, nor author Marianne Williamson received at least 15% of the statewide vote or 15% of the vote in any congressional district, the threshold necessary to win delegates. The president sent out a statement shortly after the results were called in his favor, specifically highlighting Black voters, who comprise 26% of state residents and a significant portion of the Democratic voting base in South Carolina. \u201cAs I said four years ago, this campaign is for everyone who has been knocked down, counted out and left behind. That is still true today. With more than 14m new jobs and a record 24 straight months \u2013 two years \u2013 of the unemployment rate under 4%, including a record low unemployment rate for Black Americans, we are leaving no one behind,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the Presidency. \u201cNow in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again \u2013 and making Donald Trump a loser \u2013 again. Biden continued: \u201cWhen I was elected president, I said the days of the backbone of the Democratic party being at the back of the line were over. That was a promise made and a promise kept. Now, you are first in the nation.\u201d The Democratic National Committee changed the national election calendar last year to designate South Carolina as the first official contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, taking the privilege away from the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. Biden did not participate in the New Hampshire primary, which state Democratic officials held over the objections of the national committee. Marvin Pendarvis, a Democratic state representative from North Charleston, said the primary was important, regardless of turnout. \u201cEveryone probably wondered why was it so important that we got turnout, even when we knew that Joe Biden was going to win South Carolina. It\u2019s because we are first in the nation. It\u2019s because we want to maintain that status going into 2028. And it is big for our party to be able to showcase why South Carolina was chosen to be first: because we are representative of the Democratic party, not only in our diversity of values, but also how we look and how we come together as Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones that spearheaded Joe Biden to get into office in 2020,\u201d Pendarvis added. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it again in 2024.\u201d South Carolina\u2019s primaries are open, allowing any registered voter to participate, though voters much choose only one primary \u2013 Democratic or Republican \u2013 to vote in. Of South Carolina\u2019s 3.3 million registered voters, about 13% participated in the 2016 Democratic primary, which was won overwhelmingly by Hillary Clinton, while 16% voted in the 2020 primary that separated Biden from the pack. South Carolina\u2019s Republicans go to the polls on 24 February, when the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley faces former president Donald Trump. Biden\u2019s statement ended on a warning about the upcoming contest: \u201cThe stakes in this election could not be higher. There are extreme and dangerous voices at work in the country \u2013 led by Donald Trump \u2013 who are determined to divide our nation and take us backward. We cannot let that happen. We\u2019ve come a long way these past four years \u2013 with America now having the strongest economy in the world and among the lowest inflation of any major economy. Let\u2019s keep pushing forward. Let\u2019s finish what we started \u2013 together.\u201d"

            "content": "JD Vance, the Ohio senator who is being floated as a potential Republican running mate to Donald Trump, said on Sunday that he still questions the results of the 2020 election and that the votes should not have been immediately certified. \u201cDo I think there were problems in 2020? Yes, I do,\u201d Vance told ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, adding it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to ask if he would have certified the results as Mike Pence had done and told the host he was \u201cobsessed with talking about this\u201d. In a contentious interview, the senator also suggested that Trump should ignore \u201cillegitimate\u201d US supreme court rulings. That remark came after Vance was questioned about a 2021 podcast during which he said he would advise Trump to \u201cfire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people\u201d and ignore legal rulings against it. \u201cWe have a major problem here with administrators and bureaucrats in the government who don\u2019t respond to the elected branches ... If those people aren\u2019t following the rules, then of course you\u2019ve got to fire them, and of course the president has to be able to run the government as he thinks he should,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThe constitution says that the supreme court can make rulings ... but if the supreme court said the president of the United States can\u2019t fire a general, that would be an illegitimate ruling,\u201d added Vance, whose wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, has previously clerked for John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh, the supreme court justices. Vance also argued that the civil claims and criminal cases against Trump were not legitimate efforts to prosecute the former president for wrongdoing, but \u201cabout throwing him off the ballot because Democrats feel that they can\u2019t beat him at the ballot box. And so, they\u2019re trying to defeat him in court.\u201d The interview ended badly, with the network cutting to a commercial break after Stephanopoulos told Vance he had made it \u201cvery clear\u201d he believed a president can defy the supreme court. \u201cNo, no, George \u2026\u201d Vance said before the sound was cut. Vance, the author of Hillbilly Elegy, was elected senator in 2022 after abandoning his past criticism of Trump, in which he had said the former president was \u201cAmerica\u2019s Hitler\u201d, \u201ca total fraud\u201d and \u201ca moral disaster\u201d. The reversal helped to secure Trump\u2019s endorsement and his backing has not wavered since. He has described the legal claims against Trump, specifically E Jean Carroll\u2019s sexual abuse and defamation lawsuit that last week concluded with an $83m judgement against Trump, as \u201cillustrative of what\u2019s gone wrong in this country\u201d."

            "content": "Democrats and Republicans went to the polls on Tuesday for Michigan\u2019s presidential primary. The critical swing state\u2019s election will prove a test for both frontrunners, Joe Biden and Donald Trump. But a separate Republican convention held on Saturday will determine the final delegate count for the Republican party. Here are the results from the 27 February Michigan primary: Republicans running Donald Trump The former US president\u2019s campaign to retake the White House and once again grab his party\u2019s nomination got off to a slow start that was widely mocked. But after decisive wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign has steadily moved into a position of dominance. Trump declined to attend any of the Republican debates, has used his court appearances and many legal woes as a rallying cry to mobilize his base, and has run a surprisingly well-organized campaign. His extremist rhetoric, especially around his plans for a second term and the targeting of his political enemies, has sparked widespread fears over the threat to American democracy that his candidacy represents. His political style during the campaign has not shifted from his previous runs in 2016 and 2020 and, if anything, has become more extreme. Many see this as a result of his political and legal fates becoming entwined, with a return to the Oval Office being seen as Trump\u2019s best chance of nixing his legal problems. Nikki Haley The former South Carolina governor and ex-US ambassador to the United Nations under Trump has mostly hewed a fine line between being an alternative to Trump, while not outraging his base with too much direct criticism. That paid off to some extent as Haley shone in debates and rose past her competitors for the number two slot in the Republican race. But after losing by sizable margins in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Haley\u2019s chances have dwindled. Ryan Binkley Binkley, a Texas businessman, has now dropped out but is still in the ballot. Binkley was a long-shot candidate who is also a pastor at Create church. The self-proclaimed far-right fiscal conservative criticized both Democrats and Republicans for not being able to balance the federal budget, and said he would focus on health costs, immigration reform and a national volunteer movement. Democrats running Joe Biden Biden is the likely Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election. He announced his campaign for re-election on 25 April 2023, exactly four years after he announced his previous, successful presidential campaign. While approval for the president remains low, hovering just above 40%, political experts say he is the most likely candidate to defeat Trump. Biden has served in politics for over five decades and is running on a platform that includes abortion rights, gun reform and healthcare. At 81, he is the oldest president in US history. Dean Phillips Dean Phillips, a three-term Democratic congressman from Minnesota, is challenging Biden, saying the next generation should have the opportunity to lead the country. Phillips is the heir to a distilling company and once co-owned a gelato company. He entered public office spurred by fighting back against Trump.

            "date": "2024-02-20T06:00:38Z",
            "content": "Overseas elections from more than 30 years ago are rarely hot topics of conversation in modern UK politics. But whisper \u201cCanada 1993\u201d into a Conservative MP\u2019s ear and don\u2019t be surprised if they break into a sudden cold sweat. This is the model for the \u201cextinction-level event\u201d experienced by a previously dominant rightwing party \u2013 one that some Tory opponents of Rishi Sunak warn he risks emulating at the next general election. The basic and, for Tory MPs, chilling facts are that in October 1993 the Progressive Conservative party, in power in Canada since 1984, slumped from 167 federal seats to just two, eventually leading to its dissolution and merger into the new Conservative party of Canada. There are some curiously precise parallels: a complacent conservative incumbent that had recently ditched its leader (Kim Campbell replacing Brian Mulroney) was struggling with the economy and faced a new, insurgent rightwing party \u2013 called Reform. Arguably the most pertinent common ground is the fact that Canada, like Westminster, uses first past the post (FPTP), a system that can greatly distort the way votes translate into numbers of MPs \u2013 in 1993 the Progressive Conservatives got 16% of the vote and ended up with less than 1% of the seats. Could this happen here? Some on the right of the UK Conservatives, who want Sunak to more closely follow Reform UK\u2019s harder-right populism on areas such as immigration, argue that without a change, of course it could. Such warnings have grown since last week\u2019s byelection losses in Wellingborough and Kingswood, previously Conservative seats won by Labour after a collapse in the Tory vote and Reform winning 13% and 10% respectively in each seat. The scenario that more doom-laden Tories fear could tip a general election defeat into a calamity would be a further slip in the polls and Nigel Farage deciding to retake the helm of Reform before the election, boosting its support among disenchanted voters on the right. It is certainly true that while a post-election tally of two feels unrealistic, the vagaries of FPTP means it would not take a massive shift in polling for the total number of Tory MPs to drop dramatically. The votes-to-seats modeller on the Electoral Calculus website shows that at current polling levels \u2013 27% for the Conservatives, 43% for Labour, 10% for the Liberal Democrats, 9% for Reform, 7% for the Greens \u2013 the Conservatives would be reduced to 179 MPs. However, in a scenario where Labour\u2019s vote share increased by one percentage point to 44%, the Tories\u2019 fell to 20%, with the other six points moving to Reform (now on 14%) and the Lib Dems (13%), and the Greens still on 7%, could result in just 55 Conservative MPs. Such FPTP distortions can be amplified further by particularly efficient tactical voting and the vagaries of where votes are distributed. There are a number of significant differences from Canada in 1993, however, including the near disappearance of the Progressive Conservatives\u2019 representation in Quebec amid the rise of the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. In contrast, the Conservatives start at an already lower base in Scotland and, to an extent, Wales. Overall, most pundits do not believe a Canada-style wipeout will happen. \u201cNever say never about anything in politics,\u201d said Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and psephologist. \u201cBut the only people who mention it are those who have a vested interest in exaggerating the potential for a possible defeat.\u201d Lord Hayward thinks it is unlikely that the Tories will win fewer than 100 seats, arguing that the rise of Reform could hamper Lib Dem appeal for anti-Tory protest voters. \u201cI could foresee circumstances where something like that could happen. Do I think it will happen? No,\u201d he said. Anand Menon, the director of the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe and a professor of European politics at King\u2019s College London, co-authored a 2022 study that examined the parallels with 1993. He argued that the situations were sufficiently different. \u201cOn one level, anything\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hunch is that the polls will narrow as we get to the election. With the Canadian case, you had a far stronger splintering of the right than we seem to have now, even with Reform\u2019s performance last week. \u201cThe other thing you\u2019ve got to factor in, which builds into this uncertainty, is there is eye-watering levels of volatility amongst the British voting public at the moment, compared to any historical period. \u201cSome basic facts seem to me self-evident, which is that the Tories are in a really bad position and are heading towards a bad electoral defeat. But whether it\u2019s what they call an extinction-level event, I doubt, to be honest.\u201d"

            "content": "Polls have closed in two byelections where Labour is seeking to take seats from Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservative party. In Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, the Tories were defending a majority of more than 18,000; and in Kingswood in South Gloucestershire its majority from the 2019 general election was more than 11,000. The results are expected in Wellingborough at about 4am on Friday, with Kingswood expected to declare between 2am and 5am. Labour is considered the favourite to win both seats. A Conservative source sounded downbeat about the result for Sunak\u2019s party. \u201cWe have fought robust campaigns on the ground in both of these seats with local candidates. But these byelections were always going to be hard. \u201cThe government of the day rarely win byelections. Both of these seats have been Labour recently and they require smaller swings than were seen in recent byelections.\u201d Pat McFadden, Labour\u2019s election coordinator, said: \u201cWe are proud of the positive campaigns we have run in Kingswood and Wellingborough. We were always aware of the challenge ahead of us with the large Conservative majorities in both seats, which are both beyond our target list for a general election. \u201cOur campaigns have focused relentlessly on the cost of living and delivering for working people. We have highlighted that people in Kingswood and Wellingborough deserve better than a Tory government which has presided over 14 years of failure and left the economy in tatters. Rishi\u2019s recession means this Tory government is unable to concentrate on what matters to people in both these areas and across the country. \u201cIt will be some time before we know the results, but we are making real progress in all corners of our country.\u201d The Wellingborough byelection was called after veteran Brexit-supporter Peter Bone was recalled by voters after the parliamentary watchdog found he had broken the MPs\u2019 code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct. The party generated further local anger by selecting Bone\u2019s partner, Helen Harrison, as its candidate. The Kingswood byelection was called after Tory MP Chris Skidmore resigned in protest at Sunak\u2019s decision to allow new oil and gas licences to be issued. In contrast to low-profile campaigns from the Conservative party, Labour has had a strong presence on the streets of Wellingborough, with MPs Yvette Cooper, Tulip Siddiq and Feryal Clark among those supporting Labour candidate Gen Kitchen. Keir Starmer visited football club AFC Rushden and Diamonds with Kitchen on Tuesday. On polling day, the Labour leader was carrying out phone canvassing of both constituencies from the party\u2019s London HQ accompanied by musician turned clean water campaigner Feargal Sharkey. Also campaigning in person in Wellingborough on Thursday was Reform UK deputy co-leader Ben Habib, who was seeking for the party to get its record share of the vote at a byelection. The party has been polling at near 10% in some national polls. Standing on a platform opposing net zero policies, Habib had told the FT he had been buoyed up by \u201clots of waves and tooting of horns\u201d when driving the party\u2019s battlebus. Damien Egan, the Labour candidate in Kingswood, grew up in the constituency, but had been living in London. He resigned as the mayor of Lewisham last month. The Tory candidate in Kingswood, Sam Bromiley, leads the party\u2019s group on South Gloucestershire council. His campaign has focused on trying to prevent the local authority building 8,000 new homes in the area, in the same week that the Tory government launched its plans to try to increase housebuilding. The Conservatives have already lost eight byelections during this parliament. Should they lose either of the votes today they will have lost more byelections than any government since the 1960s, eclipsing the eight lost by John Major\u2019s government between 1992 and 1997. Another byelection will be held on 29 February, when Rochdale votes in a campaign that has made national headlines with the Labour and the Green parties withdrawing support from their candidates, and former MPs George Galloway and Simon Danczuk both standing."

            "content": "Polls have opened in the Rochdale byelection after a chaotic contest dominated by the war in Gaza. The veteran campaigner George Galloway is the bookies\u2019 favourite to win after Labour abandoned its candidate over inflammatory comments he made about Israel. Galloway, the former Labour MP, has described the poll as \u201ca referendum on Gaza\u201d and sought to capture the votes of thousands of disaffected Muslims. Labour had expected to increase its 9,668-vote majority in the Greater Manchester town until it emerged that its candidate, Azhar Ali, had repeated anti-Israel conspiracy theories about the 7 October attack by Hamas. Ali will still be on the ballot paper \u2013 it was too late to select another candidate \u2013 but he will sit as an independent MP if he wins. The result is expected at around 3am on Friday. The byelection was called after the death of Rochdale\u2019s MP, Sir Tony Lloyd, from leukaemia on 17 January. Labour enjoys an average 20-point lead in the national opinion polls and was riding high on the success of the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections earlier this month, both of which it won from the Tories with double-digit swings. But what was expected to be a straightforward contest to replace Lloyd was thrown into disarray when Ali\u2019s comments were published by the Mail on Sunday on 11 February. He had suggested Israel had deliberately relaxed security after warnings of an imminent threat. Labour, which has held Rochdale since 2010, hopes that enough of its supporters will vote for the party on Thursday to stop Galloway, although byelections always have lower turnouts than nationwide polls. Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s party faces a challenge from another former Labour MP in the form of Simon Danczuk, who was suspended from the party in 2015 after sending inappropriate messages to a teenager. Danczuk was Rochdale\u2019s MP from 2010 to 2017 and is standing for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party presided over by Nigel Farage. The two other main parties, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, are not expected to mount a serious challenge, while Labour\u2019s vote is expected to be split further between a handful of local independent candidates. Galloway, 69, is expected to be the main beneficiary of the chaos having campaigned on a pro-Palestine ticket aimed at Rochdale\u2019s Muslim community, which accounts for about 30% of the population. It would be the third time the veteran agitator has unseated his former party after victories in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005 and Bradford West in 2012. Like his previous campaigns, the Rochdale contest has been mired in controversy. Galloway last week said the names of Labour MPs were \u201cdripping in blood\u201d after the party\u2019s ceasefire amendment, which did not go as far as some pro-Palestine supporters wanted. The four-week contest has been mired in controversy. Earlier this week a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of sending a death threat to Danczuk, who hired security guards for the final two days of campaigning. Galloway\u2019s team said its banners and garden posts had been ripped down in an effort to stop it getting the word out."

            "content": "Phone services have been suspended in Pakistan as the country voted in a general election marred by allegations of vote rigging and militant attacks. The caretaker government said phone services, including mobile internet, had been suspended on Thursday for security reasons, after two two bomb blasts by Islamic State targeted election offices in the restive region of Balochistan on the eve of the polls. However, political parties and candidates voiced concern that the suspension was a strategy to enable the rigging of the election by Pakistan\u2019s powerful military, which has a history of meddling in the polls. Results had been expected by the evening but the suspension caused a delay in the reporting of votes, adding to concerns about the integrity of the process. Amnesty International decried the suspension as a \u201creckless attack on people\u2019s rights\u201d while Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, who was running as an independent candidate in Islamabad, said on X: \u201cShutting down mobile networks on polling day is the beginning of election day rigging.\u201d \u201cThe pre-poll environment was already one of the worst in Pakistan\u2019s history. Cutting candidates off from their agents and staff on election day is unacceptable,\u201d said Khokhar. Early indicators, with around 20% of the votes counted \u2013 largely from urban areas \u2013 showed a surprise lead for the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the political party of the former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently in jail. According to PTI spokesperson, Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari, the party had an early lead in 114 out of 270 constituencies, giving it a significant majority over other parties. However, he voiced concerns of rigging and alleged that the vote counting in some places had \u201cslowed or stopped entirely to change results\u201d. Other candidates told the Guardian that the polling agents had been stopped from collecting votes from the polling stations. Many analysts had seen the election as a foregone conclusion for the return of three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party after he allegedly struck a deal with the military \u2013 widely seen as the power brokers of Pakistan \u2013 and had their tacit backing to return to power. Sources told the Guardian that Sharif had already written his victory speech, which he had been due to give at the party headquarters in Lahore at 7pm, but it was cancelled as the initial results began to come in. The military had also done everything to sideline Khan and his PTI party from politics in what many saw as a clear bid to keep them from returning to power, after Khan had a dramatic fallout with senior army leaders and was toppled from power in 2022. Khan has been in jail since August and was unable to contest the election. Last week he was given three separate court sentences that would put him behind bars for more than a decade in cases he alleged were politically motivated. His PTI party was subjected to a lengthy crackdown in the run-up to the vote, preventing its candidates from being able to contest freely. PTI leaders had alleged that the suspension of mobile services was an attempt to prevent high voter turnout, which was widely seen to benefit PTI. Given the strength of the military\u2019s campaign against Khan, few had expected his party to be allowed to return to power as a result of Thursday\u2019s election. Nonetheless, in polling stations across Islamabad, the mood was overwhelmingly for PTI and Khan, despite his incarceration. Feroza Rasheed Qureshi, 73, said she could barely walk but had forced her children to carry her to the polling station so she could vote for PTI. \u201cWe are tired of Sharifs and Bhuttos,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happened to Imran Khan was very wrong, the army is behind the fake cases against him and crackdown on his party.\u201d More than 128 million people were registered to vote, including 20 million first-time voters who widely appeared to throw their support behind Khan, even as they expressed doubts that the election would be free or fair. \u201cMy whole generation is standing with Imran Khan and supporting him,\u201d said Areesha Khan, 19. \u201cMaybe the result is already decided but we still have be to optimistic that our vote will count and things will change.\u201d The security situation in the country remained precarious as elections took place. More than 650,000 security personnel were deployed across Pakistan on election day, with particularly large numbers in the provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which have been the worst hit by rising militant attacks. On Thursday, five police officers died in a bomb blast in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and one person was killed when gunmen opened fire on a security forces vehicle in Tank, about 25 miles to the north. In Balochistan, a soldier from a civilian force was killed and 10 others injured in more than a dozen blasts caused by grenades or improvised explosive devices, officials said, while two children died in a blast outside a women\u2019s polling station."

            "date": "2024-02-29T22:00:37Z",
            "content": "The polls have closed in the Rochdale byelection after a chaotic race that dominated headlines, driven by conversations around the Israel-Gaza conflict. The favourite to win is the former Labour MP George Galloway, standing as the candidate for the Workers Party of Britain. He has also been a Respect party MP, and a Rochdale win would mean a fourth seat in parliament for Galloway since 1987. He has positioned himself as a pro-Palestinian voice, hoping to gain the support of thousands of disaffected Muslim voters. Labour\u2019s divisive stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict has led much of Rochdale\u2019s 30% Muslim population to withdraw their support for the party. Labour withdrew its backing for its candidate, Azhar Ali, over an inflammatory comment about Israel, but under electoral law it was not able to replace him. The byelection was called after the death of Labour\u2019s Tony Lloyd from leukaemia on 17 January. The ensuing campaign became one of chaos, with two candidates having support withdrawn from their respective parties. Ali was an adviser to the last Labour government on anti-extremism for the Home Office from 2005 to 2010. In a leaked audio recording, he was heard claiming to Labour members that Israel \u201cdeliberately took the security off\u201d to knowingly allow the 7 October attack to happen to \u201cgive them the green light to do whatever they bloody want\u201d. He apologised and called his comments \u201cdeeply offensive, ignorant and false\u201d, but the party withdrew its support on 12 February. Labour, which has held Rochdale as a safe seat since 2010, hopes enough of its supporters still voted for the party to block a Galloway victory, with Ali still appearing on the ballot. But the bookies suggest Galloway is in prime position to win the seat. He has previously won seats from Labour in Bethnal Green and Bow in 2005 and Bradford West in 2012. The Liberal Democrats and Conservative party are not expected to pose a serious threat. Simon Danczuk, who was Rochdale\u2019s Labour MP from 2010 to 2017, stood in this byelection for Reform UK, the anti-immigration party founded by Nigel Farage. Guy Otten, who was standing for the Green party, decided to pull out of the race for the seat over Islamophobic tweets. A Green party spokesperson said: \u201cAs nominations have now closed, his name will still appear on the ballot. However, he will not take part in any campaigning between now and polling day.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-15T07:00:02Z",
            "content": "Polls have opened in the Wellingborough and Kingswood byelections, seen as a final chance for Rishi Sunak to buck predictions that his party is heading for a landslide defeat at the next general election. The Conservatives are defending majorities of more than 18,000 in Wellingborough in Northants and 11,000 in Kingswood in South Gloucestershire. But Labour is expected to win both contests. The party has pulled off a string of byelection victories, gaining four Tory seats in a row since July. The byelection in Wellingborough was called after Peter Bone was successfully recalled by voters in the constituency in December. The parliamentary watchdog found he had broken the MPs\u2019 code of conduct on four counts of bullying and one of sexual misconduct. The panel upheld an earlier report that found he had repeatedly hit and verbally abused a member of his staff, asked him for massages and on one occasion put his bare genitals in the other man\u2019s face. Bone\u2019s partner, Helen Harrison, was selected as the Conservative candidate for the byelection. In Kingswood, a byelection was called after Chris Skidmore, a leading Tory voice on green issues, resigned in protest against the government\u2019s bill to allow new oil and gas licences to be issued. The byelections come at a testing time for both main parties. Keir Starmer has had one of his most challenging weeks since becoming leader after two parliamentary candidates were suspended over comments relating to Israel. On Wednesday, a Savanta poll saw Labour\u2019s lead over the Conservatives fall by seven points to its lowest level since June. Sunak came under fire last week for agreeing to a \u00a31,000 bet \u2013 later rowed back on \u2013 with Piers Morgan on whether deportation flights to Rwanda will take off before the general election. He then drew widespread condemnation for deriding Labour\u2019s policy on transgender rights at PMQs after being told that the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey was watching from the public gallery. The selection of Harrison as the Conservative candidate in Wellingborough has been a source of controversy. High-profile Tory MPs have been absent in the constituency and not a single frontbencher has endorsed Harrison. Last month, Sunak dodged the opportunity to endorse her after he was asked whether he was \u201cproud\u201d she was selected, given her connection to Bone. He said that it was up to local members to choose a candidate. The Sunday Times reported that Bone had threatened to stand as an independent if the Tories did not include Harrison on their shortlist of candidates. Bone denied the report but said it would be \u201centirely unsurprising\u201d if Harrison was selected. Both Labour byelection candidates are former London councillors. Gen Kitchen, running in Wellingborough, grew up in Northamptonshire and she went on to be a councillor in Newham, east London. Damien Egan, the candidate in Kingswood, grew up in the constituency. He resigned as the mayor of Lewisham in south-east London last month. The Tory candidate in Kingswood, Sam Bromiley, leads the party\u2019s group on South Gloucestershire council. Bromiley said his experience as a youth worker would help him tackle crime among young people, promised to stop the Labour-led local council from \u201chacking into the greenbelt\u201d and said he would work to regenerate the high street. A win for Labour would temper fears that a tough week for the party has significantly threatened its electoral prospects. A win for the Conservatives could give Sunak a lifeline and stave off any long-shot attempts by backbenchers on the right of the party to replace him before the general election."

            "date": "2024-02-29T12:00:16Z",
            "content": "Understanding the war in Gaza and the myriad political and historical currents that have shaped this part of the world could take a lifetime. As the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent, it is my job to try and convey the complexities of the region in news stories. It is always worth digging deeper, however, and while there are hundreds of books that offer insights into Israel and Palestine\u2019s past and present, these are some of my favourites. Both the nonfiction and novels I\u2019ve chosen are deeply human, centring the experiences of the people living here and how and why they can feel so differently about the same issues and events. *** Out of It by Selma Dabbagh I always find it difficult to describe what Gaza is like, and I think a lot of reportage struggles to convey the reality of life there, too. It\u2019s hard to get the claustrophobia of siege across to an audience. This debut novel from British Palestinian Selma Dabbagh, set in Gaza City during the second intifada in the 00s, does that well. Dabbagh is gentle in her treatment of the Mujahed family, chronicling their hopes and dreams as well as their suffering. *** Rise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel\u2019s Targeted Assassinations by Ronen Bergman The Talmud says: \u201cIf someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.\u201d In his 2018 history of the Mossad spy agency, the New York Times journalist Ronen Bergman looks at Israel\u2019s assassinations \u2013 a long hitlist that has included Nazis, Iranian nuclear scientists and Palestinian leaders \u2013 as well as those wrongly targeted and innocent bystanders. Some are killed with poisoned toothpaste, others in drone attacks. Rise and Kill First is a breathtaking read based on hundreds of interviews with members of Israel\u2019s intelligence services, raising many questions about ethics and strategy along the way. *** Return to Haifa by Ghassan Kanafani Ghassan Kanafani, a politician and author from Acre, was one of the aforementioned targets, assassinated by the Mossad with a car bomb in Beirut in 1972. He wrote four novels before he died aged 36, the last of which was Return to Haifa, about a Palestinian couple who are forced to abandon their baby son after the creation of Israel in 1948 and learn that he was adopted by an Israeli couple, raised Jewish and is now an Israeli soldier. It\u2019s more mature than Kanafani\u2019s earlier writings about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; his Israeli characters are fully fleshed out and also recognised as victims of dispossession. *** Apples from the Desert by Savyon Liebrecht This is a collection of short stories about Israeli women, published in 1998, when hope for the Oslo accords peace process was still alive. Liebrecht\u2019s characters come from different ethnic backgrounds and walks of society, but a common thread between them is the horror of the Holocaust, which stalks their pasts and has an impact on the kind of country Israel is. Liebrecht explores what it means to be Jewish, and Israeli, and to live alongside the Palestinian people. I have no idea why her work isn\u2019t as famous as that of Amos Oz, Israel\u2019s most respected national writer; she is every bit as good. *** The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine by Rashid Khalidi Not everyone will agree with Rashid Khalidi\u2019s settler-colonialist analysis of the Israeli-Palestinian issue, but he powerfully lays out the current asymmetry of the conflict, decades of bad faith negotiations by Britain, the US and Israel, and the many failings of the Palestinian leadership that have led us to the dark present moment. There are precious few English-language histories of Palestine, and this is the latest, drawing on Khalidi\u2019s family archives and experiences as an activist and peace negotiator. This cogent and compelling Palestinian perspective is long overdue."

            "date": "2024-02-20T05:23:39Z",
            "content": "Authorities in Papua New Guinea are bracing for an escalation of violence after dozens of men were killed in a tribal massacre on Sunday. In the wake of the killings, the prime minister, James Marape, is facing calls to declare a state of emergency to address the ongoing fighting. At least 54 people were killed in an ambush between tribes in the remote Akom village in Enga province on Sunday, the police mobile squad and Papua New Guinea defence force said. Authorities have revised estimates for the total number of deaths several times in the days since the tragedy. The bodies were recovered by locals and police officers, and graphic images circulated showing corpses piled up on a truck. Police and security officials in Enga said the incident marks the worst massacre in months. \u201cSome dead bodies are still in the bushes, and some are yet to be retrieved,\u201d security personnel in Enga said on Tuesday. Marape said the massacre was an act of \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d. Marape said the national executive council will meet this week to determine what measures will be taken to address the situation, which may include declaring a state of emergency for the region. He said Papua New Guinea would also seek \u201chelp from Australia to support our police, at the administration level, to lead and to guide, whilst our local police will be deployed to the frontlines with the support of soldiers\u201d. Marape said legislation would be introduced to \u201cstrengthen the law enforcement capacity of security forces to intervene to acts of domestic terrorism, and that will also protect our police and defence personnel.\u201d Police commissioner David Manning said security forces have begun \u201ctargeted operations\u201d in Enga to restore law and order. He said security officers had been told to \u201cuse any level of force required to prevent further violence and payback. This includes the use of up to deadly force. \u201cWith the increased number of illegal firearms, tougher measures are also required to bring in domestic terrorists, including firearms smugglers, and those who fund firearms and ammunitions, to justice,\u201d Manning said in a statement. While tribal fighting is not unusual in parts of Papua New Guinea, violence has escalated in Enga over the past year. A member of parliament from Enga, Miki Kaeok, has called on the national government to declare a state of emergency in the province. Kaeok said he is concerned about the increasing sophistication of tribal fighting in his electorate that is now spreading into nearby regions. He said tribal violence has advanced into a guerilla-type of warfare \u2013 largely due to the influx of weapons \u2013 with parties from across the province directly involved. \u201cThe ongoing tribal fighting in my district has spilled over into [neighbouring] Wabag district with gunmen from all parts of the province taking part. We cannot allow this to continue,\u201d Kaeok said. Kaeok said hired gunmen from other parts of the province were being engaged to take part in fighting, which he said was supported by \u201cleaders and educated elites\u201d from warring factions. He called on the police commissioner to investigate those involved in supplying arms and ammunition. \u201cHundreds of lives have been lost. Properties worth millions of kina have been ransacked and destroyed. I don\u2019t want this to continue. It must stop now,\u201d he said.

            "date": "2024-02-08T19:47:00Z",
            "content": "The US military presence in Iraq has become a \u201cfactor for instability\u201d and must be ended, the Iraqi military has said, as it responded angrily to a US drone strike on a car in Baghdad that killed three members of the powerful Kataib Hezbollah militia. Yehia Rasool, the spokesperson for the commander of the military forces, accused the US of conducting \u201ca blatant assassination through an airstrike in the heart of a residential neighbourhood in the capital, Baghdad, showing no regard for civilian lives or international laws. \u201cBy this act, the American forces jeopardise civil peace, violate Iraqi sovereignty, and disregard the safety and lives of our citizens.\u201d Claiming the US mission deviates increasingly from its stated objectives in Iraq, he said: \u201cThis trajectory compels the Iraqi government more than ever to terminate the mission of this coalition, which has become a factor for instability and threatens to entangle Iraq in the cycle of conflict.\u201d The US is already in talks with Iraqi officials about their continued presence, but the attack in Baghdad, undertaken without any prior consultation, is going to make those talks even more fraught. Qasim al-Araji, Iraq\u2019s national security adviser, said the attack was \u201ca cowardly and reprehensible act, targeting Iraqi sovereignty\u201d. He said: \u201cThe Iraqi government has a clear and explicit decision to end the mission of the international coalition in Iraq.\u201d Inside Iraq\u2019s fissiparous parliament the calls were already intensifying for an unambiguous withdrawal date to be set. The strike on Wednesday came on a main thoroughfare in the Mashtal neighbourhood in eastern Baghdad. The US said it had targeted and killed a Kataib Hezbollah commander responsible for the 27 January attack on a US base on the Jordan-Syrian border that led to the death of three US soldiers, and injury to dozens. One of the three killed was Wissam Mohammed \u201cAbu Bakr\u201d al-Saadi, the commander in charge of Kataib Hezbollah\u2019s drone operations in Syria, and so the likely mastermind of the 27 January attack. A large crowd gathered in eastern Baghdad for his funeral. Shia clerics, and at least one Sunni, as well as tribal leaders and fighters in a variety of military uniforms, listened to speakers who climbed into the back of a pickup truckto give eulogies in honour of the slain commander. \u201cAbu Bakr represents a new generation of resistance fighters \u2026 since 2003, he has conducted hundreds of operations, killing scores of Americans both in Iraq and Syria,\u201d said one senior leader of Kataib Hezbollah. US military bases have been under sporadic assault from Iranian-backed militia for years, but the pace of those attacks increased after 7 October with the Hamas killing of hundreds of Israelis. It is estimated that US and allied troops have been attacked more than 165 times since the outbreak of the war in Gaza. Last week the US, deploying American B-1 bombers, fired at 85 Iranian backed militia sites in Syria and Iraq reportedly killing 40 people. At the time the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said \u201cthis is the start of our response\u201d. On Tuesday Israel struck the Shuyrat airbase and several locations on the outskirts of Homs, Syria. In a statement, US Central Command claimed responsibility for the Baghdad killing and said there were \u201cno indications of collateral damage or civilian casualties at this time\u201d. Centcom said: \u201cThe United States will continue to take necessary action to protect our people. We will not hesitate to hold responsible all those who threaten our forces\u2019 safety.\u201d Muhammad Karim Mohammad Karim al-Beldawi of the Coordination Framework, the Shia leadership coalition that oversees Iraqi political factions linked to Iran-backed militias, said: \u201cThe American attacks do not need condemnations, positions, and statements any more.\u201d He pointed out that \u201cthere are supposed to be measures by governmental and parliamentary committees to end the foreign presence in Iraq\u201d. Kataib Hezbollah acknowledged the US strike and said: \u201cThis calls for steadfastness on the path of jihad,\u201d which often refers to armed struggle. Last week, seemingly under pressure from Iran, it had announced a ceasefire. Two other members of the Islamic Resistance of Iraq called for retaliation. The Harakat al-Nujaba movement said: \u201cOur response will be decisive, and these crimes will not go unpunished. Let this be our path and our foremost cause from now on and onwards.\u201d The leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq called for the \u201cimmediate withdrawal\u201d of US-led coalition forces in Iraq. \u201cIt is clear that denunciations and condemnations are no longer sufficient, which necessitates the need for Iraq to submit an official request to the UN security council, demanding the immediate withdrawal of foreign forces,\u201d Qais al-Khazali, the secretary-general of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, said on X. Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, has declared a state-wide mourning to honour the victims of the armed forces and civilians, denouncing Washington\u2019s \u201cviolation of Iraq\u2019s sovereignty\u201d. The US strike in the middle of the capital, as opposed to relatively remote militia ammunition depots in Syria, is likely to be seen as the most brazen incursion of Iraqi sovereignty since Donald Trump in January 2020 sanctioned the Baghdad assassination of the head of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, Qassem Suleimani, and the Kataib Hezbollah leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The issue will be whether the attacks weaken the militia or instead spur them into a new phase in which they attempt to attack US bases elsewhere, including in Kuwait and Jordan. A crowd gathered on Wednesday as emergency response teams picked through the wreckage. Security forces closed off the heavily guarded \u201cgreen zone\u201d, where a number of diplomatic compounds are located, amid calls for protesters to storm the US embassy. Not all of Iraq\u2019s numerous militia groups back attacks on the US. Within Iraq, the Kurdish and Sunni group wanted to retain the US presence believing it acts as a ballast against further Iranian influence that has grown since the US invasion in 2003. The Kurdistan regional government for instance repeatedly criticises Sudani\u2019s administration as ineffectual and complicit in funding and arming outlawed groups."

            "date": "2024-02-10T11:00:40Z",
            "content": "The United States has for decades formally supported a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East. But through many failed rounds of talks, dashed hopes, political volatility and violence in the region, talk of establishing Palestine and Israel as neighbors in a secure peace has looked, to many, increasingly like lip service. But in recent weeks, there have been signs of a shift in messaging from the Biden administration. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: What is the current US position? Just weeks before Hamas launched its 7 October surprise attacks on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostage, the US had been trying to broker a historic deal to normalize relations between longtime adversaries Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Biden administration, gunning for a major foreign policy achievement before the 2024 presidential elections, had hoped to strike an agreement in which Saudi Arabia would establish formal relations with the Jewish state in return for a defense pact with the US. Saudi Arabia was also seeking Washington\u2019s aid in developing a civilian nuclear program and progress toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Talks were shelved by Riyadh in October over Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, which has so far killed more than 27,000 Palestinians. They have since resumed but Saudi Arabia now insists Israel must first end the war in Gaza and put Palestinians on a path toward statehood. The US, UK and Israel, unlike nearly 140 other UN member states, have not formally recognized Palestine. The US has long stressed that Palestinian statehood should be achieved through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which oversees parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, while Hamas controls Gaza. Earlier this month, however, the state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, told reporters that the US was \u201cactively pursuing the establishment of an independent Palestinian state\u201d after the war in Gaza. His remarks came amid reports that the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has asked the state department to conduct a review and present policy options on possible future recognition of a Palestinian state. But Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said he doubted the US would actually invest a lot of manpower or resources in that goal on its own. \u201cThey\u2019re more interested in stabilizing and rebuilding Gaza but also Saudi-Israel normalization,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the big prize that they\u2019re chasing. For them to achieve that, they have to look more serious about a Palestinian state.\u201d Blinken is on his fifth visit to the Middle East since 7 October The US secretary of state returned to Israel on Wednesday. At the top of his agenda is advancing a new ceasefire and hostage-release deal between Israel and Hamas, while at the same time pushing for a larger postwar settlement in which Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel in return for a \u201cclear, credible, time-bound path to the establishment of a Palestinian state\u201d. Blinken has said that Washington would use any pause in fighting to build out plans for the reconstruction and future governance of Gaza, as well as a wider regional peace agreement. What are the main obstacles? Netanyahu has dismissed US calls for a path to a Palestinian state, insisting that he would not \u201ccompromise on full Israeli security control over all territory west of the Jordan River\u201d. The Israeli prime minster, who has boasted that he was instrumental in preventing Palestinian statehood, is trying to cling to power and elude the threat of prison by appeasing the far-right members of his coalition government. Shortly after meeting Blinken on Wednesday, Netanyahu rejected the latest Gaza ceasefire terms proposed by Hamas, and rebuffed US pressure to move more quickly towards a mediated settlement to the war, insisting again that \u201ctotal victory\u201d against Hamas was the only solution. Biden continued to maintain that the creation of an independent state for Palestinians was still possible, claiming that Netanyahu was not opposed to all forms of a two-state solution. Other countries are vital to a two-state process The US is certain to lead any fresh negotiations. Saudi Arabia has told the US that it would not open diplomatic relations with Israel unless it recognizes an independent Palestinian state on 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem, which Israel has unilaterally annexed, as its capital. Israel\u2019s coalition government includes far-right parties who are adamantly opposed to a Palestinian state, and Netanyahu himself blocked progress on the issue for many years. Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, David Cameron, has floated the idea of the UK recognizing a Palestinian state in combination with allies as a means to make the process of negotiating a two-state solution \u201cirreversible\u201d. \u201cIt could be something that we consider as this process, as this advance to a solution, becomes more real,\u201d Cameron said during a visit last week to Lebanon. What hope is there? Aaron David Miller, who served six US secretaries of state as an adviser on Arab-Israeli peace talks, believes the chances of the US unilaterally recognizing the state of Palestine are slim to none, but that talks on establishing Palestinian statehood form part of a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-Israeli normalization deal faces many obstacles, Miller says, but \u201cit\u2019s a serious proposal from the administration, and they\u2019ve actively working on it.\u201d He noted, though, how unlikely Israel was to agree to what Blinken on Tuesday called for: a \u201ctime-bound, irreversible\u201d path to a Palestinian state."

            "content": "The Treasury\u2019s decision to appoint the head of the City regulators\u2019 watchdog has been thrown into controversy after campaigners accused the newly installed commissioner of being unfit because of conflicts of interest. Positive Money is concerned that the financial regulators complaints commissioner, Rachel Kent, could struggle to remain independent, given that she will continue to advise the government and financial services bosses on behalf of the City law firm Hogan Lovells. Kent, who took the commissioner role last month, has given up her position as a partner at Hogan Lovells, but is staying on part-time as a senior consultant on its financial services regulatory team, which advises banks, insurers and investment and wealth managers. Positive Money says this poses a conflict of interest, because she will be responsible for handling complaints, including from City firms, against the sector\u2019s three regulators: the Financial Conduct Authority, the Payment Systems Regulator and the Prudential Regulation Authority. \u201cTasking a lawyer who remains in the employment of a business serving financial firms with judging those same firms\u2019 complaints against regulators, creates a clear conflict of interest,\u201d Fran Boait, co-executive director at Positive Money, said. It is the first time that the government has appointed the commissioner, who until this year had been selected by the trio of regulators. The government gave itself the powers to take over the appointment as part of the wide-ranging Financial Services and Markets Act, passed in the summer. Kent has defended her position, telling Positive Money in a letter last month that she \u201cmade various changes to my arrangements to take proper account of conflicts and the perception of conflicts. I did this in discussion with HM Treasury who appointed me\u201d. She said that in the case of a conflict, the Treasury had the ability to appoint a temporary replacement to deal with select cases. She also stressed that her position at Hogan Lovells was publicly disclosed, and that none of her pay in the role came directly from regulated financial firms. Positive Money said this was splitting hairs, and that ultimately her salary would come from Hogan Lovells\u2019 own clients, which include regulated firms. It also questioned whether this would affect Kent\u2019s ability to reach objective decisions on whether complaints were justified. Kent\u2019s pay at Hogan Lovells is not disclosed but is likely to exceed the salary she earns at the commission, where her predecessor took home \u00a3129,000 last year, according to its latest annual report. Kent also noted in her letter that most of her consulting work at Hogan Lovells would involve advising the \u201cUK government and related entities\u201d. Positive Money said this posed additional conflicts, given that the government had recently given regulators a new responsibility to promote economic growth and international competitiveness. Leading economists and former politicians have said the new \u201cobjective\u201d risks watering down regulation and recreating the conditions that led to the 2008 banking crash. Boait said the potential conflict \u201cwould pile on more pressure for lax regulation and watered-down standards \u2026 with the public paying the price\u201d and called on Kent to resign from her other roles. \u201cEither Kent must drop these conflicts of interest, or the government must find someone else for the job if she is unwilling to do so.\u201d The Treasury said: \u201cRachel is a highly experienced candidate who was appointed through a robust process. As part of her appointment, she has stepped down as a partner at Hogan Lovells and will not benefit from or provide advice to regulated firms while in the role.\u201d The Guardian attempted to contact Kent for comment."

            "title": "US defense secretary Lloyd Austin cancels Nato trip after hospitalization",
            "date": "2024-02-12T19:12:32Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden\u2019s top military adviser, Lloyd Austin, has cancelled a trip to Brussels to meet with Nato counterparts this week, following his hospitalization on Sunday because of an \u201cemergent bladder issue\u201d. A US official told Reuters on Monday that Austin had cancelled a meeting with Nato defense ministers due to be held on Thursday, and a separate meeting with allies for Wednesday on how to continue supporting Ukraine in countering Russia\u2019s invasion. The US defense secretary, who transferred his duties to the deputy secretary of defense, Kathleen Hicks, was admitted to Walter Reed national military medical center. He was then transferred to the critical care unit, according to a Pentagon statement. Austin\u2019s health became a focus of attention in January following treatment for prostate cancer when the 70-year-old general was readmitted to hospital for several days without the apparent knowledge of the White House. Earlier, the Pentagon said that Hicks, the joint chiefs of staff, White House and Congress had been notified about Lloyd\u2019s hospitalization, and that Hicks \u201cis prepared to assume the functions and duties of the secretary of defense, if required. \u201cAt this time, the secretary is retaining the duties and functions of his office,\u201d the statement said, adding that Austin had \u201ctraveled to the hospital with the classified and unclassified communications systems necessary to perform his duties\u201d. In a subsequent statement Maj Gen Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said that Austin, 70, later transferred the duties of his office to his deputy. Sunday\u2019s notification about Austin stands in stark contrast to a previous hospitalization that the defense secretary underwent late last year after he was admitted for complications following prostate cancer surgery. The White House appeared to be unaware of Austin\u2019s earlier hospitalization for three days. In that instance, Austin underwent surgery at Reed hospital on 22 December 2023. He was discharged the following day but returned on 1 January. It was not until 4 January that Hicks, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and then the president were notified of Austin\u2019s diagnosis, treatments or hospitalization. The Pentagon then did not publicly release any notification about Austin\u2019s hospitalization and absence from work until 5 January. That prompted a political backlash, including an investigation by the defense department inspector general. The Pentagon later said the Austin\u2019s chief of staff was sick with the flu, exacerbating the delay in information about the secretary\u2019s medical condition. The national security council spokesperson, John Kirby, said Austin\u2019s participation in national security affairs \u201cwas no different than it would be on any other given day, except that he was briefing the president on options and engaged in the discussions from the hospital\u201d. But the appearance that the links in a crucial chain of command had been compromised during a moment of rising global tensions and US military action against Iran-backed militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen caused significant concern about communications within the administration. Austin reportedly orchestrated and then watched in real time from his hospital room as US retaliatory strikes against Houthi militias were launched ahead of his 15 January discharge. That came after the Senate armed services committee chair, Jack Reed, a Democrat, and his counterpart, the Republican senator Roger Wicker, sent a letter to Austin asking for an accounting of his absences from defense department headquarters. \u201cWe are concerned that critical notification procedures were not followed while you were receiving medical care the past several weeks,\u201d they wrote, adding that their committee \u201chas serious questions about this incident, and members need a full accounting to ensure it never happens again\u201d. Sunday\u2019s statement on Austin did not elaborate to what extent his more recent hospitalization had to do with the previous one. It was announced hours after Biden said he warned Benjamin Netanyahu to not launch an offensive in Rafah without a \u201ccredible\u201d safety plan for more than 1 million Palestinians sheltering there. The Israeli prime minister\u2019s threatened offensive in Rafah comes as the military of Israel \u2013 a key US ally \u2013 has been aiming strikes at Gaza in response to the 7 October attack by Hamas.

            "date": "2024-02-09T15:57:07Z",
            "content": "Stephen Colbert Late-night hosts recapped oral arguments for the US supreme court case on whether or not Colorado can remove Donald Trump from its ballot, citing the constitution\u2019s insurrection clause. \u201cThis is an historic, monumental case,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on Thursday\u2019s Late Show. Such a big deal, in fact, that people lined up for hours ahead of time just to get seats in the viewing gallery. \u201cThough evidently one guy was just in line for an Apple Vision Pro,\u201d Colbert quipped. Arguing the case for Trump is the former Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell, who has a reputation as a tough litigator. As one former colleague told Politico: \u201cHe has a strong conviction for what he thinks the law is.\u201d \u201cActually, not the best compliment you could give,\u201d Colbert mused, comparing it to someone saying, \u201cOh yeah, this guy is a great surgeon. He will definitely remove what he thinks is your appendix.\u201d In their written arguments, Trump\u2019s lawyers pinned their hopes mainly on semantics. For instance, Mitchell claims the insurrection clause of the constitution applies only to people who took an oath \u201cto support the constitution\u201d, but presidents swear an oath to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend\u201d the constitution, without the word \u201csupport\u201d. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not a lawyer, but I wear a suit professionally,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cSo I feel qualified to say that that is dumb. It\u2019s like saying, \u2018honey, I know I swore till death do us part, but we never said whose death. And I personally think me banging my pilates instructor is what Queen Elizabeth would\u2019ve wanted.\u2019\u201d The same lawyers also argued that the 14th amendment says people who engaged in an insurrection cannot \u201chold\u201d office, but does not bar them from running for office. \u201cBut the point of running for office is to hold office!\u201d Colbert exclaimed. \u201cUnless you\u2019re Nikki Haley \u2013 we\u2019re not sure what her point is.\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers also looked into the supreme court\u2019s oral arguments, where it seemed most justices were supportive of Trump and skeptical of the decision to remove him from the ballot in Colorado. \u201cWhich was expected,\u201d said Meyers, \u201cgiven that Trump appointed three of the justices on the court and another three are staunch conservatives like Clarence Thomas, who is somehow still involved in this case despite the fact that his wife Ginni Thomas played a role in the January 6 coup attempt.\u201d Ginni Thomas personally pleaded with electors to switch their votes and texted Trump\u2019s chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows, urging him to overturn the results. \u201cNot only should Clarence Thomas recuse himself from this case, Ginni Thomas should recuse herself from texting on her phone,\u201d Meyers said. As for the hearing itself \u2013 \u201cfor the most part, the court avoided getting into the actual facts of what happened on January 6,\u201d Meyers explained, \u201cand the justices didn\u2019t seem especially interested in litigating the question of whether Trump had actually engaged in an insurrection, although at one point Trump\u2019s lawyer conceded something pretty eye-opening.\u201d That would be that the events of January 6 were violent, criminal and wrong \u2013 \u201cthis was a riot\u201d, said Mitchell. \u201cIt was not an insurrection. The events were shameful, criminal, violent, all of those things, but did not qualify as insurrection.\u201d \u201cSomething tells me Trump isn\u2019t exactly going to be thrilled with that argument,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really fit on a baseball cap \u2013 \u2018shameful, criminal, violent, but still eligible!\u2019\u201d Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel poked holes in Trump\u2019s legal defense. \u201cHere are his two primary lines of defense: number one, it wasn\u2019t an insurrection. And number two, I didn\u2019t cause the insurrection,\u201d he explained. In a speech addressing the hearing, Trump blamed the insurrection attempt on Nancy Pelosi. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Nancy Pelosi cooked up a secret plot to have a bunch of Maga morons break into her office and poop into her desk,\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. Trump also claimed the mob on January 6 stormed the Capitol \u201cpeacefully and patriotically\u201d \u2013 \u201cyes, and then his followers tried to peacefully and patriotically kill the vice-president of the United States,\u201d said Kimmel. In other news, Ted Cruz proposed legislation that would allow lawmakers to get a private security escort and expedited screening at airports. \u201cSounds to me like somebody just booked an all-inclusive snorkel trip to Sandals,\u201d Kimmel laughed. Cruz argued that there are serious security threats facing public officials \u2013 \u201clike people getting photos of you fleeing your state during a major power outage to get some sun on your big old nipples, that kind of stuff\u201d, Kimmel joked. \u201cI think Ted Cruz is worried somebody will get a picture of him taking his shoes off at security and everybody will find out he has hooves. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty great the guy who\u2019s always screaming about people sneaking across the border doesn\u2019t want us to know when he\u2019s sneaking across the border,\u201d he added."

            "content": "Jimmy Kimmel Late-night hosts anticipated potential consequences for Donald Trump\u2019s role in January 6, and also looked ahead to the Super Bowl. One in four Americans \u2013 about 68 million people \u2013 are expected to bet on Sunday\u2019s big game. \u201cAnd when I say bet on the game, I mean bet on Taylor Swift,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday evening. Among the things people can bet on: what color top Swift will wear, whether Travis Kelce will propose and win MVP, and whether or not Swift will be shown eating a hot dog. \u201cLet me say that there is no more important conversation a father can have with his child than sitting them down and explaining that he can\u2019t go to college because Taylor Swift did not eat a hot dog at the Super Bowl in 2024,\u201d Kimmel joked. In political news, a federal appeals court in Washington DC unanimously rejected Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from all criminal charges during his presidency in a scathing 57-page ruling. \u201cIt was a devastating moment for Trump, especially when Melania started clapping,\u201d Kimmel quipped. \u201cOf course, he will now appeal to the supreme court, which is the legal equivalent of \u2018well, I need to speak to your manager,\u2019\u201d he added. It\u2019s unclear if the US supreme court will hear the case; if not, the current ruling stands. And according to a new poll from CNN, a majority of Americans want to see a verdict in the January 6 case before they vote in the election. \u201cYes, it\u2019s vitally important that we find out if the former president did what we all saw him do on television or not,\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. Meanwhile, Trump is pressuring GOP senators to reject a deal on border security that they themselves secured, to help his campaign chances. \u201cBasically, he wants chaos at the border so that come election time, he can be the only one who can stop it,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going along with it, which is crazy. \u201cMost of the Republicans like this but Trump didn\u2019t, so now they\u2019re trying to kill it,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s like Mike Pence all over again.\u201d Stephen Colbert \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of suspense in the primaries this year,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show. \u201cBut there was big news today from the one voting bloc who could sway the 2024 election: federal judges.\u201d He referred to the DC appeals court\u2019s rejection of Trump\u2019s immunity claim. \u201cThe law applies to everyone!\u201d Colbert chanted. \u201cLowest bar! Lowest bar! \u201cSo it\u2019s official: former presidents are not immune from prosecution,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, that should be obvious, but it\u2019s never actually been tested in court because no former president until Trump has been indicted.\u201d The judges \u201cquickly pointed out the stupid in Trump\u2019s idiocy\u201d. Colbert said, quoting the opinion: \u201cIt would be a striking paradox if the President, who alone is vested with the constitutional duty to \u2018take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u2019, were the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity.\u201d \u201cYes! That\u2019s why the Ten Commandments don\u2019t read \u2018Thou shalt not commit adultery. Except for Moses, who gets a heavenly hall pass to part that sea, if y\u2019know what I\u2019m saying,\u2019\u201d Colbert joked. Seth Meyers And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also addressed the failure of Trump\u2019s immunity strategy for his role in January 6. \u201cOK, so he doesn\u2019t have immunity. But after all these trials, he must have built up some antibodies,\u201d Meyers joked. Speaking about the doomed immigration bill, Biden said Republican lawmakers needed to ask themselves: \u201cWho do they serve: Donald Trump, or the American people?\u201d \u201cAnd Republican lawmakers said they\u2019ll get back to him on that, they just have to make a quick phone call,\u201d Meyers quipped. In other news, the former Trump communications director Anthony Scaramucci said if Trump pays $370m in penalties for his New York civil fraud trial, he may be forced to liquidate assets and take on loans. \u201cWhich would be crazy, because Trump hasn\u2019t had to do that since the 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s, 2020s and a few times last week,\u201d Meyers deadpanned. And the Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said she requested Secret Service protection, \u201cbecause then at least there will be a couple of people at her rallies\u201d, said Meyers."

            "date": "2024-02-18T13:00:44Z",
            "content": "For Clint Hickman, an official who helped lead Arizona\u2019s largest county through some of the most difficult moments of the pandemic and the 2020 election, the current moment in American life feels like the right one to quit. Amid yet more tumult and tense division in American public life, the Maricopa county supervisor announced this week that he\u2019s not running again, choosing instead to prioritize his family \u2013 and get rid of the endless harassment that\u2019s been a feature of his job the last few years and put him more than once in the national spotlight. \u201cAfter the election in 2020, it\u2019s gotten worse and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to feel like all I get to do is play defense in this job any more \u2026 I thought I was looking way too much in the rearview mirror.\u201d Hickman, a Republican, voted to certify Maricopa\u2019s elections in 2020 despite an aggressive campaign from former president Donald Trump and his allies to reject the results and throw the state toward the Republican candidate over Joe Biden, the Democrat who narrowly won there. The threats arrived at Hickman\u2019s door at one point, with people protesting outside his home while his wife and three kids, now teenagers, were there. \u201cThis is poor behavior brought to my doorstep, and I would like to think it hasn\u2019t impacted my kids,\u201d he said. Hickman, just shy of 60 years old, said his upcoming milestone birthday made him reflect on what he wants out of life now, and that\u2019s more time with his family. But the threats he faced at work and the punishing environment in his role as a supervisor played a role in his decision to exit. He faced credible death threats, one of which resulted in a two and a half year prison sentence for an Iowa man. The threats amped up both in response to elections and in response to the county\u2019s decision to institute a mask mandate during the pandemic, a fault line for conservatives in the purpling county. \u201cThose [threats] didn\u2019t just arrive to myself. It arrived to county workers, county elections workers, people in the county clerk\u2019s office. During the pandemic, people were making threats to anybody wearing Maricopa county badge when it came to the mask mandate.\u201d He\u2019s still receptive to the idea of running for office someday again, but for now, he wants to get his kids away from the vitriol he\u2019s faced. Hickman\u2019s family is one of the Phoenix area\u2019s biggest business families, running a giant egg farming operation. For now, it\u2019s back to the eggs for Hickman. Maricopa county became a national flashpoint in 2020, then again in 2022. Errors like printing problems or the use of certain pens became the subject of endless speculation and conspiracies that still linger today. And 2024 will undoubtedly bring more, as the county is a critical piece of a swing state, one that both Trump and Biden will want to win to complete their electoral map. Part of his effort to move forward is getting out of the race to remain in office. He doesn\u2019t want his name on the ballot this year, that way \u201cno one can say that I have my thumb on an election that I\u2019m going to rig for either myself or my friends\u201d. The seat could, theoretically, go to someone who wouldn\u2019t uphold the county\u2019s elections \u2013 that\u2019s up to the district\u2019s voters, he said. He doesn\u2019t think they\u2019d go for it, but the seat belongs to the citizens there, not him. He joins a too-long line of public servants who have left their roles in the face of ongoing harassment over elections. A study of 11 states in the US west, including Arizona, by Issue One showed that more than 160 chief local election officials had left their roles since the 2020 election, leaving half of the 76 million Americans living in those states with a new top election official. Hickman called it \u201cshocking\u201d to see elections officials run out of their jobs, often whipped up by misunderstandings and distortions. \u201cIt is saddening to see so much of a brain drain in this space leaving due to harassment techniques by people that want to do people harm,\u201d he said. He\u2019s one of few officials who have seen the person who threatened them prosecuted. Mark Rissi, of Iowa, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison over threats he made to Hickman and to the state\u2019s attorney general. In the voicemail Rissi left for Hickman in September 2021, he said he was going to \u201clynch\u201d the supervisor. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna die, you piece of [expletive]. We\u2019re going to hang you. We\u2019re going to hang you.\u201d At the sentencing hearing, Hickman testified \u2013 and Rissi didn\u2019t even recognize him, Hickman said. Rissi was supposed to enter prison on 8 January, but has so far delayed his sentence because of health issues. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the day I can stop looking over my shoulder for this guy,\u201d Hickman said. Hickman said he isn\u2019t sure what to do to address this kind of threatening behavior and how to stop it. Catching the people making threats and holding them accountable is part of it, but there seems to be a lot more going on \u2013 maybe the pandemic, maybe the people running for office \u2013 driving more people to conflict and chaos, he said. \u201cI can certainly play the blame game all day long,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need some solutions. And I don\u2019t know what those solutions are at this short moment. How about this? Maybe everybody needs to start watching Mr Rogers again and start treating people nicer.\u201d"

            "content": "The chancellor should axe the annual spring budget and autumn statement in order to provide greater certainty for Britain\u2019s manufacturing industry, according to the main trade body representing the sector. The head of Make UK is calling for the twice-yearly fiscal events to be dropped as part of a package of calls for the government to overhaul its policies on taxing and spending. Its chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said on Tuesday that Jeremy Hunt\u2019s budget next week should be the last fiscal statement by a chancellor, and that future governments instead should set out their tax and spend policies once, at the start of parliament. Speaking at the Make UK National Manufacturing Conference in London, Phipson said: \u201cIf I were to ask [Hunt] to do one thing next week in the budget, it is to announce that, from now on, there will be no annual fiscal statements, let alone two a year. The trade body boss added that the axing of these events should only be reversed in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, arguing that the changes would provide greater stability for companies, which have experienced 26 changes to corporation tax since 2019. The call is one of several put forward, alongside a call for a manufacturing industrial strategy that would increase the country\u2019s manufacturing output from 10% of GDP to 15%. Make UK argues that this would add \u00a3150bn to economic output. In recent years, it has become commonplace for both a spring budget and autumn statement to take place annually. However, Make UK, which represents 20,000 manufacturers, argues that having these events, which can introduce significant changes to tax policy, harms investment. A recent survey of its members found that 62% felt frequent changes in policy incentives had made it more challenging to plan business investments over the past three years. Phipson acknowledged that axing both fiscal events would be radical, but argued that \u201cinsanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result\u201d. He said: \u201cWe have had six plans for growth in little over a decade, while the department responsible for industry has been reorganised five times in the same period. Any of you running businesses this way would have gone bankrupt.\u201d Under the proposals, there would be no changes to investment allowances, corporation tax or green targets for five years. The Institute for Government has repeatedly called for a reduction in the number of fiscal events, saying that the current form led to \u201cad-hoc tinkering\u201d with the tax system, and added uncertainty to the wider structure. Phipson\u2019s other requests are for the government to match other major economies like the US, China and Germany and come up with a national industrial plan. This plan would include driving manufacturing output to 15% of GDP. He said: \u201cSome may see this ambition as fanciful but, as globalisation shifts, why not aim to produce more here so we are less dependent on others for everything, from our food to our energy and security?\u201d The body is also urging the government to significantly increase defence spending to ensure that a minimum of 2% of all government spending is ringfenced around that area. On infrastructure, Make UK believes that the country needs to rip up the expensive and cumbersome planning system and replace it with a fast track for projects of strategic national importance. Phipson also called for a change to the fiscal rules that he argues are preventing investment in capital spending. If the chancellor rejects such a change, Make UK proposes splitting the Treasury into a ministry for finance and a ministry for the economy."

A naval press officer hovers a few feet away. \u201cThis is where they are,\u201d Jones continues. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Twitch or YouTube or Facebook Gaming, this is what they love.\u201d His esports team \u2013 navy personnel who compete with gamers online under the name Goats &amp; Glory \u2013 consists of 12 enlisted sailors who used to work as flight officers, sonar techs and even a chaplain\u2019s assistant. A navy recruiting command spokesperson says the navy allocates 3%-5% of its marketing budget to esports initiatives annually. That amounted to up to $4.3m from Oct 2022 through Sept 2023, according to budget information obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Since 2018, the US military has been ramping up its use of gaming to recruit more people, at a critical time when the US armed forces face the worst recruitment struggle since becoming an all-volunteer force after the Vietnam war. Targeting gamers makes sense from the military\u2019s perspective, as it gives them access to the young, tech-savvy population they want joining up. But some veterans told me that marketing the military with video games \u2013 essentially making a game out of war \u2013 is unethical. Of primary concern is just how young the military\u2019s gaming audience is. Online gaming spaces are popular with minors, many of them not yet 13 years old, and the military deliberately capitalizes on games that appeal to them. If the military\u2019s recruiting efforts are successful, these kids and teens will end up applying the skills they honed while playing games they love to warfare \u2013 piloting drones to kill from afar, for example. One young gamer I spoke to, Katie K, age 12, spends hours a day watching livestreams of people playing warlike games on YouTube and TikTok Live. The thought of fighting for her country intrigues her. She thinks it would teach her better discipline. Also: \u201cI would think about all the people that would thank me \u2013 like, that would be pretty cool.\u201d The reality is starkly different. \u201cI was in a country fighting a population that lives on less than $1 a day with gigantic weapons and armored vehicles,\u201d says a former US army intelligence analyst, Jeremiah Knowles, \u201cand if I\u2019m patrolling in Afghanistan with my assault rifle and a kid gets too close \u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s not what they put in the advertisements. That\u2019s not what they talk about on their Twitch streams.\u201d The military is gaming online \u2013 and in schools In the late 1990s, the military was struggling to meet recruitment goals, prompting the army to release its own video game aimed at younger people. \u201cWhen a kid starts thinking about what he\u2019s going to do with his life, it\u2019s not at age 17, it\u2019s more like age 13,\u201d a colonel who oversaw the project told Corey Mead, author of War Play: Video Games and the Future of Armed Conflict. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait until they\u2019re 17, because by then they will have decided that they\u2019re going to college or to a trade school.\u201d The resulting game, America\u2019s Army, was hugely successful. According to Mead, the relationship between the military and the games industry remains \u201csymbiotic\u201d, with the military loaning resources to game developers in exchange for the insertion of pro-military narratives. In 2018, the army formed the first military esports team but was accused of unethical recruitment practices in its Twitch stream, including censoring questions about war crimes in its chat and holding a fake Xbox controller giveaway. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proposed a ban on Twitch recruitment that did not pass. The army stopped streaming on Twitch, but gaming recruitment continued. These days, the US military\u2019s gaming content sprawls across Twitch, YouTube, Instagram and Discord. The army and navy esports teams host tournaments for some of the most popular games among young people, including Fortnite and Valorant. The air force and coast guard formed esports teams of their own, while US Marine Corps recruitment has partnered with gaming influencers including TheWarOwl and Melonie Mac. Young gamers who I interviewed report being targeted with recruitment ads that mirror the graphics of their favorite games. \u201cLast year, we had over a million impressions on Twitch,\u201d says Joshua Silva, religions program specialist with the navy esports team. Internet users are supposed to be at least 13 to use social media sites such as Twitch and YouTube; users under 18 are supposed to have parental permission. But such age limitations are easy to bypass. Plenty of 13-year-olds in the online gaming community are starting to form opinions of the US military. Kaitlynn Considine, a former marine linguist, gives her 13-year-old brother as an example. \u201cHe is a very young child. His brain isn\u2019t fully developed,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat he knows about the military is his older sister went and did that, and he has pictures of me in front of equipment that he thinks is super cool.\u201d Considine is a member of the anti-video-game-recruitment initiative of Veterans for Peace, called Gamers for Peace. She says she would worry if her brother were to watch a military Twitch stream or military-sponsored content from a favorite influencer, or be targeted by a recruiting ad. She acknowledges that the military must advertise itself, just as military service is sometimes the best (or only) option for young adults. \u201cI can\u2019t tell someone that they can\u2019t join, especially if you\u2019re in a precarious financial situation. But people need to be able to understand what they\u2019re getting into,\u201d she says. \u201cNo matter what your job is, you are supposed to help the military kill. You might not ever pull a trigger, but you\u2019re still part of that mission.\u201d Most members of Gamers for Peace are anti-war veterans in their 30s and 40s and lifelong gamers. They understand both the influence that video games can have on young people and the gravity of what it\u2019s like to serve in the armed forces. \u201cAs a person who played a lot of video games as a kid, it kind of pissed me off,\u201d says one member, Jeff Parente, a US Marine Corps veteran with three deployments. \u201cThere are a lot of younger kids that watch Twitch to watch other people play video games, and to think [the military is] going into that space to go after these kids that don\u2019t know any better \u2026\u201d Officially, the military does not recruit anyone under age 17. In this case, \u201crecruit\u201d means the formal process of signing a legally binding agreement to enlist. The military does, however, advertise to and interact directly with minors for the purposes of military recruitment. Katie, the 12-year-old, has watched gaming streams from military accounts \u201conce or twice\u201d, though she has not yet seen recruitment ads. She likes playing first-person shooters like Call of Duty, which let players experience combat through their characters\u2019 eyes: \u201cIt\u2019s, like, pretty fun to shoot things,\u201d she says. She acknowledges that compared with real warfare, Call of Duty is probably not \u201c100% realistic\u201d, but she adds: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you use real guns like how they actually are, and the healing is pretty realistic.\u201d Choosing games that draw in young people is part of the military\u2019s recruiting calculation. \u201cShooters are the No 1 genre that I find people playing,\u201d says Silva. His navy esports team also makes a point of playing the racing/sports game Rocket League because it\u2019s \u201cone of the bigger games that universities and high schools play\u201d. And when I visited the Memphis facility, Goats &amp; Glory was hosting a championship for Fortnite, the third-person shooter that is massively popular with kids Katie\u2019s age and young adults \u2013 so popular that it will soon be folded into the Disney/Pixar/Marvel/Star Wars universe. (As it happens, Katie\u2019s favorite Fortnite weapon is the combat SMG, an abbreviation for \u201csub-machine gun\u201d.) In a video posted to Instagram last fall, you can watch a navy esports team member slipping a Meta Quest VR headset on to a child\u2019s head in an elementary school library in Utah. The boy plays with the headset, punching his fists, before images of sea vessels appear in the frame. The graphics read, \u201cUnited States Navy: where gamers thrive\u201d and \u201cPress start to protect!\u201d Military recruiters are allowed to talk to children in schools \u2013 a practice that boomed in the 2000s when the No Child Left Behind Act ensured military access to campuses. In 2008, the ACLU reported to the United Nations that the US military was violating international children\u2019s rights conventions by \u201cheavily recruiting\u201d students under 17 on high school campuses. In response, the state department reiterated the military\u2019s age policy and said recruiters were prohibited from using \u201ccoercive measures or deception\u201d. Meanwhile, the UN expressed its \u201cconcern\u201d and issued \u201crecommendations\u201d for improvement in recruiting practices. Jordan, 20, who asked to use a pseudonym in case he wishes to join the military in the future, remembers when the army came to his high school in Mineola, Texas, in March 2021, when he was a junior. \u201cThey had just like a regular trailer, like the ones we use for band,\u201d he says, \u201cand on the inside, every station had a cubicle where everyone could play a game.\u201d He recalls that the army brought a spinoff of America\u2019s Army called Proving Grounds. \u201cEveryone was excited to play the game \u2013 but not really to join the military.\u201d Sheena Young, an air force veteran with Gamers for Peace, had recruiters come to her high school, too. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t going out and joining conversations. They had their table in the cafeteria. You had to approach them,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen a 12-year-old goes on to watch somebody play Twitch, they\u2019re not approaching a recruiter. They\u2019re in the same space.\u201d And unlike at a high school, there are no other adults around to supervise interactions in online gaming spaces, notes Knowles, also of Gamers for Peace. Knowles is now a licensed social worker at a university, where he primarily works with young adults. \u201cThey follow these streamers, and the amount of influence those personalities have on young adults is pervasive,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen it comes to the military recruiters on Twitch streams, they\u2019re giving them an incomplete view of that world.\u201d By 17, gamers see recruiting tactics Since she was a kid, Amber Cronin has enjoyed watching professional streamers play her favorite games \u2013 like TheWarOwl, a Twitch streamer with 1.46 million followers on YouTube. Cronin, a 21-year-old computer science student, has also logged more than 800 hours on Counter-Strike, a first-person shooter in which players can either fight for a team of terrorists or a unit of military and police forces. When she was 18, Cronin noticed TheWarOwl had released a series of videos in which he trained with the marines for 100 days, matching his gaming skills \u201cagainst the real world battles that marines fight and win for the country\u201d. Then, last school year, the algorithm started feeding her recruitment videos when she scrolled YouTube Shorts. \u201cEven if they\u2019re not directly providing a link to join the army or whatever,\u201d Cronin tells me from her dorm room at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, \u201cthey are trying to appeal to the cool factor of \u2018ooh, we do mid-air refueling\u2019 and \u2018we jump out of planes and shoot guns\u2019.\u201d In March, Cronin was contacted directly by a marine recruiter, who asked if she wanted to attend Officer Candidates School. By the time gamers are old enough to join the military, at 17, they will probably have been exposed to video game recruitment. Bodhi B, 17, says he \u201cgets ads from the military super often on YouTube\u201d \u2013 usually while watching his favorite gaming content. Bodhi and his twin brother, Dashiell, high school seniors from suburban Massachusetts, have played games like Rainbow Six Siege and Counter-Strike since they were 12. \u201cI see the army\u2019s team sponsoring Valorant tournaments or sponsoring teams,\u201d says Dashiell. The military says online gaming spaces provide an opportunity to have meaningful conversations with young people. \u201cA recruiter in high school \u2013 he\u2019s in uniform,\u201d says Jones, the navy esports team captain. \u201cYou see him, you know what he is. When you play against us, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a regular person?\u2019 And we\u2019re like, \u2018Yeah, the navy is regular people. We are just like you \u2013 we have the same hobbies, the same loves.\u2019\u201d The navy emphasizes that its team members are not official \u201crecruiters\u201d. After the army was accused of unethical practices on Twitch, the navy refined its own streaming practices to avoid similar blowback. Jones says the team talks about life in the military while streaming, but members are trained to direct anyone who expresses interest in the navy to a recruiting website, where they can connect directly with an official recruiter. \u201cWhen we started about three years ago, a lot of the negative stuff that we saw was really a bleed over from [the army\u2019s] stream and the way they were operating,\u201d says Jones. Still, every navy team member does attend the recruiting orientation unit, where they learn basic public speaking skills, according to Jones. Then the team undergoes more public affairs training at the esports center itself, where members are taught team lingo and how to moderate a Twitch stream. \u201cYou kind of have to explain [to those watching the Twitch stream] that we\u2019re not robots, we\u2019re people,\u201d says Jones. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna, like, put you in a chokehold. They think that soldiers just kill people and all that stuff.\u201d He says that Goats &amp; Glory likes to \u201cposition ourselves as the Blue Angels of esports\u201d, referring to the navy aerobatic team that performs at air shows and sporting events. \u201cThe Blue Angels go out and fly; they don\u2019t try to get people in the navy. People want to know more about the navy because they see the Blue Angels.\u201d The reality of combat Moses Lemann, 21, a University of Pittsburgh junior, often gets recruitment ads that look like his favorite game series, Battlefield. \u201cIt really looks like they\u2019re jacking the aesthetics of a video game,\u201d he says, with the ads mimicking Battlefield\u2019s loading screen, complete with a topographic map and prompts for players to \u201cpick your class\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly trying to tap into that, like a specialization in the military is exactly like picking a class in Battlefield,\u201d says Lemann. Since the end of the cold war, military superpowers like the US have largely moved away from conventional warfare and towards \u201casymmetric warfare\u201d, in which powerful states rely on sophisticated technology to defeat less equipped opponents. To maintain the technological upper hand, the US military needs to recruit from a pool of young people whose skills include being \u201cdetail-oriented\u201d, being \u201cproblem solvers under time pressures\u201d and showcasing \u201cperseverance in the face of frustration\u201d, per the navy\u2019s recruiting guide for streamers. Jones puts it more literally: \u201cWe look for those we consider \u2018high quality\u2019, the people who are very technically savvy, your Stem people\u201d who can help when the navy needs \u201cmore nukes\u201d or \u201cIT stuff\u201d. \u201cJust by being a hardcore gamer, you already [have] this affinity for technology.\u201d Virginia-class attack submarines use Xbox controllers to operate photonic masts, and some combat vehicle controllers resemble Nintendo 64 controllers. Then there is the obvious parallel between combat drone piloting and gaming. While drone pilots often reject the comparison (primarily due to the psychological toll of operating a real machine that remotely kills people), research does show that gamers excel at this work. Scientific research has consistently shown that video games do not make people more violent. Playing games can, however, improve perceptual and cognitive functions, says Dr C Shawn Green, professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Office of Naval Research funded Green to research how certain games (mainly shooters) improve warrior performance. \u201cThese games have lots of speed in them,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of what we call \u2018transient events\u2019 \u2013 things pop up on the screen and disappear.\u201d He says this can improve basic visual perception as well as heighten levels of cognition (such as working memory). But video games can\u2019t fully convey the psychological toll of combat, the moral injury, or even the physical toll. \u201cI remember wearing the armor,\u201d says Knowles. \u201cYou\u2019re adding 80lb on to your body, you have seven magazines across the front of your body, and then you\u2019re carrying your 8lb M4. Heaven forbid you have a grenade attachment, which adds another 5lb to your rifle. And then you have to try and get in and out of an upper armored Humvee in a combat zone while you\u2019re getting shot at. That\u2019s not in Call of Duty.\u201d As potential conflicts with Russia, China and in the Middle East loom, personnel is considered critical for maintaining combat \u201creadiness\u201d. But the branches are scrambling: in December, the Department of Defense reported that the branches had collectively missed their 2023 recruiting goals by 41,000 recruits \u2013 even after they lowered their goals significantly. The military points to the fact that most young people are ineligible to serve due to their weight, drug use or criminal records. Others attribute youth reluctance to recent publicity about a culture within the military that allows for racism, white supremacy and sexual violence; gaping holes in the US\u2019s veteran support system; the legacies of the US occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan; and ideological opposition to war itself. But when recruiting teams go into gaming spaces where there are kids and teens, \u201cthey\u2019re trying to get their attention and start to glamorize the military as a lifestyle \u2013 or try to minimize it\u201d, Young of Gamers for Peace says. The military does not release data on how effective video game recruitment is, but the teams consider the efforts successful. In December 2021, the air force launched an online \u201cAircade\u201d of video games that require \u201creal-life skill that airmen use\u201d. In Command the Stack, for example, players can pilot aircraft in an augmented reality mission simulator constructed from satellite scans. \u201cI had some folks come up to me saying, \u2018Hey, I actually joined the air force because of Air Force Gaming,\u2019\u201d says Maj Oliver Parsons, founder of the air force/space force esports team, adding that it has \u201cmade the overall Department of Defense more relatable to folks and put us in a better light\u201d. Silva says: \u201cWithout the esports team in the navy? You would never talk to these kids.\u201d He and Jones list Goats &amp; Glory\u2019s recent accolades: partnerships with influential streamers and esports leagues; videos of sailors playing Madden NFL with professional athletes; and their own competitions, including a 2022 tournament in Denver that was \u201cone of the largest amateur League of Legends events in all of North America\u201d, per Jones. The navy says it will expand its Memphis facility into a more sophisticated esports center this year. \u201cThere might be a stage with extra seating,\u201d Jones says excitedly. Notably, the marines have thus far refused to use esports for recruitment. Although there is a Marine Corps Gaming team, it does not officially represent the branch. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious decision to serve, and there\u2019s concerns over gamifying what we do and the translation between video games and actual military service,\u201d a US Marine Corps communications officer told Military.com in 2020. Another way to game Military gaming goes beyond recruitment. Video games can improve mental health and build community, issues that the military sorely needs to address, not least because mentally healthy fighters are capable of making better moral decisions. And the military\u2019s openness to channeling resources into gaming can be a force for good \u2013 like funding immersive VR therapy for veteran trauma treatment. Parsons created Air Force Gaming as a grassroots project with fellow airmen. He says esports help build psychological resilience across the branch. He tells me that a drone pilot who was \u201cin a very dark place\u201d told him: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my Overwatch team, and these airmen and guardians that I met all around the world, I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d As veterans like Considine and Knowles point out, kids and teens are simply not old enough comprehend the seriousness of enlistment, or the toll active service takes. Cronin, the computer science student, recently learned about military propaganda in a college history class: \u201cI was naive and I said, \u2018What is the current form of military propaganda? Why don\u2019t they make those posters any more?\u2019 And the answer was: it\u2019s the advertisements, and it\u2019s the cool videos and social media engagement.\u201d She has no immediate plans to enlist. Though career and money pressures make it tempting, she\u2019s not as open to the idea as she was as a teenager. She says she\u2019s become much more critical of the military as she\u2019s matured.

            "title": "Outgunned and exhausted: what hope for Ukraine if US military aid dries up?",
            "date": "2024-02-11T09:39:38Z",
            "content": "Ukraine began 2024 on the defensive and Kyiv\u2019s battlefield prospects are dimming further as Republicans in the US Congress appear increasingly to be intent on blocking future military aid. If Europe does not plug the gap, Ukraine risks slow-motion defeat from 2025. A simple figure sums up the problem. Ukraine is once again being outgunned in this near two-year-old war: the current estimate is that Russia is firing 10,000 artillery shells a day to Ukraine\u2019s 2,000, a dismal ratio that may yet worsen in the absence of future US gifts of ammunition. A recent report on the UK\u2019s Sky News highlighted a group of Ukrainian gunners with the 22nd brigade, operating between Chasiv Yar and Russian-held Bakhmut, and featured their pleas for help and limited stockpiles of shells. Their Soviet-standard 152mm gun was fired only three times in a night to protect the supplies available. \u201cWhat that means is that Ukrainians can\u2019t suppress Russian artillery any more, and if the Ukrainians can\u2019t fire back, all they can do is try to survive,\u201d said Sam Cranny-Evans, of the Royal United Services Institute thinktank. Russia, meanwhile, has managed a transition to a war economy. Analysis by Estonia has concluded that Moscow\u2019s factories will produce about 4.5m shells in 2024 (more than 12,000 a day), with Russia having lifted defence spending to a high but sustainable level of 6.5% of GDP. Smaller Ukraine is reliant on western industrial support, but the US political divisions mean the Pentagon has had no more money to spend since the beginning of January, while European efforts have faltered. Europe had committed to produce 1m shells for Ukraine in the year to the end of March but has fallen short and will instead produce anywhere between 480,000 to 700,000, Estonia estimates. \u201cIn Europe, the problem has been to put together sufficiently large orders to make it worthwhile for privately owned companies to invest in expanding their capacity,\u201d said Nick Witney, a former chief executive of the European Defence Agency. As a result, Ukraine is reliant on its own manufacturing and any remaining gifts. Ironically, the US, which produces its shells in government-owned plants, has found ways to lift up its own production, from 28,000 last October to a projected 37,000 in April, 60,000 in October 2024 and 100,000 in October 2025, according to a US thinktank. Even that is well short of helping Ukraine match Russia on the frontline, but without the US, Europe will have to double its own already underpowered efforts in 2024. The war is about more than artillery, of course, and Ukraine is developing alternative strategies, focusing on developing at least 1m small and cheap \u201cfirst-person view\u201d armed drones during 2024. Controlled as if in a video game, the highly manoeuvrable drones are effective in combat but their smaller payload makes them a limited substitute for artillery \u2013 while the Russians have proved able to imitate Ukrainian efforts with their own drones. Ukraine has recognised since the beginning of December that it needs to switch to the defensive, and the president has ordered a strengthening of fortifications. As the Russians showed successfully during 2023, mining deep behind the frontlines should prevent an immediate breakthrough. In any event, the Kremlin\u2019s generals have still not shown they are able to attack effectively. An assault on the frontline town of Avdivvka, in the eastern Donbas, began in October and has continued, with Russian forces making incremental gains at high costs. Western intelligence estimated last week that Russia had lost 365 main battle tanks in the four months of fighting, just about ahead of Moscow\u2019s estimated replenishment rate of about 125 tanks a month. Ukraine nevertheless badly needs more troops to reinforce its exhausted and depleted frontline forces, with parliament debating controversial new mobilisation laws after a call from the ousted chief of staff, Valerii Zaluzhyni, for 450,000 to 500,000 fresh soldiers. It is not clear how many will ultimately be pressed into service. Russia, meanwhile, may not mobilise further ahead of the presidential election in March, but its larger population and use of more ruthless methods always gives it an edge in numbers, able to train 130,000 every six months, according to Estonian estimates, if this is not disrupted by the need to send untrained troops into Ukraine because of the number of casualties being inflicted. There are some technologies that in effect only the US can supply in volume at present, such as Patriot interceptors, critical in the air defence of Kyiv particularly against potent Russian Iskander and Kinzhal missiles. Russia makes and fires about 100 long-range missiles a month, Ukraine estimates, and the rule of thumb is that two interceptors are needed to halt them. A Nato contract on behalf of Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain at the beginning of January will allow for 1,000 Patriot missiles to be made in Germany at some point, some of which could eventually reach Ukraine \u2013 although Kyiv would doubtless have preferred if such an arrangement had been reached a year earlier. The expectation is that the Ukraine war will run into 2025, not least as the Kremlin waits to see if Donald Trump \u2013 widely perceived to be more sympathetic to Vladimir Putin than to Ukraine \u2013 is elected. For Ukraine to prevail, it will most likely have to endure 2024, regroup as far as possible, and hope European politicians concentrate on basic rearmament. \u201cI think the war will be with us for at least another year,\u201d said Cranny-Evans, \u201cand the situation need not be catastrophic if European allies fill the void left by the US. Europe\u2019s economy is still far larger than Russia\u2019s.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-08T19:57:32Z",
            "content": "President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s decision to replace his most senior military commander may solve a political problem, but it is not clear how it can improve Ukraine\u2019s weakening position on the battlefield. It was clear that the outgoing Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi had lost the confidence of the Ukrainian leader, who had come to be wary of the general\u2019s popularity and saw him as a political threat. By refusing to resign when asked by the president last week, Zaluzhnyi had created an untenable situation at the top. Eight days later, Zaluzhnyi has recognised reality, as Zelenskiy has made it clear he wants a change of leadership after the failed summer counteroffensive. His choice of Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, however, currently commander of land forces, is not seen as a radical departure. \u201cSyrskyi is close to the president,\u201d said Oleksiy Goncharenko, an opposition Ukrainian MP close to Zaluzhnyi. \u201cAnd the most important thing for Zelenskiy is that he thinks that Syrskyi is absolutely not a political person. That is his most valuable characteristic.\u201d While Zaluzhnyi came of age as Ukraine became independent, Syrskyi, at 58, is eight years older and was trained at the Higher Military Command school in Moscow. But he has lived in Ukraine since the 1980s and was critical in its defence in the early phases of the war. Syrskyi was responsible for defending Kyiv, organising the defences of the capital into an inner and outer ring in the dramatic weeks of the war. The outer ring largely held, helped at a critical moment by a decision to blow dams of the Irpin river north-west of the capital, flooding ground that prevented the Russian advance. Speaking to the Guardian a year later, Syrskyi described last-ditch defence as \u201can example of what I said about careful planning\u201d, highlighting the fact that Ukrainians had understood that the river, unusually, flowed away from the reservoir north of the capital and could be turned into an impassable obstacle at a village called Moshchun. \u201cSo, realising that we were outnumbered at Moshchun, we made a small opening in the upper part of the dam. We used the features of the landscape. We raised the sluices and flooded the entire area in front of Moshchun that had been occupied by the enemy,\u201d Syrskyi said. Subsequently, however, Syrskyi was involved in a failed attempt last summer to retake Bakhmut on the eastern front, an effort that drew criticism from the US as a distraction from what Washington believed: that Ukraine\u2019s resources should have concentrated on achieving a breakthrough in the south. Ukrainian soldiers generally remained supportive of Zaluzhnyi, who cultivated a following amongst the Azov brigade and other nationalist forces \u2013 while there is greater scepticism of Syrskyi. One critic described him as \u201cvery Soviet thinking\u201d and another as a soldier more willing to tolerate higher casualties, which may affect Kyiv\u2019s efforts to mobilise more forces for the frontline. Allies of the new commander in chief, however, emphasise his dedication. One told the Guardian last year \u201che didn\u2019t sleep for three days\u201d after the Russian invasion \u2013 and the general himself, muscled from regular workouts, says he only sleeps \u201cfour and a half hours a night\u201d rising at 5.20am to do an hour of exercise. During the autumn, once it became clear that the summer counteroffensive had failed to achieve a breakthrough, it was Zaluzhnyi who warned that the war had become a \u201cstalemate\u201d \u2013 a remark that irritated Zelenskiy who believed the comment was both unduly negative and straying into political territory belonging to himself. Sryskyi is a notably more low-key figure. \u201cThe army is outside of politics,\u201d he told the Economist in December 2022, amid another bout of speculation that Zaluzhnyi might be replaced. But there is no obvious alternative military strategy available when Ukraine\u2019s central problem is persuading US Republicans to unblock $61bn (\u00a348bn) worth of military aid. On the battlefield, Ukraine is short of a range of critical munitions, most notably artillery. Russia is firing an estimated 10,000 shells a day, five times more than Ukraine, and, until the challenges of industrial production are solved, Kyiv is likely to be on the defensive, hoping that Moscow will gradually exhaust itself. As a student of history, Sryskyi is not likely to be short of ideas on how to respond to the current situation. Last June, the general argued the essentials of warfare had remained unchanged throughout the ages, even if modern weaponry was far more sophisticated. He said: \u201cWhen you read about the battle of Cannae, between Hannibal and the Romans [in 216 BC], the principles at work are the same: flanking the enemy, surrounding the enemy, concentrating the central effort at the enemy\u2019s weakest point of defence, the need to study the enemy carefully.\u201d"

            "content": "Myanmar\u2019s junta has declared mandatory military service for all young men and women, state media said, as it struggles to contain armed rebel forces fighting for greater autonomy in various parts of the country. All men aged 18-35 and women aged 18-27 must serve for up to two years, while specialists like doctors aged up to 45 must serve for three years. The service can be extended to a total of five years in the ongoing state of emergency, state media said on Saturday. The junta \u201cissued the notification of the effectiveness of People\u2019s Military Service Law starting from 10 February 2024,\u201d the junta\u2019s information team said in a statement. Myanmar has been gripped by chaos since the military seized power from an elected government in a 2021 coup, which sparked mass protests and a crackdown on dissent. Three years on, the junta is struggling to crush widespread armed opposition to its rule. Since October, the Tatmadaw, as the military is known, has suffered personnel losses while battling a coordinated offensive by an alliance of three ethnic minority insurgent groups, as well as allied pro-democracy fighters who have taken up arms against the junta. The success of this offensive and the military\u2019s failure to mount a counterattack has dented morale among low- and mid-level officers, according to several military sources, all of whom requested anonymity. Analysts have said the Tatmadaw is struggling to recruit soldiers and has begun forcing non-combat personnel to the frontline. A \u201cnational military service system involving all people is essential because of the situation happening in our country,\u201d junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said in an audio message released by the information team. A law mandating conscription was introduced in 2010 but has not been enforced until now. Those who fail to comply with the draft face imprisonment for up to five years, the legislation says. Saturday\u2019s statement did not give further details but said the junta\u2019s defence ministry would \u201crelease necessary bylaws, procedures, announcements orders, notifications and instructions.\u201d It did not give details on how those called up would be expected to serve. More than 4,500 people have been killed in the military\u2019s crackdown on dissent and over 26,000 arrested, according to a local monitoring group."

            "content": "Politics doesn\u2019t end in wartime, even when it has been subsumed by more immediate, existential matters. With the passage of time, Winston Churchill\u2019s wartime leadership can appear as if it were unassailable \u2013 yet in reality, criticism grew loud enough that the House of Commons held two votes of confidence in 1942. Though some have compared Volodymyr Zelenskiy to Churchill, the Ukrainian president will be grateful that he has not faced anything approaching that kind of challenge. The \u201crally round the flag\u201d effect, along with his charisma, effective diplomacy and personal courage as Russia invaded, created a remarkably enduring mood of national unity. Even those criticising the decisions or conduct of those around the president shrank from questioning his. But by last autumn, it was clear that the country was seeing the return of politics. It is still far from business as usual. But Mr Zelenskiy\u2019s decision to fire Ukraine\u2019s admired commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, on Thursday has turned up the volume. Mr Zelenskiy says politics played no part. But he has not explained the move beyond citing the need for \u201crenewal\u201d in the armed forces. Disagreements between the men over strategy and tactics were open knowledge and it was widely reported last week that the president had asked for the general\u2019s resignation. Military decisions can be political and economic too \u2013 like Mr Zaluzhnyi\u2019s desire to mobilise half a million troops, which his boss regarded as unrealistic. The president was also reportedly annoyed when the general said the war had reached a stalemate in an interview late last year. That was seen as unhelpful to the diplomatic push for more arms donations, and as venturing on to political turf. The general is wildly popular in Ukraine and aides explored a future political career even as he denied an interest, according to The Showman, a new biography of Mr Zelenskiy by the journalist Simon Shuster. It is hard to see the change of command transforming Ukraine\u2019s fortunes on the battlefield, not least because Gen Zaluzhnyi\u2019s replacement, Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine\u2019s land forces, has a mixed record and at best a mixed reputation among troops. But curiously, it is also hard to see much political benefit to Mr Zelenskiy. Gen Syrskyi is seen as the president\u2019s man, and as lacking political ambition. Gen Zaluzhnyi will be out of the spotlight, but equally will not take the blame for any future military shortcomings. His departure also encourages discussion of whether the president is willing to accept questioning of his decisions. While some western officials have expressed concern about the change of personnel, Mr Zaluzhnyi\u2019s removal is more likely to be a pretext than a reason for Republicans in the US to block further aid: wrangling over the $60bn aid package continues. This is primarily a domestic issue. As war grinds on, the toll grows, and hopes of a breakthrough fade into memory, it is hardly surprising that grumbling increases, that scrutiny of Kyiv\u2019s decisions grows more marked, and that politicians and oligarchs look to their own interests again. Yet people are still anxious not to be exploited by Russia\u2019s propaganda mill. There are no calls for the elections which would, without the war, have taken place this spring. Criticism and challenge are a normal part of political life, even in abnormal times \u2013 and Churchill resoundingly won those votes in 1942. But leaders need to show that they are listening."

            "date": "2024-02-15T18:17:46Z",
            "content": "Rumours that Russia is planning to deploy nuclear weapons in space have been dampened down by experts who say that while such technology is possible, there is no need to push the panic button. The furore kicked off on Wednesday when the head of the US House of Representatives\u2019 intelligence committee, Mike Turner, called for the Biden administration to declassify information on what he called a \u201cserious national security threat\u201d. While Turner gave no further details, it was later reported by news outlets, citing unnamed sources, to involve Russia\u2019s potential deployment of a nuclear anti-satellite weapon in space. The Kremlin dismissed the claim as a \u201cmalicious fabrication\u201d. Dr Bleddyn Bowen, an associate professor at the University of Leicester who specialises in outer space international relations and warfare, said the the lack of detail was no reason to panic. \u201cIt\u2019s so vague and cryptic, it could be a number of different things. [But] no matter what they are, none of them are a big deal, to be honest. Everyone needs to calm down about this.\u201d Russia is bound by several legal restrictions regarding the use or presence of nuclear weapons in space. Article 4 of the Outer Space treaty (1967) bans nuclear weapons from being put into orbit, installed on celestial bodies or otherwise stationed in outer space, while the New Start treaty aims to reduce the number of deployable nuclear arms. The Partial Nuclear Test Ban treaty (1963) bans nuclear explosions in space. Even if Russia ignores these agreements, there are other considerations. Bowen said the rumoured threat may relate to nuclear-tipped anti-satellite weapons but that such a threat was nothing new. \u201cThese are the first and the most crude kind of anti-satellite weapons ever built: the Americans had them in 1959.\u201d He said any state with nuclear weapons already had the technology to use them in space, broadly speaking. Another possibility, Bowen said, was that the threat related to space-based nuclear weapons that could be used to knock out satellites. Again, the idea is not entirely new: Russia has previously explored the stationing of nuclear weapons in space, albeit to attack ground targets. \u201cThey did this in the 1960s and in the 1970s and found out it\u2019s not actually very useful, and it\u2019s very expensive.\u201d He said the country stopped short of attempting to put nuclear bombs in space. Bowen said a nuclear bomb detonation in low-Earth orbit would create a flash in the sky, visible to those in the vicinity below, while it is likely there would also be a false aurora similar to the northern lights \u2013 as occurred during the high-altitude nuclear test known as Starfish Prime in the 1960s. Such a detonation would be certain to destroy the desired satellite, with less of a need for accuracy \u2013 and Russia does have nuclear weapons to spare. Yet there are drawbacks. Space-based nuclear weapons are vulnerable to attack from other nations, while the damage from such weapons would be indiscriminate. \u201cWhen you detonate a nuclear weapon in space you generate the fireball \u2026 but what you [also] generate is the electromagnetic pulse which fries the electrical circuits of anything that\u2019s unshielded within a few thousand kilometres\u2019 radius,\u201d he said. The pulse may also knock out power grids on Earth if the bomb is detonated above or near populated areas. \u201cAfter that, you have the radiation that the bomb would generate,\u201d Bowen said. Over time it would fry the electrical circuits of satellites in the wider part of Earth\u2019s orbit. The loss of satellite services could affect myriad systems on Earth, from telecoms to satellite navigation services. \u201cThat can have knock-on effects to the economy, to critical infrastructure, to the financial system, which relies on these satellites.\u201d In other words, while nuclear bombs could take out a desired satellites, they could also damage Russia\u2019s technology and interests. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in a very desperate situation to want to do something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I am not losing any sleep over this.\u201d Russia also has other technology to hand. In 2021 Russia tested a direct-ascent anti-satellite missile, successfully knocking out one of its own defunct satellites. But James Green, a professor of public international law at the University of the West of England, said he was also dubious that that system would be deployed. \u201cI think Russia likes to project its space power [to appear] greater than it probably is,\u201d he said."

In his statement, Turner, an Ohio Republican, gave no details about the supposed security threat. Talking to reporters at the White House later on Wednesday, the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, expressed surprise at Turner\u2019s statement saying he was due to meet the \u201cgang of eight\u201d (congressional leaders with special security clearance for classified briefings) on Thursday. But Sullivan did not give any details of the planned meeting. ABC News and the New York Times cited unnamed sources as saying that the security threat Turner was referring to involved Russia\u2019s potential deployment of a nuclear anti-satellite weapon in space. The New York Times said US allies had also been briefed on the intelligence, which was not deemed to represent an urgent threat, as the alleged Russian capability was still in development. It is not clear whether the new intelligence alert is connected to a Russian launch on 9 February of a Soyuz rocket carrying a classified defence ministry payload. \u201cRussia has been conducting several experiments with manoeuvring satellites that might be designed to sabotage other satellites,\u201d Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists, said. He pointed out that any such deployment of nuclear weapons in space would violate the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, to which Moscow is a signatory. \u201cThe issue is not so much about an increased nuclear weapons threat per se but that it would increase the threat against other countries\u2019 space-based nuclear command and control assets. It would be highly destabilising.\u201d Pavel Podvig, an expert on Russian nuclear forces, said: \u201cI am very skeptical (to put it mildly). Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to categorically rule out anything these days. But still, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s plausible.\u201d Kristensen suggested that a Russian threat to put nuclear weapons in space, thus destroying yet another non-proliferation treaty, could be the latest in a long line of Vladimir Putin\u2019s moves designed to add to pressure on the US and its allies to end their military support for Ukraine. Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, said a nuclear anti-satellite weapon made little practical sense. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a nuclear weapon to blow up a satellite in orbit. All objects in space are so delicate, that you can do something with much less than a nuclear detonation,\u201d Kimball said. \u201cPlus, it\u2019s completely illegal.\u201d The House speaker, Mike Johnson, said there was no need for panic over the alleged, unnamed threat. He said he was not allowed to discuss classified information but told reporters: \u201cWe just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We\u2019re working on it and there\u2019s no need for alarm.\u201d"

If so, such a calculation was more than naive\u201d. Despite the best efforts of the Greenham women to prevent it, deployment of cruise missiles went ahead as planned, paving the way for the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which eliminated both cruise and the SS-20s. This multilateral deal could never have happened if their campaign for unilateral UK nuclear disarmament had succeeded. Rebecca Johnson (Letters, 30 January) appears to have forgotten that this conclusion was shared across the political spectrum. As the Observer stated in an editorial on 20 September 1987: \u201cThink back to 1979, when Nato settled on its \u2018twin-track\u2019 decision to deploy cruise and Pershing-2 missiles in Europe while continuing to negotiate with the Russians about the elimination of such systems. If the Soviet Union had then offered, inconceivably, to eliminate all its intermediate and short-range missiles aimed at western Europe in return for the non-deployment of cruise and Pershing-2, the offer would have been greeted with disbelief \u2013 and joy. Yet that is the very outcome that has now been achieved by deployment and negotiation: the twin-track decision has achieved its objective. \u201cNow is the moment for those who stood firm in 1983 \u2013 the year of deployment \u2013 to enjoy the results of their resolution. Despite public agitation and the parading of conscience through the streets, Nato was not deterred. Who would now have the nerve to claim that if the prescription of the peace groups had been followed the outcome would have been as good?

            "date": "2024-02-27T15:34:24Z",
            "content": "The Welsh government\u2019s cabinet did not discuss the threat posed by Covid as the virus spread across the world until a month after its chief medical officer had warned there was a \u201csignificant risk\u201d it would reach Wales, the inquiry into the pandemic has heard. At the start of three weeks of hearings in Cardiff, the inquiry was told this was more than three weeks after the UK government\u2019s cabinet debated Covid, with bereaved families describing this delay as a missed chance to \u201carmour up for battle\u201d. The Labour-led government was also accused of \u201ca massive failure of infection control\u201d when it allowed patients to be discharged from hospitals into care homes without being tested. It was suggested that first minister Mark Drakeford\u2019s administration should have banned mass gatherings sooner. The Welsh leg of the UK Covid inquiry began with a moving film in which families described losing relatives to the virus and survivors revealed how it had affected them. One told how her husband had begged her not to take him to hospital because he would be infected. Others recalled how loved ones had died trapped in Covid wards, separated from families. A person with disabilities told how his mental health had been affected because he felt he was being \u201ckept in prison\u201d during lockdowns. Others expressed distress that they had not been able to organise proper funerals. Tom Poole KC, a counsel for the inquiry, said the number of Covid deaths in Wales was more than 12,300. \u201cThat is by any measure a shocking figure and a terrible loss of life,\u201d he said. Poole said people from deprived backgrounds, people from ethnic minorities or with disabilities, older people and women in Wales had been disproportionately affected by Covid. Detailing the chronology of the pandemic, Poole said on 24 January 2020 the Welsh government was warned by its chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, that there was a \u201csignificant risk\u201d Covid would reach Wales. The UK cabinet discussed it on 31 January but the Welsh cabinet did not do so until 25 February. Poole said: \u201cDoes the fact that Covid was not discussed by the Welsh cabinet throughout January indicate that the threat posed by the virus was not taken as seriously as it ought to have been or that the Welsh government thought the UK government had things under control and there was no need to take independent action? Was there a lack of national strategic leadership and coordination from the Welsh government in this crucial early period?\u201d He said Welsh Labour called off its spring 2020 conference but was still prepared to allow 70,000 people to gather in Cardiff for a Wales v Scotland rugby game on 14 March. The game was eventually cancelled by the Welsh Rugby Union but not until 20,000 Scottish rugby fans had arrived in the Welsh capital. He said two concerts by the Welsh band Stereophonics also went ahead. Poole said: \u201cGatherings were not without some risk and a ban would have reinforced other social distancing good practice.\u201d The barrister said more than 1,000 Welsh patients were discharged from hospital to care homes without a test during March and April 2020. He said: \u201cThere is no doubt there has been a massive failure of infection control contributed at least in part to the influx of infected but untested patients.\u201d Later in the pandemic, the Welsh government imposed different restrictions to England. Poole said: \u201cWe will examine the extent to which divergence was based on proper advice \u2026 whether points of difference were substantive or merely cosmetic.\u201d The issue of politicians\u2019 WhatsApp messages disappearing has cropped up during the inquiry. Poole said text or WhatsApp messages from ministers \u201cshed light\u201d on some key decisions. He said there were instances when informal communications from Welsh politicians had been deleted and said: \u201cThe inquiry will wish to know why and how such messages are now not available for inspection.\u201d Nia Gowman, a barrister for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru group, told the inquiry that the then Welsh health minister and now first minister candidate, Vaughan Gething, and a senior adviser to Drakeford used the disappearing messages function on WhatsApp during the pandemic. Gowman said: \u201cThe limited messages which have been disclosed clearly show WhatsApp and text messages used to discuss government business where they shouldn\u2019t have been. They show Welsh government senior special advisers suspiciously and systematically deleting communications. They show special advisers reminding themselves and others that they had agreed to clear out WhatsApp chat once a week.\u201d Andrew Kinnier KC, for the Welsh government, said: \u201cNeither Welsh ministers nor senior officials used WhatsApp or any other form of informal communication as a substitute for or a supplemental means of decision-making.\u201d"

The Pantex site in Amarillo in north Texas announced on Facebook that staff should come to work for normal shift operations after it had paused operations. \u201cThe Pantex Plant is open for normal day shift operations for Wednesday, February 28; all personnel are to report for duty according to their assigned schedule.\u201d The plant updated that there was no fire at the plant site, NBC News reported. There is an unconfined fire north of the plant. Since 1975, Pantex has been the US main assembly and disassembly site for its atomic bombs. It assembled the last new bomb in 1991. In the time since, it has dismantled thousands of weapons. Pantex is located 30 miles (48km) east of Amarillo. With unseasonably warm temperatures and strong gusts helping to fuel the flames through dry grasses, the largest Texas blaze, known as the Smokehouse Creek fire, has consumed more than 500,000 acressince it ignited on Monday, and remains 0% contained. Two others had collectively scorched more than 38,000 acres and were each 20% contained. The wildfire is now the second-largest on record in Texas, CNN reported. Mandatory evacuations were issued in Texas on Tuesday afternoon as wind-swept wildfires continued to burn uncontrollably across the Panhandle. \u201cThere has been some structure loss,\u201d said public information officer Juan Rodriguez, who added that it\u2019s too soon to know how many buildings have burned. Rodriguez said high winds are complicating the efforts, even though there\u2019s hope for higher humidity on Wednesday. As of Wednesday morning, Texas officials are still determining the extent of damage as firefighters work to contain active fires. More than 4,000 homes in Texas are also without power as of Wednesday, poweroutage.us reported. Gusts of up to 65mph and low relative humidity are contributing to critical fire weather conditions and they are not expected to calm soon, according to the National Weather Service. Millions of people across the south-central US remain under red flag warnings. \u201cStronger winds are anticipated today, and conditions will remain quite favourable for the start and spread of wildfires,\u201d the NWS in Amarillo, Texas, wrote in an update on Tuesday, before urging residents to take extra caution with activities that could cause new ignitions. Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties across the region under threat from the fires, stating that additional counties may be added as conditions intensify. The state\u2019s division of emergency management has also been enlisted to provide resources and aid local firefighters in the response. Encouraging Texans to keep their loved ones safe and thanking first responders, Abbott also shared warnings from Texas A&amp;M forest service that risks were high for fires beyond the Panhandle, in regions of the South Plains, Texoma, Permian Basin and portions of east Texas. The Smokehouse Creek fire, already the fifth largest in the state\u2019s history, burned more than all the fires ignited in Texas last year combined, according to the Texas A&amp;M forest service. Several communities were forced to flee, in some cases through chaos and confusion as the winds changed and exit routes were blocked by closed roads. Residents in the city of Canadian, a city in Hemphill county, were told to shelter in place on Tuesday afternoon, due to closures of important routes out of the city. \u201cThe wind has shifted from the north,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office for the town of Roberts posted on Facebook, adding: \u201cIf you have not evacuated, do so now.\u201d The city of Borger, in Hutchinson county, meanwhile, posted a plea for patience and instructions to remain off the roads as residents inundated the agency with questions. \u201cWe are trying to keep our pages as up to date as possible. Please understand that fire related situations are rapidly changing. This includes evacuations, active hotspots, and wind shifts,\u201d the city posted online. \u201cWe understand it\u2019s inconvenient for the roads to be closed,\u201d they added, \u201cbut there is active fire all over our roadways right now. And where there isn\u2019t fire, there is extreme smoke, making visibility nonexistent. Do NOT chance it! [sic]\u201d The Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "content": "I have lived for long enough in the US to be acclimated to most of the cultural differences, starting with 20% tipping and ending with the customary address of strangers as \u201csir\u201d, or \u201cma\u2019am\u201d, as opposed to the dithery British \u201cer, excuse me?\u201d. The exception to this, of course, is US healthcare, which will never strike me as less than outlandish. So it was, last week, when I had cause to call 911 in the middle of the night, but only after putting in a call to my insurers to request pre-authorisation. If you take the narrowest view, there are aspects of US healthcare that are superior to the UK and European models. In the early hours of last Thursday morning, I knew, for example, that an ambulance would arrive at my door within 10 minutes and probably sooner, no questions asked. I knew that, once I\u2019d been discharged from the ER, I would be able to choose my own doctor for follow-up care, and have some say in how, where and when I was treated. I also knew, with a certainty that I suspect deepened the back spasms that kicked off the whole thing in the first place, that if I didn\u2019t take the necessary steps, I would be receiving a $3,000 invoice from my insurers for the cost of the ride \u2013 and that even if I did everything right, there was no guarantee. For reasons that have never been clear to me, the call centre for my insurer \u2013 a policy bought through a broker in Dubai, regulated in the Channel Islands, and falling under the umbrella of one of the biggest insurers in the US \u2013 is located in Scotland, ensuring that the man who picked up my call had to strain as hard as I did to pretend this situation was normal. I gave him a quick run-down: agonising pain; inability to move; shortness of breath as the spasms got deeper; above all, keenness to avoid bankruptcy by reminding him that I had no control over which hospital the ambulance came from \u2013 that is, whether or not it fell within my insurance network. \u201cRight,\u201d he said. \u201cRight.\u201d I asked if he could pre-authorise coverage and he said that he could certainly try, but of course \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean \u2026\u201d He trailed off. \u201cBut it can\u2019t hurt, can it!\u201d he said brightly, at which point I began heavy breathing with pain, bumping us from one script (policyholder seeks pre-authorisation) to another (woman on edge, requires careful handling). \u201cI\u2019m just going to talk nonsense to you, if that\u2019s OK?\u201d he said gently and began telling me about the weather in Scotland. This was lovely, in its way, but after a few moments didn\u2019t seem to be fixing things and I hung up to call 911. Pro tip: if you\u2019re ever in New York and in agony, the line \u201cI just need some fentanyl to get me moving again!\u201d will not have the intended effect. Ten minutes later, two EMTs at my bedside informed me severely that paramedics in the city don\u2019t carry pain drugs, for obvious reasons of safety. This is a very bad moment for me vis-a-vis my faith in the consumer choice of American healthcare. \u201cLook,\u201d I said desperately, indicating a bottle by my bedside, \u201cI have two oxycodone left from when this happened four years ago \u2013 that\u2019s how much not of an addict I am!\u201d \u201cI doubt it even works this far out,\u201d said the paramedic \u2013 no shit \u2013 and conveyed me via stretcher to the ambulance, yelping. I could make a point here about the limits of choice within healthcare, or the desperate anxiety entailed in the cost of US emergency care. Truthfully, though, the sweet relief of not being in pain has yet fully to wear off. At the ER, the doctor, when she finally saw me, offered a pathetic Lidocaine pain relief patch, which might as well have been a plank of wood to bite down on. \u201cUm,\u201d I said, sweating and shaking and trying with every fibre of my being to convey not-addicted-to-opioids vibes. A man down the corridor shouted, \u201cI\u2019m in pain! I\u2019m in pain\u201d \u2013 shut up you idiot, you\u2019re going to ruin it for all of us \u2013 and the doctor sighed. As if giving in, she ordered the nurse to put me on a morphine drip until morning, which was heaven, obviously, but for which the price will be dear. Now I\u2019m home, feeling better, and braced for the cost: invoice, appeal, escalation, eventual arbitration, and the huge expenditure of time and money that is a guaranteed part of falling ill in the US. The real pain begins. Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist"

            "content": "Janice Morgan, an A&amp;E nurse for the last 12 years, explains what life is like for frontline NHS staff who are facing rising levels of abuse and aggression. She is an emergency department matron (senior nurse) in the A&amp;E unit at Nottingham\u2019s Queen\u2019s Medical Centre hospital. \u201cI\u2019ve had three threats to kill me. Men have looked me in the eye and said \u2018I\u2019m going to fucking kill you\u2019 and I have partially believed them. \u201cThreats to kill are the most extreme form of the aggression, violence and hostility myself and my colleagues in A&amp;E face. But they do happen. \u201cHow do they affect me? That depends on how much bandwidth you\u2019ve got on that day. I\u2019ve never left work and thought I wasn\u2019t safe. But there have been a few incidents that have got to me. \u201cHowever, when that happens, when someone is looking into your eyes and telling you that they\u2019re going to kill you, a lot of people do descend, who are usually a lot bigger than me \u2013 colleagues and security staff \u2013 and that makes you feel safer. \u201cThere is a human aspect to the abuse we get. People I know have been off sick for a long time because of verbal abuse. But physical assaults are more likely to have that lasting impact. \u201cStaff have a level of acceptance about abuse, hostility and the threat of violence that we probably shouldn\u2019t have. That\u2019s because although you don\u2019t think it\u2019s part of the job, it\u2019s become part of the job. \u201cWe record every time someone is punched, kicked, bitten or scratched where it breaks the skin. But if you recorded every single time someone swore at you or was rude to you, that would be a whole other job in itself. \u201cUnfortunately A&amp;E staff are an easy target because we\u2019re here. While patients can\u2019t always get to see their GP or a specialist or get to a pharmacy, we\u2019re always accessible, 24/7, 365 days a year. \u201cAbuse has definitely increased in recent years. Since Covid, a lot more people have been using A&amp;E as their first point of call when they need care, because there\u2019s a feeling that GP services are inaccessible. That has increased our waiting times and increased overcrowding, which then just leads to more frustration. \u201cLong waits in the emergency department [ED] are the main reason people get frustrated. During my 12 years here, we\u2019ve gone from patients being here less than four hours to them now being here for well over 12 hours at times. \u201cPeople want things more readily now and it\u2019s really difficult because we can\u2019t provide them as readily, because our ED is so busy all the time and often overcrowded. In an ideal world we\u2019d see everybody immediately, but we can\u2019t because that\u2019s impossible. \u201cWhen you are here as a patient, or your child is here as a patient, at that time you or your child is the most important person. I understand that. \u201cBut getting people to understand that as ED staff we deal with people in order of clinical priority is quite difficult. People don\u2019t always understand that, actually, if they\u2019re not being seen straight away, that\u2019s quite a positive thing.\u201d As told to Denis Campbell"

            "date": "2024-02-01T17:00:24Z",
            "content": "When K Monica Kelly saw that women in Texas had filed a lawsuit challenging the contours of their state\u2019s abortion ban, she posted on Instagram to cheer them on. \u201cI shared how terrible I thought it was, that they weren\u2019t able to get the proper healthcare they needed in their state,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt never crossed my mind that that was actually going to happen to me soon.\u201d Kelly and her husband spent a year trying to have a second baby. So when they discovered in February 2023 that Kelly was pregnant, the couple was ecstatic. They taught their son, who was then two years old, to describe their family as: \u201cMama, dada, me, baby, all four!\u201d After an ultrasound looked promising, they drove more than 10 hours from their home in northern Tennessee to announce the news to their family in Florida. Only days later, after they\u2019d returned home, in late March, the pair drove back to Florida. This time, though, the drive was \u201csurreal and devastating\u201d, Kelly said. A series of catastrophic fetal diagnoses had led Kelly to decide to get an abortion \u2013 a procedure she could not legally get in Tennessee. \u201cIt\u2019s awful and agonizing to just even drive that far to go do something that you just really don\u2019t want to do,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cEven up until the last second, I wished that I could change my mind. But I just knew that that was the best decision.\u201d More than a dozen states have implemented near-total abortion bans since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in June 2022. Although every state with an abortion ban has some kind of exception that should theoretically allow for abortions in medical emergencies, doctors and patients across the country have said that the bans are worded in such a way as to be unworkable in reality. Misinterpreting the exceptions could lead providers to shoulder not only hefty fines, but also lifelong prison sentences. As a result, dozens of women from across the country have come forward with stories of being denied medically necessary abortions. Now, Kelly, like the women in Texas, is one of them: earlier this year, she joined a lawsuit in Tennessee that was filed by multiple women who say they were turned away from abortions they desperately needed. After Roe fell, Tennessee rushed to implement what was believed to be one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. Lawmakers have since carved out extremely narrow exceptions in the law \u2013 but advocates say they are nowhere near enough to ensure doctors can provide what is often lifesaving care. \u2018I was trying to make a compassionate decision for my baby\u2019 Kelly\u2019s fetus was diagnosed with trisomy 13, a chromosomal disorder that can result in a range of grave issues, according to Kelly\u2019s lawsuit. The fetus had large growths on the neck and back, as well as elevated swelling in the tissues and organs. The fetus also had a condition, associated with trisomy 13, that had led the brain to fail to split correctly, Kelly said: \u201cThat\u2019s associated with really severe complications, like facial deformities, like only having one eye and really terrible things like that.\u201d Many fetuses diagnosed with trisomy 13 do not make it to birth; if they are born, the infants need extensive medical care and still likely only live for hours or days. If Kelly had continued the pregnancy, the fetus could have started experiencing pain, according to the lawsuit. Kelly faced the risk of developing medical complications herself, too, such as preeclampsia, a risky blood pressure condition. But Tennessee bans almost all abortions after conception. Under the state\u2019s ban, Kelly\u2019s doctor and genetic counselor told her, Kelly could not get an abortion in Tennessee, according to her lawsuit. \u201cI felt confused and stressed about where to go and what to do when I wasn\u2019t allowed to get the healthcare I needed in Tennessee,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cJust, the whole thing was drawn out even longer than it needed to be because I was trying to figure out where to go and I was trying to make a compassionate decision for my baby.\u201d She considered getting an abortion in Illinois, a state that has become an abortion haven since Roe\u2019s downfall; she made and cancelled appointments. She didn\u2019t feel right going somewhere she had never been for such a personal procedure. \u201cI was seeking any comfort I could possibly grab onto,\u201d she said. Finally, Kelly was able to get an appointment at a Florida hospital, with an OB-GYN she knew and trusted. But going to Florida came with its own challenges. Kelly realized she was running out of time: Florida bans abortions past 15 weeks of pregnancy, and she was coming up against that limit. In addition, patients in Florida must visit an abortion provider in person for counseling, wait 24 hours, and return for the procedure itself. Kelly and her husband also had to make the 10-hour-plus trek to north-west Florida with their toddler in tow. Just remembering that drive, Kelly said, gives her goosebumps. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to put myself back in that state of mind sometimes, because it was so traumatic for me that I think my brain is trying to protect itself and forget,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what I did. I just went forward.\u201d Kelly and her husband saved money by staying at a friend\u2019s place, but the whole trip set the couple back \u201cat least several thousands of dollars\u201d, Kelly estimated. \u201cIt was a lot more stressful and confusing than it would have been had we been able to just stay in Tennessee.\u201d At the hospital, Kelly cried before she slipped under anesthesia. The nurses held her hand. \u201cThey were really compassionate and kind,\u201d Kelly said, her voice choking up with tears. \u201cThat was the hardest part \u2013 just not wanting to go through with it or be there but knowing it had to be done, and then having someone just tell me it was gonna be OK. They made me feel comfortable.\u201d By the time of her abortion, on 31 March 2023, Kelly was roughly 15 weeks pregnant, according to her lawsuit \u2013 just about the legal limit in Florida. But abortion laws in Florida may soon shift again: the Florida state supreme court is weighing a case that may lead to a six-week abortion ban, which would outlaw the procedure before many people know they\u2019re pregnant. After her procedure, Kelly reached out to Allie Phillips, a Tennessee mom who went public on social media with her experience of having to travel out of state for an abortion. Phillips, who is now running for a seat in the Tennessee state legislature, was one of the first women to sue Tennessee over the exceptions in its abortion ban \u2013 months later, Kelly decided to join the lawsuit. Seven women who say they were denied abortions in Tennessee, including Kelly and Phillips, are a part of the lawsuit. One ended up traveling to Virginia for an abortion, and was later diagnosed with sepsis due to an infection that, her doctors said, had gotten worse because her abortion had been delayed. Another woman learned that her pregnancy was unlikely to result in a healthy baby, but had to continue it against her will. She delivered a stillborn son 31 weeks into her pregnancy. \u201cI hope that it makes a difference. I feel like I\u2019m proud to be a part of it, although it\u2019s something I never wanted to be a part of,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI just hope that I can make a difference for women\u2019s rights.\u201d A hearing in the case is set for April. In April 2023, Tennessee\u2019s Republican governor signed into law a bill that slightly expanded abortion providers\u2019 legal protections. Under the original version of the law, all abortions had technically been felonies \u2013 but doctors who performed them could claim in court that the abortions had been performed to save a patient\u2019s life or prevent a serious injury. Under the new law, doctors could use their \u201creasonable medical judgment\u201d to perform abortions in severe emergencies, a standard that abortion-rights advocates say still opens doctors up to prosecution. Lawyers for the women, who are being represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, are asking the courts to issue a temporary injunction that would allow doctors instead to use their \u201cgood faith medical judgment\u201d to perform abortions when a patient has a \u201ccritical or emergent physical medical condition\u201d that threatens their health, future fertility or life. The Texas lawsuit, meanwhile, is under deliberation by the state supreme court. A similar case, filed in Idaho last year, continues. Kelly is pregnant again. She\u2019s due in June 2024. The fear of something happening to this pregnancy and, in particular, the fear of being pregnant again in Tennessee lingers. Kelly didn\u2019t buy any new baby outfits, or tell her son about the pregnancy, until after testing confirmed her fetus had no medical issues. \u201cWe did not start trying until my previous baby\u2019s due date had passed. I wasn\u2019t mentally or physically ready,\u201d she said. \u201cWe actually ended up conceiving this baby the weekend of our former baby\u2019s due date. Things just felt right.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-07T15:00:16Z",
            "content": "Nigel Pernu knows all too well the damage homelessness wreaks on a person\u2019s health. He slept rough for six months after six heart attacks left him hospitalised long-term in Adelaide, leading to an opioid addiction. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly worrying about where you\u2019re going to sleep,\u201d he says. \u201cIt puts a strain on your body. It also increases stress levels, cortisol levels, gives you high blood pressure and weakens your immune system as well. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have a mental health condition or addiction before you\u2019re homeless, it\u2019s no doubt that you will after you\u2019ve experienced homelessness. People\u2019s lives feel like they\u2019re falling apart and there\u2019s nothing else to do but take substances, that\u2019s why people do it.\u201d Pernu now uses his experience as a peer worker for cohealth, which runs a healthcare service for rough sleepers and other disadvantaged groups in Melbourne. His job is to build trust, encouraging people experiencing homelessness to open up about their problems so they can be referred to a team of allied health workers. But specialised services of the kind offered by cohealth are both rare and operating on a fee-for-service funding model that fails to adequately cover the longer, low-volume consults needed in this type of healthcare. \u201cThey are few and far between and they\u2019re all struggling like we are to deliver the care the way it needs to be delivered, and to be able to make ends meet,\u201d says cohealth\u2019s chief executive, Nicole Bartholomeusz. Frontline workers are warning that the underfunding of these services and lack of emergency housing for chronically ill rough sleepers are leading to preventable and premature deaths. Guardian Australia has spent 12 months investigating the deaths of homeless Australians, reviewing coronial findings over 10 years, accessing hidden coronial data, and interviewing dozens of people experiencing homelessness, their advocates, researchers and support services. The investigation revealed homeless Australians are dying shockingly early, at an average age of 44, according to 627 death reports to the coroner. The barriers to rough sleepers accessing healthcare include declining bulk billing availability, stigma and distrust of the medical system, an inability to travel for appointments or to store medication, and the difficulty of keeping clothes clean and managing wounds. Those barriers mean minor illnesses and injuries can go untreated, only caught when an individual presents to an emergency department. \u201cYou\u2019re prioritising what is necessary,\u201d Pernu said. \u201cThat stress ... most people eventually do have some minor ailment that becomes chronic or major, they don\u2019t have the healthcare to address that.\u201d A University of Notre Dame Australia professor, Lisa Wood, an expert in health and homelessness, describes trying to manage health conditions while sleeping rough as a \u201cdisaster\u201d. \u201cPeople are literally dying waiting for a house,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is untenable. \u201cAnyone who is homeless deserves rapid housing but certainly what homeless healthcare workers say is that there should be even more prioritised pathways for people who already have chronic health conditions.\u201d Bartholomeusz says the provision of housing has significant benefits to the health of rough sleepers. That became obvious during the pandemic lockdowns, she says, when state governments housed those experiencing homelessness in hotels. The health benefits her staff observed were lost when clients were turned back out on to the streets. \u201cPeople are exposed to pneumonia, arthritis, a whole range of musculoskeletal problems, foot problems are a major concern, infections, so the poor hygiene causes increased rates of infections, not being able to manage wounds well,\u201d Bartholomeusz says. \u201cDiabetes is a huge issue as well for people who experience homelessness, and uncontrolled diabetes then has a significant impact on the cardiovascular systems, circulatory system. Oral health is also a significant issue \u2013 tooth decay, gum disease, we know now about the links between gum disease and heart disease. \u201cAll of those health conditions are exacerbated if you are sleeping rough. What we\u2019ve been saying is that housing is really the cheapest form of healthcare that we can provide.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-02T12:00:03Z",
            "content": "In June, 2022, Nick Zingarelli and his family packed their bags and left St Louis. His daughter had shared with them she was transgender just two years earlier, and Missouri lawmakers were in the midst of passing a raft of anti-trans bills, including a ban on gender-affirming care for minors. They moved to Cincinnati, where the family had lived years before, viewing it as a possible refuge from the legislative attacks. Zingarelli thought Ohio would be \u201ca more moderate place, a more rational and logical place\u201d, with the centrist-leaning Republican governor, Mike DeWine, at the helm. \u201cIt seemed like at least leadership was willing to be the rational adults in the room,\u201d he said. He was half right. DeWine, who had himself in January created some restrictions on trans healthcare in the state, vetoed a bill from Ohio Republicans to ban gender-affirming care for minors last December, saying that many parents of trans kids had told him \u201ctheir child would be dead today if they had not received the treatment they received from an Ohio children\u2019s hospital\u201d. But it didn\u2019t matter. Using their supermajorities in the state legislature, Republicans voted to override DeWine\u2019s veto last week and banned trans youth from accessing potentially life-saving treatments like hormone replacement therapy and puberty blockers. Their brazen move illustrates just how secure Republicans are in their control of Ohio\u2019s legislature. Democrats and Republicans alike have used gerrymandering to win legislative majorities, but the GOP has perfected the art, pouring money into state redistricting battles across the country in an explicit strategy to remake statehouses to their advantage. GOP lawmakers can ignore the governor because their severely gerrymandered maps gave them enough seats in the legislature to disregard his objections. With so many safe districts, Republicans \u201conly have to court the support of their party\u201d, said Maria Bruno, the policy director of LGBTQ+ rights organization Equality Ohio. \u201cThey are prioritizing their legislation not based on their voters or constituents, but on their party\u2019s goals.\u201d The same day legislators overturned DeWine\u2019s veto on banning gender-affirming healthcare for minors, they also voted to override his veto of a bill that allowed cities to regulate the sale of flavored cigarettes. And they\u2019re already gearing up for more clashes with the governor. \u201cIf we pass legislation in this chamber with the requisite amount of support to have a supermajority, we should always be very mindful, and we should always look at \u2013 zealously \u2013 our ability to override a veto,\u201d Rob McColley, a rising Republican star in the state legislature, said last week. Their aggressive posture sets the legislature up for another possible fight with the governor \u2013 over a push by Republican lawmakers to eliminate the state\u2019s income tax. DeWine has expressed doubts about the legislation, but has not indicated he would veto it. It\u2019s also notable who\u2019s driving policy within the statehouse. Republicans shoved DeWine to the side on the trans healthcare ban to pass a bill sponsored by state representative Gary Click, a Baptist pastor who has defended conversion therapy and openly espoused homophobic and transphobic claims, including declaring that Satan makes people trans. But this kind of gerrymandered dominance wasn\u2019t supposed to be allowed any more in Ohio. In 2015, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to limit partisan gerrymandering. Voting rights advocates and elections experts celebrated the measure\u2019s passage as a major win. But the state\u2019s new redistricting commission still had a GOP majority, and as they drew legislative and congressional maps in 2021, they refused to abide by the constitutional amendment\u2019s guidelines. The state supreme court ruled their maps unconstitutional five different times. But the commission refused to comply, repeatedly submitting to the court maps with minimal changes until the one Republican justice who opposed the gerrymandered maps retired from the court at the end of 2022. The commission made some changes to the maps in 2023 that softened, but did not eliminate, the Republican advantage. Crafting maps with a partisan advantage is only one of the ways Ohio Republicans have used the electoral process to cement their power in the state. The GOP-controlled state legislature enacted in January 2023 one of the strictest voter identification laws in the country \u2013 which voting rights groups have decried as disproportionately affecting poor and disabled voters. They have enacted voter purges, including one in 2019 that mistakenly removed about 40,000 eligible voters from the rolls. Last year, they tried and failed to make it harder for voters to amend the constitution through a direct vote \u2013 attempting to raise the threshold for ballot measures from a simple majority to more than 60%, in an explicit bid to block an abortion rights amendment that voters passed overwhelmingly in November. Now, Ohio voters are trying again to create a fair redistricting process through a ballot initiative that would create an independent redistricting commission rather than one led by politicians. The coalition has until July to collect more than 400,000 signatures for the question to appear on the November ballot. According to Catherine Turcer, the executive director of the government watchdog group Common Cause Ohio, which is part of the Citizens Not Politicians coalition, the group has trained about 2,000 volunteers to collect petition signatures. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s this disconnect between what it is that ordinary Ohioans want, and what it is that the state legislature chooses to do,\u201d said Turcer. \u201cThere is real interest in ensuring that we have accountable government.\u201d If voters choose to adopt the amendment in the Ohio constitution, an independent commission will draw the state\u2019s electoral maps, with a panel of judges determining members\u2019 eligibility to join the commission. Guardrails will be in place to prevent politicians and lobbyists from sitting on the board, narrowing the possibility of partisan influence on the map-drawing process. But unless and until those become law, Republican legislators can do just about anything they want. Zingarelli testified in front of lawmakers during numerous hearings at the Ohio state capitol to try to defend his daughter\u2019s right to access healthcare. He thought his pleas could get through to them. But his faith in the process has been shattered by the gerrymandered supermajority\u2019s veto override. \u201cMy big message has been, up until now, that you need to reach out to your legislators, and you need to let them know how you really feel, with the hope being that they would actually do their job and represent the will of their constituents,\u201d said Zingarelli. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that that\u2019s not something that is on their agenda.\u201d Julius Constantine Motal contributed to the reporting."

Italy was the first western country to report an outbreak and has the second highest Covid-related death toll to date in Europe, at more than 196,000. Only the UK\u2019s death toll is higher. The creation of a commission to examine \u201cthe government\u2019s actions and the measures adopted by it to prevent and address the Covid-19 epidemiological emergency\u201d was approved by the lower house of parliament after passing in the senate. A Covid-19 inquiry was among the election campaign pledges of the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, whose far-right government came to power in October 2022. Victims\u2019 families had protested against an inquiry proposal by the previous administration, a vast coalition led by Mario Draghi, after attempts were made by the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and the League, which governs the worst-hit Lombardy region, to narrow its scope by focusing only on the outbreak in China and introducing a cutoff date of 31 January 2020, therefore not examining the scramble by the Italian government to contain rapidly rising infections and deaths in the weeks that followed. Consuelo Locati, a lawyer representing hundreds of families who brought legal proceedings against former leaders, said: \u201cThe families were the first to ask for a commission and so for us this is a great victory. The commission is important because it has the task, at least on paper, to analyse what went wrong and the errors committed so as not to repeat the massacre we all suffered.\u201d The commission will investigate the actions of individuals including Giuseppe Conte, the former prime minister, Roberto Speranza, the former health minister, and Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. Conte, who now leads the Five Star Movement, which at the time was in government with the PD, accused Meloni\u2019s government of \u201ccowardice\u201d and of creating \u201can abnormal tool\u201d to politically attack its predecessors. \u201cBut you will not govern for life and this could prove to be a dangerous precedent,\u201d he said, adding that he had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d. Speranza claimed the objective of the commission was not to make the healthcare system more resilient but to vilify the former government. In June last year, prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province heavily hit by Covid-19 at the start of the pandemic, shelved an investigation into Conte and Speranza\u2019s management of the emergency after they found no evidence connecting the deaths to their failure to swiftly adopt measures to contain the escalating virus. Italy\u2019s first coronavirus case was confirmed in Codogno in southern Lombardy on 21 February 2020. Two days later, an outbreak occurred at the hospital in Alzano Lombardo, a town in Bergamo. However, unlike Codogno, where quarantine measures were implemented immediately along with nine other towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto, Bergamo went into lockdown with the entire Lombardy region two weeks later. A case brought by relatives of the deceased at Rome\u2019s civil court is ongoing. The court is examining the same evidence that Bergamo prosecutors did, including the alleged absence of an updated national pandemic plan. \u201cThe difference with the Rome case is that there will definitely be a sentence, which will either go in our favour or not,\u201d said Locati, whose father was among those to die early in the pandemic."

            "title": "What does Queensland\u2019s Covid-19 mandates ruling mean for other vaccines and other states?",
            "date": "2024-02-28T06:34:33Z",
            "content": "The Queensland supreme court has thrown out the state\u2019s Covid-19 vaccination mandate for paramedics and police, on the basis of the Human Rights Act. Guardian Australia spoke to a range of human rights experts to understand the ramifications of Tuesday\u2019s decision. What does the decision mean? It means 74 named applicants to the court, who are current employees of the ambulance and police services, cannot be fired or otherwise disciplined as a result of not following the vaccine mandate. What was the basis for the decision? There were essentially two different reasons for the decision, depending on whether applicants worked for the police force or Queensland health. Senior judge administrator Glenn Martin ruled that police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, didn\u2019t follow the right process under the Human Rights Act and \u201cfailed to give proper consideration to human rights relevant to those decisions. As a result, those decisions were unlawful\u201d. The court\u2019s decision was even more technical with regard to the ambulance service. That application succeeded because the health service was unable to provide sufficient evidence to show that the order was a power contained in an employment contract. The ambulance service order was not unlawful, just ineffective. Griffith University human rights law professor Sarah Joseph described it as a \u201cprocedural\u201d rather than \u201csubstantive\u201d breach of the act, and a narrow decision. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Is the decision final? Not necessarily. It could be appealed in the supreme court of appeal. Both Queensland health and the Queensland police said on Tuesday they were considering their legal options. How did this happen in the first place? The applicants challenged two decisions in 2021 and 2022 by the commissioner of police, and the then director general of Queensland health, Dr John Wakefield, that staff must be vaccinated against Covid-19 or else face disciplinary action or even sacking. Both mandates were quashed, in December 2022 and September 2023, respectively. After a 21-month wait, a joint judgment was handed down on Tuesday at the Queensland supreme court. It\u2019s the first time a vaccine mandate has failed in court in Australia. What does this mean for other states? The decision is very narrow and based on the state Human Rights Act, which only applies in Queensland. It is also based entirely on the way Queensland decision-makers issued that specific mandate. The only other state with a Human Rights Act is Victoria, which has a similar requirement for government to consider human rights when making decisions. The ACT also has a Human Rights Act. Theoretically, lawyers in those jurisdictions could make out a similar case that their state decision-makers failed to consider human rights properly before imposing vaccination mandates. Does it mean all vaccine mandates are illegal? Definitely not. In fact the court has explicitly ruled otherwise. Queensland health has imposed all sorts of vaccine mandates on its staff for a very long time. Nurses, doctors, paramedics and even health volunteers have to be vaccinated against various diseases, ranging from tuberculosis to whooping cough, to keep their job. They still do and these rules are all still legal. On Tuesday, the health minister, Shannon Fentiman, told media the decision did not affect the health directive imposed on the broader community of employees of Queensland health, including doctors and nurses, only employees of the ambulance service. Martin was asked to rule that the mandate violated rights against discrimination, to equality before the law, against torture, to freedom of political thought and belief, to privacy, to life, to take part in public life and the right to liberty and security, among others. He ruled none of these rights were limited at all. The only right that was impeded, he found, was the right not to be subjected to medical treatment without consent. Martin found public servants were coerced into vaccination because they feared loss of employment and income. However, the state\u2019s Human Rights Act does allow rights to be limited, the limits just need to be \u201cdemonstrably reasonable\u201d. Martin ruled that the restriction of that right was reasonable given the circumstances of the pandemic. However, the act doesn\u2019t just require a decision-maker to come to the right decision \u2013 they also have to do it the correct way, and document this process. Some lawyers say if the police commissioner had done so, the court might have ruled a different way on the police element of the case. Does it mean sacked police and paramedics can sue for compensation? Billionaire businessman Clive Palmer \u2013 who says he provided millions for the successful case \u2013 said he would be \u201chappy\u201d to fund future legal action, potentially a class action lawsuit. Lawyers for the police applicants also hinted at civil litigation in the future. Human rights professor Sarah Joseph said she couldn\u2019t predict how compensation claims would play out, but said \u201cthe chances of winning a litigation lawsuit against the government today are much bigger than they were yesterday\u201d. Benedict Coyne, who acted for many of the police service employees in the case, said the case would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on others outside the group of litigants, including officers who were sacked as a result of the mandates. What does this mean for the state Human Rights Act? Human rights advocates have celebrated the outcome. In a state without an upper house, Queensland has often been said to have an accountability deficit in its government. It\u2019s now clear the act is capable of acting as a check on the actions of governments. Michael Cope, the president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, said some elements of the judgment represented the first time sections of the Human Rights Act had been tested in the supreme court, blazing a precedent for future cases. \u201cThis is a reminder to everybody that that is the law in this state and if you don\u2019t do it, you can have your decision declared to be in breach of the Human Rights Act,\u201d Cope said."

            "content": "A California judge is facing accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior, antisemitic comments, drug use and a slew of ethic violations, according to a complaint filed by a state agency. The state\u2019s commission on judicial performance, which investigates alleged judicial misconduct, announced last week that it had filed formal proceedings to conduct an inquiry into Gregory J Kreis, a Humboldt county judge. Kreis is charged with \u201cmisconduct in office, conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute\u201d. The complaint lists 19 counts against him and details years of bad behavior, including repeatedly calling a colleague a \u201cJewboy\u201d, pantomiming \u201csomething similar to a lap dance\u201d against the wife of another colleague as she held her child, and drinking and driving. The judge in Humboldt county, on the state\u2019s far north coast, was first appointed to the bench in 2017 by then governor Jerry Brown while working at the county public defender\u2019s office as a supervising attorney. Kreis is currently seeking re-election and has cited his \u201ccommitment to public service and the law\u201d on his campaign website. He has described the allegations against him as \u201coutright lies\u201d. The complaint details disturbing behavior over the course of several years, both before and after he became a judge. During a May 2019 campout with several employees from the public defender\u2019s office, Kreis is alleged to have repeatedly demeaned deputy public defender Rory Kalin, referring to him as a \u201cJewboy\u201d multiple times, and at one point pushed him off a moving boat. At the same gathering, he allegedly performed the \u201clap dance\u201d on the wife of a colleague and \u201cmoaned or made other noises that suggested you were having sex\u201d. Kalin filed lawsuits against the county and Kreis, which were later dismissed. Kreis is also accused of having an \u201cintimate relationship\u201d with the court\u2019s family law facilitator. A courtroom clerk allegedly shared her suspicions of an affair between the two with other staff members and Kreis complained to the presiding judge about the clerk\u2019s behavior, the complaint states. The clerk was fired. At a 2018 party, Kreis allegedly grabbed the buttocks of a husband and his wife even after the woman told him not to do so. In 2019, Kreis allegedly took several women and a child on a driving tour while drinking, and allowed passengers to drink. At a party in 2015, before he became a judge, Kreis allegedly went into his friend\u2019s bedroom while she was sleeping, pulled down his pants and \u201chad [his] penis out and near her face as [he] tried to awaken her\u201d, according to the complaint. He is also accused of repeatedly failing to recuse himself from cases involving people he knew well and failing to disclose those relationships. In a statement on Instagram, Kreis said he was \u201cconfident the allegations and outright lies will be dismissed and clear my name\u201d. He appeared to allege that the timing of the complaint was intended to affect his re-election campaign."

            "date": "2024-02-02T12:00:04Z",
            "content": "A stretch of unusually warm weather has forced federal officials to temporarily halt researchers\u2019 annual count of wolves and moose in remote Isle Royale national park for the first time in more than six decades. Isle Royale is a 134,000-acre island situated in far western Lake Superior between Grand Marias, Minnesota, and Thunder Bay, Canada. The Michigan park is a wildlife biologist\u2019s dream \u2013 it offers a rare opportunity to observe wolves and moose without human influence. Researchers have conducted an annual survey of the park\u2019s wolf and moose population since 1958, every year except 2021, when the Covid-19 pandemic forced its cancelation. Scientists from Michigan Tech University returned to the island on 19 January, planning to survey the wolf and moose populations from the air through March, said Sarah Hoy, a Michigan Tech research assistant professor who leads the project alongside John Vucetich, a Michigan Tech forestry professor, and Rolf Peterson, a retired Michigan Tech ecology professor. Hoy said that the National Park Service suspended the survey on Tuesday and ordered everyone off the island. She said warm temperatures have left the ice around the island unsafe for the scientists\u2019 ski-planes to land. \u201cThe ice on the harbor was starting to deteriorate, I guess,\u201d Hoy said. \u201cWe lost some ice depth and a few holes and cracks were starting to appear \u2026 Everybody had to leave. So the island\u2019s now only occupied by wolves and moose and a bunch of critters. We\u2019re incredibly disappointed that we\u2019re not able to continue our work.\u201d Temperatures in the region have hovered above freezing since 24 January, about 20 degrees above average, according to the National Weather Service. The mercury hit 47F (8C) in the area on Wednesday. Hoy said helicopters were not an option because they are expensive to rent and so loud they would disturb the wildlife. The team may return to the park if temperatures drop and the ice firms up enough to support ski-planes again. It\u2019s too far to fly from the mainland to the island, complete survey circles and fly back, she said. Otherwise, the team may return to the park in spring by boat \u2013 but winter snow and bare branches makes tracking the animals much easier. The scientists\u2019 2022-23 survey put the number of wolves on the island at 31, up from 28 wolves the prior year, and the number of moose at 967, down 28% from 1,346. The team attributed the decline to lower survival rates for calves, starvation and wolf predation. The scientists calculated a rate of an estimated 0.52 moose killed for each wolf every month last year. Extreme weather across many parts of the US this winter has seen wild fluctuations amid the worsening climate crisis. Freezing temperatures have been prolonged in parts of the deep south and close to the Mexico border, while unseasonably balmy warmth has bathed parts of the far north, with a lack of snow in many ski areas and biblical deluges out west.

            "date": "2024-02-22T11:30:50Z",
            "content": "One of the most active and largest people-smuggling gangs operating in Calais has been dismantled with 19 arrested by German, French and Belgian police after a year-long investigation, Europol has announced. Operation Task Force Wave, involving 600 police, arrested the leader of the Iraqi Kurdish gang and five of the main organisers in Germany where the people-smuggling operation was orchestrated, police said. The swoop on numerous addresses comes less than two months after five people drowned in Wimereux, a resort close to Calais, attempting to cross the Channel during freezing temperatures in early January. Among the arrests were five \u201chigh value\u201d targets or people in controlling roles in the gang. Details of the investigation also lift the lid on how people-smuggling around Calais has been so successful, with almost 30,000 men, women and children crossing the Channel last year despite the risk of death. Cheap dinghies were imported from China and transported into Germany through a complex operation involving surveillance by the gangs and rest areas in Belgium, where the smugglers would wait with the boats until given the order to head to Calais. Premises in 28 locations were raided in Germany, with 12 boats, 179 life vests and 81 floatation devices for children seized along with 11 outboard motors, 10 engines and almost 60 electronic devices and a number of firearms. The suspects were all based in Germany and are being detained under Belgian and French judicial orders. Europol said: \u201cThe investigative activities, initiated at the end of 2022, identified the structure and modi operandi of this large criminal network, made up of Iraqi and Syrian nationals of Kurdish origin.\u201d Europol said the suspects \u201chad set up their own logistical infrastructure with specific branches in charge of organising delivery of large amounts of nautical equipment\u201d from China and into the EU via Turkey and on to France. Drivers typically transported eight boats at a time with \u201ca forerunner car\u201d scouting the route throughout the journey to avoid police detection. \u201cThe drivers were located in rest areas in Belgium before they drove the equipment to a spot at the time of departure,\u201d said Europol. \u201cWhen used legally, such boats would not be suitable nor safe for the transportation of more than 10 individuals. However, on average, smugglers put around 50 migrants in one of these boats. In total, the investigators have gathered evidence linking at least 55 departures that were facilitated solely by this smuggling network. The suspects collected between \u20ac1,000 [\u00a3856] and \u20ac3,000 per migrant for a place,\u201d said Europol. In a detailed four-page statement, Europol said small-boat smuggling activities had increased on the English route since 2019 and \u201care becoming increasingly violent while adapting\u201d activities and crossing points. It said the operations were complex, with intermediaries recruiting people hoping to cross, maintaining contacts with low-level criminals, overseeing logistical arrangements and handling payments while the gang bosses are often elsewhere. Police from Bruges and Lille were involved, with sources saying the gangs operating in the Calais region were either controlled or \u201chave to get the blessing of\u201d Iraqis who run the criminal operation from afar. EU police sources say people-smuggling on the northern French coast has been dominated by Iraqi gangs for years. The UK and the EU are about to agree a deal to share real-time data on migration in a further sign of thawing post-Brexit relations. The deal is expected to be signed in London on Friday by Sunak and the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, giving the UK access to Frontex (the EU\u2019s border agency) risk analysis and to information from Eurosur, the EU\u2019s drone and satellite surveillance of the Mediterranean and other external border areas."

            "date": "2024-02-11T07:00:07Z",
            "content": "Patients across England who failed to visit their dentists since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic have been systematically barred by some clinics from getting NHS treatment. Dental practices across the country informed patients they could no longer get NHS treatment, citing non-attendance over a period of two years or more that included lockdown. The Observer has established that many of these patients were not given any written warning and now face potential future treatment costs of thousands of pounds. The decision to \u201cde-list\u201d some NHS patients comes as the government faces growing anger over the state of dental care in the country, with many patients resorting to \u201cDIY dentistry\u201d out of desperation. Ministers last week launched a recovery plan, with \u00a320,000 bonuses for dentists in areas with the poorest access to NHS care. PM Rishi Sunak has repeatedly cited the \u00a33bn annual budget in England for NHS dentistry, but it has fallen in real terms by more than \u00a3500m in a decade. It also includes dental charges paid by NHS patients worth almost \u00a3747m in 2022/23, according to the latest accounts of the Department of Health and Social Care. This weekend, responding to the Observer\u2019s findings, Healthwatch England, the health and social care champion, said it wanted reforms to allow patients to register with a dental clinic in the same way as a GP surgery. Chris McCann, its director of campaigns, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for people to think that they are \u2018registered\u2019 with a dental practice only to discover that they have been \u2018de-listed\u2019 when they go to make an appointment. \u201cPeople want to sign up with a local NHS dentist in the same way as they register with a GP, knowing they\u2019ll be there for them in the long term.\u201d Under the current system, there is no official NHS dental registration scheme in England and practices can choose whether to provide NHS treatment on an individual basis. Sylvia Suddes, 59, a copy editor from Huddersfield, said she contacted her dental practice in the autumn of 2021, after pandemic lockdown restrictions had been lifted, and was told she could no longer get NHS treatment because of non-attendance. She has not seen a dentist since before lockdown. \u201cNone of my neighbours have got a NHS dentist,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they have a serious problem they call NHS 111.\u201d When Boris Johnson announced a lockdown in March 2020 to prevent the spread of coronavirus, routine dental care was suspended. Dentists were allowed to resume in June, but infection control meant clinics were only able to see a fraction of their usual patients. The British Dental Association (BDA) said in the year from March 2020 about 28m courses of NHS treatment were missed in England. Many people were anxious about appointments and some who have been \u201cde-listed\u201d said they were never contacted after lockdown. Trevor Maggs, 64, a writer, and his partner Gillian, 64, who live near Penzance in Cornwall, were told last week that NHS treatment at their local practice was no longer available because of non-attendance. They had been patients there since 2012. \u201cThey haven\u2019t refused to treat us, but have refused to treat us as NHS patients,\u201d Maggs said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got modest savings and spending thousands of pounds to have our teeth fixed is a bit galling.\u201d Maggs said his last appointment had been in early 2020 before lockdown. He said: \u201cWe are both still very cautious about Covid infections having had it quite badly very early in the first wave and at least once since.\u201d Lizzie Dunthorne, 32, a communications manager who lives in the Cotswolds, called to book a post-Covid dental appointment in August 2021. She was informed she had been could not have NHS care because she had not visited the clinic in Kidlington in Oxfordshire since late 2019. She was not given prior written notification. Dunthorne was unable to find another NHS practice and paid \u00a390 for a private appointment. \u201cThey told me two fillings needed redoing at \u00a3220 each,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t booked to go back.\u201d In Scotland, patients must be given three months\u2019 notice by a dental practice if it intends to remove them from a register. The rules do not apply in England, which allowed practices to \u201cde-list\u201d some NHS patients after the pandemic as they faced a backlog in care and the prospect of better returns from private practice. There is now scant chance in many areas of finding NHS treatment, as seen last week in Bristol, where hundreds of people queued outside the St Pauls Dental Practice in the hope of registering. Shawn Charlwood, chair of the BDA\u2019s general dental practice committee, said hundreds of practices were cross-subsidising their NHS activity with private work. \u201cMany dedicated colleagues are just looking for the exit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cash offered to dentistry doesn\u2019t even begin to reverse a decade of savage cuts.\u201d The BDA does not have figures on patients in England who have been told they are no longer eligible for NHS care at specific clinics, but says practices faced \u201cclear limits on patient throughput\u201d after the pandemic. The BDA says more than 12 million adults in England have unmet need for NHS dentistry, more than one in four of the adult population. An online survey of 500 UK dentists by the BDA last month found more than eight out of 10 had treated patients who had performed \u201cDIY dentistry\u201d. NHS dentistry was founded in 1948, with clinics typically operating independently, providing both NHS and private treatment. Dental charges for NHS patients were first introduced in 1951 and by 2006 covered more than 400 items. The BDA has called for a \u201cdecisive break\u201d from the current dental contract for dentists, which was introduced in 2006 and pays providers an annual sum for delivering an agreed number of courses of treatment. MPs have said the contract is not fit for purpose. The government said last week it was developing further proposals for dental contract reform. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cOur new dental recovery plan sets out how we will make access to dentistry faster, simpler and fairer. The plan \u2013 backed by \u00a3200m of government funding \u2013 will create an additional 2.5m dental appointments for patients over the next 12 months.\u201d \u201cThe government already invests more than \u00a33 billion each year to support NHS dentistry and we are starting to see progress. Last year, 1.7 million more adults and around 800,000 more children saw an NHS dentist compared to 2022.\u201d A Commons\u2019 health select committee report published in July recommended the government require patients to be registered with an NHS dentist. The government has said it has no plans to introduce official patient registration for dental services, because the current model allows \u201cgreater choice and flexibility for patients\u201d. An NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS plan for dentistry will make it easier for patients to get an appointment by supporting dentists to take on new patients and helping practices set up shop in areas where there aren\u2019t enough NHS appointments.\u201d Contributors who provided information for this article responded to a community callout. You can contribute to open callouts at the Guardian community team. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 February 2024 to refer to August 2021 being after pandemic lockdown restrictions had been lifted, rather than \u201cafter the pandemic\u201d as an earlier version said."

            "content": "Italy will carry out an inquiry into its handling of the coronavirus pandemic in a move hailed as \u201ca great victory\u201d by the relatives of people killed by the virus but criticised by those who were in power at the time. Italy was the first western country to report an outbreak and has the second highest Covid-related death toll to date in Europe, at more than 196,000. Only the UK\u2019s death toll is higher. The creation of a commission to examine \u201cthe government\u2019s actions and the measures adopted by it to prevent and address the Covid-19 epidemiological emergency\u201d was approved by the lower house of parliament after passing in the senate. A Covid-19 inquiry was among the election campaign pledges of the prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, whose far-right government came to power in October 2022. Victims\u2019 families had protested against an inquiry proposal by the previous administration, a vast coalition led by Mario Draghi, after attempts were made by the centre-left Democratic party (PD) and the League, which governs the worst-hit Lombardy region, to narrow its scope by focusing only on the outbreak in China and introducing a cutoff date of 31 January 2020, therefore not examining the scramble by the Italian government to contain rapidly rising infections and deaths in the weeks that followed. Consuelo Locati, a lawyer representing hundreds of families who brought legal proceedings against former leaders, said: \u201cThe families were the first to ask for a commission and so for us this is a great victory. The commission is important because it has the task, at least on paper, to analyse what went wrong and the errors committed so as not to repeat the massacre we all suffered.\u201d The commission will investigate the actions of individuals including Giuseppe Conte, the former prime minister, Roberto Speranza, the former health minister, and Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. Conte, who now leads the Five Star Movement, which at the time was in government with the PD, accused Meloni\u2019s government of \u201ccowardice\u201d and of creating \u201can abnormal tool\u201d to politically attack its predecessors. \u201cBut you will not govern for life and this could prove to be a dangerous precedent,\u201d he said, adding that he had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d. Speranza claimed the objective of the commission was not to make the healthcare system more resilient but to vilify the former government. In June last year, prosecutors in Bergamo, the Lombardy province heavily hit by Covid-19 at the start of the pandemic, shelved an investigation into Conte and Speranza\u2019s management of the emergency after they found no evidence connecting the deaths to their failure to swiftly adopt measures to contain the escalating virus. Italy\u2019s first coronavirus case was confirmed in Codogno in southern Lombardy on 21 February 2020. Two days later, an outbreak occurred at the hospital in Alzano Lombardo, a town in Bergamo. However, unlike Codogno, where quarantine measures were implemented immediately along with nine other towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto, Bergamo went into lockdown with the entire Lombardy region two weeks later. A case brought by relatives of the deceased at Rome\u2019s civil court is ongoing. The court is examining the same evidence that Bergamo prosecutors did, including the alleged absence of an updated national pandemic plan. \u201cThe difference with the Rome case is that there will definitely be a sentence, which will either go in our favour or not,\u201d said Locati, whose father was among those to die early in the pandemic."

            "date": "2024-02-21T09:00:11Z",
            "content": "\u2018In the dark times / Will there also be singing?\u201d muses Brecht in the Svendborg Poems. \u201cYes, there will also be singing / About the dark times.\u201d The impulse for lamentation in a crisis is instinctive and, perhaps, socially useful. But how we voice a response to catastrophe can be contentious, not least with the recent Covid pandemic. And while it may be too early to judge the overall effect of the crisis on the written word, we seem to have come out of it with more of a feeling of discord than harmony, and a sense that the plague and its quarantine accelerated an already existing divisiveness and cultural dissonance. So in many ways the publication of Fourteen Days could not have been more timely. Commissioned by the US Authors Guild Foundation, with proceeds going to support its charitable work, this is a collaborative novel set in New York at the start of lockdown, offering a collective narrative of that time and produced by 36 literary heavyweights from the US and Canada. Edited by Margaret Atwood and Douglas Preston, there\u2019s work here from an impressive list of writers, including Emma Donoghue, Ishmael Reed, Dave Eggers and Celeste Ng. The book is pitched as an \u201code to the power of storytelling and human connection\u201d, and the setting is an apartment building in Manhattan, where residents gather on the rooftop at twilight; socially distanced interactions develop as they begin telling tales. A shared sense of grief and isolation emerges and, as New York becomes the epicentre of the pandemic, the stories become \u201ca reminder of what we\u2019re losing, keeping people away from their loved ones as they die\u201d. An introduction explains that each character has been created by a different writer, and a wide-ranging cast reflects the diversity of the authors. The rooftop becomes a very crowded stage and each day a wonderful variety of testimonies is recounted. There are ghost stories, angels appearing in Mexico, a nun in a Catholic hospital who can predict when patients are about to die, war stories, a tale of gay adoption, an account of how Shakespeare survived the plague that devastated London in the 1590s. Even an anecdote about a pet rabbit becomes a parable about how shared trauma can act as a bond. The standout story for me is set in Texas in the 1970s, about a Black female country and western musician who falls in love with a white male star, \u201ckind of a cross between Kristofferson and Glen Campbell with a lot more grit\u201d. Harsh realities of time and place are captured with a real musicality, in a sad and beautiful ballad of doomed love. It\u2019s revealed at the back of the book to have been written by Alice Randall. The central narrator of the novel is the building\u2019s caretaker, Yessie, a second-generation Romanian-American lesbian whose prime motivation is to reach her father, who has Alzheimer\u2019s and is trapped in a nursing home in another part of the city. In the meantime she struggles to keep a thread running through the novel, diligently recording each evening gathering for us, referring to convenient notes left by the former caretaker that give useful character breakdowns and catchy nicknames for the residents. There\u2019s an awful lot of setup here, which hinders the sense of a coherent novel. Instead, a rather contrived frame story to the individual narratives is established, like Boccaccio\u2019s Decameron, itself set during the Black Death pandemic of 14th-century Europe. It\u2019s an obvious inspiration, though it doesn\u2019t get a mention until the 12th day. \u201cListening to all of you up here, hiding from the plague, telling stories,\u201d declares the Poet, a struggling Black writer and academic. \u201cHow could this whole thing not remind us of the Decameron?\u201d His own tale becomes something of a recursive satire, recounting a seminar in which diverse arts practitioners hold \u201cclassical readings about the plague now that it has been declared a national emergency\u201d. Representatives of various minorities at the seminar soon condemn Boccaccio as being homophobic, transphobic, ableist, elitist, antisemitic and racist. Here, as elsewhere, there is much debate about who is truly given a voice, where \u201cone person\u2019s censorship is another person\u2019s didacticism\u201d. And despite, or maybe because of, the discursive nature of the novel, a strong theme does emerge from the heart of it: the struggle for identity. The appearance of ghosts also becomes a recurring trope, providing a rather hokey denouement, but it\u2019s the spectre of the culture wars that truly haunts the book. Fourteen Days chronicles how Covid-19 exacerbated a fever of competing rights and fierce arguments over free speech and silencing. And it inadvertently pinpoints the effect that lockdown had on literature: how it has become increasingly solipsistic and autofictional, with lived experience valued over creative storytelling. The power of much of the writing here is undeniable, as is the sense of personal testimony. The fact that it doesn\u2019t cohere as a novel is perhaps the point, giving us a more accurate reflection of the fractured world we came back to. The imagination remained socially distanced, leaving us with a strange sense of collective isolation. \u2022 Fourteen Days: A Collaborative Novel, edited by Margaret Atwood and Douglas Preston, is published by Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a320.

            "date": "2024-02-28T14:00:19Z",
            "content": "The first tray of yellow-lidded specimen jars holds chunks of flesh \u2013 lung, perhaps, or muscle \u2013 some cerebrospinal fluid and another liquid, possibly from a brain abscess. The second holds a rainbow of colourful fungi, cultivated from those specimens. One growth is green and fluffy, like something you would find in a sharehouse fridge \u2013 penicillium, maybe. Another is a dark grey or brown, like animal fur. There are bright white fuzzballs and blackish blobs. One growth leaches red into the medium it sits in. Fungal pathogens come from all over Australia to this Adelaide laboratory, the National Mycological Reference Centre, for identification. Mycologists are on the lookout for new pathogens, which are starting to spread more because of climate change, and which can be deadly in the absence of effective antifungal drugs. They work under biohazard signs, sorting specimens and growing colonies on petri dishes, to slice off and put under the microscope. There\u2019s a weird, wonderful library of mycology books, a DNA sequencer and a reference collection with boxes and boxes full of vials, from azole-resistant Aspergillus to Zygomycetes. Dr Sarah Kidd is the centre\u2019s head. She was interested in Cryptococcus gattii, which live in eucalyptus trees and infect koalas, before she moved to Canada in 2006. And, serendipitously, there was a C gatti outbreak in Vancouver while she was there. It was a mystery how that fungus associated with Australia cropped up over there, but the theories are that it was something to do with changing global temperatures, perhaps some mutations. Asked if those mutations scare her, Kidd says it\u2019s \u201ccertainly not a good thing \u2026 but it keeps things interesting\u201d. The fascination with fungal pathogens has recently been piqued by the HBO series The Last of Us, which stars Pedro Pascal, Bella Ramsey and a host of humans turned into zombies by a parasitic fungal infection. \u201cThe fungus in The Last of Us, Cordyceps, it certainly does cause infection and sort of zombifies, if you will, insects,\u201d Kidd says. \u201cBut insects have a much cooler body temperature than humans \u2026 The vast majority of fungi cannot grow at 37C. So it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see a human brain fungus zombification. \u201cShows like The Last of Us have been really fantastic for drawing attention to mycology \u2026 Before that, I think people considered mycology to be about mushrooms, and foraging \u2026 or they knew that fungi can cause infections on skin, on toenails. \u201cBut I think very few people, even now, really appreciate that fungi cause life-threatening infections.\u201d There are hundreds of fungi that can affect humans. Almost 4m global deaths a year are associated with fungal infections, according to research published earlier this year in the Lancet \u2013 and it\u2019s likely that this figure is massively underreported. A pathogen of much more concern than Cordyceps at the moment is Candida auris. It affects immunocompromised patients, people in intensive care and people with cancer or HIV/Aids. Kidd says it can live on people, happily coexisting, until it finds its way into the bloodstream. It is resistant to many of the existing therapies and can spread easily from person to person \u2013 not unlike superbugs, bacterial infections that have grown resistant to antibiotics. \u201cThey\u2019re calling this the first fungal superbug,\u201d Kidd says, \u201cbecause it behaves like any of those resistant bacteria.\u201d Another pathogen starting to crop up in Australia is Trichophyton indotineae. It\u2019s a superficial rash, but it never goes away. People try to self-treat it with ointments, but they don\u2019t work and its resistance grows. \u201cYou can have whole families affected by these essentially incurable rashes,\u201d Kidd says. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see those come into Australia as well.\u201d Kidd returned to Australia from Canada to take over at the centre from emeritus mycologist David Ellis, a legend in the field. Ellis is quick to point to Kidd\u2019s impressive achievements, including a paper on fungal name changes that was listed in the Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2019s top 10 papers for the year, and the book Descriptions of Medical Fungi, on which she was the first author. A lack of treatments In 2022 the World Health Organization identified four fungal pathogens as \u201ccritical\u201d among 19 fungi that pose the biggest threat to public health: Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida auris, Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. The WHO emphasised the danger of having only a few antifungal medicines, the expansion of fungal diseases due to global warming and international travel and trade, and their increasing resistance to treatment. Dr Megan Lenardon, a microbiologist at the University of New South Wales, warned just a few weeks ago that fungi had historically been overlooked in infectious disease research. She has been studying the Candida species, which cause thrush infections in tens of millions of people each year. While thrush itself \u2013 an overgrowth of Candida often in the mouth or genital area \u2013 is generally not dangerous, Candida can become invasive and spread through the organs and bloodstream. \u201cWe call them \u2018opportunistic invasive\u2019 fungal pathogens because they don\u2019t kill healthy people,\u201d Lenardon says. \u201cBut if they find themselves in a host who is susceptible, then they can kill.\u201d Lenardon warns that fungi may evolve to resist higher temperatures, meaning they can survive in human bodies but says the likelihood of a pandemic is \u201cprobably still relatively low\u201d. Still, she says, there are no vaccines imminent and few preventive treatments in the pipeline. At the centre in Adelaide they can screen for infections and implement extra precautions with infected patients. They are working on specialised tests and treatments, and hope they will have enough to tackle what comes. Kidd says we \u201cdon\u2019t have a huge problem\u201d with Candida auris in Australia \u2013 \u201cyet\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 February 2024.

            "content": "Melbourne airport is facing its busiest day since before the pandemic and one-way domestic prices are surging in excess of $1,500 as Swiftie mania descends on the capital city. The pop superstar Taylor Swift has already touched down for the Australian leg of the sold-out Eras Tour, but the journey is just beginning for thousands of interstate fans making the trek to Melbourne ahead of her Friday night concert. A spokesperson for Melbourne airport said 117,000 passengers were expected to move through terminals on Friday \u2013 a post-Covid record. There were 775 take-offs and landings scheduled, also a record number. \u201cAirlines such as Qantas and Virgin Australia have added extra flights from key domestic destinations, and there are also extra flights operating from New Zealand to allow people to get to the concerts this weekend,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cFebruary is typically the quietest month for travel, so to be breaking records today is extraordinary.\u201d Social media users have reported an \u201celectric\u201d atmosphere on domestic flights to Melbourne, with a video of flight attendants dancing to Shake it Off going viral and an entire flight from Perth bursting in to an impromptu rendition of Cruel Summer. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Qantas added 60 additional flights in June last year to gear up for concert demand, including 24 additional flights between Sydney and Melbourne. In early February, a further four return flights were added between Melbourne and Auckland, Brisbane and Perth. The airline carrier is gearing up to carry 35% more passengers into Melbourne from its domestic and trans-Tasman network over the concert period compared with the same time last year. It came amid a 350% surge in bookings between New Zealand and Melbourne at the time of presale compared to the same time last year. For Swifties lucky enough to secure a last-minute ticket to Friday\u2019s concert, the next battle will be facing last-minute one-way flight costs \u2013 in excess of $1,000 \u2013 to make it to Melbourne in time. There were just a handful of options left from Sydney to Melbourne on Jetstar\u2019s website as of Friday morning, with prices ranging from $317 to $1,048 one way. Virgin was similarly pinched, with just half a dozen flights available that would get superfans to the MCG from Sydney by 6.30pm \u2013 costing from $551 to $859 economy one way. Qantas had half hourly flights available for the popular route from midday and flights every 10 to 15 minutes through from five to 7pm \u2013 but it would cost you. The cheapest option was $648 for economy, surging up to $1,630 for a business seat one way. The Melbourne airport spokesperson said due to the surging number of arriving passengers, staff had been working with ground transport operators to keep up with demand. Skybus had put on an extra six buses on Friday to assist with transfers to the city, while additional customer service staff were stationed around terminals to help arriving passengers. It comes amid controversy over Swift\u2019s heavy emitter status due to her penchant for private jet travel. More than 6,000 enthusiastic fans watched flight VJT993 carry Swift from Honolulu to Melbourne on Thursday evening \u2013 becoming the globe\u2019s most tracked aeroplane. Swift claims to have bought double the amount of carbon credits required to offset her travel for the Eras Tour. But according to Carbon Market Watch, she comes first in the list of celebrities with the highest Co2 emissions from flying, with her private jet usage amounting to an estimated 8,300 tonnes of carbon emissions in 2022. The figure is 1,800 times the average person\u2019s annual emissions."

            "date": "2024-02-25T13:00:00Z",
            "content": "Scientific discoveries can emerge from the strangest places. In early 1900s France, the doctor Albert Calmette and the veterinarian Camille Gu\u00e9rin aimed to discover how bovine tuberculosis was transmitted. To do so, they first had to find a way of cultivating the bacteria. Sliced potatoes \u2013 cooked with ox bile and glycerine \u2013 proved to be the perfect medium. As the bacteria grew, however, Calmette and Gu\u00e9rin were surprised to find that each generation lost some of its virulence. Animals infected with the microbe (grown through many generations of their culture) no longer became sick but were protected from wild TB. In 1921, the pair tested this potential vaccine on their first human patient \u2013 a baby whose mother had just died of the disease. It worked, and the result was the Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccine that has saved millions of lives. Calmette and Gu\u00e9rin could have never imagined that their research would inspire scientists investigating an entirely different kind of disease more than a century later. Yet that is exactly what is happening, with a string of intriguing studies suggesting that BCG can protect people from developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. If these preliminary results bear out in clinical trials, it could be one of the cheapest and most effective weapons in our fight against dementia. According to the World Health Organization, 55 million people now have dementia, with about 10 million new cases each year. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is by far the most common form, accounting for about 60%-70% of cases. It is characterised by clumps of a protein called amyloid beta that accumulate within the brain, killing neurons and destroying the synaptic connections between the cells. Exactly what causes the plaques to develop has been a mystery, but multiple lines of evidence implicate problems with the immune system. When we are young, our body\u2019s defences can prevent bacteria, viruses or fungi from reaching the brain. As we get older, however, they become less efficient, which may allow microbes to work their way into our neural tissue. According to this theory, the amyloid beta is produced to kill those invaders as a short-term defence against infection. If the brain\u2019s own immune cells \u2013 known as microglia \u2013 were working optimally, they could clear away the protein once the threat has passed. But in many cases of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, they seem to malfunction, triggering widespread inflammation that leads to further neural carnage. A wealth of evidence now supports this theory. Autopsies have revealed brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s are more likely to be home to common microbes such as the herpes simplex virus, the cause of cold sores. Crucially, these germs are often entrapped in the amyloid, which has been proven to have antimicrobial properties. If this theory is correct, attempts to boost the immune system\u2019s overall functioning could prevent the development of the disease. New approaches are certainly needed. After decades of research on ways to clear the plaques, only two new drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Both are based on antibodies that bind to the amyloid beta proteins, triggering an immune response that clears them out of the brain. This appears to slow disease progression in some patients, but the improvement in overall quality of life is often limited. Anti-amyloid antibodies also come with a hefty price tag. \u201cThe cost of treatment is likely to lead to an enormous health equity gap in lower-income countries,\u201d says Marc Weinberg, who researches Alzheimer\u2019s at Massachusetts general hospital in Boston. (He emphasises his opinions are personal and do not reflect those of his institution.) Could existing vaccines such as BCG offer an alternative solution? * * * The idea may sound far-fetched, but decades of research show that BCG can have surprising and wide-ranging benefits that go way beyond its original purpose. Besides protecting people from TB, it seems to reduce the risk of many other infections, for instance. In a recent clinical trial, BCG halved the odds of developing a respiratory infection over the following 12 months, compared with the people receiving a placebo. BCG is also used as a standard treatment for forms of bladder cancer. Once the attenuated bacteria have been delivered to the organ, they trigger the immune system to remove the tumours, where previously they had passed below the radar. \u201cIt can result in remarkable disease-free recoveries,\u201d says Prof Richard Lathe, a molecular biologist at Edinburgh University. These remarkable effects are thought to emerge from a process called \u201ctrained immunity\u201d. After an individual has received BCG, you can see changes in the expression of genes associated with the production of cytokines \u2013 small molecules that can kick our other defences, including white blood cells, into action. As a result, the body can respond more efficiently to a threat \u2013 be it a virus or bacteria entering the body, or a mutant cell that threatens to grow uncontrollably. \u201cIt can be likened to upgrading the security system of a building to be more responsive and efficient, not just against known threats but against any potential intruders,\u201d says Weinberg. There are good reasons to believe that trained immunity could reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. By bolstering the body\u2019s defences, it could help keep pathogens at bay before they reach the brain. It could also prompt the brain\u2019s own immune cells to clear away the amyloid beta proteins more effectively, without causing friendly fire to healthy neural tissue. Animal studies provide some tentative evidence. Laboratory mice immunised with BCG have reduced brain inflammation, for example. This results in notably better cognition, when other mice of the same age begin to show a steady decline in their memory and learning. But would the same be true of humans? To find out, Ofer Gofrit of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centre in Jerusalem and his colleagues collected the data of 1,371 people who had or had not received BCG as part of their treatment for bladder cancer. They found that just 2.4% of the patients treated with BCG developed Alzheimer\u2019s over the following eight years, compared with 8.9% of those not given the vaccine. Since the results were published in 2019, other researchers have replicated the findings. Weinberg\u2019s team, for instance, examined the records of about 6,500 bladder cancer patients in Massachusetts. Crucially, they ensured that the sample of those who had received BCG and those who hadn\u2019t were carefully matched for age, gender, ethnicity and medical history. The people who had received the injection, it transpired, were considerably less likely to develop dementia. The precise level of protection varies between studies, with a recent meta-analysis showing an average risk reduction of 45%. If this can be proven with further studies, the implications would be huge. \u201cSimply delaying the development of Alzheimer\u2019s by a couple of years would lead to tremendous savings \u2013 both in suffering and our money,\u201d says Prof Charles Greenblatt of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who was a co-author of Gofrit\u2019s original paper. * * * Plenty of caution is necessary. The existing papers have all examined patients with bladder cancer, but as yet there is little data on the general population. One obvious strategy may be to compare people who have received the BCG vaccine during childhood with those who hadn\u2019t, but the effects of BCG may dwindle over the decades \u2013 long before most people would be in danger of developing Alzheimer\u2019s. We can, however, examine the effects of other vaccines delivered in old age. With its live (but attenuated) bacteria, BCG is thought to provide the most potent immune training, but other vaccines may also stimulate the body\u2019s defences. Consider the flu jab. Nicola Veronese of the University of Palermo in Italy and her colleagues recently analysed the results of nine studies, many of which controlled for lifestyle factors, including income, education, smoking, alcohol consumption and hypertension. The team found that the influenza vaccine was associated with a 29% reduced risk of dementia. \u201cTwo studies also showed an association between the number of doses, over previous years, and the incidence of dementia,\u201d says Veronese. Such studies still cannot prove causality. \u201cIn this kind of epidemiological research, it may be that there\u2019s a confounding factor that\u2019s lurking that isn\u2019t properly accounted for,\u201d says Jeffrey Lapides of Drexel University College of Medicine in Pennsylvania, though he agrees that the vaccine effects on dementia are plausible and deserve more research. The clinching evidence would come from a randomised controlled trial in which patients are either assigned the active treatment or the placebo. Since dementia is very slow to develop, it will take years to collect enough data to prove that BCG \u2013 or any other vaccine \u2013 offers the expected protection from full-blown Alzheimer\u2019s compared with a placebo. In the meantime, scientists have started to examine certain biomarkers that show the early stages of disease. Until recently, this was extraordinarily difficult to do without expensive brain scans, but new experimental methods allow scientists to isolate and measure levels of amyloid beta proteins in blood plasma, which can predict a subsequent diagnosis with reasonable accuracy. A pilot study by Coad Thomas Dow of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues suggests that BCG injections can effectively reduce plasma amyloid levels, particularly among those carrying the gene variants associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer\u2019s. Although the sample size was small \u2013 just 49 participants in total \u2013 it has bolstered hopes that immune training will be an effective strategy for fighting the disease. \u201cThese results were encouraging,\u201d says Weinberg, who was not involved in the study. Weinberg has his own grounds for optimism. Working with Dr Steven Arnold and Dr Denise Faustman, he has collected samples of the cerebrospinal fluid that washes around the central nervous system of people who have or have not received the vaccine. Their aim was to see whether the effects of trained immunity could reach the brain \u2013 and that is exactly what they found. \u201cThe response to pathogens is more robust in specific populations of these immune cells after BCG vaccination,\u201d says Weinberg. We can only hope that these early results will inspire further trials. For Weinberg, it\u2019s simple. \u201cThe BCG vaccine is safe and globally accessible,\u201d he says. It is also incredibly cheap compared with the other options, costing just a few pence a dose. Even if it confers just a tiny bit of protection, he says: \u201cIt wins the cost-effectiveness contest hands down.\u201d As Calmette and Gu\u00e9rin discovered with their potato slices more than a century ago, progress may come when you least expect it. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 February 2024 to correct an instance of a misspelling of Marc Weinberg\u2019s surname. \u2022 The Expectation Effect: How Your Mindset Can Transform Your Life by David Robson is published by Canongate (\u00a310.99).

            "content": "Responding to an expert\u2019s statement that \u201cabout 3.2 million\u201d American lives have been saved by vaccines against Covid, with \u201cover 14 million lives\u201d saved globally, the far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene said: \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, but I have a PhD in recognising bullshit when I hear it.\u201d On Capitol Hill on Thursday, Greene attended a hearing staged by the House oversight select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic. The expert Greene responded to, Dr Peter Marks, the director of biologics evaluation and research at the Food and Drug Administration, also described how at the height of the pandemic in the US, \u201cabout 3,300 [people], about a World Trade Center disaster a day\u201d, were dying of Covid-19, contributing to a death toll of more than 1.1m. Marks later apologised to viewers, after Greene claimed children should not be given Covid vaccines. Greene, from Georgia, is a former CrossFit gym owner, conspiracy theorist and controversialist who entered Congress in 2021 and has assumed an influential position in a House Republican caucus controlled by the far right. Touting herself as a possible vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump, she is set to act as a manager in the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, a process Greene drove in the House. Speaking after Marks answered questions from the Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin, Greene first dismissed the doctor\u2019s comments as \u201cbullshit\u201d. Then she used her allotted five minutes to deliver rambling remarks about \u201call kinds of injuries, miscarriages, heart attacks, myocarditis, permanent disability, neurological problems\u201d that she said had arisen from \u201cpeople being forced to take vaccines\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been thousands of peer-reviewed medical studies, thousands of them studying vaccine injuries,\u201d Greene said. \u201cThey are real. People are dying. \u201cPeople are having heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, and many other countries are dropping the Covid-19 vaccine and saying we shouldn\u2019t give them to children. It\u2019s time to be honest about the vaccine-injured and we need to stop allowing these Covid-19 vaccines to be given out to children.\u201d The next speaker, the California Democrat Robert Garcia, said: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you all had to go through that. That was a lot of conspiracy theories and wild accusations, which we know have been debunked by medical science. We should be clear that vaccines work and have saved lives, and have saved millions of lives in this country.\u201d Garcia displayed blow-ups of tweets and comments in which Greene has spread conspiracy theories and misinformation including comparing pandemic public health rules to the Holocaust, encouraging parents to deny Covid vaccines to children and claiming vaccines contribute to an increase in \u201cturbo cancers\u201d. As Greene indicated her displeasure, Garcia asked Dr Marks to \u201cclarify once again for the American people, do the Covid vaccines cause \u2018turbo cancers\u2019?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a haematologist and oncologist that\u2019s board certified,\u201d Marks said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what a \u2018turbo cancer\u2019 is. It was a term that was used first in a paper on mouse experiments, describing an inflammatory response. We have not detected any increase in cancers with the Covid-19 vaccines.\u201d As Garcia began to speak, Marks interjected. \u201cMay I just add something here,\u201d he said. \u201cI do need to apologise to the thousand or so parents of children under four years of age who have died of Covid-19, who were unvaccinated. Because there were deaths and there continue to be deaths among children, and that is the reason why they need to get vaccinated. Thank you.\u201d"

            "content": "Two new but exceptionally rare Covid-19 vaccine side effects \u2013 a neurological disorder and inflammation of the spinal cord \u2013 have been detected by researchers in the largest vaccine safety study to date. The study of more than 99 million people from Australia, Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, New Zealand and Scotland also confirmed how rare known vaccine complications are, with researchers confirming that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccines still \u201cvastly outweigh the risks\u201d. Researchers working as part of the Global Vaccine Data Network used deidentified electronic healthcare data to compare the rates of 13 brain, blood and heart conditions in people after they received the Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccine with the rate that would be expected of those conditions in the population before the pandemic. The study confirmed with a high level of accuracy known links between mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) vaccines and the rare side-effects of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (swelling of the thin sac covering the heart). It also confirmed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (where the immune system attacks the nerves) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (a type of blood clot in the brain) as rare side effects linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But a new rare side-effect, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis \u2013 an inflammation and swelling in the brain and spinal cord \u2013 was also identified in the data analysis as being linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. The findings were published in the international journal Vaccine on Friday. Prof Jim Buttery, co-director of the Global Vaccine Data Network, said the finding prompted researchers to independently confirm the side-effect by completing a second study, this time analysing a separate dataset of 6.8 million Australians who received the AstraZeneca vaccine. Not only did the Australian study confirm acute disseminated encephalomyelitis as a rare side-effect, but the large amount of AstraZeneca-specific data also allowed them to detect a second new rare side-effect, known as transverse myelitis, or spinal cord inflammation. Also published in Vaccine on Friday, the Australian study found the data translated to an extremely small risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis of 0.78 cases for every million doses, and 1.82 cases per million doses for transverse myelitis. Buttery, who is also a senior research analyst with the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Australia, said \u201cfor rare side effects, we don\u2019t learn about them until the vaccine has been used in millions of people\u201d. \u201cNo clinical trial can ever have the size to answer those questions and so we only find out those questions after a vaccine has been introduced.\u201d Buttery said the risk of myocarditis is even higher with natural Covid infection than it is following vaccination. Both conditions are serious but patients usually recover from them, he said. Prof Julie Leask, a vaccine expert at the University of Sydney, said it\u2019s important to keep these findings in perspective and that a Covid infection increases the risk of some of these rare conditions \u201cmuch more than a vaccine\u201d does. She said the studies also confirmed that \u201cour vaccine experts are paying attention to when vaccines lead to serious side-effects, and they\u2019re acting on it\u201d. \u201cBeing confident in a system that will detect problems and address them, is a very important part of a robust vaccination program.\u201d"

            "title": "What does Queensland\u2019s Covid-19 mandates ruling mean for other vaccines and other states?",
            "date": "2024-02-28T06:34:33Z",
            "content": "The Queensland supreme court has thrown out the state\u2019s Covid-19 vaccination mandate for paramedics and police, on the basis of the Human Rights Act. Guardian Australia spoke to a range of human rights experts to understand the ramifications of Tuesday\u2019s decision. What does the decision mean? It means 74 named applicants to the court, who are current employees of the ambulance and police services, cannot be fired or otherwise disciplined as a result of not following the vaccine mandate. What was the basis for the decision? There were essentially two different reasons for the decision, depending on whether applicants worked for the police force or Queensland health. Senior judge administrator Glenn Martin ruled that police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, didn\u2019t follow the right process under the Human Rights Act and \u201cfailed to give proper consideration to human rights relevant to those decisions. As a result, those decisions were unlawful\u201d. The court\u2019s decision was even more technical with regard to the ambulance service. That application succeeded because the health service was unable to provide sufficient evidence to show that the order was a power contained in an employment contract. The ambulance service order was not unlawful, just ineffective. Griffith University human rights law professor Sarah Joseph described it as a \u201cprocedural\u201d rather than \u201csubstantive\u201d breach of the act, and a narrow decision. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Is the decision final? Not necessarily. It could be appealed in the supreme court of appeal. Both Queensland health and the Queensland police said on Tuesday they were considering their legal options. How did this happen in the first place? The applicants challenged two decisions in 2021 and 2022 by the commissioner of police, and the then director general of Queensland health, Dr John Wakefield, that staff must be vaccinated against Covid-19 or else face disciplinary action or even sacking. Both mandates were quashed, in December 2022 and September 2023, respectively. After a 21-month wait, a joint judgment was handed down on Tuesday at the Queensland supreme court. It\u2019s the first time a vaccine mandate has failed in court in Australia. What does this mean for other states? The decision is very narrow and based on the state Human Rights Act, which only applies in Queensland. It is also based entirely on the way Queensland decision-makers issued that specific mandate. The only other state with a Human Rights Act is Victoria, which has a similar requirement for government to consider human rights when making decisions. The ACT also has a Human Rights Act. Theoretically, lawyers in those jurisdictions could make out a similar case that their state decision-makers failed to consider human rights properly before imposing vaccination mandates. Does it mean all vaccine mandates are illegal? Definitely not. In fact the court has explicitly ruled otherwise. Queensland health has imposed all sorts of vaccine mandates on its staff for a very long time. Nurses, doctors, paramedics and even health volunteers have to be vaccinated against various diseases, ranging from tuberculosis to whooping cough, to keep their job. They still do and these rules are all still legal. On Tuesday, the health minister, Shannon Fentiman, told media the decision did not affect the health directive imposed on the broader community of employees of Queensland health, including doctors and nurses, only employees of the ambulance service. Martin was asked to rule that the mandate violated rights against discrimination, to equality before the law, against torture, to freedom of political thought and belief, to privacy, to life, to take part in public life and the right to liberty and security, among others. He ruled none of these rights were limited at all. The only right that was impeded, he found, was the right not to be subjected to medical treatment without consent. Martin found public servants were coerced into vaccination because they feared loss of employment and income. However, the state\u2019s Human Rights Act does allow rights to be limited, the limits just need to be \u201cdemonstrably reasonable\u201d. Martin ruled that the restriction of that right was reasonable given the circumstances of the pandemic. However, the act doesn\u2019t just require a decision-maker to come to the right decision \u2013 they also have to do it the correct way, and document this process. Some lawyers say if the police commissioner had done so, the court might have ruled a different way on the police element of the case. Does it mean sacked police and paramedics can sue for compensation? Billionaire businessman Clive Palmer \u2013 who says he provided millions for the successful case \u2013 said he would be \u201chappy\u201d to fund future legal action, potentially a class action lawsuit. Lawyers for the police applicants also hinted at civil litigation in the future. Human rights professor Sarah Joseph said she couldn\u2019t predict how compensation claims would play out, but said \u201cthe chances of winning a litigation lawsuit against the government today are much bigger than they were yesterday\u201d. Benedict Coyne, who acted for many of the police service employees in the case, said the case would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on others outside the group of litigants, including officers who were sacked as a result of the mandates. What does this mean for the state Human Rights Act? Human rights advocates have celebrated the outcome. In a state without an upper house, Queensland has often been said to have an accountability deficit in its government. It\u2019s now clear the act is capable of acting as a check on the actions of governments. Michael Cope, the president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, said some elements of the judgment represented the first time sections of the Human Rights Act had been tested in the supreme court, blazing a precedent for future cases. \u201cThis is a reminder to everybody that that is the law in this state and if you don\u2019t do it, you can have your decision declared to be in breach of the Human Rights Act,\u201d Cope said."

            "date": "2024-02-12T10:36:55Z",
            "content": "Fewer people with mental illnesses would endure the trauma of being sectioned if advance choice documents \u2013 setting out a treatment plan while they are well \u2013 were included in Mental Health Act reforms, a leading psychiatrist has said. Advance choice documents are the only proven way to reduce the number of people detained under the Mental Health Act in England and Wales, which is one of the reforms\u2019 core objectives, said Dr Lade Smith, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Research suggests that the use of these documents can reduce compulsory detention rates in psychiatric units, often known as sectioning, by 25%, minimising traumatic experiences for people with bipolar, schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s high time there was reform of the Mental Health Act because the rates of detention are increasing, especially for marginalised groups, those who are poor or from a minoritised ethnic community, especially black Caribbean \u2026 Advance choice docs were a recommendation of the review, I don\u2019t know why they haven\u2019t gone through,\u201d said Smith. Advance choice documents are especially effective in reducing the significantly higher detention rates for black people with mental illnesses, as they can help patients feel more autonomous and reduce unconscious bias. The documents can also speed up and improve recovery, and reduce the time spent in hospital, which can have a negative impact on patients\u2019 jobs, homes or relationships, said Smith. Advance choice documents are similar to those used in palliative care. Patients work with a healthcare professional when they are well to outline the signs that they are experiencing a manic or psychotic episode, effective treatments, and their personal preferences. This could include background information and trigger questions to help healthcare practitioners establish delusional thought patterns; medications and doses which have been effective previously; and requests to be put in hospital for their own safety, or \u2013 more unusually \u2013 that of others. Although the documents are now included in NHS guidance, take-up remains low, due to limited awareness, logistical challenges and a misconception that patients may ask for ineffective treatments, such as Reiki healing, said Smith. \u201cIdeally, there should be a mandatory requirement of services to offer advance choice documents to anybody who\u2019s ever been detained under the Mental Health Act \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to see,\u201d she said. King\u2019s College London is aiming to boost awareness with a new site, which will be used as a resource on the NHS to spur a culture shift towards shared decision-making. Dr Tania Gergel, a researcher at UCL who is leading on the Advance Choice project, said this would represent a move away from the \u201cpaternalistic\u201d model of psychiatry, reflecting that \u201cpeople have a very good understanding of their illness\u201d. In interviews for the project, she found examples where clinicians refused to follow the advance choice document. One patient had written that an antipsychotic worked for them at a lower dose, while the usual prescribed dose made them physically unwell, but this was ignored and recovery was only achieved through a traumatic process of trial and error after being sectioned. Others said they hated being injected, which is common in forcible detentions, including in their buttocks while being held down in the middle of a ward. \u201cPeople can feel that who they are as a person becomes completely erased,\u201d said Gergel. Gergel, who has bipolar, believes that advance choice documents have saved her life, as she experiences severe mixed manic and psychotic episodes in which she quickly becomes uncontrollably suicidal. She has struggled to stay safe as she is good at concealing her symptoms. Her document contains trigger questions to help doctors tease out her delusions, and includes a \u201cself-binding\u201d agreement, meaning that when these symptoms are present she needs to be treated and supervised immediately for her own safety. It adds that conventional medications have not worked for her and that she needs electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) \u2013 this helped doctors secure hospital approval to give it to her during pregnancy, a treatment typically avoided despite no evidence of harm to the baby. She said the document helps her understand intellectually why it\u2019s important to stay in hospital, even if she feels a desire to abscond. Since writing it, she said her episodes have been \u201cmuch calmer\u201d. \u201cIt has really worked, and has meant I\u2019ve stayed safe although I\u2019ve been deeply suicidal. When I reflect afterwards, no matter how difficult the episode has been, the trauma is nothing compared to when it was formal detention and literally being held down.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the draft mental health bill did not include provisions for a statutory advance choice document because \u201cit is important that a person can make advance choices in a way that best meets their needs, which may not always be in a written document\u201d. Instead, the draft bill gives advance choices the same legal weight without requiring a statutory document. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "date": "2024-02-29T12:00:16Z",
            "content": "A woman who says she sold nearly $50m in products for Gucci is accusing the fashion label of forcing her to work around the clock while enduring discriminatory comments about her age and mental health before she was fired for formally complaining about her working conditions. In a pending lawsuit filed in federal court in Chicago, Tracy Cohen contends that her experience during a nearly 18-year career at Gucci is only one of several cases which illustrate a toxic work culture at the renowned luxury brand. Cohen\u2019s suit refers to eight cases alleging that Gucci officials, between 2010 and 2022, maintained sweatshop conditions in China, forced pregnant workers to have abortions, ignored sexual harassment claims, and even required women to wear straitjackets on the modelling runway against their will. \u201cThis is a pattern of conduct that they have engaged in for years,\u201d Cohen\u2019s attorney, Tamara Holder, said in an interview. \u201cHow they treated Tracy, how they treat women \u2026 I believe that Gucci needs to be held accountable for that.\u201d Neither Gucci nor its corporate owner, Kering, responded to a request for comment on the claims from Cohen and Holder, known in legal and media circles as a former left-leaning commentator on Fox News who won a multimillion dollar sexual assault settlement from the rightwing network. Cohen\u2019s lawsuit said she joined Gucci\u2019s Chicago store as a sales associate in 2006, when she was 38. She said she earned recognition as the store\u2019s No 1 salesperson by 2018, accounting for about 15% of the location\u2019s monthly sales and outshining about 20 peers. Gucci responded to Cohen\u2019s success by saddling her with an even higher \u2013 and ultimately unrealistic \u2013 sales quota, the lawsuit alleged. Cohen said the company promised to reward her with an assistant as well as international travel and attendance to glamorous fashion shows in Milan, Los Angeles and New York. But in reality, Cohen said her work required to stay on her mobile devices around the clock. She had to work unpaid overtime and avoided taking time off because she felt her job was in constant jeopardy. Cohen said she repeatedly told her superiors that she was exhausted, anxious and depressed in that climate. In return, she said, they insulted her as \u201ccrazy\u201d and old, gave away her promised travel incentives to younger, lower-performing colleagues and hiked up her sales quota. In September 2022, Cohen said she sought help by emailing Gucci president Marco Bizzarri, but he did not reply. She said that left her feeling as if there was no internal support available, and she filed complaints with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as well as the Illinois human rights department, alleging discrimination over her age, gender and battles with anxiety and depression. The lawsuit said Cohen continued performing well \u2013 her managers as recently as last summer even told her that her sales had helped them achieve their bonuses, she said. But she said she signed her professional \u201cdeath warrant\u201d by filing her EEOC and state human rights complaints, which were required to preserve the option of eventually pursuing a lawsuit if necessary. Cohen said Gucci suspended her for the first time in her career in July. Without elaborating, the lawsuit said her suspension paperwork \u201clisted incidents that allegedly occurred nine months prior\u201d, and the plaintiff alleges that discipline was simply retaliation. The lawsuit said Cohen served her suspension and soon helped sell $80,000 of customized goods to clients with whom she had a close relationship. Then, in October, the store fired her without severance, citing a pair of episodes in September that the lawsuit did not detail. The store waited until after Cohen\u2019s dismissal to deliver the $80,000 in customized orders, ensuring the commission went to associates and managers still at the location rather than to her, she said in the lawsuit, first filed in late January but not previously reported on. Cohen\u2019s lawsuit said she is among the 63% of workers who \u2013 according to a study at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst \u2013 eventually lost their jobs after complaining to the EEOC about their employers. She demands damages, contending that her former bosses violated several laws prohibiting discrimination, retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, abusive labor standards and unfair wages. The lawsuit also argued that Cohen deserved damages because Gucci subjected her to tactics frequently used by labor traffickers, including by duping her with promises that if she just stuck it out a little longer she would eventually receive compensation commensurate with her unpaid sacrifices. Holder \u2013 whose past clients include 50 plaintiffs who settled a sexual harassment lawsuit against the Twin Peaks restaurant chain \u2013 said attorneys for Gucci threatened to seek legal sanctions against her if she didn\u2019t remove the trafficking allegations. But Holder said she had no intention of doing that. \u201cThis case,\u201d Holder said, \u201chas international importance for \u2026 working women\u201d."

            "date": "2024-02-07T00:01:04Z",
            "content": "The number of children referred to emergency mental healthcare in England has soared by more than 50% in three years, according to data laying bare the impact of lengthy waiting lists for regular NHS treatment. There were 32,521 emergency and urgent referrals to child and adolescent mental health services crisis teams in 2022-23, analysis of official data by the Royal College of Psychiatrists revealed. In 2019-20, the year before the Covid pandemic, the figure was 21,242. The increase means that more than 600 mentally ill children a week are deteriorating to such a state that they have reached crisis point, according to a separate review of NHS figures by the Guardian. Many of the children requiring emergency care \u2013 some suicidal or seriously ill as a result of eating disorders \u2013 have been stuck on waiting lists for an average of five months, and in the worst cases as long as two years. MPs and health leaders said the NHS figures exposed a \u201cdevastating explosion\u201d of untreated severe mental ill health among children, and should be a wake-up call for the government. There was now a serious risk that the alarming surge in children reaching crisis point before being able to access help was becoming \u201cthe new norm\u201d, they added. \u201cNo one should have to watch their child\u2019s mental health deteriorate while they wait for care,\u201d the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Lade Smith, told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable that this is the reality facing so many families.\u201d Ministers must take urgent action to provide targeted support to every child in need of mental healthcare and \u201cturn the tide\u201d on the country\u2019s growing children\u2019s mental health crisis, Smith said. \u201cWe want to provide young people with effective care as soon as they need it, not once they\u2019ve already developed a serious illness which could have been prevented,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to see government focus on prevention and reversing the rising rates of mental illness, as well as ensuring sufficient resourcing of specialist services.\u201d Record numbers of children and young people are seeking help for mental health problems. In 2022 alone, 1.4 million were referred to child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) for treatment of anxiety, depression, eating disorders and other psychological problems. But as demand soars for children\u2019s mental healthcare, Camhs teams are struggling to see children quickly enough. Experts say that is leading to thousands of under-18s getting even sicker while on waiting lists, prompting a 53% rise in emergency and urgent referrals for Camhs crisis care. An emergency referral is normally made if a child needs to be seen within 24 hours. They might be a risk to themselves due to suicidal feelings, have a significant health risk because of an illness such as anorexia or have another serious mental health condition, experts told the Guardian. Emergency referrals to Camhs are mostly made by GPs and doctors in A&amp;E departments, which are seeing rising numbers of mentally ill children arrive with nowhere else to turn, though schools and social services can also do so. Dr Elaine Lockhart, the chair of the college\u2019s child and adolescent faculty, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that so many children and young people are reaching crisis point before they are able to access care. We cannot allow this to become the new norm. \u201cSevere mental illness is not just an adult problem. The need for specialist mental health services for children and young people is growing all the time.\u201d Many of the conditions arising in children could be prevented or treated if prompt support and access to care were available, Lockhart said. \u201cThe evidence shows us that children who receive support quickly are less likely to develop long-term conditions that negatively affect their education, social development and health in later life. \u201cGovernment and integrated care boards must commit to reducing the rate of mental illness among children by setting an achievable target. This needs to be backed by an expansion of the mental health workforce and additional funding for services.\u201d The college welcomed last year\u2019s government announcement of an extra \u00a35m to improve access to early support hubs for people aged 11 to 25. But it said an extra \u00a3125m to \u00a3205m would be needed to establish hubs in every local authority, with running costs of at least \u00a3114m a year. \u201cEvery young person should be able to access the help they need when they need it,\u201d said Laura Bunt, the chief executive of YoungMinds, a children\u2019s mental health charity. \u201cThe government must prioritise young people\u2019s mental health and make it much easier for them to get support.\u201d Daisy Cooper MP, the Lib Dem health spokesperson, said: \u201cThis devastating explosion of mental ill health among children should be a wake-up call for the government. Conservative ministers have neglected children\u2019s mental health during and after the pandemic, leaving mental health services and families in crisis.\u201d NHS England said it was treating more young people than ever before, and was expanding mental health services as quickly as possible to meet increasing demand. A spokesperson said: \u201cEarly support for children and young people with mental health issues is a priority for the NHS, and plans are in place to ensure more than one in two pupils and learners in schools and colleges are covered by an NHS mental health support team by spring 2025 \u2013 significantly ahead of the original target.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care said it was determined to support children with their mental health, and was investing an extra \u00a32.3bn a year into NHS mental health services. \u201cThis funding will also help expand the number of mental health support teams in schools to reach at least 50% of pupils in England by the end of March 2025,\u201d a spokesperson added."

            "content": "Overcrowded conditions on the controversial Bibby Stockholm barge, where up to six men are sharing a room designed for one person, may be putting the mental health of asylum seekers at risk, MPs have said. Last month a delegation of MPs and peers from the cross-party home affairs committee and the joint committee on human rights visited the barge, which accommodates about 300 people in Portland, Dorset, and spoke to residents and staff. After the visit, the group wrote to ministers to set out serious concerns about the wellbeing of men on the barge. The group of MPs and peers said \u201cmany asylum seekers expressed mental health concerns\u201d, with one man telling them he had suicidal thoughts as a result of being housed on the barge. Leonard Farruku, a 27-year-old Albanian man, was found dead on the barge on 12 December 2023 after a suspected suicide. The delegation also raised concerns about discrepancies in information provided by officials and the asylum seekers themselves. For example, there was confusion about whether a GP was available onboard every day or for one day a week. Organisations working with the men told the delegation the barge felt like a prison. In their letter to ministers, the group wrote: \u201cWe were disheartened to see some of the living conditions on the Bibby Stockholm, with many individuals having to share small, cramped cabins [originally designed for one person], often with people [up to six] they do not know [some of whom spoke a different language to them]. \u201cThese crowded conditions were clearly contributing to a decline in mental health for some of the residents, and they could amount to violations of the human rights of asylum seekers.\u201d Diana Johnson, the chair of the home affairs committee, said: \u201cBeyond the question of whether housing asylum seekers on a barge instead of hotels is actually value for money, which we are still seeking further information on from the Home Office, we need to know that they are living in conditions that are not detrimental to their wellbeing. \u201cWe are concerned that housing asylum claimants on Bibby Stockholm is leaving them in a claustrophobic environment, isolated from external support, including legal advice, and without important links to community, faith or family, potentially for months on end. \u201cSupport services on the barge must be adequate to meet the needs of those housed there, and if not, that there are practical steps in place to allow them to be accessed in the wider community.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe health and welfare of asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm is of the utmost priority, and we constantly work to ensure the needs and vulnerabilities of those residing on the vessel are identified and met. Asylum seekers are screened to identify vulnerable individuals and ensure they are placed in suitable accommodation. \u201cThere are rigorous safeguarding processes in place on the barge. Residents have access to health and social care services, including mental health support. If concerns are raised about any aspect of the service delivered, we work with the provider to ensure these are swiftly addressed, and Migrant Help 24/7 is also available every day of the year.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "date": "2024-02-17T15:00:18Z",
            "content": "The number of black inpatients injured while being restrained by police in mental health units has risen dramatically \u2013 at the same time as the number of non-black inpatients injured has fallen, according to analysis of government data by the Observer. The Home Office\u2019s police use of force statistics for 2022/23 show that police forces across England recorded 820 incidents of force used in mental health units against black inpatients, resulting in 36 injuries. This is up from the 770 use of force incidents and 27 injuries recorded in 2021/22. Over the same time, use of force incidents against non-black inpatients decreased by 19% from 7,698 to 6,244, and resulting injuries fell from 559 to 406. \u201cThese figures reveal that the shocking racial inequalities in our mental health services are only widening,\u201d said Abena Oppong-Asare, the Labour MP for Erith and Thamesmead and shadow minister for women\u2019s health and mental health. This latest data covers the first full year since the main provisions of the Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Act came into use in 2018. The act, also known as \u201cSeni\u2019s law\u201d, was introduced following the death of Olaseni Lewis, a 23-year old black man who died in Bethlem Royal Hospital in 2010, having been restrained by 11 police officers from the Met police. These provisions require mental healthcare providers to develop and publish policies on the use of restraint, keep records of the use of force, and to train staff in de-escalation techniques to help reduce its occurrence. Since August 2022, in the event that police are called to attend mental health units, they have been required to wear body cameras. However, experts remain concerned that little has changed in practice. \u201cThe family of Seni Lewis fought for this law, to ensure what happened to Seni never happened again,\u201d said Lucy McKay, spokesperson for the charity Inquest. \u201cIt is clear that the law and guidance has led to some important changes, but that has not been felt by black inpatients like Seni, for whom things appear to be getting worse.\u201d Ground restraint and limb and body restraint, two of the tactics used by police during the restraint of Lewis, rose by 9% and 20% respectively against black inpatients, while their use against non-black inpatients fell by 38% and 14%. Aji Lewis, the mother of Seni Lewis and a campaigner on mental health, said: \u201cSince my son died more than 13 years ago, we have fought to ensure he has a legacy. That legacy should be that what happened to Seni does not continue to happen.\u201d \u201cThe enactment of Seni\u2019s law and the subsequent guidance was a positive step forward. Yet this data shows the change we need is not taking place. We must see urgent action to address continued racial disparities in restraint of patients, and to end the use of dangerous restraint of mental health patients.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cPolice officers must only use force where it is reasonable, necessary and proportionate to do so, in order to keep the public and themselves safe. \u201cNobody should experience police use of force because of their ethnicity. We are making it easier for officers to use body-worn video and are providing local communities with more opportunities to scrutinise incidents of police use of force.\u201d \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 22 February 2024. An earlier version referred to black mental health patients being \u201cmore likely to be injured at hands of police\u201d. As the article reports, the data shows that between 2021/22 and 2022/23 the total number and percentage of restraint incidents involving injury to black patients in England increased, while the number of incidents and injuries recorded for non-black patients decreased. This indicates black patients were more likely to be injured than before, but not that they were more likely to be injured than non-black patients; the data reported in the article suggests the recorded rate of injury in 2022/23 had risen to 4.4% in cases involving black patients, but was 6.7% for non-black patients."

            "date": "2024-02-28T17:51:04Z",
            "content": "The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has admitted it would take time for a Labour government to turn Britain around, as she accused the Conservatives of vandalising the economy over the past 14 years. Speaking before next week\u2019s budget, Reeves said the party that wins the next election would have the worst inheritance of any incoming government since the war and that a national mission was needed to kickstart the economy. \u201cI recognise the dire inheritance we would have if we win the election. I am not going to be able to turn everything round overnight. We are going to have to grow the economy. There will be a relentless focus on what we need to grow the economy,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. Referring to a soundbite used by George Osborne before the Conservatives came to power in 2010, Reeves said: \u201cGeorge Osborne promised to fix the nation\u2019s roof. But the Conservatives have broken the windows, kicked the door in and now they\u2019re burning the house down.\u201d Jeremy Hunt is putting the finishing touches to next Wednesday\u2019s budget, with the Treasury massaging down expectations of the size of an anticipated tax giveaway in light of deteriorating forecasts for the public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which will give its final, confidential pre-budget assessment to the Treasury on Friday. \u201cI am not going pre-empt what the chancellor does or the forecasts published by the OBR,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cHowever, we do know that the budget will paint a picture of 14 years of economic failure. The next government \u2013 Conservative or Labour \u2013 will inherit the worst set of economic circumstances since the second world war.\u201d Sketching out Labour\u2019s critique of the government\u2019s economic record since 2010, Reeves said public debt as a share of national output was at the highest level since the 1960s; debt interest payments were at the highest level since the second world war; taxes as a share of national output were the highest since 1949; the economy was smaller than when Rishi Sunak became prime minister in October 2022; and the current parliament was on track to be the first in which living standards \u2013 as measured by real household disposable incomes \u2013 fell. \u201cThere needs to be a national mission to kickstart our economy\u201d, she said. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re having a debate in the Conservative party about headroom and what\u2019s best for Rishi Sunak\u2019s leadership.\u201d Hunt will use next week\u2019s speech to say the worst is over for the economy and that it is already recovering from the mild recession that it slipped into in the second half of 2023. But the chancellor\u2019s room for manoeuvre is limited by official forecasts showing he will meet one of his fiscal rules \u2013 to have national debt falling in five years\u2019 time \u2013 by the narrowest of margins. Reeves has been reluctant to say whether Labour would support any tax cuts Hunt might announce next week, preferring to wait until the OBR publishes its judgment on the the impact of Hunt\u2019s measures after the budget. She rejected accusations that Labour\u2019s plan for the economy differed little from that of the Conservatives. \u201cPeople will see a real change in our economy under Labour. People will see something they haven\u2019t seen for a long time: an economy that\u2019s growing and creating prosperity,\u201d she said. Reeves said Labour\u2019s growth plan was built on three pillars: stability, investment and reform."

            "date": "2024-02-17T17:00:20Z",
            "content": "Britain has a sick economy and it is getting sicker. The clear message from last week\u2019s raft of economic data is that the UK is being held back by the growing number of people not able to work because of long-term illness. There are many theories about why the trend is worsening. Possible factors include long Covid, delays in NHS treatment as waiting lists grow longer, poor workplace practices, stress and the impact of austerity. But one thing is certain. The economic impact of ill health is a headache for Jeremy Hunt. It will be a headache for Rachel Reeves if she becomes the first female chancellor. It is a headache for every business that is struggling to fill vacancies. Figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics illustrated the extent of the problem. The number of people saying they are inactive due to long-term sickness is now 2.8 million \u2013 an increase of more than 200,000 in the past year and of 700,000 since the pandemic started in 2020. This matters, and not just for those who would be working if their circumstances were different. This high level of long-term illness helps explain why the UK\u2019s workforce is 700,000 smaller than its pre-Covid level, why the labour market is so tight and why the economy is flatlining. Jane Gratton, deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cBusinesses are growing increasingly concerned about higher levels of inactivity and its economic impact. It is impacting on growth and inflation. Wages are rising because of skills shortages. This has an effect on both employers and individuals.\u201d This is not a new issue. Large numbers of employees were invalided out of the workforce when factories and coalmines were closed in the de-industrialisation of the 1980s and 1990s. This century, Britain has had a higher percentage of people inactive due to ill health than Germany, France or Italy. But two new factors \u2013 Covid and longer NHS waiting lists \u2013 have made matters significantly worse in recent years. Yet what\u2019s especially worrying for economic policymakers is that Britain has gone from being the G7 country with the lowest levels of inactivity to the one where, uniquely, the workforce has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility has pointed out: \u201cThe available international evidence suggests that while the UK has consistently been a strong performer internationally in terms of working-age participation, its post-pandemic rise in inactivity stands out. And ill health has consistently been a bigger factor behind inactivity in the UK than in most other advanced economies, with post-pandemic trends likely to have amplified these differences.\u201d While it would be tempting to dub Britain the sick man of Europe, it would not be strictly accurate. Feminist thinktank the Women\u2019s Budget Group (WBG) has pointed out that there are 200,000 more women than men inactive due to ill health (1.5 million against 1.3 million). The WBG says this is not just down to Covid, but continues a trend that was evident before the pandemic. Zubaida Haque, the WBG\u2019s deputy director, said women were more likely to be in low-paid jobs and suffering the impact of austerity. \u201cThis has not been happening in a vacuum. Women were hit disproportionately by the pandemic but they were also more severely impacted by the benefit cuts made between 2010 and 2020. It is no good the government trying to deal with the symptoms of the problem.\u201d Hannah Slaughter, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said the 2.8 million people inactive due to long-term sickness were a real concern: \u201cThis is holding back the economy, putting pressure on the public finances and the NHS, and limiting opportunities for too many people. Reversing this trend will be a priority for the current and next government.\u201d According to the Department for Work and Pensions, the government is already on the case. A spokesperson said: \u201cWith an extra 4 million people in work since 2010, we are now going even further, with welfare reforms forecast to reduce the number of people who would otherwise have been placed in the highest tier of incapacity benefits by over 370,000. \u201cOur back to work plan will help over a million people, including those with disabilities and long-term health conditions, to start and stay in work, as we continue to bring down inflation, cut taxes and grow the economy.\u201d One option for the government would be to try to fill the hundreds of thousands of job vacancies by tightening welfare conditions. But experts such as Ben Harrison, director of the Work Foundation thinktank, have warned that forcing people into work through punitive benefit sanctions would be counterproductive and might lead to more ill health. Whichever approach it decides to take, the government is under pressure to do more, both in terms of preventing illness, and in tailoring back-to-work programmes for those who take time off sick, ensuring that they don\u2019t exit the labour market altogether. While it is inactivity due to ill health that has grabbed the headlines recently, plenty of people with health problems are working, and are more likely to carry on if they get appropriate support. A study by the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank found people were more likely to leave work because of a heart condition than for any other health problem. The IPPR said someone suffering the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 2021-22 had a 22% likelihood of leaving their job, compared with 14% for those with a mental health problem and 16% for those diagnosed with cancer. Chris Thomas, head of the IPPR\u2019s commission on health and prosperity, said: \u201cAfter great strides in tackling cardiovascular disease in the 20th century, the UK is now stalling, if not reversing. This is costing not just lives, but also livelihoods. The good news is that heart disease is one of the most preventable health conditions, but the government has to get on to the front foot and deliver proactive policies. Both human lives and economic prosperity depend on it.\u201d Gratton at the BCC said firms could help by allowing flexible working, investing more in occupational health and offering staff medical insurance. Jon Boys, senior research economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said the reduction in workers was compounding labour supply difficulties and limiting growth. There was ample evidence of both in last week\u2019s economic data, with the ONS reporting more than 900,000 job vacancies and unemployment below 4%, at a time when the UK economy was in recession. Boys said breaking down barriers to working for people with health problems should be a priority for policymakers and employers. Like Gratton, he said it was vital to focus on occupational health, to prevent individuals from exiting the workforce prematurely: \u201cIt is all very well getting people back into work but the bigger issue is not allowing them to fall out of it in the first place.\u201d Boys said both government and employers needed to address inactivity: employers through an awareness of the impact of stress in the workplace and addressing heavy and unsustainable workloads, and ministers by tackling NHS waiting lists. \u201cThe government has to recognise that health policy is economic policy,\u201d Boys said. \u201cThey can\u2019t be treated in silos.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-15T13:48:52Z",
            "content": "As she stood beside two union flags in a wood-panelled room, it looked as if Rachel Reeves had stepped into Rishi Sunak\u2019s own press conference room in Downing Street \u2013 a deliberate move. The shadow chancellor had been preparing for this moment for months, warning of the heightened risk of recession ever since the last quarter\u2019s GDP figures showed negative growth. Accusing Sunak of putting the economy \u201cinto reverse\u201d and leaving his promise of economic growth \u201cin tatters\u201d, Reeves was keen to imprint one phrase on voters\u2019 minds: \u201cRishi\u2019s recession.\u201d One Labour source said it was \u201can economic and political moment \u2013 for a government to have fallen into recession in an election year, when Rishi Sunak has made his whole argument about growing the economy\u201d. Labour sources say Reeves had wanted to speak directly to the country at such a crucial time, rather than popping up briefly on television screens for a short clip. \u201cThe picture we want the country to see is a competent alternative to what you\u2019ve gone through, doubling down on Rachel\u2019s core strength of people looking at her and trusting her,\u201d one source said. They say Reeves is now gearing up to make the election all about economic competence, having put to bed the argument over Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn green investment promise once and for all. Prior to the decision to ditch the pledge, Labour figures had been getting tangled up in questions about how it would be paid for and were fearing Conservative attacks on their spending plans. But having abandoned the \u00a328bn figure after weeks of uncertainty, Reeves and her team now feel they \u201ccan prosecute the economic case much more effectively\u201d, one source said. Reeves\u2019s speech showed Labour trying to get back on the front foot after a difficult few days for the party in which its poll lead has slipped slightly, and Keir Starmer has been mired in accusations that he did not act quickly enough to suspend a Labour candidate accused of spreading a conspiracy theory about Israel. The shadow chancellor appeared sure-footed in the face of questions about the Rochdale candidate furore, saying the comments had been made in a private meeting and that Labour could not know everything about what was said behind closed doors. She also batted away queries about what she would do if standing in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s shoes for the budget next month, apart from saying Labour would go for growth with planning reforms and a modern industrial strategy. The question remains about how Labour\u2019s economic offering differs from the Tories\u2019 now that the party has got rid of the \u00a328bn green investment pledge, which, while the subject of political attacks, had polled well with the public. Reeves made noises about matching Tory tax cuts, saying she had \u201cmade no secret of the fact that [she] wants taxes on working people to be lower\u201d as long as the money was there to make that possible. But with Sunak and Hunt believed to be pencilling in public spending cuts to fund tax cuts, that could put Labour in a difficult position over whether to follow suit. The shadow chancellor referred to \u201chard choices ahead\u201d, but went no further in indicating how Labour would deal with a scenario where the Tories go to the polls promising tax cuts on the back of fresh austerity."

            "date": "2024-02-16T12:00:45Z",
            "content": "Bordered by the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, Egypt is a country blessed with many miles of coastline, and its resorts have long been tourist favourites. But in a country in which the divide between rich and poor has always been stark, Egypt\u2019s recent economic woes have had a seismic effect on society \u2013 and nowhere illustrates that better than the fortunes of those making their way to the country\u2019s two coasts. Along the Red Sea\u2019s Gulf of Aqaba, the once-quiet fishing outpost of Dahab has become a haven for well-off young digital nomads. Its warm turquoise waters and hipster vibes have transformed the small town into a popular diving resort, making it the perfect location for those looking for a more flexible work-life balance. \u201cI fell in love with Dahab,\u201d says Natalia*, a Moldovan spurred into a lifestyle change by the Covid-19 pandemic and who now calls Dahab home while working on her PhD. \u201cWhen you\u2019re here, you experience a sense of harmony with nature.\u201d Tamer*, a 25-year-old from Cairo, works from Dahab as a freelance translator. \u201cLife becomes more affordable\u201d outside the capital, says Tamer, who asked for his real name not to be used as he relies on the illegal currency exchange market. \u201cSome months, I can even put money aside,\u201d he adds. The number of digital nomads rose sharply during the pandemic, when workplaces made the necessary switch to remote working and white-collar workers were suddenly released from geographical confines. In the intervening years, rising rents and the cost of living crisis in many countries have also driven out young professionals, and changing cities or even countries becomes a more affordable option. In Egypt, the exchange rate makes the country especially attractive to anyone paid in dollars or euros, which often applies to foreigners who can apply for a work permit or those natives who work with international companies. But millions of Egyptians are struggling in a stricken economy. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, three consecutive devaluations in 2022 have halved the Egyptian pound\u2019s value. Officially, the dollar is worth about EGP30, but a severe shortage of foreign currency has revived a thriving parallel market, where the rate is up to EGP60 to the dollar. Hit by record high inflation rates of close to 30%, the living standards of most of Egypt\u2019s 105 million people dropped sharply, pushing thousands to make the dangerous journey to Europe by sea. From 2020, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country had become the ninth-highest source of asylum applications to the European Union. Meanwhile, digital nomads who are paid in dollars have found these economic circumstances ideal for enjoying year-round sunshine on its pristine beaches. \u201cThe past year has been a gamechanger,\u201d says Natalia. \u201cInternet cutoffs are now a thing of the past; several new co-working spaces opened up. \u201cEven if you encounter issues with wifi, 4G is very affordable, especially if you\u2019re paid in US dollars,\u201d she says. Ali al-Edreesy, professor of economics at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, says: \u201cThere is no crisis without winners and losers; it\u2019s inaccurate to claim that everyone loses in a crisis.\u201d What needs to be assessed, he says, is \u201cwhether the negative impacts on a group outweigh the positive impacts on another\u201d. According to the World Bank, nearly a third of Egypt\u2019s population fell below the national poverty line in 2019, most of whom live along the overcrowded, impoverished Nile delta, with overstretched services. Edreesy says poor economic prospects have pushed more people to leave Egypt, many choosing to overlook the hurdles of illegal immigration. In November 2022, life changed for Samir*, who is not using his real name while Italian authorities process his asylum request. He had journeyed from his home in Belbes in the Nile delta province of Sharqiya, to New Alamein on Egypt\u2019s north coast to start work as a mechanic. When he got there, the 24-year-old was told there was no longera job for him. \u201cI had nowhere to go,\u201d Samir says. A friend in Italy told him that a bus of would-be migrants was leaving Alexandria for Salloum, near the Libyan border. Having seen many youths from his home town make a successful start in Italy, Samir had been contemplating the journey for a while and the phone call felt like a \u201clifeline\u201d. The bus travelled along mountain trails to avoid checkpoints on its way to Salloum. There, he paid smugglers an initial fee of EGP40,000 (about \u00a31,000) before joining a group of people, mainly women and children. \u201cWe walked to Libya. I had no other choice: I had paid a large sum of money so I was committed,\u201d says Samir. Finally, the group reached the border area between Egypt and Libya. With someone else\u2019s child in his arms, and following the smugglers\u2019 instructions, Samir sprinted several hundred metres through a minefield until he reached the barbed wire marking Libyan territory. \u201cThat\u2019s when bullets from Libya\u2019s border patrol rained on us,\u201d he says. Exhausted and terrified, Samir immediately surrendered. He and the others were arrested and taken to a nearby checkpoint, but they bribed the border guard to let them go for 1,000 Libyan dinars (about \u00a3160). After a few days in Libya, Samir met another smuggler who took him to a nearby warehouse, where illegal migrants were kept. \u201cI spent the worst 20 days of my life in that small warehouse,\u201d he says. \u201cThousands of people squashed together with little food and water. Any sort of objection to the conditions was met with violence. A man who asked for more water was thrown into a well to die.\u201d Samir was then packed into a crowded truck and dropped at the coast near the port of Tobruk, where the self-styled Libyan National Army of the warlord Khalifa Haftar, who nominally controls eastern Libya, has cracked down on people-smuggling. From there, Samir and about 700 other would-be migrants scaled a mountain to reach a point on the coast where a boat was waiting. \u201cWhen people fell off the mountain to their death, the smugglers did nothing to help,\u201d he says. \u201cHundreds of us boarded a boat barely fit for 50 people.\u201d After two sleepless days at sea, they reached the shores of Italy. Samir surrendered to the police and was housed in a specialist refugee camp. He has been there for almost a year, awaiting a decision on his refugee status. Samir is one of 21,753 Egyptians who reached Europe in 2022 \u2013 when the numbers of Egyptians arriving in Europe surpassed even those from countries devastated by war such as Syria and Afghanistan. \u201cIt\u2019s not solely economic drivers; there are also cultural aspects at play,\u201d says Ibrahim Adam, a civil society worker in Tattoun, near Faiyum, south of Cairo, where many young people are tempted to try illegal migration. \u201cThe youth here see young people who migrated illegally, living well, dressed nicely, and integrated into Italian society, and they think they could do it as well,\u201d Adam says. \u201cIt has become a sort of get-rich-quick scheme that they\u2019re falling for.\u201d Adam is affiliated to the Tattoun Community Development Association, which introduces vulnerable young people to the government-run Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (Smeda) to look at alternative ways to make a living, and where they receive support for their project ideas and marketing, management training, as well as financial support and funding at lower interest rates. \u201cSome people respond to our work while the majority don\u2019t,\u201d says Adam. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s crucial to continue awareness efforts since it remains the only solution. For Edreesy, however, economic factors are crucial. He believes the solution lies primarily in \u201caddressing inflation and stabilising the exchange rate\u201d. He says that \u201conly then will the market begin to experience a certain level of revitalisation that would solve many of Egypt\u2019s problems\u201d. But Adam points out: \u201cEven when the dollar equated to less than 15 Egyptian pounds, young people still resorted to migration. The issue lies in the culture.\u201d * Full names have not been used to protect their identity This article is published in collaboration with Egab."

            "date": "2024-02-08T19:40:11Z",
            "content": "When Rachel Reeves announced Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn climate plan in 2021, she was so confident it was the right thing to do that she issued a dire warning about what would happen if the scheme was held up or scaled back. \u201cThe greatest cost to our public finances, as well as to our planet, will be if we delay and let the costs mount up for future generations to pay,\u201d she told a packed hall at the party conference in Brighton. On Thursday, Reeves stood alongside the party leader, Keir Starmer, in front of about 30 journalists in a draughty room in parliament and reversed all of that. The \u00a328bn was gone, as was the reasoning behind it. \u201cWe want to bring jobs to Britain, to bring energy bills down, to boost our energy security, and also to decarbonise the economy,\u201d Reeves told reporters. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need to spend \u00a328bn in doing that, that\u2019s great.\u201d The reversal of Labour\u2019s central economic and environmental policy has come after weeks of agonised decision-making by Starmer and Reeves, in conjunction with Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary. Thursday\u2019s confirmation that the policy would be cut back to half its original scale is a key moment in Starmer\u2019s leadership and could redefine the election campaign. It also marks a shift in Reeves\u2019s entire economic philosophy. No longer is the shadow chancellor arguing for public investment for its own sake as a way to stimulate the economy and galvanise private capital. Instead, she says she wants to achieve Labour\u2019s green targets using as little public money as possible. The story of how that change came about in the course of just over two years is indicative of the broader shift in approach from Starmer and Reeves in that time, as they have enacted a series of U-turns in an attempt to shed the baggage they fear could weigh them down in an election contest. From determination to doubt Reeves\u2019s initial announcement in 2021 was regarded in senior Labour circles as a triumph. The Brighton conference had been fractious until then. The party had been plagued by splits between Starmer and Miliband on the question of whether energy companies should be nationalised. Senior figures had been followed wherever they went by protesters calling for a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d. The party\u2019s members had defied the leadership by voting for a motion calling for a \u201csocialist green new deal\u201d. Reeves\u2019s announcement brought an end to all that, answering the criticisms that Labour did not have a green policy and that it did not have an economic strategy. \u201cI am committing the next Labour government to an additional \u00a328bn of capital investment in our country\u2019s green transition for each and every year of this decade,\u201d she told delegates. \u201cI will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain\u2019s first green chancellor.\u201d Labour stuck to the plan for many months. At the party conference a year later, Starmer announced that a significant chunk of the money would be spent on a new national energy company, to be known as Great British Energy. Other schemes included a new sovereign wealth fund to invest in green schemes and a \u00a36bn-a-year home insulation scheme to improve the energy efficiency of 19m properties. Gradually however, senior Labour figures became nervous. After Liz Truss\u2019s turbulent 45 days in power, Labour\u2019s pitch to the electors was no longer to be the party of radical change, but instead to offer reassurance where the Conservatives offered turmoil. Truss\u2019s economic plans, coupled with the war in Ukraine and rising inflation, sent interest rates on UK government debt spiking from just over 1% at the beginning of 2022 to 4.5% by the middle of 2023. Reeves was growing concerned about the economic consequences of the \u00a328bn policy, especially after a crucial meeting she had in Washington DC in June 2023 with Janet Yellen, the US treasury secretary. People briefed on that meeting have told the Guardian that Yellen warned Reeves against making the mistake the Biden administration had of announcing major new climate investments without first reforming planning laws so they could get built. Reeves came back from that trip determined to make a change. She wrote an article for the Times announcing the \u00a328bn figure would not be hit until the second half of the parliament, and that it would only be hit if Labour could meet its promise to have debt falling as a percentage of economic output at the end of a five-year period. Given the forecasts at the time predicted the government could borrow only an additional \u00a36bn a year and still have debt falling in that time period, Reeves\u2019s announcement all but killed her original policy. Decision time And yet Labour politicians continued to use the \u00a328bn figure, putting the party in the awkward position of defending a figure they had no intention of hitting and could not say how it would be spent. Shadow ministers and advisers began pitching their ideas for how to change the policy. Some wanted to junk it altogether. Others wanted to use the money to fund other investment schemes, such as new schools and roads. Some suggested putting all the existing spending commitments in a single bill and abandoning the rest. As those around Starmer argued over what should happen, the leader continued to defend it publicly. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s absolutely clear to me that the Tories are trying to weaponise this issue, the \u00a328bn,\u201d he said in January. \u201cThis is a fight I want to have \u2026 If they want that fight on borrow-to-invest, I\u2019m absolutely up for that fight.\u201d Privately however, Starmer was becoming convinced of the need to make a change. He, Reeves and Miliband began working intensively on a compromise which would protect existing schemes such as GB Energy and the sovereign wealth fund, but scale back the home insulation scheme and clarify that no further spending would be announced. Labour officials insisted on Thursday the three had developed the plan together, downplaying talk of a split at the top of the party. The final decision was reached jointly just days ago, they added. Some of Starmer\u2019s advisers urged him to wait until after Jeremy Hunt\u2019s budget to make the final decision, not least because the chancellor was promising more tax cuts which would further reduce the room to borrow. The Labour leader, however, had told shadow ministers to have their manifesto policies ready by Thursday in case of a May election, so he knew a decision would have to be taken by then. Besides, reports in the Guardian and elsewhere about the fate of the \u00a328bn were making it increasingly hard to hold the line. \u201cToday is the deadline for shadow cabinet teams to get their proposals in and fully funded so we can begin the next stage of the process of the manifesto,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday. \u201cWe knew we would have to get to a decision on this around about now.\u201d Political ramifications The eventual U-turn was met with anger among green campaigners and some MPs, including the former shadow energy secretary Barry Gardiner, who called it \u201ceconomically illiterate, environmentally irresponsible and politically jejune\u201d. And while the party has recommitted to parts of its investment schemes, important question remain. Can Labour really decarbonise Britain\u2019s energy sector by 2030 with this level of spending? What does the reduction in the home insulation programme mean for the legal requirement to eradicate fuel poverty by 2030? Many in Labour expressed relief at the change, however. \u201cAt least we know what the policy is now,\u201d said one shadow minister. \u201cAt least we have something to defend.\u201d But if Labour believes it now has something to defend, the Tories insist they still have something to attack. Senior advisers to Rishi Sunak insisted on Thursday they intended to keep using the \u00a328bn figure, arguing Labour would have to end up spending that much when they realised they might miss their green targets. \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d said one. But in a sign of how Thursday\u2019s announcement by Starmer has made life more difficult for his opponents, the Conservatives were simultaneously accusing him of enacting another \u201cflip-flop\u201d. \u201cThe problem is the Tories now have to decide,\u201d said one Labour figure. \u201cIs it that nothing has changed, or have we flip-flopped? They can\u2019t get their attack right.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-29T18:18:02Z",
            "content": "Get ready to see more flotations later this year, said David Schwimmer, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group on Thursday. Good: it would mark a change from the droughts of 2022 and 2023 that have caused much agonising over the health of the London stock market. But, actually, the deep problem here may not be a shortage of newcomers. Rather, it could be indifference, or so it seems, towards sub-\u00a31bn UK companies that have been around for years. The current extraordinary bid battle for Chippenham-based Wincanton, the last UK-listed logistics firm, shows how the London market \u2013 or part of it \u2013 sometimes doesn\u2019t know how to value what it\u2019s got. A bid at a 52% premium to the previous share price would normally be regarded as juicy if it came at the end of a contested tussle, but Wincanton got that on one day when a French shipping firm, CMA CGM, offered 450p-a-share, or \u00a3567m, last month. Some Wincanton shareholders felt the offer was still too mean (well done, Aberforth), so the French went to 480p to try to clinch things. But now comes a fresh suitor from the US, GXO Logistics, offering 605p. That is 104% more than the old share price of 297p, which shouldn\u2019t happen if a market is liquid and full of active buyers and sellers. We\u2019re not talking about a hard-to-value biotech outfit. Wincanton, with 20,000 employees, is in the business of warehouses and lorries. Yes, there have been a couple of complications in recent years \u2013 the loss of a contract with HMRC to check cross-border goods and a deficit in the pension fund (now resolved) \u2013 but neither should have scrambled the market\u2019s collective brain. Wincanton\u2019s chairman, Sir Martin Read, understandably backed the original French offer on the grounds that the company\u2019s strong financial performance had \u201cnot been reflected in the performance of its shares in recent years\u201d. If Wincanton was an isolated case, one could shrug and say pockets of undervaluation can occur in any market. But, over at Currys, the electrical retailer, a similar tale is unfolding. From a previous 47p, the bids from US hedge fund Elliott have reached 67p per share, an improvement of 42%, and the defending board is still resisting \u2013 quite rightly, many of us would argue (Peel Hunt\u2019s analyst reckons 80p is the point at which Currys would be obliged to engage). Currys\u2019 largest shareholder, Redwheel, which has backed the board, made an excellent point when it said there was a wider problem with a UK equity market \u201cwhich no longer seems to fulfil its primary purpose of price discovery and efficient capital allocation\u201d. Fund manager Ian Lance pointed to the silliness of some big UK investment houses allocating cash away from UK equities, which are close to all-time low valuations, and towards US equities at close to all-time highs. \u201cUnless this changes, it seems likely that we will continue to see overseas corporate buyers step in to take advantage of the depressed valuations of UK equities with ownership falling into foreign hands and the number of quoted UK businesses will continue to decline,\u201d he argued. It\u2019s hard to disagree. A pitch for London is not compelling if it involves paying your advisers a small fortune to get listed and then being ignored for years until a foreign predator turns up. In a rational world, perceived undervaluations would bring forth buyers and the problem would solve itself. Maybe the sight of a 100% takeover premium will help at the margin. But investor indifference towards pockets of small- and medium-sized companies is not new and none of the proposed remedies sounds transformational. Obliging UK pension funds to show more home bias in their equity portfolios would help, but compulsion has its limits. The proposal for a \u201cBritish ISA\u201d, with allocations only to UK-listed stocks, probably wouldn\u2019t shift serious sums. Consolidation among defined-benefit schemes, to produce bigger funds with an appetite to own more UK equities, will not happen overnight. If Schwimmer has more radical ideas, we\u2019d love to hear them. Sadly, he seems more interested in arguing that people such as himself \u2013 those running large FTSE 100 companies \u2013 should be paid more to compete with US rivals. That won\u2019t cure the problems at the other end of the market."

            "date": "2024-02-22T23:10:33Z",
            "content": "Reddit set the stage for its highly anticipated stock market debut, preparing investors for the largest initial public offering by a major social network in four years. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday disclosed the financial performance of the social media group, and revealed that Sam Altman, the OpenAI founder and CEO, is its third-largest shareholder, with an 8.7% stake. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cRDDT.\u201d Its much-awaited listing \u2013 expected in March \u2013 would be the biggest social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019. The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined, Reddit said in a statement. The IPO filing revealed that Reddit sustained $90.8m in losses in 2023, down from $158.6m in 2022, as its revenue grew by roughly 21%. The platform has 267.5 million active weekly users, more than 100,000 active communities, and 1bn total posts, it said. The business estimated that its US average revenue per user, or ARPU, was $3.42 for the last quarter of 2023 \u2013 a decrease of 2% year over year. Advance Magazine Publishers is the company\u2019s largest shareholder, with a 30.1% stake, while the Chinese multinational Tencent has 11%. Reddit\u2019s planned IPO comes almost two decades after Reddit\u2019s launch and will be a major test for the platform that still lags the commercial success of social media contemporaries such as Facebook and Twitter, now known as X. The filing also revealed an unusual plan from Reddit to allow its most active users to buy shares in the IPO. Reddit will allocate shares using a tiered system rewarding users who have \u201cmeaningfully contributed to Reddit community programs\u201d, users who have completed a certain number of moderator actions and people with a minimum \u201ckarma\u201d score \u2013 the points given to users by others on the platform for posting content. Reddit was valued at $10bn in a funding round in 2021 and it is unclear what valuation the company will aim for during its share sale in the coming weeks. It is expected to seek a sale of nearly 10% of its shares in the IPO, Reuters reported earlier. In the filing, Reddit cited data licensing arrangements as a revenue stream \u2013 saying that in January 2024 it entered data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203m. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Reddit struck a deal with Alphabet\u2019s Google to make its content available to train the search engine giant\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) models. The contract is worth about $60m each year, according to one of the sources. \u201cReddit data constantly grows and regenerates as users come and interact with their communities and each other,\u201d Reddit said in its filing. \u201cWe believe our growing platform data will be a key element in the training of leading large language models (\u201cLLMs\u201d) and serve as an additional monetization channel for Reddit.\u201d Reddit had confidentially filed for the IPO in late 2021, but tough economic conditions and the poor performance of listed technology stocks had compelled it to delay the offering. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been tapped as the lead underwriters for Reddit\u2019s IPO, which includes more than a dozen other banks."

            "title": "Why has Nvidia driven stock markets to record highs?",
            "date": "2024-02-23T16:39:35Z",
            "content": "Investor excitement over artificial intelligence reached a new peak this week when better-than-expected results from chipmaker Nvidia drove stock markets in three continents to record highs. The rally began on Thursday and continued into Friday, as Nvidia overtook Google\u2019s parent group, Alphabet, to become the third most valuable company in the US. Its market capitalisation hit $2tn (\u00a31.58tn), surpassed only by Microsoft and Apple. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has raised many questions, not least over safety and the impact on jobs, but there are also concerns that it might be driving unsustainable market exuberance. Here we look at the latest share price rise and whether it can be maintained. What does Nvidia do and why is it important to AI? Nvidia makes the chips that are crucial to training and operating AI systems \u2013 they can carry out the immense data crunching required for tools like chatbots very quickly \u2013 and the demand for this crucial infrastructure is soaring as big tech firms join the AI race and make products such as ChatGPT that people want to use. If Nvidia is reporting strong demand for its products, then it is a clear sign that demand for the technology is thriving \u2013 and investors will inevitably follow. On Wednesday, the US-based firm surprised markets with the strength of its fourth-quarter earnings. It posted revenues of $22.1bn \u2013 against expectations of $20.6bn \u2013 and then forecast revenue growth of 233% in the current quarter, ahead of Wall Street forecasts of 208%. Nvidia\u2019s chief executive Jensen Huang said demand for generative AI \u2013 technology that immediately produces convincing text, images and audio from simple typed prompts \u2013 had reached a \u201ctipping point\u201d. How did markets react? Several leading indices have started the year strongly and reached fresh highs after the Nvidia results. On Thursday, Japan\u2019s main stock market index, the Nikkei, increased 2.19% to close at 39,098.68 in Tokyo \u2013 the highest it has been in 34 years. Over the longer term, other factors have boosted the Nikkei, including capital fleeing troubled waters in China and a fall in the value of the yen, but Nvidia\u2019s results had a knock-on effect around the world. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 and Wall Street\u2019s blue chip Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 indices all reached new highs. Nvidia was a big beneficiary too, of course, posting the biggest ever single-day increase in the value of a listed company as its worth rose by $277bn. One investment argument is that strong demand for Nvidia GPUs \u2013 or graphics processing units, the company\u2019s key AI-friendly product \u2013 will ripple out across economies as demand for AI-related infrastructure and services increases. \u201cNvidia and the golden GPUs are the start of the spending wave, not the end and now Wall Street awaits as a myriad of use cases get built out across the enterprise and consumer ecosystem,\u201d said Dan Ives, analyst at US financial firm Wedbush Securities. For instance, tech research firm Gartner forecasts that global spending on AI software will grow from $124bn in 2022 to $297bn in 2027. There is also a belief that AI will increase productivity, or produce higher economic growth at a lower cost, with the accompanying fear that those lower costs are due to fewer jobs as AI systems render human roles obsolete. According to Goldman Sachs, generative AI could boost US GDP by 0.4 percentage points and by 0.3 points in other developed markets over the next 10 years. How much is AI behind the stock market increases? It has played a significant role in continuing to boost the big tech stocks, which play such an outsize role in US markets alone. This week Deutsche Bank pointed out that tech stocks were playing an ever-bigger role in the S&amp;P 500, the biggest US index. The bank pointed out that Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, account for almost a quarter of the value of the S&amp;P 500. \u201cThe US equity market is rivalling 2000 and 1929 in terms of being its most concentrated in history,\u201d wrote Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of global economics and thematic research. Once you add in the other two big US tech stocks \u2013 Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta and Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla \u2013 you get the so-called \u201cMag 7\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Magnificent Seven movie \u2013 who together have a combined market cap of over $13tn, a bigger valuation than all the stocks listed in any other single country, other than the US. All of Mag 7 have interests in AI to varying degrees. For instance, Amazon and Microsoft own cloud computing businesses that are crucial to developing and operating AI models (Microsoft is also a big investor in ChatGPT developer OpenAI), while Apple\u2019s shares were boosted recently by a bank report predicting new AI features embedded in its phones will increase demand. Is the AI stock market boom sustainable? The excitement around AI breakthroughs continues, with OpenAI revealing the remarkable-looking Sora video generation tool last week and Google releasing an upgrade to its Gemini model. Nvidia\u2019s optimistic sales forecasts also indicate an ongoing increase in demand for AI-related infrastructure. Deutsche Bank\u2019s Reid states that there are arguments \u201cfor and against\u201d the continued dominance of the Mag 7. In their favour, he argues that AI is \u201cjust in its infancy\u201d and the companies have room to grow due to their global reach. Factors against them include regulators launching antitrust actions and no one really knowing how AI will pan out and who will win. Neil Wilson, chief analyst at brokerage firm Finalto, says this is a bubble \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s the nature of markets, it\u2019s built into them to produce these manias\u201d \u2013 and the question is when and how it levels off. \u201cDoes the levelling off see a bust phase or can it glide gently down, which stocks are overvalued now and which are not, and I guess crucially from the wider perspective, does it herald a new era of productivity boom which sees multiples expand for almost all equities?\u201d Are there broader economic factors at play in the stock market rise? Stock markets have rallied in recent weeks, reflecting an easing of tensions that not so long ago appeared ready to wreck a global economic recovery. The Gaza conflict is a humanitarian disaster, but for the time being, ships laden with oil and gas are reaching their destinations, allowing the oil price to stabilise and the gas price to tumble back towards pre-pandemic levels. Low and stable energy prices are the bedrock of any recovery along with low interest rates, and central banks have signalled they will begin to make cuts in the second half of this year after a steep fall in inflation. Even Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock market \u2013 held back for decades by low growth while the country coped with an ageing population \u2013 joined New York\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and German DAX indexes in reaching a record high. What could bring the rally to a halt? The conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could escalate further, sparking a resurgence of shortages of energy, food and raw materials. The result will be a return to high inflation, which again could dent spending and confidence. Even without a global downturn, stock market investors may panic if they believe financial assets have become overpriced. It has been 16 years since the great financial crash of 2008, and many economists believe that the best efforts of regulators to prevent excessive speculation across the board during that time will not be enough to prevent another 2008-style wipeout."

            "date": "2024-02-09T07:44:58Z",
            "content": "The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has hinted at plans to launch a tax-free \u201cBritish Isa\u201d investing in UK company shares at the spring budget, as part of efforts to revive the country\u2019s stock market. A British stock Isa would allow investors to buy a certain amount of UK company shares, without paying tax. Currently, the government charges a 0.5% tax, known as the share purchase stamp duty, for any shares bought in the UK. It comes as Hunt tries to find cost-free announcements that could help win over voters and businesses as the Tories lag well behind Labour in the polls before a much-anticipated general election. The incentive, which some expected Hunt to announce as part of the autumn statement last November, could also complement government plans to sell shares in NatWest \u2013 which is still 38.6% government owned since its 2008 taxpayer bailout \u2013 to retail investors later this year. Hunt made the comments in front of hundreds of City bosses, who were gathered in the Raffles hotel in Westminster for an annual dinner hosted by the financial services lobby group TheCityUK. When asked whether he would consider a British Isa, he said: \u201cSo there\u2019s a certain category of questions that I\u2019m not really able to answer \u2026 Those are things that might appear in the budget. And that is one of them.\u201d \u201cDo I want to do things that mean that more UK capital is invested in our most promising companies? Absolutely. I think that something like a British Isa could be very good at that.\u201d It comes as the City faces growing threats from rival financial hubs including New York, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, particularly post-Brexit. London\u2019s stock market has experienced an exodus of companies chasing capital outside the UK, with Flutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power, Betfair and FanDuel, saying last week that it was considering moving its primary listing to New York \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. However, Hunt stopped short of suggesting he was ready to slash the 0.5% stamp duty levied on direct share purchases, which some City campaigners have claimed is a larger roadblock for local investors. Both proposals \u2013 the British stock Isa and the scrapping of stock stamp duty \u2013 have been lobbied for by City groups, including the industry body UK Finance. UK Finance\u2019s spring budget submission paper, released earlier this week, said: \u201cWhile the reforms in autumn statement 2023 to evolve the Isa regime were welcome, officials need to work with providers to ensure these changes can be properly implemented. The government should explore introducing a \u2018British Isa\u2019 focused on UK domestic equities to offer an easily accessible, trusted vehicle to incentivise investment in UK equities for individuals.\u201d Hunt also reiterated ambitions to make the UK the next Silicon Valley, unleashing growth akin to the big bang changes to City regulations that some credit with unleashing a boom in British financial services. That would extend to a boost in tech-focused stock market listings. \u201cWe want the London Stock Exchange to become Europe\u2019s Nasdaq,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Japan\u2019s main stock index, European shares and Wall Street\u2019s blue-chip listings hit all-time highs on Thursday as strong results from the chipmaker Nvidia stoked investor exuberance over a worldwide artificial intelligence investment boom. The S&amp;P 500 enjoyed its best day in more than a year in New York, rising 2.1% amid a global equities rally. The technology-heavy Nasdaq gained 3%. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, which climbed 1.2%, scaled fresh all-time highs. The Nasdaq finished just shy of its own record. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 index also reached a record close of 495.10. Earlier in the day, the Nikkei increased 2.19% to close at 39,098.68 in Tokyo. On the final trading day of 1989, it had closed at 38,915.87. The 34 years it has taken to regain its footing is a decade longer than it took Wall Street to recoup losses from the 1929 crash and Great Depression. Shares in Nvidia leapt 16.4% as trading started a day after the company reported bullish results. Booming demand for its AI chips \u2013 a key piece of infrastructure for companies building and operating AI tools \u2013 helped Nvidia post quarterly revenue and future sales guidance much above Wall Street\u2019s already high expectations on Wednesday, lifting tech stocks globally. The gains meant Nvidia broke the record for the biggest single-day increase in a company\u2019s stock market value, as it added $277bn to be worth more than $1.9tn \u2013 just nine months after reaching $1tn. Although the strong Nvidia results and accompanying optimism about tech stocks helped drive the Nikkei to a record high, the Tokyo index has been bolstered over the past few years by other factors, including hope that Japan is finally overcoming its historical problems with flat or falling prices, and investor concerns about the Chinese economy. A fall in the value of the yen has also helped to tempt foreign investors to the Nikkei. One analyst described Nvidia\u2019s results on Wednesday as \u201cthe biggest moment for the market and tech sector in many years\u201d. \u201cThis was a \u2018game-changing moment\u2019 for the tech bulls and puts jet fuel in the tech bull market thesis,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst at the US financial firm Wedbush Securities. Jensen Huang, the Nvidia chief executive, said on Wednesday the AI market had hit \u201cthe tipping point\u201d. He added: \u201cDemand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations.\u201d Gains in Nvidia lifted its AI competitor Advanced Micro Devices by 10.7%, while Super Micro Computer climbed 33% and the UK-based Arm Holdings rose 4%. Soaring demand for Nvidia\u2019s chips used by companies rushing to upgrade their AI offerings helped the Silicon Valley company forecast first-quarter revenue growth of 233%, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 208%. The midpoint of the forecast was $24bn, which was above market expectations of about $22.2bn. Fourth quarter revenues were $22.1bn against an expected $20.6bn \u2013 up 265% from a year ago. Josh Gilbert, a market analyst at eToro, said: \u201cNvidia continues to deliver in every way, and its results show there is still plenty of growth ahead. This isn\u2019t just a flash in the pan, nor a bubble, but a business that continues to make serious cash.\u201d Expectations heading into the results were very high, with shares in Nvidia surging nearly 36% this year to become the best-performing S&amp;P 500 stock and notching a record high just last week. The share rise that fuelled the S&amp;P 500\u2019s climb to record highs this year had prompted fears that growth at Nvidia, seen as the bellwether for AI demand, could disappoint and potentially disrupt the market rally."

            "title": "Why insurance premiums are squeezing Australians and fuelling inflation",
            "date": "2024-02-27T04:44:04Z",
            "content": "Insurance premiums are rising faster than inflation, squeezing homeowners, drivers and private health customers, even as some of Australia\u2019s biggest insurers expand their profits. The sector, largely overlooked as a driver of inflation and cause of cost-of-living pressures, was the standout contributor to the most recent inflation data, representing annual price increases not seen in more than two decades. Insurers have been advising customers of double-digit premium price increases for most products, including home cover and car insurance, representing a new super cycle of hikes. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The industry has defended the decisions, arguing that extreme weather and high costs of labour, building replacement, car parts and repairs mean above-inflation increases are necessary. Climate crisis effects are weighing heavily on prices charged by reinsurers, which take on some of the risk of natural disasters, ultimately passed to policyholders. Prof Paula Jarzabkowski from the University of Queensland said the increased frequency of extreme weather events was driving prices higher. \u201cYou usually get a spike in premiums for a year or two after a disaster and then it all settles back down again,\u201d said Jarzabkowski, who specialises in addressing insurance protection gaps. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is a fundamental change in the way the insurance market works. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find that some people simply can\u2019t afford insurance and so they will drop out of the market. We\u2019ve built in places we probably shouldn\u2019t have built in and, after climate change, they\u2019re definitely not robust.\u201d While weather disasters are fuelling insurance premium hikes, brokers also note that the steep increases have put insurers in a strong position to profit in the years ahead, a scenario that resembles what occurred in the aftermath of the 2010-11 Queensland floods. Two of the country\u2019s biggest general insurers, Suncorp and QBE, unveiled greatly expanded insurance profit margins at their recent financial results, with the former attributing the spike to strong premium growth, an increase in customer numbers and targeted price increases. \u201cWe remain acutely alert to the affordability challenges facing customers and continue to focus on driving greater efficiencies in our own business,\u201d Suncorp said. QBE noted that higher costs for building products and the greater frequency and severity of weather events were reflected in policy pricing. The sharemarket performance of insurance stocks is mixed, as old claims weigh on the performance of some of the country\u2019s biggest insurers, such as IAG, while Suncorp and QBE are trading near decade highs. Insurers have not faced the same sort of political scrutiny as supermarkets and banks, which have also profited during the inflationary period while their customers grapple with increased prices and repayments. The Australian Council of Trade Unions said the major insurers had shown \u201cno mercy\u201d in a cost-of-living crisis. \u201cWhen you see the growth in these profits, workers should rightly ask why they are getting priced out of essential cover,\u201d ACTU assistant secretary Joseph Mitchell said. The insurance sector\u2019s future profitability will depend on whether they face ongoing elevated claims or if they enjoy a period of relative peace. There\u2019s also a question over whether customers will continue to accept double-digit price increases on their policies. Insurance prices are up 16.2% over 12 months, according to the inflation reading, representing the highest annual rate since 2001. This compares with a 4.1% annual inflation rate, which policymakers are trying to push back down to the 2% to 3% band. A spokesperson from the Insurance Council of Australia said that since the devastating bushfires of 2019-20, insurers have paid out $16bn in claims from 13 declared insurance catastrophes or significant events, which are still affecting premiums. \u201cWherever you live in Australia, whether you\u2019re directly exposed to extreme weather impacts or not, premium prices are rising because of the escalating costs of natural disasters, the growing value of our assets making them more costly to replace, inflation driving up building and vehicle repair costs, and the increasing cost of capital for insurers,\u201d the spokesperson said. Insurance costs contribute more than 5% to inflation calculations, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, behind housing and food but ahead of education and clothing expenses. Kate Booth from the University of Tasmania said there needed to be more awareness of how rising premiums were adding to cost-of-living pressures. \u201cCompanies that produce food, their insurance risk profiles are changing, so they\u2019re potentially paying extra for their insurance and then that has a flow-on effect to consumers,\u201d Booth said, referring to the impact of climate change on premiums. \u201cIt\u2019s not just housing contents insurance. That\u2019s the most obvious thing that we can really see and get a tangible grasp of, but potentially all kinds of insurance are increasing in price \u2013 health insurance, pet insurance, funeral insurance, life insurance.\u201d Health costs are also tracking above inflation, according to ABS data, at the same time as the value many consumers receive from the private health insurance diminishes, according to a report by the Australian Medical Association. The industry group Private Healthcare Australia has rejected claims of declining value and said health funds had been paying more on average for hospital treatment per policyholder compared with past years. Australia\u2019s largest private health insurer, Medibank, increased its profit margins throughout the pandemic, rising from 7.2% in 2019-20 to 9.1% last financial year, and its shares are trading near record highs. Medibank credited productivity improvements and cost savings for its expanded margins. \u201cThis cost discipline is a good thing for customers and their premiums,\u201d said Medibank\u2019s chief customer officer, Milosh Milisavljevic. \u201cWe are really focused on making sure our customers can get great value with us \u2013 and we know value starts with their premiums, which is why we\u2019ve been working hard keep to them as low as possible, despite costs rising significantly in the health sector.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-13T13:40:00Z",
            "content": "Inflation was hotter than expected across the US last month as it continues to fall back from its highest levels in a generation. Price growth dropped to an annual rate of 3.1% in January, according to official data; above economists\u2019 expectations of 2.9%. In December, the consumer price index stood at 3.4%. The latest official data sparked a sell-off on Wall Street, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 1.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1.1%. Stock markets have scaled record highs in recent weeks as investors grew more confident about the easing of inflation and some of the US\u2019s largest companies released robust results. While inflation has fallen sharply since peaking above 9% in June 2022, many Americans are still feeling the pinch. Joe Biden, who is standing for re-election in November, must persuade them that the economy is working for them. On a monthly basis, the consumer price index rose by 0.3% in January, up from 0.2% the previous month and also higher than the 0.2% expected. The so-called \u201ccore\u201d index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is closely watched as it tends to provide a better indication of inflation\u2019s trajectory. It also increased on the month, from 0.3% to 0.4%. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases the data each month, said the index was driven higher in January by the rising cost of shelter, including rent; motor vehicle insurance; and medical care. The US economy has remained robust in recent years, adding millions of jobs and defying predictions of recession even as the Federal Reserve has embarked upon an aggressive campaign to take on inflation. Employers added 353,000 jobs last month alone. Many Americans have not been feeling positive about the economy, as they grapple with their own financial realities. A closely watched survey by the University of Michigan indicated a rallying in consumer confidence last month, however, with sentiment jumping to its highest level since July 2021. Now that annual inflation is easing back towards 2%, Fed policymakers are preparing to cut interest rates for the first time in four years. Wall Street had been betting that the central bank would start doing so as soon as May, after the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, signaled that a cut was unlikely next month. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said January\u2019s unexpectedly strong reading will reinforce the view in some quarters that the \u201clast mile is the hardest\u201d as inflation comes back down to earth. Prices in key categories like clothing and medical care commodities did fall last month, however. \u201cThere is still plenty of disinflation in the economy,\u201d Ashworth noted."

The Office for National Statistics compiled the overall reading using the consumer prices index but also logs prices for individual goods and services.

            "date": "2024-02-05T10:03:15Z",
            "content": "Central banks should be certain they have beaten inflation before cutting interest rates this year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said despite revisions to its outlook that showed inflation was falling at a faster rate than previously expected. The Paris-based organisation, which represents 38 countries, said it was \u201ctoo soon to be sure that underlying price pressures are fully contained\u201d. It warned that inflation in the UK would persist at the highest level in the G7 this year, forecasting a rate of 2.8%, despite sharp declines in the headline rate in recent months amid cooling global energy prices. The US inflation rate in 2024 would be 2.2%, down from a previous forecast of 2.8%. \u201cMonetary policy needs to remain prudent, that is restrictive, for some time to come to ensure inflationary pressures are contained,\u201d said Mathias Cormann, the secretary general of the OECD. However, in a shot across the bows of central banks considering early cuts in the cost of borrowing, it said that while wage demands had \u201cbecome better balanced\u201d, pay rises \u201cgenerally remain above rates compatible with medium-term inflation objectives\u201d. The attacks in the Red Sea, which have disrupted shipping through the Suez Canal, could also trigger a second round of inflationary pressure, it said. Cormann said continued disruption could add 0.4 percentage points to inflation across the OECD area this year if a doubling in shipping costs was sustained, while there were also risks to inflation from robust growth in workers\u2019 pay, corporate profits or weaker productivity growth. \u201cA widening or escalating of the conflict in the Middle East could lead to renewed price pressures and shortages, and a decline in global growth,\u201d he added. The head of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said over the weekend that the central bank was alert to the risk of cutting interest rates too soon. \u201cThe danger of moving too soon is that the job\u2019s not quite done, and that the really good readings we\u2019ve had for the last six months somehow turn out not to be a true indicator of where inflation\u2019s heading,\u201d he told the 60 Minutes programme on CBS. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. But the prudent thing to do is to just give it some time and see that the data continue to confirm that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustainable way.\u201d Last week, the Bank of England also played down the likelihood of an early cut to interest rates. Financial markets still expect Threadneedle Street to push down the interest rate of 5.25% in the UK towards 4% by the end of the year, but Andrew Bailey, the governor, threw cold water on a more aggressive stance, saying: \u201cWe need to see more evidence that inflation is set to fall all the way to the 2% target, and stay there, before we can lower interest rates.\u201d The OECD said growth in the global economy was likely to ease to 2.9% in 2024, from 3.1% in 2023, before recovering to 3% in 2025. Strong US growth will be higher than forecast at 2.1% in 2024. The eurozone will act as a counterweight to the US after its growth rate was downgraded from 0.9% in 2024, at the time of November\u2019s forecast, to 0.6%. The UK\u2019s growth rate for this year was left unchanged at 0.7% and is still expected to recover to 1.2% in 2025. China is expected to be a significant barrier to global growth as it struggles to cope with high levels of corporate debt and a weak property market, the OECD said. It said the estimate for China\u2019s GDP growth, which was 5.2% in 2023, was 4.7% this year before dropping to 4.2% in 2025."

            "content": "Tumbling energy costs and a price war between Britain\u2019s supermarkets have slowed food inflation to its lowest rate for nearly two years in a boost for households trying to cope on stretched budgets. The cost of meat, fish and fruit dipped in February, meaning food prices rose 5% on last year, down from 6.1% in January and the lowest since May 2022, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) shop price index. Although the figures show prices are still rising, the rate is far lower than the double-digit increases consumers have consistently faced since rising energy prices triggered rampant inflation over the past two years. The index showed food prices fell 0.1% in February on the previous month, its first monthly fall since last September. \u201cThis was driven by easing input costs for energy and fertiliser while retailers competed fiercely to keep prices down,\u201d said Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC. A sharp fall in the wholesale price of gas has fed through into household energy bills, with the industry regulator Ofgem announcing last week that its price cap will fall 12%, or \u00a3238 to \u00a31,690, from April. Meanwhile, there are increasing signs the major supermarkets are ramping up efforts to compete on price. The cost of living crisis has weighed on retailers\u2019 attempts to maintain their profit margins while attracting customers tackling increases in household bills and shopping budgets. Last week, Morrisons launched a campaign to tell customers it offers the same or cheaper prices than discounters Aldi and Lidl, echoing similar marketing drives by Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s. Overall, shop price inflation eased to 2.5% in February, from 2.9% in January. Nonfood prices rose, up 1.3% on a year earlier and 0.7% on January. Richard Walker, the executive chair of frozen food chain Iceland, said a cost squeeze in its supply chain had eased and it had seen \u201cstrong sales\u201d after cutting prices, including on pizzas, beef burgers and ready meals. \u201cCost pressures throughout manufacturing are coming down and this is starting to come through,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe are passing on the biggest falls faster than wholesale prices are coming down for us to get ahead of the game. For our customers, offering great value is more important than ever.\u201d The BRC figures showed the price of furniture, electricals, and health and beauty products rose, but clothing fell as retailers attempted to lure shoppers with promotions. Dickinson said that easing inflation was \u201cgood news\u201d for shoppers, but warned that the increase in shipping costs due to disruption in the Red Sea could push up the cost of non-food items, and reiterated calls for government help on retailers\u2019 business rates bills ahead of next month\u2019s budget. Separate data from the CBI showed retail sales in the year to February fell at a modest pace after a sharp drop last month. Its quarterly survey predicted the rate at which sales would fall will accelerate next month."

            "date": "2024-02-15T14:32:06Z",
            "content": "The UK economy fell into recession at the end of last year as hard-pressed households cut back on spending amid the cost of living crisis, in a heavy blow to Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise to kickstart growth. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a larger than expected 0.3% in the three months to December after a decline in all main sectors of the economy and collapse in retail sales in the run-up to Christmas. It followed a drop of 0.1% in the third quarter, confirming a second consecutive quarter of falling national output \u2013 the technical definition of a recession. Official confirmation of a recession will embarrass the prime minister before a general election expected this year, having made growing the economy one of his five flagship priorities for government. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Sunak\u2019s promise was \u201cin tatters\u201d after years of economic stagnation under the Conservatives. \u201cThis is Rishi Sunak\u2019s recession, and the news will be deeply worrying for families and business across Britain,\u201d she said. The ONS said growth over the course of 2023 as a whole was estimated at 0.1%, the weakest year since 2009 during the financial crisis, excluding the economic collapse in 2020 during the Covid pandemic. Highlighting a deep economic malaise as households come under pressure from soaraway prices and higher borrowing costs, official figures show economic growth per head of the population shrank for seven consecutive quarters, the worst performance since modern records began in 1955. The director of economic statistics at the ONS, Liz McKeown, said: \u201cOur initial estimate shows the UK economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2023. While it has now shrunk for two consecutive quarters, across 2023 as a whole the economy has been broadly flat. \u201cAll the main sectors fell on the quarter, with manufacturing, construction and wholesale being the biggest drags on growth, partially offset by increases in hotels and rentals of vehicles and machinery.\u201d Economists had widely expected a shallow recession at the end of last year as households came under pressure from higher borrowing costs and rising prices for everyday essentials, forcing cuts elsewhere. Widespread strikes across the economy and heavy rainfall also dampened activity. More recent snapshots from the economy have, however, shown a rebound in consumer confidence since the start of this year, buoyed up by the prospect of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England as inflationary pressures cool. Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, this week downplayed the significance of the quarterly GDP figures, suggesting there were signs of an upturn in the economy that would become clearer in the months ahead. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cHigh inflation is the single biggest barrier to growth, which is why halving it has been our top priority. While interest rates are high \u2013 so the Bank of England can bring inflation down \u2013 low growth is not a surprise. \u201cBut there are signs the British economy is turning a corner. Forecasters agree that growth will strengthen over the next few years, wages are rising faster than prices, mortgage rates are down and unemployment remains low. Although times are still tough for many families, we must stick to the plan \u2013 cutting taxes on work and business to build a stronger economy.\u201d The Bank is widely expected to begin cutting interest rates from as early as this summer amid growing concern over the strength of the economy after 14 consecutive increases in the cost of borrowing in response to soaring inflation. Official figures this week show inflation unexpectedly remained unchanged at 4% in January, having fallen back from more than 10% a year ago. Economic growth is forecast to outpace France and Germany this year, at 0.7%, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, but significantly trailing the US and several other advanced economies. The ONS said since the UK economy was about 1% larger than its pre-pandemic level, ahead of Germany, but behind every other country in the G7 group of leading developed countries. The latest snapshot from the ONS indicated weakness across much of the economy at the end of last year, with a fall in GDP amid a tough Christmas shopping period for retailers. Reflecting on pressure on household spending amid the cost of living crisis, the ONS said output in the UK\u2019s dominant services sector had fallen for three consecutive quarters, with a drop of 0.2% in the last three months of 2023. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: \u201cThough the shallowness of this recession provides comfort, these figures also confirm that our economy remained locked in a cycle of persistent stagnation throughout 2023 as a myriad of headwinds, including high inflation, weighed heavily on activity.\u201d"

            "content": "In the end it wasn\u2019t really that close. The UK economy is now technically in recession after contracting by 0.3% in the final three months of 2023. The official data brings to an end a miserable year for the UK. Growth in 2023 as a whole was just 0.1% \u2013 the weakest performance outside the Covid pandemic year of 2020 since 2009. In one sense, there is no comparison between 2009 and 2023. The former was a severe recession, with output declining by about 6% over a protracted period. In 2023 the economy had essentially stagnated: growing by 0.2% in the first quarter, remaining unchanged in the second quarter and then shrinking slightly in the second half of the year. That said, even a technical recession is a headache for Rishi Sunak, who made growing the economy one of his five new-year pledges at the start of 2023. As the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was quick to point out, the prime minister has failed to deliver on that promise. What\u2019s more, the economy showed across-the-board weakness in the fourth quarter, with all three main sectors \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 going backwards. There was also evidence that households had been cutting back on their spending as a result of cost of living pressures and the squeeze from higher interest rates. Consumer-facing services fell by 0.7% in the final three months of the year, largely as a result of people spending less in the shops and going out in the run-up to Christmas. Governments facing the prospect of a general election always want to generate a feelgood factor before polling day. Britain, in the last three months of 2023, had the opposite: a feel-bad factor. The picture would have been even worse had it not been for a rising population. Gross domestic product per head of population has not risen for seven straight quarters (six falls, one quarter unchanged) stretching back to early 2022. Jeremy Hunt put a brave face on what was clearly unwelcome news for a government facing two byelections on Thursday. The economy was \u201cturning a corner\u201d, the chancellor said, and forecasters were predicting stronger growth over the coming years. Hunt may well be right. The worst for the economy is now probably over. Business and consumer confidence are picking up a bit. The housing market is showing signs of stabilising. The City is expecting the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates by the middle of the year. Ultimately, it makes little difference whether the economy is moving sideways or contracting marginally, particularly since revisions in the future may well show the UK was not in recession after all. But it would have certainly been politically helpful to Sunak and Hunt had the UK emulated the eurozone and narrowly avoided a recession in late 2023. The fact that it did not puts added pressure on the chancellor to come up with some \u201cfeel better\u201d measures in the budget on 6 March."

What? Surely France is the home of romance? That\u2019s not what I heard. What did you hear? I heard that la flamme has gone out. What does that mean? The French are not having sex. Don\u2019t be silly. They\u2019re famously at it tout le temps, comme les couteaux. Not any more, apparently. According to a new study, France is suffering from \u201can unprecedented decline\u201d in sexual activity. How steep is the decline? A cool 24% of French adults aged 18-69 said they had not had sex in the previous 12 months. In 2006 that figure was just 9%. \u00c7a alors! The decline is steeper still among the young: between the ages of 18 and 24 the proportion of celibates was 28%, up from 5% in 2006. Why have they gone off it? According to the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP) \u2013 which conducted the poll from a sample of 1,911 people \u2013 it could just be a form of social correction. \u201cWhat one generation does intensely, the next does less,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Kraus, IFOP\u2019s director. That\u2019s no explanation. There\u2019s also a suggestion that the French have escaped a cultural expectation to be sexually active. Women in particular now feel free to say non. So it\u2019s just a French thing? Also non. The number of cases of decreased sexual desire reported to the Spanish National Health System went up almost tenfold between 2011 and 2018. Other research has shown declines in Germany and the Netherlands in recent years. Thank God for Brexit. The frequency of sex has also been decreasing steadily in the UK for decades. Are there no benefits to leaving the EU? This is an international problem: similar declines have been reported in the US, Japan and Australia. It\u2019s probably due to increased stress, heavier workloads and the competing distractions of technology. \u201cDistractions of technology\u201d: you mean pornography? \u201cThe internet provides new mediums of sexual experience that shift away from physical, partnered experiences,\u201d the study says. We\u2019re doomed. Then again, the recent figures could just be a reflection of a newfound willingness to be honest about these matters. Is anyone still interested in sex? Italy tops the European tables for self-reported sex drive, according to the adult toy seller LoveHoney\u2019s \u201cLibidOlympics\u201d study. If self-reporting was all there was to it, I\u2019d come top. That\u2019s enough honesty. Do say: \u201cNow?

            "content": "Britain is showing signs of recovery from its mild recession and will receive a boost when interest rates start coming down later this year, the Bank of England governor has said. Andrew Bailey rejected accusations that Threadneedle Street\u2019s reluctance to cut borrowing costs despite falling inflation meant it was \u201cbehind the curve\u201d and made it clear rate cuts were coming. \u201cWe don\u2019t need inflation to come back to target before we cut interest rates,\u201d Bailey said as he came under pressure from Conservative members of the Treasury committee to respond to news that the UK fell into recession in the second half of 2023. \u201cThe economy seems to be at full employment and that\u2019s a very good story,\u201d the governor said. In comparison to previous downturns, the UK was suffering from a \u201cvery small recession\u201d and was now showing \u201cdistinct signs of recovery\u201d, he added. The two quarters of negative growth last year only added up to a 0.5% drop in GDP. \u201cIf you look at recessions going back to the 1970s, this is the weakest by a long way,\u201d Bailey said. The range for previous recessions was for the economy to contract by between 2.5% and 22% over two quarters, he added. The annual inflation rate currently stands at 4% but Bailey said he expected it to come back to its 2% target temporarily within the next few months before rising to 2.75% by the end of 2024. The Bank\u2019s latest forecasts for inflation are based on the predicted path of interest rates in the financial markets, and these assume the first cut in borrowing costs in June or August this year. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs said it expected the first rate cut to be made in June. It had previously forecast this would take place in May. Bailey said: \u201cI am comfortable with an interest rate profile that has cuts in it. What I am not saying is by how much they will be cut and when.\u201d Conservative MP John Baron asked why rates were not already being cut given that the economic warning signs were \u201cflashing red\u201d. The governor said the question for the Bank was how long interest rates needed to remain restrictive to bring inflation sustainably back to target. \u201cWe are not there yet, he said. The governor said there were \u201cencouraging signs\u201d inflation in the services sector and earnings growth \u2013 two of the key factors the MPC takes into account when setting rates \u2013 were moderating. Ben Broadbent, one of the Bank\u2019s deputy governors, supported Bailey\u2019s view that rate cuts were probable over the coming months. In an annual report to the Treasury committee, Broadbent said the Bank\u2019s forecasts don\u2019t rule out an easing of policy in 2024, adding: \u201cIn my view, that is the more likely direction in which Bank rate is likely to move. But even if that proves to be the case, the timing of any adjustment can only depend on the actual evolution of the economic data.\u201d"

            "title": "To revive Britain from recession the next government must get growth right | Richard Partington",
            "date": "2024-02-18T11:56:36Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy is in a deep rut. After news confirming the country fell into recession late last year, most experts agree the downturn is likely to be shortlived and shallow. Few, though, are betting on a strong recovery from the toughest period for living standards in almost 70 years. In most of the economic cycles of the past century, robust growth has typically followed each period of recession, as households and businesses get back on their feet after each setback. But as highlighted by Matt Whittaker of the Pro Bono Economics thinktank, the past two decades have been different. Gross domestic product per capita has either fallen or flatlined for the past seven quarters, and it is now 16 years since the last sustained uptick came to an end. For whoever wins the next general election, making sure Britain can escape this quagmire ought to be the top priority. After more than a decade and a half of flatlining progress, capped by the current cost of living crisis, poverty levels have risen sharply. The proceeds of what little growth has been eked out are unevenly spread and geographically imbalanced, while the UK is slipping behind comparable advanced nations. To revive the sputtering engine of the economy, the next government will, however, need to keep in mind the kind of growth Britain would benefit from most. The plan will need two priorities in particular: tackling the inequalities entrenched over the past decade, and ensuring the biggest challenge of all \u2013 the climate crisis \u2013 is addressed. So far there is reluctance among political leaders to set out a clear roadmap, with Rishi Sunak promising tax cuts that would fail on the first priority while increasingly hacking away at policies that could help address the second. The prime minister had promised in the first weeks of his premiership to turn Britain into a \u201cclean energy superpower\u201d. Since then, however, Sunak has rowed back on net zero policies and leaned into anti-green politics to pacify the right of his party. Keir Starmer has also staged a managed retreat, having scaled back Labour\u2019s \u00a328bn green investment plan out of fear the Tories could weaponise it in the election campaign. At the heart of both is a common theme: affordability. The fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, Covid pandemic, Brexit and the cumulative drag on productivity from more than a decade of Tory underinvestment has indeed taken its toll on the exchequer, as has spiralling demand from an ageing population. The government\u2019s budget deficit is historically high, while the national debt has risen to the highest level since the 1960s. However, it also plays on two falsehoods. First, that inaction is cost-free. This is patently untrue, as the past 15 years of underinvestment have shown, laying the ground for our current weak economic performance. The consequences of the climate crisis are also becoming clearer and costlier for households and businesses. And second, that leaving the private sector alone to kickstart growth and manage the climate transition would be cheaper. The cost of investing in new technologies does not magically vanish in the private sector. Instead of being borne on the government balance sheet \u2013 paid for mostly through taxation \u2013 the household balance sheet picks it up instead, in the prices charged for utilities, goods and services. As a paper from the leftwing Common Wealth thinktank last week showed, state-led investment in clean energy could be substantially cheaper than the private sector equivalent, primarily through the difference in cheaper borrowing costs that nations enjoy over corporate borrowers, helping households to save money on their bills. Investing in the climate transition could also help kickstart economic growth, creating the jobs and industries of the future. The report set out the case for a more ambitious plan for Labour\u2019s Great British Energy, the party\u2019s publicly owned clean energy generation company. According to the report, Labour\u2019s initial \u00a38.3bn capitalisation of GB Energy could save between \u00a3125m and \u00a3208m a year on debt interest costs each year compared with equivalent borrowing in the private sector \u2013 saving up to \u00a31bn in total. While Starmer cut back Labour\u2019s overall \u00a328bn investment plan, the decision to keep and prioritise GB Energy is an important move. Plenty of details over its operation still need clarifying. And it could be more ambitious. But a publicly owned firm investing in renewable energy could help optimise the transition to net zero. One criticism would be that the state lacks the knowhow big energy companies possess, or would be less efficient than the private sector, adding to the cost of energy generation. However, it is increasingly clear the market alone is failing to deliver, as some of the wealthiest energy firms in history funnel profits into investor payouts rather than renewables. Over the last two years energy companies have benefited from a boom in prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing what ought to be a powerful war chest for the green transition. But analysis by the IPPR thinktank shows that BP and Shell alone handed \u00a332.6bn back to their investors in 2022 through dividends and share buybacks \u2013 11 times more than the \u00a32.9bn they invested in renewables. In a world of rising supply chain costs, geopolitical shocks and higher borrowing costs on financial markets, a state-backed firm could help de-risk the cost of renewables projects for private firms by co-investing alongside them. It makes even more sense when the approach is already the norm in Britain \u2013 only with companies owned by overseas governments rather than our own. Figures from Common Wealth show 42.2% of the installed capacity from operational and under-construction windfarms in the UK is owned by foreign public entities, including state-owned enterprises and public pension funds. Such is the lack of our own involvement that the UK government owns less of that capacity (0.03%) than the city of Munich does (0.85%) through its stake in the Gwynt y M\u00f4r windfarm off the north Wales coast. The next government will have choices to make. Powering up economic growth could be helped by a step-change in green investment. Rather than holding back amid fears over affordability, it\u2019s the cost of inaction that would hurt more."

            "content": "Robert Buckland has launched a broadside against Lee Anderson, Suella Braverman and Liz Truss and said that any Conservative politician intent on stoking division \u201chad better get out and join another party\u201d. Buckland, the Tory MP for South Swindon and a former justice secretary, criticised his colleagues for \u201cdangerous\u201d rhetoric in the past week. The Conservatives have been warring over a series of interventions and remarks where Tory MPs have flirted with far-right sentiment. Lee Anderson, who was deputy chair of the party until a month ago, told GB News on Friday that Islamists had \u201cgot control of\u201d Sadiq Khan and that the London mayor had \u201cgiven our capital city away to his mates\u201d. He was stripped of the Tory whip after refusing to apologise. Buckland told Broadcasting House on BBC Radio 4 that Anderson\u2019s remark was \u201cracist\u201d and \u201crepugnant\u201d. \u201cThis man has crossed a line, very clearly,\u201d he said. \u201cA number of colleagues, notably Sajid Javid, me and others, noted this and expressed our view, and the party\u2019s acted. \u201cIt is wrong to conflate whole groups of people that are based on race or ethnicity with extremists. To start to conflate issues is dangerous. If it\u2019s being done deliberately, then it is absolutely unacceptable. Even if it\u2019s being done inadvertently, it\u2019s careless, it\u2019s reckless, and it doesn\u2019t help us deal with the serious issues.\u201d The deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg on BBC One that he did not believe Anderson was \u201cintending to be Islamophobic\u201d. He would have kept the whip had he apologised, Dowden said. Asked about Braverman\u2019s claim that Islamists were running the country, Dowden said he disagreed but that her remarks were \u201cin a different category\u201d because they were not directed at any individual. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that what Suella has said crosses the line in the way that Lee Anderson\u2019s comments do,\u201d he said. Braverman, a former home secretary under Rishi Sunak, wrote in the Telegraph last week that \u201cthe truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now\u201d. Asked about her comments, Buckland said: \u201cTo then say that we are being controlled or that they are in charge is, I think, to ramp things up in a way that is inaccurate, unnecessary and doesn\u2019t actually allow us to have a proper debate to confront these people on an accurate basis.\u201d Buckland was also asked about Liz Truss, the former prime minister, who took part in an interview with Steve Bannon, a former chief strategist to Donald Trump, and remained silent as Bannon hailed the far-right figure Tommy Robinson as a \u201chero\u201d. Buckland said: \u201cIt beggars belief to know what on earth was going on there \u2026 It is important that when people like this are being lauded as some sort of hero, that there\u2019s challenge. \u201cAny sort of suggestion that somehow this is a real conservatism and that people like me are Conservatives in name only is the opposite of the truth.\u201d \u201cWhat we stand for, proper Conservatives stand for, is bringing the country together and seeking to unify, challenging criminality and hate and extremism absolutely square on, and being honest and truthful about it \u2013 but bringing the country together, not dividing it. \u201cThat\u2019s what the proper Conservative vision is. That\u2019s what the Conservative party that I joined believes in, and anybody else who doesn\u2019t agree with that agenda and wants to fight had better get out and join another party, because that is not the Conservative party that I and millions of others believe in.\u201d During the 2022 Tory leadership contest, Buckland initially supported Sunak but then switched to Truss. In an apparent swipe at Sunak, who appointed Anderson and Braverman to senior roles, Buckland said: \u201cPeople talk about rottweilers or attack dogs in politics. The danger with having attack dogs with a licence to roam free is that sometimes they bite you on the hand, and that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening.\u201d Dowden told the BBC that Truss \u201cshould have called it out\u201d when Bannon lauded Robinson. During her trip to the US last week, Truss said she would like to see Nigel Farage become a Tory party member and suggested she could work with him to reshape the party. Dowden insisted that Farage would not be welcome. \u201cI, like many hundreds of thousands of Conservatives up and down the country, have spent many years campaigning against parties led by Nigel Farage,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cSo no, I don\u2019t support Nigel Farage to be joining the Conservative party.\u201d There is speculation that since losing the Tory whip, Anderson could join the rightwing populist party Reform UK, which is linked to Farage. Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader, said he was not in touch with Anderson. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this appears to be an internal squabble within the Conservative party about language,\u201d he told Times Radio."

            "date": "2024-02-06T00:01:52Z",
            "content": "Algorithms used by social media platforms are rapidly amplifying extreme misogynistic content, which is spreading from teenagers\u2019 screens and into school playgrounds where it has become normalised, according to a new report. Researchers said they detected a four-fold increase in the level of misogynistic content suggested by TikTok over a five-day period of monitoring, as the algorithm served more extreme videos, often focused on anger and blame directed at women. While this particular study looked at TikTok, researchers said their findings were likely to apply to other social media platforms and called for a \u201chealthy digital diet\u201d approach to tackling the problem, rather than outright bans on phones or social media which \u201care likely to be ineffective\u201d. The study, by teams at University College London and the University of Kent, comes at a time of renewed concern about the impact of social media on young people. Research last week found young men from generation Z \u2013 many of whom revere social media influencer Andrew Tate \u2013 are more likely than baby boomers to believe that feminism has done more harm than good. Meanwhile, the mother of murdered teenager, Brianna Ghey, called for social media apps to be banned on smartphones for under-16s after hearing evidence about the online activities of her daughter\u2019s killers. The UCL/Kent study, called Safer Scrolling, argues that harmful content is presented as entertainment through the algorithmic processes of social media. Toxic, hateful or misogynistic material is \u201cpushed\u201d to young people, with boys who are suffering from anxiety and poor mental health at increased risk, it said. \u201cHarmful views and tropes are now becoming normalised among young people,\u201d said principal investigator Dr Kaitlyn Regehr (UCL Information Studies). \u201cOnline consumption is impacting young people\u2019s offline behaviours, as we see these ideologies moving off screens and into schoolyards.\u201d Researchers interviewed young people engaging with and producing radical online content to help create a number of archetypes of teenage boys who might be vulnerable to becoming radicalised. Accounts were set up on TikTok for each archetype, each with specific interests \u2013 they might be seeking content on masculinity or loneliness \u2013 and researchers then watched more than 1,000 videos that TikTok suggested on its \u201cFor You\u201d page over seven days. The initial suggested content was in line with the stated interests of each archetype, but after five days researchers said the TikTok algorithm was presenting four times as many videos with misogynistic content including objectification, sexual harassment or discrediting women, which increased from 13% of recommended videos to 56%. \u201cAlgorithmic processes on TikTok and other social media sites target people\u2019s vulnerabilities \u2013 such as loneliness or feelings of loss of control \u2013 and gamify harmful content,\u201d said Regehr. \u201cAs young people microdose on topics like self-harm, or extremism, to them, it feels like entertainment.\u201d Researchers also interviewed young people and school leaders about the impact of social media and found that hateful ideologies and misogynistic tropes have moved off screens and into schools, and have become embedded in mainstream youth cultures. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which collaborated with the research, said: \u201cUCL\u2019s findings show that algorithms \u2013 which most of us know little about \u2013 have a snowball effect in which they serve up ever-more extreme content in the form of entertainment. \u201cThis is deeply worrying in general but particularly so in respect of the amplification of messages around toxic masculinity and its impact on young people who need to be able to grow up and develop their understanding of the world without being influenced by such appalling material. \u201cWe call upon TikTok in particular and social media platforms in general to review their algorithms as a matter of urgency and to strengthen safeguards to prevent this type of content, and on the government and Ofcom to consider the implications of this issue under the auspices of the new Online Safety Act.\u201d Andy Burrows, adviser to the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up in memory of Molly Russell, who killed herself after falling into a vortex of despair on social media, said: \u201cThis research reinforces how TikTok\u2019s algorithms ruthlessly target and bombard young people with harmful content, and within days can serve teens a near constant barrage of unhealthy and sometimes dangerous videos. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be clearer that the regulator Ofcom needs to take bold and decisive action to tackle high-risk algorithms that prioritise the revenue of social media companies over the safety and wellbeing of teens.\u201d Speaking on a trip to Northern Ireland, prime minister Rishi Sunak said: \u201cAs a parent, I am always worried about social media and what my young girls are exposed to. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pleased we have passed the Online Safety Act over the last year and that means the regulator now has tough new powers to control what is exposed to children online. \u201cAnd if the big social media companies do not comply with that, the regulator is able to levy very significant fines on them and the priority now is making sure that act is up and running.\u201d A TikTok spokesperson said: \u201cMisogyny has long been prohibited on TikTok and we proactively detect 93% of content we remove for breaking our rules on hate. The methodology used in this report does not reflect how real people experience TikTok.\u201d An Ofcom spokesperson said: \u201cTackling violence against women and girls online is a priority for us. Our research shows that women are less confident about their personal online safety, and are more affected by harmful content like trolling. \u201cUnder the Online Safety Act, online services such as social media and search services will have duties to protect users\u2019 safety and their rights \u2013 understanding and addressing content which disproportionately affects women and girls online is central to this.\u201d"

The analysis, by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) thinktank and the charity Justice and Care, found that criminal exploitation is the most common type of modern slavery occurring in the UK in the past four years. It found that 45% of those suffering from criminal exploitation are British boys aged 17 and under, according to referrals to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a system used to identify people in danger or at risk of exploitation. The analysis found that about two-thirds were British and mostly teenagers and vulnerable adults who are \u201cforced, coerced or groomed into committing crime for someone else\u2019s benefit\u201d.

Eleanor Lyons, the independent anti-slavery commissioner, backed the report\u2019s demand for a widening of the Modern Slavery Act to include criminal exploitation, which she said would help with the \u201cinconsistent\u201d response to the problem from police and other agencies. \u201cCriminals are using new ways to coerce people into committing crimes to line their own pockets,\u201d she said. \u201cUndoubtedly this can sometimes be difficult to understand, but those who are targeted by gangs can sometimes be forced to offend. They are victims too \u2013 victims of criminal exploitation. \u201cThat is why this report rightly calls on the government and frontline policing to make sure criminal exploitation is prosecuted for what it is: a form of modern slavery. This will also allow us to do more to prevent the endless stream of young people and vulnerable adults being pulled into criminal exploitation and give them the support they deserve.\u201d Substance misuse, family circumstances, learning disabilities, school exclusion or financial deprivation were all factors identified as putting people at greater risk. Polling for the report found that a quarter of people in the most deprived parliamentary constituencies had seen signs of criminal exploitation in their community compared with 15% in the least deprived communities. A quarter of teachers in schools with the most deprived students had encountered suspected criminal exploitation compared with 12% in the most affluent schools. Criminal exploitation often features in \u201ccounty lines\u201d drug dealing, where victims can be coerced or groomed into committing crime through debts, violence or manipulation. The report demands a new law tackling so-called cuckooing, where a victim is made to store weapons or criminal proceeds on their property. A government spokesperson said: \u201cProtecting children from all forms of exploitation is a key priority. As part of our county lines programme, we are investing up to \u00a35m over three years to support exploited victims and their families. We also remain committed to rolling out the Independent Child Trafficking Guardian Service across England and Wales, and tackling the abhorrent practice of cuckooing by working closely with the police to use all the tools and powers available to them.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-19T12:00:12Z",
            "content": "Louisiana\u2019s Republican-dominated state legislature is poised to enact a swathe of new criminal justice measures as a special legislative session convenes on Monday, leaving reform advocates concerned about soaring rates of incarceration that may follow. The session, called by the state\u2019s new far-right governor, Jeff Landry, will consider two dozen items including broad restrictions on parole eligibility, measures to resume executions, the lowering of the age limit for adult prosecutions, and changes to post-conviction procedures often used to remedy wrongful convictions or excessive sentences. The results are likely to undo hard-won bipartisan reform efforts in 2017, which helped shrink the state\u2019s prison population by about a quarter and led to Louisiana losing the title of America\u2019s most incarcerated state, with the rate of imprisonment slipping below Mississippi\u2019s in recent years. Landry, the state\u2019s former attorney general, came to office in January after a campaign centered on hardline law and order. A former sheriff\u2019s deputy, he was sworn into office in a ceremony lined by flags associated with the \u201cblue lives matter\u201d movement that aligns with law enforcement and is often associated with white nationalism, marking the end of eight years of Democratic incumbency in the deep south state. In announcing the session on 8 February, Landry argued a raft of new laws would \u201crepeal soft-on-crime policies that enable criminals and hurt our communities\u201d and pledged to \u201cmake our state safe again\u201d. While rates of violent crime in Louisiana have long been among the highest in the nation, the state has seen a significant decline since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. And as details of the proposed new laws came into focus, advocates expressed alarm at a number of severe measures they argued would do little to improve public safety, continue to disproportionately affect Black communities and cost the state billions to enforce. \u201cOur elected officials are pushing strategies that assume violence will always happen and there\u2019s nothing they can do to prevent it other than just punish people,\u201d said Sarah Omojola, director of the non-profit Vera Institute of Justice\u2019s Louisiana office. \u201cBut what people in Louisiana really need and want is prevention.\u201d Among the bills state lawmakers are set to consider is one that would expand methods of execution, including legalizing the use of nitrogen hypoxia, the controversial suffocation procedure recently used for the first time in Alabama. The bill would also maintain the state\u2019s use of electrocution as an available method and give confidentiality to providers of drugs for lethal injections. Although nearly 60 people still sit on Louisiana\u2019s death row, the state has not executed anyone since 2010. Its former Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, announced shortly before his final term ended that he was opposed to capital punishment, although he failed to meaningfully intervene during a mass clemency effort last year. Other bills would lead to longer periods of incarceration for broad categories of cases by removing parole eligibility for extended periods of time to those deemed \u201cdangerous offenders\u201d by the state. Such a definition could be imposed not only for those convicted of violent crimes but also by raising previous criminal records, conduct during previous periods of incarceration and \u201cany previous efforts to rehabilitate\u201d. Landry has also encouraged lawmakers to change the rules of parole board hearings to require unanimous decisions before granting applications. The legislature will also consider undoing recent legislation that raised the age for most adult prosecutions to 18 in order to protect juveniles from abuse and harsh conditions in adult prison. It will also examine a bill that would significantly tighten rules on post-conviction relief for those seeking to overturn a conviction or sentence after exhausting appeals, by removing local prosecutors\u2019 rights to waiving mandatory time limits to file applications. Post-conviction relief has been a key tool in local prosecutors\u2019 offices, notably in New Orleans, seeking to address past harms in the criminal justice system by re-examining historical cases involving prosecutorial misconduct, due process violations, and sentencing that was disproportionate as well as racially biased. \u201cThis slate of items Landry has proposed are dangerous, expensive and disingenuous,\u201d said Samantha Kennedy, executive director of the Promise of Justice Initiative, a New Orleans-based advocacy and legal group. \u201cI think what it does is cover up misconduct and excessive sentencing mostly coming from the 1990s.\u201d Kennedy added: \u201cThese cases are fraught with all kinds of problems, and that is why we have a parole system and all these other checks and balances that this special session is proposing to destroy. It is unconscionable.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-20T17:05:15Z",
            "content": "A draft bill to reform Britain\u2019s railway has been published by the government \u2013 derided by Labour as \u201cfittingly late\u201d and with no prospect of becoming law. The bill, which can go before MPs for scrutiny but will not be put forward for legislation before the election, theoretically paves the way for an independent Great British Railways body to oversee both the railway infrastructure and train services. The Department for Transport said that the new body \u2013 first announced under Boris Johnson in 2021 after a review commissioned in 2018 \u2013 would make for a simpler, more accountable and more effective rail system. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, said: \u201cThis draft bill demonstrates our commitment to reforming the railways. Working with industry, we will move towards a more modern and financially secure rail network that delivers for passengers for the next 200 years.\u201d The bill has been published a year after Harper insisted in a keynote annual speech to the rail industry that Downing Street and the Treasury were backing the reforms, despite widespread scepticism. However, with a general election due this year, it appears unlikely that the 32-page draft bill establishing the integrated rail body will be enacted. At a separate Rail Industry Association event this week, Patrick McLoughlin, the former Conservative transport secretary, said it was \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d that the bill remained only in draft form. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, said: \u201cIt is fitting that the Conservative\u2019s flagship rail reform plan has arrived so late it has no prospect of ever becoming law. \u201cYears after they promised change, they\u2019ve finally admitted they can\u2019t and won\u2019t fix our broken railways.\u201d Labour has yet to set out exactly how it will reform the railways, but may well retain some aspects of the bill, including the promised integrated body, as well as bringing train operating contracts into public ownership when they expire. The Conservatives first commissioned a review into the railway after the chaos and cancellations sparked by a timetable change in May 2018, alongside the financial collapse of key train operating franchises. The Williams-Shapps review was delayed during Covid but was finally published in 2021 with the pledge to create a new Great British Railways (GBR). A 100-strong \u201ctransition team\u201d, GBRTT, was tasked with establishing the body but tussles over policy and Treasury opposition meant that within a year many observers believed it was doomed. The team has continued to work on fares reform and other aspects not requiring primary legislation. Andrew Haines, the chief executive of Network Rail and the GBRTT lead, said: \u201cPassengers, freight customers and communities are crying out for a simpler, better railway and the publication of the draft bill is an important step on that journey. \u201cBringing track and train together under a guiding mind is by far the best way to improve the service the railway offers, unlock the economic potential of a growing network and reduce the burden on the taxpayer.\u201d Rail Partners, an industry body representing train operators and other private firms in rail, said the publication of the draft bill was a \u201cuseful step forward\u201d. Its chief executive, Andy Bagnall, said it started \u201can important process to identify areas of consensus and disagreement between the political parties ahead of a general election\u201d."

            "content": "It looks as if Rishi Sunak has run out of road. The latest Labour byelection victories in Wellingborough and Kingswood come despite Keir Starmer\u2019s most challenging fortnight as Labour leader, with a key policy U-turn on the party\u2019s \u00a328bn green economy package and its continued issues with tackling antisemitism. Yet in spite of all that, Labour won with significant swings, and Thursday\u2019s results show a Conservative party whose vote is being eaten up on all fronts. On one side, the Conservatives are losing out to a Labour party that is stealing the Tories\u2019 levelling up mantra, itself now claiming the mantle of being the party of aspiration with a \u201cbreaking down barriers\u201d mission. And on the other side, the Tory party is under pressure from Reform UK, which is highlighting Sunak\u2019s failed \u201cstop the boats\u201d policy and portraying that as a wider failure to control post-Brexit immigration. It\u2019s clear that many in the Conservative party will now push it to counter Reform UK by matching yet more of its political rhetoric and policies. That would be a huge mistake. Part of the problem is that Sunak\u2019s emphatic stop the boats promise is akin to a prime minister claiming that rather than cutting crime, they can stop it completely. Whatever the clear merits in rightly combating illegal people smugglers, the oversimplistic rhetoric is a political gift that will keep on giving to Reform UK. If just one boat arrives, they can keep telling voters Sunak has demonstrably failed. A further shift towards a Reform UK version of the Conservative party also leaves the broader political landscape ever wider open for Labour to dominate. With so much focus on shoring up its Reform UK-minded voters to the exclusion of others, it\u2019s harder and harder for the Conservatives to get any credible policy messages across to the rest of the voting public. There is a solution for the Conservative party, one that counters both the Labour challenge on opportunity and the Reform UK challenge on migration. It is to set out an ambitious, generational plan on developing homegrown talent and driving social mobility, to produce the skills Britain\u2019s economy needs, and remove the barriers that too often stop talent flowing to, and creating its own, opportunities. The Conservative party must understand that it will never win by being Reform UK\u2013lite. It will never successfully \u201cout-Reform\u201d Reform UK. Aping it just plays into Reform UK\u2019s hands. The only real answer was to deliver on the levelling up promise that Boris Johnson made but failed to fulfil, something people voted for, regardless of whether they had ever voted Conservative before. Disastrously, levelling up has been all but shelved under Sunak\u2019s leadership, not mentioned once in his ill-judged \u201clet Rishi be Rishi\u201d 2023 conference speech. Those who warn that the party faces an \u201cextinction event\u201d at the forthcoming election are right. But it\u2019s because, time and time again, the party has consistently chosen to play up to the negative, simplistic, culture wars-driven rhetoric of Ukip and, latterly, Reform UK. Instead, it should have some collective courage, not just to reject those siren voices, but to become the broader, more positive alternative \u2013 the ambitious party of social mobility that Britain needs. The Conservative party has been heading down a political cul-de-sac for some time. It might have felt like moving forwards, but the reality was different for voters. Now the party\u2019s hitting the end of the road. It will be a long way back, but the journey needs to start now. Justine Greening is a former education secretary and Conservative MP for Putney"

George Galloway, another former Labour MP, is the bookies\u2019 favourite to win. GMP said on Tuesday that a 23-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of malicious communications.

            "content": "Puffing and wheezing its way on to the parliamentary agenda, the Department for Transport\u2019s long-promised bill to reform Britain\u2019s railways was finally published last week, in draft form. Almost certainly, given limited legislative time before the next election, it will never be voted into law. As Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, waspishly observed, it was fitting that this final act of strategic mismanagement should lead to a disastrously late arrival. It is six years since the government commissioned a review of the rail industry, following timetabling chaos in the north of England. Since then, multiple transport secretaries have presided over what has amounted to a rolling omnishambles. In the north, cancellations, late-running services and overcrowding have brought the network into disrepute. The cancellation of HS2 beyond Birmingham, and the related downgrading of Northern Powerhouse Rail, have made a mockery of the government\u2019s supposed levelling up ambitions. Nationally, ministers\u2019 mishandling of pay negotiations with unions has inflicted extended misery on travellers, and needlessly alienated an entire workforce. Most recently, government-backed plans to shut more than a thousand station ticket offices proved so unpopular that they were binned almost as soon as the public got wind of them. The common thread in this sorry sequence has been a refusal to invest sufficiently for the long term, and a blinkered determination to prioritise cost-cutting across the network. Since the pandemic, this Treasury-driven approach has assumed that the railways need to permanently adjust to a new reality, in which an economic model dependent on business travel no longer applies. Though passenger numbers are now back at 90% of the pre-Covid peak, revenues have not kept pace, and guaranteed income from commuter season tickets has fallen away. The new normal does not seem to have troubled the private companies that lease out Britain\u2019s trains \u2013 their profits trebled last year. But it is the lamentable shortsightedness in Whitehall that truly exasperates. According to forecasts from one specialist rail consultancy, the number of people travelling by train could double by 2050. This would be exactly the right direction of travel, helping the country make the necessary move to a greener transport network. Handled with imagination and flair \u2013 for example, in relation to ticketing \u2013 it could also deliver huge social benefits. But a misconceived austerity strategy is inflicting reputational damage as service standards drop, grievously undermining industry morale and risking a spiral of decline. Beyond a commitment to renationalise train operators as existing contracts expire, Labour has largely been keeping stumm about its own ideas. It has so far not ruled out creating an independent Great British Railways-type body to run the industry, as envisaged in the DfT\u2019s draft bill. But what the railways need above all is a government focused on growth not decline, which recognises the strategic importance of public transport in Britain\u2019s future. After a period in which industrial relations have reached rock bottom, the rail unions and train operators should be seen as partners in that wider vision. A new era of ambition and collaboration is required, after the scandalous dysfunction of recent years. The curtain must come down on a period in which passengers have been paying more for less, victims of an overbearing Treasury that has known the price of everything and the value of nothing."

            "content": "According to his son, for the 10 years after Norman Ward was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the age of 60, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have known he was unwell\u201d. But eventually, the cancer \u201cspread everywhere\u201d. Then he had a stroke. \u201cIt was all going wrong,\u201d said Gareth Ward of his father. \u201cHe had been very independent. As long as he could go down the pub and walk his dog, he was happy. But he was in an awful lot of pain for a long time. He got thinner and weaker, and he had to take morphine all the time. He looked like he was already dead, and no one had told him.\u201d One day, Norman called his son and said he couldn\u2019t have another night like the one that had just passed. \u201cHe was very matter of fact, and said he was going to shoot himself, and then he hung up. He knew exactly what he was saying and doing.\u201d Ward\u2019s stomach dropped. His father had a licensed shotgun locked away in the attic of his house. He called 999 and also his sisters, who lived near Norman. One sister reached the house before the police, and found her father\u2019s body in a garden chair. He was 75. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t have to do what my dad did. But he was in a world of pain and it was only going to get worse. My dad decided to put himself down,\u201d he said. Since his father\u2019s death, Ward has joined the campaign in favour of allowing assisted dying for people with terminal illnesses. \u201cWe need more compassion,\u201d he said. This week, MPs published a report on what they described as this \u201cdifficult, sensitive and yet crucial subject\u201d. It came amid growing calls for a change in the law, triggered in part by celebrity interventions from Dame Diana Rigg, Dame Harriet Walter and Dame Esther Rantzen, who has described the current law on assisted dying as a \u201cmess\u201d. More than 130,000 people signed a petition calling for a parliamentary debate and vote on assisted dying. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who could be prime minister by the end of the year, has backed a call for a change in the law. Campaigners point to overwhelming support among the public, and say the mood among MPs has significantly shifted since the last vote in 2015. The MPs\u2019 report laid out evidence on assisted dying, and reflected arguments both for and against. Its intention was to provide a useful resource for debate on the issue. Gordon Macdonald, the chief executive of Care Not Killing, which represents more than 40 organisations opposed to assisted dying, said he was disappointed that MPs had not \u201ccome down firmly\u201d against changing the law. \u201cMPs could have decided to firmly close the door on assisted suicide and euthanasia,\u201d he said, \u201cand say the current law, which protects everyone regardless of whether they are young or old, able bodied or disabled, should remain. They failed.\u201d From the other side of the debate, Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said the report \u201cshifts the prospect of an assisted dying law for the UK from a hypothetical to a reality. It acknowledges that law change is coming down the track in the British Isles and rightly calls on the government to engage in this debate. \u201cIf MPs take just one thing from the mountains of evidence heard in this inquiry, it\u2019s that the current law on assisted dying is unsafe and woefully inadequate. Palliative care is simply not enough to give everyone a peaceful death, forcing terminally ill Britons to contemplate taking their own lives or seek compassion in Switzerland.\u201d The report points out that the proportion of the UK population over the age of 65, and therefore more likely to suffer from terminal illnesses, is rising sharply. According to government statistics, there will be an additional 7.5 million over-65s within 50 years. Although the UK is a \u201cworld leader\u201d in palliative and end-of-life care, provision is patchy, according to the report. Dr Paul Perkins, the chief medical director at the charity Sue Ryder, told the MPs\u2019 inquiry: \u201cI am constantly surprised that as a society it is OK for us to have to sell second-hand cardigans to be able to look after seriously ill people. If people thought that you had to sell second-hand cardigans for their cancer surgery, I don\u2019t think that would be acceptable.\u201d But even outstanding palliative care was not enough in some cases. One person told the inquiry that their wife\u2019s cancer \u201cproved resistant to all treatment options, including rather heroic neurosurgery \u2026 Her treatment, including specialist palliative care, had been excellent throughout, but she\u2019d simply had enough. And she actually said to me: \u2018They treat cats and dogs better than humans.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t that she was in pain. She just felt dreadful all the time and she knew this was only going one way.\u201d Dr Stephen Duckworth told the inquiry that as a severely disabled person, he had been strongly opposed to assisted dying until he sat on the Commission on Assisted Dying, which reported in 2012. \u201cThe evidence that emerged from this commission resulted in me changing my mind,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cA terminally ill person requesting an assisted death is not choosing between living and dying. They are choosing between two different ways of dying: either enduring avoidable suffering or a peaceful death surrounded by family and friends celebrating life.\u201d Pippa Stone lived for 18 days after her brain tumour was diagnosed at the age of 60, but those days would \u201chaunt me for the rest of my life\u201d, said her daughter, Josie Kemp. \u201cShe deteriorated a lot quicker than we expected. It was so undignified, not the end of life anyone would want. \u201cShe cried and told us that she just wanted to die. She was in nappies, she lost her speech, she lost the ability to swallow. And there was nothing that anyone could do about it. She was on the maximum medication she could be on. It was a very traumatic experience for everyone,\u201d she added. Her mother would \u201cdefinitely have wanted an assisted death if it was available. Her life could have ended while she could still speak and had her dignity.\u201d Kemp now campaigns for a change in the law on assisted dying. \u201cEveryone is one horrific death away from wanting this to happen,\u201d she said."

            "content": "Trudging across the top of Bromley Mountain Ski Resort on a sunny afternoon in January, Matt Folts checks his smartwatch and smiles: 14 degrees fahrenheit. That is very nearly his favorite temperature for making snow. It\u2019s cold enough for water to quickly crystallize, but not so cold that his hourslong shifts on the mountain are miserable. Folts is the head snowmaker at Bromley, a small ski area on the southern end of Vermont\u2019s Green Mountains. The burly 35-year-old sports a handlebar moustache, an orange safety jacket, and thick winter boots that crunch in the snow as he walks. A blue hammer swings from his belt. It is nearing the end of the day for skiers, but not for Folts. He\u2019ll work well into the evening preparing the mountain for tomorrow\u2019s crowd. Cutting across the entrances to Sunder and Corkscrew, he heads toward a stubby snow gun used to blanket Blue Ribbon, an experts-only trail named in honor of Bromley\u2019s founder, Fred Pabst Jr. The apparatus stands a few feet high, with three legs and a metal head that\u2019s angled toward the sky. Two lines that resemble fire hoses supply the device with water and compressed air, which it uses to hiss precipitation into the air. As the water droplets fall, they coalesce into snowflakes. \u201cIf it was warmer I\u2019d be a yeti,\u201d says Folts, referring to wetter snow that, if conditions were just a bit balmier, would leave him abominably white. But at these temperatures the powder he\u2019d just made bounced lightly off his sleeve. \u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d Yet perfect fake fluff like Folts\u2019 poses a climate conundrum. On one hand, making snow requires enormous amounts of energy, which creates planet-warming emissions. On the other, a warming planet means that artificial snow is increasingly essential to an industry that, while admittedly a luxury, pumps over $20bn annually into ski towns nationwide. The good news is that, in the face of these growing threats, resorts have been dramatically improving the efficiency of their snowmaking operations \u2013 a move they hope will help them outrun rising temperatures. American ski areas logged more 65 million visits last season. A sizable chunk of those likely came during Christmas week, when a resort can make \u2013 or lose \u2013 a third or more of its annual revenue. The Martin Luther King Jr and Presidents Day weekends are similarly vital. But ensuring that there\u2019s a surface to slide on is an increasingly fickle business. Snowpack in the western US has already declined by 23% since 1955, and climbing temperatures have pushed the snowline in Lake Tahoe, California \u2013 which is home to more than a dozen resorts \u2013 from 1,200 to 1,500 feet. A recent study found that much of the northern hemisphere is heading off a \u201csnow-loss cliff\u201d where even marginal increases in temperature could prompt a dramatic loss of snow. By one estimate, only about half of the ski areas in the Northeast will be economically viable by mid-century. Research suggests that Vermont\u2019s ski season could be two to four weeks shorter by 2080, while another study found that Canada\u2019s snowmaking needs will increase 67 to 90% by 2050. At Bromley, snow guns have been essential for years; without them, the resort\u2019s mid-January trail count would have likely been in the single digits, rather than 31. Opening terrain, however, comes at a cost. It takes a lot of horsepower to move water up the hill under pressure, and compress the air the guns need to function. Bromley\u2019s relatively small operation, which produces enough snow each season to cover about 55 hectares (135 acres) in three or more feet of the stuff, chews through enough electricity each year to power about 100 homes. All that juice adds nearly $500,000 to the resort\u2019s utility bill. But Bill Cairns, Bromley\u2019s president and general manager, says the system is actually much more efficient than it was just a decade ago. \u201cI used to spend about $800,000,\u201d he says. He\u2019s now able to produce more snow for around half the price. \u201cThe reduction in cost with snowmaking has totally been a gamechanger.\u201d Powder days start with specks of dust high in the atmosphere. As they fall, water droplets attach to them, forming snowflakes. Ski areas like Bromley replicate this natural process using miles of pipes that feed water and compressed air to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of snow guns scattered across a mountain. Early guns mixed compressed air and water inside a chamber, and then used air pressure to propel water droplets skyward through a large nozzle. This was the type of system Fred Pabst Jr, of beer family fame, spent $1m installing in 1965, making his resort one of America\u2019s earliest adopters. \u201cIt was a black art. We knew nothing,\u201d says Slavko Stanchak, whose inventions and expertise have made him a legend among snowmakers. It was an era when energy was relatively cheap and resorts would rent rows of diesel-powered compressors that threw whatever snow they could generate on the hill. But as energy costs rose in the 1990s and early 2000s, so did the impetus to innovate. \u201cWe focused on making the process viable from a business standpoint,\u201d Stanchak says. He launched a consulting company that helped ski areas, including Bromley, design or improve their snowmaking operations. On the water side of the equation, Bromley spent the 1990s improving its piping network and added a mid-mountain pump to help get H2O from its ponds to its trails. (Much of the water returns to the watershed during the spring melt.) But the amount of water needed to carpet a ski hill in snow remains relatively fixed from year to year, so there are only so many efficiency gains to be had. Compressing air is what really eats into a budget. \u201cThe air is where the little dollar bills fly out,\u201d says Cairns, adding that two diesel compressors can consume a tanker truck of fuel every week. The 1990s also saw more efficient snow guns come to market. Tinkerers discovered that devices with multiple small holes, instead of a single large aperture, could utilize water, rather than air pressure, to force fluid upward. This allowed them to move the compressed air nozzles to the outside of the barrel, where they would primarily break the water stream into droplets \u2013 a far less strenuous function than forcing them out of the gun. \u201cAn old-school hog might use 800 cubic feet per minute [of compressed air]. This one here uses about 70,\u201d Folts says, pointing toward a tower gun from the early 2000s that stands about 15ft tall and, unlike the ground guns on Blue Ribbon, can\u2019t be easily moved. Up the hill sits a newer model that can get by on closer to 40 cubic feet a minute, or CFM, and a bit further down the slope is the resort\u2019s latest tool, which under ideal conditions can use as little as 10. That\u2019s a roughly hundred-fold increase in efficiency. The state-backed Efficiency Vermont program urges resorts to swap in as many of the more efficient devices as possible. \u201cThat work got a real big boost in 2014, when we did the \u2018Great Snow Gun Roundup,\u2019\u201d says Chuck Clerici, a senior account manager at the organization. Before then, it had been doing a handful of sporadic replacements. The roundup retired 10,000 inefficient models statewide, and, overall, Clerici says snowmaking operations are now using about 80% less air than they used to. While Efficiency Vermont doesn\u2019t separate savings that are the result of snowmaking upgrades from, say, those tied to building improvements, it reports that its efforts to help ski resorts use less energy have saved more than a 1bn kilowatt hours of electricity between 2000 and 2022. That\u2019s nearly a million tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions or the equivalent of taking more than two gas-fired power plants offline for a year. \u201cThe bigger projects we\u2019ve had over the years have been snowmaking projects,\u201d says Clerici. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that many instances in the energy-efficiency realm where you can swap something that uses one-fifth of the energy.\u201d Standing next to the building that houses Bromley\u2019s air compressors, Cairns points to a concrete slab with two maintenance hole covers that once fed massive underground diesel tanks. \u201cUnderneath was fuel,\u201d he says. To his right is a large pipe marked where the carbon-spewing generators used to connect to the rest of the snowmaking system. Now it\u2019s cut off. Bromley is among the many snowmakers that have been able to eliminate, or drastically reduce, its dependence on diesel air compressors. Electrifying the job has also allowed some resorts to incorporate renewable energy. Bolton Valley, in Vermont, features a 121-foot-tall wind turbine. Solar panels now dot the hills of many others, including Bromley, which leases a strip of land beside its parking lot for a solar farm. The array produces more than half the power its snowmaking system consumes. America\u2019s snowmaking industry has been historically based on the East Coast, where natural snow can be especially elusive. But that\u2019s changing. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot more work out West,\u201d says Ken Mack, who works for HKD Snowmakers, one of the largest equipment manufacturers. One of the company\u2019s executives recently moved to Colorado to help meet demand. The snow guns that HKD sells currently may be reaching the limit of how little water and compressed air they use. \u201cWe\u2019re probably getting to a point where we\u2019ve gone as low as we can go,\u201d says Mack. That\u2019s required finding gains in other arenas. One step snowmakers can take, says Mack, is to better track how much energy they use, ideally in real time. He\u2019s in the midst of trying to help revive a metric called the Snowmaking Efficiency Index, or SEI. It\u2019s a measure of how many kilowatt hours it takes to put 1,000 gallons of water worth of snow on the hill, something Stanchek pioneered years ago but never quite took hold. (For reference, under ideal circumstances it takes about 160,00 gallons to cover one acre in 1ft of snow.) If publicly released, such data could provide transparency and allow ski areas to boast about their efficiency. That\u2019s particularly appealing given that sustainability and environmental stewardship are increasingly top of mind for consumers. But because SEI varies considerably from mountain to mountain, and by temperature, it will probably be most effective as a tool for resorts to compete against themselves, rather than each other. This year, Bromley\u2019s SEI ranged from about 23 in the warm, early weeks of the season to mid-teens when temperatures dropped. Cairns consistently tries to beat those numbers and can monitor them from his office. If the number ever spikes, he can search for an open gun, leaking water line, or other culprit. \u201cAnything below 20 is really good,\u201d Cairns says. \u201cSo we\u2019re trending the right way.\u201d A more revolutionary development in snowmaking is the move toward automated systems that can be operated almost entirely remotely. One obvious benefit is reducing the need to find people willing to schlep around a mountain in the dead of night, when temperatures can dip into single digits. More importantly, automation allows resorts to ramp snowmaking up and down quickly, which is particularly useful as global temperatures climb. Snowmaking can occur when the mercury drops to about 28 degrees F (though the process is optimal at about 22 degrees or fewer); a threshold Mother Nature sometimes crosses for only brief periods. When it does, resorts can take advantage with a press of a button, instead of having to spend the time dispatching a crew out to fire up all those guns. The ability to operate in shorter time windows also means less energy is needed to run pumps and compressors \u2013 and get people up and down the mountain. \u201cYou\u2019re done sooner,\u201d says Mack. Where it might take 100 hours to cover a trail, automation could cut that to 20 or 30. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a savings. But it also gives you a little bit of reserve if you need it.\u201d Europe is far ahead of North America when it comes to automation, in part because governments have subsidized the daunting expense of running electricity and communication lines across a mountain. The cost of installing the technology can quickly run into the millions and, without subsidies, the benefits for American ski areas have been limited largely to smaller mountains in warmer climates, such as in the mid-Atlantic, where it is vital to surviving. But bigger resorts in snowier locales, including Stowe, Stratton, and Sugarbush in Vermont and Big Sky in Montana, have been testing the equipment. \u201cThe future of snowmaking is definitely going to be automation,\u201d says Cairns. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of money, and nobody really wants to subsidize that yet.\u201d Bromley is testing one semi-automated gun that could avoid the wiring issue. It uses the existing compressed air supply to spin an internal turbine that creates just enough energy to run a small onboard computer. By monitoring the weather conditions, it can automatically adjust the rate of water and air flow to produce optimal snow. \u201cThose guns don\u2019t need any power,\u201d says Folts, as he finished adjusting the position of one gun and moved to the next. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of another next level.\u201d Until then, Folts and his crew lumber on into the night, one gun at a time. This story was co-published with Grist, a nonprofit media organization covering climate, justice, and solutions. It was updated on 20 March 2024 to correct the name of HKD Snowmakers."

            "content": "\u201cTo make a hamburger \u2013 just one burger \u2013 takes what to make?\u201d Mathieu Flamini, elite footballer turned biochemical entrepreneur, asks the question. The answer, it turns out, is 2,000 litres of water. \u201cInsane,\u201d he says. The passion, the elan previously shown in midfield for Marseille, Arsenal over two spells and Milan is in full flow as the Frenchman presents his designs for life. Flamini, who eats once a day, sips hot water in a Soho vegan cafe as he espouses the benefits of an environmentally friendly lifestyle. \u201cClimate and health are related,\u201d he says. Turning 40 next month, he last played top-level football for Getafe in 2019 but still talks and looks like an athlete. He is also a partner in GFBiochemicals, a leader in sustainable alternatives to oil-based products, with levulinic acid replacing fossil fuels ingredients in everyday products. Swapping renewables for fossil fuels is big business and Flamini was on the ground floor, starting up the business in 2008 soon after joining Milan. The company now works with multinationals seeking to decarbonise. A long road lies ahead towards worldwide safe levels of carbon. \u201cClimate change is being ignored,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we talk about countries like India and China, people can\u2019t exercise outdoors any more. Do we want to get there? \u201cPlastic? It is everywhere in the sea. Even if I don\u2019t care about the environment, babies are being born with microplastic in their organs. We cannot ignore it.\u201d He believes football can play its part in averting the environmental catastrophes that threaten the planet. Football? The sport of private jets, fast cars, air-miles-busting transcontinental tournaments and petrodollar-funded club ownership? The sport where Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, has partnered with Saudi Arabia and where Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, is set to sponsor the governing body for $100m a year? Yes, football. Flamini is a frontman for Green Football Weekend, an initiative held this weekend \u2013 Sky Sports swapping their yellow for green, the BBC and TNT involved, too \u2013 that addresses the grassroots, involving schools in delivering the message that eating vegetarian food is helpful to the environment. Fans can download a cookbook featuring a Raheem Sterling cauliflower, potato and spinach curry recipe the Observer is told is particularly tasty. That eating vegetarian more often \u2013 though not necessarily exclusively \u2013 can counter the high level of carbon byproduct from mass-produced meat is a leading message. Small changes eventually equating to giant steps is the strategy. \u201cWe need to empower people,\u201d says Flamini. \u201cClimate change is a big and scary topic. If you are told you must save the world, you feel useless as an individual. You must break it down, tell them how they get impacted by pollution and plastics, with everyday things like shampoo and shower gel coming from fossil fuels. If you multiply people making a change by billions then you can make a big impact.\u201d One of the campaign\u2019s aims is to depolarise the issues of climate change that, to take the UK as an example, have become bogged down in battlegrounds such as London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone, low-traffic neighbourhoods and Labour\u2019s on-off pledge of \u00a328bn on green investment. Throwing the issue back to football takes the edge off the spikiness and the UK game has not been immune to climate change, considering flooding has severely affected schedules in the lower divisions this winter. \u201cOur game is being affected but we are not blaming anyone here,\u201d says Flamini. \u201cWe are bringing the table out and trying to make sense. Football \u2013 and sport \u2013 is one of the last things we have that can unite people, can address everyone, from rich to poor, people from every part of the world. Football needs to stand up for climate change. What can they do? Start finding solutions. Offsetting carbon is one of those solutions. But it\u2019s the minimum.\u201d With men\u2019s World Cups in North America in 2026, across three continents in 2030 and in Saudi Arabia in 2034, Flamini, on the environmental committee for the Paris 2024 Olympics, has more than a few ideas for the organisers. \u201cSourcing food locally, vegetarian options for the athletes and the fans, avoiding plastics, using products made more sustainably than from fossil fuels, trying to reduce transport. It\u2019s about integrating all those solutions into planning. It\u2019s a journey.\u201d His own path includes giving up pescetarianism when the Arsenal doctor Gary O\u2019Driscoll showed him high levels of mercury in his monthly blood tests; a Marseille childhood and a passion for diving had already told him the Mediterranean was full of pollutants. He freely admits he drove a sports car in the fleet of Ferraris that pulled into the Milanello training ground. \u201cTake a young kid who has grown up in a difficult area, and didn\u2019t always have food on the table, and imagine that the poor kid becomes a very rich athlete. That kid had a dream to play in front of hundreds of thousands of people and that became reality. He also had a picture of a sports car on his wall, it is very difficult to tell this kid he can\u2019t achieve that dream, too. \u201cThe footballer will probably have a sports car but he can do other things, like become a vegan, or offset his carbon, or create awareness through his platform. Maybe later he\u2019ll get an electric car.\u201d For Flamini, the Eurostar now takes the strain of a hectic business life shared between London and Paris for a previous private jet frequent flier. A commitment to the environment can make everyone hypocrites. \u201cWhat if you have family in New York?\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot tell people to take the boat but when people have the choice, we want them to take the green option.\u201d If his approach to changing opinions in football and the wider business world is largely conciliatory and commercially minded he retains an admiration for the direct-action activism of Greta Thunberg and her ilk. \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring,\u201d he says. \u201cAt 12 or 13 I was kicking a football around. It\u2019s a message of hope and if you push the message to corporations \u2013 to football \u2013 those kids are the consumers of tomorrow. Guys, it\u2019s time to change.\u201d"

            "content": "Nearly 15% of Americans don\u2019t believe climate change is real, a new study out of the University of Michigan reveals \u2013 shedding light on the highly polarized attitude toward global warming. Additionally, denialism is highest in the central and southern US, with Republican voters found less likely to believe in climate science. Using artificial intelligence, researchers analyzed over 7.4m tweets posted by roughly 1.3 million people on the social media platform X (previously Twitter) between 2017 and 2019. The social media posts were geocoded, and classified as \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d climate change using a large language model, a type of artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI. \u201cOver half of the tweets we looked at simply denied that climate change was real, that it was a hoax,\u201d said Joshua Newell, co-author of the study and professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t surprising but it was disappointing, I would hope that more and more Americans would believe in climate change and the importance of addressing it.\u201d Donald Trump emerged as one of the most influential figures among climate change deniers. His tweets around a cold snap in Texas in December 2017, as well as his missives rejecting the 2018 IPCC report released at the Cop24 UN conference, were some of his most engaged social media posts among climate change deniers. \u201cPublic figures such as Trump are highly influential,\u201d Newell said, \u201cwhen they use these events to trigger disbelief in climate change among social media users.\u201d The findings are consistent with similar studies, such as the recent survey out of Yale University which estimates that as of 2023, 16% of Americans do not believe in climate change (about 49 million people). Acceptance and belief in global warming is most prevalent along the west and east coasts, correlating with those regions\u2019 high rates of Democratic voters. Still, clusters of denialism exist within blue states, like in the case of Shasta county, California. There, disbelief in climate change is as high as 52%, but statewide, less than 12% of California\u2019s population does not believe in global warming. \u201cIt comports with my understanding that there is a small but very vocal and active minority of the public that still denies the overwhelming evidence of human-caused warming,\u201d said Michael Mann, climatologist and geophysicist at the University of Pennsylvania, about the study. Last week, Mann was awarded $1m in a defamation lawsuit against conservative writers who called his pioneering climate change research \u201cfraudulent\u201d, comparing it to the work of a convicted child molester. In his book The New Climate War, Mann argues that scientists have to rebut the misinformation and disinformation promoted on social media by bad actors, \u201cnot because we\u2019re going to win them over, their ideological heels are dug in, but because they are infecting the entire social media space with myths, falsehoods and toxic anti-scientific sentiment\u201d, Mann said. Researchers\u2019 use of AI helped classify millions of social media posts that otherwise would be too time-consuming and expensive to conduct. Still, some skepticism remains regarding the ethics of using AI for research, as artificial intelligence has a documented history of bias, especially in facial recognition, highlighting the need for human vetting. \u201cIt\u2019s an intriguing new tool to use for these purposes,\u201d Mann said. \u201cBut its limitations must be kept in mind as it\u2019s an evolving technology.\u201d It is up to social media platforms to combat misinformation, and fact-check what the researchers call \u201cknowledge vulnerability\u201d. \u201cThere is proper action by the social media companies to monitor disinformation and to act accordingly,\u201d Newell said, referencing Trump\u2019s ban from X (then Twitter) following the January 6 insurrection. \u201cThese very powerful social media companies should consider similar strategies for misinformation regarding climate change.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-28T05:00:29Z",
            "content": "\u201cAre you exhausted today?\u201d political theorist Ajay Singh Chaudhary asks over video chat on a dark Friday afternoon. This is a question he is posing not just to me, but to you, too \u2013 and it\u2019s one he already knows the answer to. Most of us, the indicators suggest, would suggest we are. But Chaudhary argues this isn\u2019t just an individual problem: \u201cOur ecological life is exhausting, our social and economic lives are exhausting, even our individual lives are exhausting.\u201d This is one of the central arguments of his first book The Exhausted of the Earth: how you feel and the state of the world are connected. And, he argues, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. \u201cYour exhaustion is not some random byproduct [\u2026] There is a class of people out there who cause your exhaustion, [and] it\u2019s not just Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk.\u201d Under capitalism, we are not all in it together. Executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for Social Research, an educational organisation for adult learners, Chaudhary\u2019s book is an accessible analysis of how climate and politics interact. Writing it was \u201clike a return to home\u201d, he says; his parents are natural scientists and it was drilled into him from a young age that the climate crisis was not being approached politically. Climate change is political but it\u2019s \u201cnot the imaginary politics of universal consensus,\u201d he writes in the book\u2019s pithy prologue, nor the \u201canti-politics of miraculous technological salvation\u201d. It\u2019s also \u201cnot the end of the world\u201d. Instead, it\u2019s a struggle between \u201cactually existing people over actually existing crises with actually existing differences, interests, and prospects. Climate change is about power.\u201d Politicians in the global north rarely talk this way. They think of climate as an \u201con/off switch\u201d. \u201c\u2018We\u2019re doing some climate\u2019\u201d, says Chaudhary, mimicking them, \u201c\u2018would you prefer we do nothing?\u2019\u201d. But there are two large clusters of \u201cdoing something\u201d, both of which Chaudhary examines. The first is what he calls \u201crightwing climate realism\u201d. This encompasses a \u201cbroad spectrum\u201d, from those who favour \u201cslower climate mitigation and adaptation\u201d to climate barbarism, but it\u2019s ultimately about concentrating, preserving and enhancing existing political and economic power. That is why Chaudhary is insistent that, when we think of climate policies, we must pay attention to plans for borders and policing, too. He considers Joe Biden a type of rightwing climate realist. Among the US president\u2019s most important climate policies is not just the Inflation Reduction Act but the US National Security Strategy, Chaudhary argues. \u201cIt is insanely jingoistic,\u201d he says. It describes, for instance, out-competing China. If that\u2019s the framework, he argues, we\u2019re doomed, \u201cbecause US-China cooperation is vital\u201d. Ultimately, rightwing climate realists know there will be \u201cinstability\u201d and \u201cthey are preparing for it\u201d. That they will be successful is not only \u201cplausible and possible, but probable,\u201d he says. That is why the second avenue of \u201cdoing something\u201d, composed of \u201cthe rest of us\u201d, is so important. Chaudhary advocates for \u201cleftwing climate realism\u201d, which accepts the science, not because it\u2019s a discipline \u201cbeyond impugning\u201d but because it\u2019s quite clear that there are ecological limits on this planet. We need a slower life, he argues; a circular economic system, where firms compete for the same amount of finite profit and the state dominates certain sectors. This will be good for the planet and for people, producing \u201ca world relieved from social, economic, and ecological despair and exhaustion\u201d. So how do we get on this \u201cfaster [\u2026] track to a slower life?\u201d Answering this question is one of the other main aims of Exhausted of the Earth. Chaudhary deploys a version of realism informed by thinkers such as Franzt Fanon (the title pays homage to Fanon\u2019s classic, The Wretched of the Earth, on the trauma of colonisation), Audre Lorde and philosopher Raymond Geuss. Each of them examine how to build up power and what methods of outreach will be most effective. The usual mechanisms alone \u2013 elections and demonstrations \u2013 are not enough, Chaudhary argues. If Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour wins the next UK general election, Chaudhary has \u201cvery little hope\u201d this will mean \u201cany appreciable change for climate issues\u201d, he says. Leftwing climate realists must think outside of the box, \u201cnot only to influence major parties\u201d but to build networks of people and groups beyond these traditional political spaces. Emotions can help with this because they are how people \u201crelate to the world\u201d, he says. But aside from ecoanxiety (an overwhelming disquiet about environmental crisis) and solastalgia (the distress caused by the environmental changes where you live, causing a kind of homesickness), how we feel, a more \u201cinchoate\u201d sense of exhaustion, is missing from a lot of climate texts, he says. \u201cI might feel exhaustion in a particular way \u2013 like burnout, that\u2019s very common for someone in my social position in a place like the United States,\u201d Chaudhary explains, \u201cbut someone else might be feeling it as pure bodily fatigue [and] someone else might be feeling it as \u2018my people have never had a chance to express ourselves\u2019.\u201d Tapping into this can unite people, he says. This makes a lot of sense. But halfway through reading Exhausted of the Earth, I wonder whether it could also be demobilising? If we\u2019re uniting over how exhausted we are, might we end up deciding we\u2019re too exhausted to do anything about it? No, Chaudhary argues \u2013 exhaustion is just the stage for action, and then we have to coordinate and build from this shared feeling. In the global north, the right understands this far better than the left, organising in churches or radical right cells that are deeply emotional. But the left can learn alternative strategies of organising by looking around the world for inspiration. Chaudhary cites examples including the Muslim Brotherhood, who he says create support and connection by building clinics, fixing people\u2019s phones or helping when they\u2019re behind on rent. Movimiento al Socialismo in Bolivia, which is \u201cless a classic, formal party than a sometimes tightly, sometimes loosely bound set of social movements\u201d. Socialists, indigenous groups and intellectuals are all involved and they have radically transformed society, including providing the conditions for the Cochabamba Agreement, \u201cprobably the most radical official transnational climate politics document ever produced,\u201d he says. Too often in places such as the UK and US, the left have an idealised vision of an industrial worker who will be the agent of change and a rosy vision of returning to the postwar welfare state model. Chaudhary cites the work of eco-modernists Leigh Phillips and Matt Huber, whom he critiques among other things for \u201ctreating 2024 as 1924\u2019. Now production is flung all over the world and climate is inherently a cross-border issue \u2013 so we must think and organise internationally, he argues. Born in the Bronx, living in New York\u2019s most diverse borough, Queens, and from a Jewish and Indian background (he describes himself as a \u201cred diaper grandchild\u201d of sorts), he knows international solidarity not only feels good but is necessary. And this requires another kind of realism \u2013 understanding what might appeal to the greatest number of people globally, from peasants in the global south to farmers in the global north. It\u2019s unlikely, he says, that we\u2019ll get communism or socialism in the next 10 years \u2013 a small farmer in Iowa \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to obliterate private property\u201d. But we can get \u201csome pretty good stuff\u201d through \u201cdecommodifying many of the key pillars of socioeconomic life and creatively working within ecological constraints\u201d, even if \u201cwe\u2019ll probably still have basic market mechanisms for some things\u201d. If some of this sounds like triangulation, he insists it isn\u2019t. \u201cIn between meaningless reform and impossible revolution,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe find mixed existing and historical models of formal state, civil, and guerrilla strategies.\u201d Knowing what will appeal to the greatest number of people, then, doesn\u2019t just amount to watering down your approach. Realism moves politics from the realm of morality to efficacy, not in the sense of just working in \u201cthe system\u201d but figuring out \u201cwhere the power is going to come from to get these changes through\u201d. What, we should ask, is strategically necessary to achieve this different world. This includes, Chaudhary argues, refusing to shy away from violence \u2013 from the interpersonal through to the destruction of property. We are already living in a capitalist world that is violent in all kinds of ways, he says: communities destroyed by the changing climate and people eking out a living in endless precarity. And it would be ridiculous to believe that \u201cfossil capital\u201d will simply give in, he says \u2013 instead, it will inevitably deploy state and private violence to ensure its interests are protected. Steeped in critical theory, Chaudhary is wary of instrumentalism. But with the climate crisis, he realises there is now no other option: \u201cI am forced into self-defence\u201d; \u201csabotage\u201d, \u201cblockades\u201d, and \u201cyes, just straight up violence\u201d. He points to precedents such as the suffragettes in the UK, Martin Luther King\u2019s movement in the US and Gandhi in India, all of which involved both planned and spontaneous acts of violence. But he is not arguing violence should be the \u201cprincipal mode of struggle\u201d \u2013 rather, that leftwing climate realism has to \u201cwork across a host of terrains\u201d to be successful, including sports clubs, art movements or government. Much of what he\u2019s talking about might be \u201cquite radical\u201d, he admits, but it should not be \u201cverboten\u201d. The climate crisis is \u201cnot the apocalypse\u2019, he says. Billions will die but the world will not end. \u201cThere is not going to be a moment that it clicks and fire falls from the sky and you realise, \u2018Ah, the climate has changed\u2019. It\u2019s already happening.\u201d And what we do about it is up for grabs. The Exhausted of Earth by Ajay Singh Chaudhary (Repeater Books, \u00a314.99).

            "date": "2024-02-25T11:00:57Z",
            "content": "The Knepp estate in West Sussex is home to the first white stork born in the wild in Britain for over 600 years. It\u2019s a place where endangered bats, turtle doves and nightingales are thriving, where \u201cofficially extinct\u201d large tortoiseshell butterflies are breeding and where tens of thousands of people visit each year to experience \u201ca story of hope\u201d about the resilience of nature in the face of the global climate emergency. There have been many exciting changes at Knepp since 2018, when Isabella Tree wrote Wilding, her award-winning book about rewilding an unprofitable 3,500-acre arable and dairy farm. Now she has written a captivating illustrated book, Wilding: How to Bring Wildlife Back \u2013 An Illustrated Guide, updating her readers about extraordinary developments at Knepp and offering practical advice about rewilding their own spaces, however small. \u201cWe\u2019re living in a world of eco-anxiety and most of us, I guess, stick our heads in the sand because these problems are so enormous,\u201d says Tree. \u201cHow is one individual going to make a difference to climate meltdown and biodiversity? \u2018It\u2019s impossible,\u2019 you think. Then you come to Knepp and you see what nature has done, how it\u2019s rebounded in 20 or so years. It really is such a story of hope that I think people find it quite galvanising. It restores your energy and your belief that you can do something.\u201d The book, out on 7 March and is aimed at older children (aged 9+) and adults, explains how and why Tree and her husband, Charlie Burrell, sold off their dairy cows and farm machinery in 2000. They stopped ploughing and spraying fertilisers and pesticides, pulled up their barbed wire fences, smashed their Victorian land drains, quit clearing their ditches \u2013 and \u201csimply let things go\u201d. \u201cWe wanted to work with nature for a change, rather than fighting against it all the time,\u201d writes Tree. Exquisite illustrations by the printmaker and fine artist Angela Harding reveal how, step-by-step, wilderness and wildlife then returned to Knepp. \u201cNature bounces back, if you let it, wherever it can.\u201d Some of the rarest creatures in Britain have now made Knepp their home, including kingfishers, hazel dormice, scarce chaser dragonflies and purple emperor butterflies. The river has returned to its natural course and the soil is now storing as much carbon per hectare as a 25-year-old plantation of trees does, according to recent tests. \u201cThat\u2019s really exciting, because rewilding has been seen as fantastic for wildlife and recovering biodiversity, but people say it doesn\u2019t answer the problem of climate change. We can say now, categorically, it does. That, actually, you can restore your soils by allowing an area to rewild \u2013 and just the soils alone will be the same as a carbon storage in a plantation.\u201d This comparison is important, Tree says, because putting trees in the ground with a spade is not good for biodiversity. \u201cWhat you\u2019re creating as a single generational plantation with standing trees is a closed canopy woodland, which is very species poor.\u201d By contrast, Knepp has wetland, scrubland, mature trees and deadwood, as well as mycorrhizal fungi and root systems under the ground. \u201cAll of that is way more significant for storing carbon than just planting trees.\u201d Yet, in 2000, Knepp was merely an \u201cunpromising piece of land underneath the Gatwick stacking system\u201d. \u201cIf it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.\u201d The release two years ago of a pair of breeding beavers was particularly important: last year, they had two kits, the first to be born in the wild in Sussex for centuries. \u201cSeeing what the beavers have done during all these storms and floods is astonishing \u2013 they\u2019re holding back probably four or five acres of standing water and helping to prevent flooding downstream.\u201d During the 2022 heatwave, the beavers\u2019 dams created something similar to a \u201clittle emerald oasis in the middle of an African savannah\u201d, which is now \u201cheaving with life\u201d. Tree says: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd we still have to have beavers under licence in enclosed pens in England, when they\u2019re living free in Scotland and on the continent. Everyone knows how powerful they are for cleaning polluted water and restoring biodiversity.\u201d She and Burrell have been campaigning to \u201cget beavers back in England\u201d for 15 years: \u201cWe\u2019re so risk averse in the UK, while the planet is in meltdown. We\u2019ve got to get braver and start reintroducing the keystone species that are crucial to restoring nature.\u201d Wild-living beavers were recently given protected status in England, but farmers are concerned that reintroducing the native species \u2013 which was hunted to extinction in the 16th century \u2013will threaten their crops or livestock, for example by redirecting rivers and flooding agricultural land. Similarly, critics of rewilding argue that the government\u2019s decision to offer farmers incentives to rewild their land, in order to restore 741,000 acres of wildlife habitats in England by 2042, is putting food security at risk, when the UK is already heavily reliant on global food supply chains. \u201cPeople say we can\u2019t rewild everywhere \u2013 how are we going to produce food? That\u2019s the big pushback we\u2019re getting against nature, certainly from the National Farmers\u2019 Union,\u201d says Tree. While she accepts that not everywhere can be rewilded \u2013 \u201cwe will always need land for food production\u201d \u2013 she thinks that it can protect crops and provide farmers with a \u201clife-support system\u201d they desperately need. \u201cWe cannot carry on ploughing and using chemicals and artificial fertiliser. We know the pollution that causes, we know we\u2019re losing our soils. So, for the long-term security of food production itself, we\u2019ve got to shift to regenerative agriculture. But also we need to have rewilded areas around our food production to provide the dung beetles, the pollinating insects, the pest control, the clean water, the water storage and the buffers against extreme weather events.\u201d Surrounding agricultural land with wild land is the only sustainable way forward. \u201cRewilding works hand in glove with food production. We can have both,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the space for both.\u201d Wilding: How to Bring Wildlife Back \u2013 An Illustrated Guide by Isabella Tree and illustrated by Angela Harding will be published by Macmillan on 7 March"

            "date": "2024-02-18T14:00:45Z",
            "content": "Mark Wootton and his wife, Eve Kantor, were the carbon-neutral pioneers of Australia\u2019s red meat industry. Years before the Paris agreement to keep global heating below 1.5C, and a decade before the Australian government committed to reaching net zero emissions, their family farm in south-western Victoria was declared carbon-neutral. \u201cIn the early 2010s we were pretty cocky that we had conquered this thing,\u201d Wootton says. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d cracked the formula.\u201d Jigsaw Farms, a mosaic of lush pastures, eucalypt plantations, wildlife corridors and wetlands about 250km west of Melbourne, near the town of Hamilton, was the envy of the industry. It was lionised by the media, a favoured photo opportunity by politicians and held up by the red meat sector as a vision of the future. The farm\u2019s carbon-rich soils, 20% of which were forested, sequestered enough CO2 to offset its annual emissions from wool, lamb and beef production. Or at least it did. The latest report tracking Jigsaw\u2019s emissions, which is now undergoing peer review, confirmed that since about 2017 \u2013 the same year the industry body Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) announced a target of net zero emissions by 2030 \u2013 Jigsaw Farms has been emitting more greenhouse gases than it could sequester. \u201cCows and sheep are still there producing the same amount of methane [every year], but the trees grow up and carbon sequestration slows down,\u201d says the report author, Prof Richard Eckard. Eckard is an agricultural economist and the director of the school of agriculture, food and ecosystem sciences at the University of Melbourne. He became involved in measuring Jigsaw\u2019s emissions a decade ago. The 3,378-hectare farm spans six titles, bought by Wootton and Kantor between 1996 and 2003. Hardwood timber plantations cover 295 hectares, 24 hectares is remnant forest and a further 268 hectares are set aside for biodiversity. It hosts a fine wool merino operation with about 20,000 ewes, and 550 head of cattle. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Initially, the hundreds and thousands of trees they planted, combined with a switch to perennial grasses, significantly increased the amount of carbon sequestered on the property. But those trees have now matured and passed peak sequestration, meaning they absorb less C02 year-on-year, and the soil is so carbon rich it can\u2019t sequester any additional C02 from the atmosphere. \u201cTen years later it all slows down because carbon saturation,\u201d Eckard says. \u201cIt\u2019s just the law of diminishing returns.\u201d The latest Jigsaw study estimated that in 2021, the farm sequestered 70.3% to 83.2% of its annual emissions. By 2031, as the farm\u2019s forests grow older, models predict it will absorb just over half of what it did when carbon sequestration peaked in 2012. The dilemma Jigsaw now faces reflects the broader challenge of decarbonising Australia\u2019s red meat industry, Eckard says. The industry claims it has reduced its emissions by 65% compared with 2005 levels, but this reduction relies on recorded decreases in deforestation and increases in forest regrowth, which some analysis suggests is overstated. \u201cCarbon sequestration through forestry is a short-term buy out of trouble,\u201d Eckard says. \u201cYou can plant your way out of trouble and, like Jigsaw, get seven years of net zero, but ultimately, unless you do something about the methane, you\u2019re not going to stay net zero.\u201d Climate neutrality v the \u2018seaweed solution\u2019 Other efforts to reduce the industry\u2019s carbon footprint have focused on attempting to reduce the amount of methane expelled from the rumen, which accounts for 80% of the sector\u2019s emissions. MLA has put more than $180m towards the problem, with no solution forthcoming. The results from the longest running commercial trial of a seaweed cow-feed, which aimed to cut methane by more than 80%, were lacklustre. Selective breeding and dietary changes can help, says Eckard, but it\u2019s slow going. \u201cIt took the animal 50m years to evolve to produce meat and eat grass the way it does,\u201d he says. \u201cThat can\u2019t be overcome in three-year funding rounds.\u201d But he says that if producers adopt current best practices that will reduce their emissions intensity per kilogram of meat produced while research finds the \u201cseaweed solution\u201d. On Jigsaw Farms, high reproductive rates, fast-growing livestock due to genetic selection and ample feed, and grazing stock at double the density of other farms in the district helps reduce the emissions that go into producing each animal. \u201cIf that lamb or calf grows faster, so it gets to market quicker, so it grows faster, so, to be brutal, it can die and be eaten \u2013 your carbon intensity is dropping,\u201d Wootton says. This allows Jigsaw to sell its wool, lamb and beef at a premium in a market that is increasingly looking for farmers who can demonstrate strong environmental credentials. This is particularly important for the export-focused Australian market, Eckard says. Seventy per cent of Australian-grown beef is sold into global supply chains ruled by international corporations, all of whom have net zero targets. That\u2019s the impetus behind the MLA\u2019s \u201cworld leading\u201d net zero target. This month Guardian Australia reported that the industry body described the target as \u201caligning the industry\u201d towards improvement and said it did not need to be met, though it remains committed to the goal. Environmental scientists say reporting on the goal is based on unreliable land clearing data. David Jochinke, the president of the National Farmers Federation, says the target is about the \u201caspiration\u201d towards decarbonisation. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said at the NFF, we\u2019re not going to reduce production in an attempt to get to net zero,\u201d he says. \u201cWill we make it? I\u2019m not really sure, but we are going to give it a red hot go.\u201d A 2023 CSIRO report found the industry would fall short of the net zero goal and recommended a \u201cclimate-neutral\u201d target be adopted instead, which would theoretically be achieved by reaching a point where the sector no longer causes any additional warming to the planet. Australia\u2019s peak cattle body, Cattle Australia, has also called for a shift to climate neutrality. But both Eckard and Wootton say the industry shouldn\u2019t change course. \u201cI fear that if the industry fiddled with the metric what they would be effectively saying is \u2018methane is no longer an issue so we don\u2019t have to worry about it\u2019,\u201d Eckard says. The director of the Australian National University Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions, Mark Howden, says that unachievable or \u201cfalse [climate] targets\u201d are ineffective and can alienate both industries and the public. He says the red meat sector\u2019s goal is \u201cin a sense the wrong target\u201d. \u201cWe do need to go net zero in terms of C02, but in the case of methane we need to reduce it by about two-thirds in the long term to effectively meet the Paris agreement,\u201d he says. Wootton says the benefits of their regenerative approach to farming persist even if the farm\u2019s carbon accounts are now in the red. They did not initially set out to be carbon-neutral. The timber plantations were established on Jigsaw Farms to offer an alternative source of income. They planted permanent native vegetation to encourage biodiversity and shelter belts to protect livestock, and dug deep dams so they would always have a secure water supply. A bird survey in 1996 found 46 bird species on the land. Today, there are 174. The land is healthier \u2013 that is, ironically, why carbon sequestration has stabilised. \u201cPeople come to us and go, shit, if they can\u2019t go carbon-neutral, what does that mean for us,\u201d Wootton says. \u201cIt means you\u2019ll have to do some of what we\u2019ve done, do things differently from what we\u2019ve done, and do some other things that we don\u2019t even know we can do yet. \u201cThere\u2019s no silver bullet here, but there\u2019s some silver buckshot, hopefully.\u201d Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"

            "date": "2024-02-28T08:00:31Z",
            "content": "Ministers will be able to water down the UK\u2019s carbon reduction commitments if the government chooses to take advantage of a legal loophole. The UK overachieved on meeting its third five-year carbon budget, which ran from 2018 to 2022, requiring reductions of 38% compared with 1990 levels. The emissions cap for the budget was 2,544 megatons of CO2 equivalent, but the actual emissions were 391 MtCO2e fewer, or 15% below the budget. The substantial fall was thanks in part to the effects of the lockdowns imposed under the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, ministers are allowed to count the surplus of emissions savings, compared with the budgetary requirement, towards the next carbon budget. That would make the next budget easier to meet, but could also slow the UK\u2019s path towards meeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions. On Wednesday, the Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s statutory adviser, wrote to the climate minister, Graham Stuart, urging him \u201cunequivocally\u201d not to exploit the surplus by loosening current and future carbon budgets. Piers Forster, interim chair of the committee, said: \u201cWe congratulate the government on meeting the latest emissions target \u2013 the Climate Change Act is working. But the path ahead is tougher and we risk losing momentum if future legal targets are loosened on a technicality. The UK is already substantially off track for 2030, and the government must resist the temptation to take their foot off the accelerator.\u201d When the third carbon budget was set, the UK\u2019s legally binding target was to cut emissions by 80% by 2050. That was raised to a commitment to reach net zero by 2050 as one of Theresa May\u2019s last acts while prime minister, a toughening that means future carbon budgets need to be much more stringent. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) warned last year that the UK was not likely to meet its 2030 commitments under current trajectories. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, further weakened some of the government\u2019s net zero policies last September, which the committee warned would further harm the country\u2019s ability to meet the targets. The government could make a decision before the general election to carry forward the surplus in carbon savings to the next carbon budget. Caroline Lucas, the only MP for the Green party, called on ministers to push ahead instead. \u201cAdvice from the UK Climate Change Committee has been unequivocal: the UK\u2019s climate target will be under serious threat if the government uses the unexpected drop in UK emissions during Covid to justify less action and ambition in future carbon budgets,\u201d she said. \u201cThe UK is already dangerously behind on our 2030 targets \u2013 now is the time to speed action up, not find new excuses to dither and delay.\u201d Mike Childs, head of science, research and policy at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cClimate extremes are already battering the planet and causing havoc around the world, with those who\u2019ve contributed least to climate breakdown facing the very worst impacts. The CCC is right to urge the government to hold steadfast on its climate targets and refrain from relaxing them at such a critical moment. \u201cAs research published this week has shown, the green economy is absolutely booming, having grown 9% over the last year compared to the wider economy which has all but ground to a halt. We know that action on climate change is good for jobs, health, our public finances and ultimately the planet. Rishi Sunak promised world leaders in 2022 that the UK will meet its target to reduce emissions by two thirds by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. If he breaks his word, what remains of his credibility will be lost for good, and the UK can expect to continue on its downward trajectory as a nation in decline.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cWe are the first major economy to halve emissions and have the most ambitious legally binding emissions targets in the world. We have overdelivered on every carbon budget to date and will continue to meet our emissions targets.\u201d They added: \u201cFollowing the process set out in the Climate Change Act, we will review the advice of the Climate Change Committee and consult devolved administrations before taking any decision on whether the UK\u2019s overachievement on the third carbon budget is carried over.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-14T14:00:38Z",
            "content": "Environmentalists have implored Queensland\u2019s opposition party to \u201cend the climate wars\u201d by backing the government\u2019s carbon emissions reduction target as renewables industry leaders also call for bipartisanship on the issue. Newly minted premier, Steven Miles, introduced a bill to legislate an ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions by 75% by 2035 in state parliament Wednesday. Miles said it was a \u201cresponsible, credible and critical target,\u201d and the bill \u201cpositions Queensland as a world leader on the pathway to net zero\u201d. The Australian Conservation Foundation called on opposition leader, David Crisafulli, \u201cto end the climate wars in this state by matching this announcement because what we need more than ever is durable, sustainable climate and energy policy.\u201d \u201cAnd we also call on the Albanese government, who will be making their decision on a 2035 target in the next 12 months or so, to treat this 75% by 2035 target as a floor not a ceiling,\u201d said the Foundation\u2019s Gavan McFadzean. The Liberal National party has yet to announce a position either way on the bill, with several from the party suggesting it was still too early to fully understand it. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In a debate on a separate climate bill on Tuesday, shadow environment minister Sam O\u2019Connor said he would be \u201clooking closely\u201d at the modelling behind the target. \u201cI will say I was surprised to see in those targets a 30% reduction by 2030 followed by a significant increase to a 75% reduction just five years later in 2035,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be seeking further details on that legislation as it goes through the committee process before outlining the Liberal National party\u2019s response. We need to see the modelling and the assumptions the government has relied on to produce these targets.\u201d Wayne Smith from the Smart Energy Council \u2013 Australia\u2019s peak body for the renewables industry \u2013 said the industry needed bipartisan support. \u201cThe closer you get to the [October state] election, the more people are going to be wondering what is the opposition\u2019s position and people will be reluctant to make investment decisions if there isn\u2019t bipartisan support.\u201d Smith said investment would be \u201cturbocharged\u201d once the legislation was passed. Climate Energy Finance director, Tim Buckley, said the industry requires bipartisan support for long-term planning and security. \u201cThat means it\u2019s got longevity and credibility and therefore it provides the investor certainty that is needed to really underpin the literally hundreds of billions of dollars of investments that are required to make this work,\u201d Buckley said. Advisors won\u2019t have \u2018vested interests\u2019 If legislated, the bill would set a 2030 target of 30% below 2005 levels, and 75% by 2035. It would then require the minister to set a series of interim targets every five years after 2035 until net zero 2050, a decade in advance. It would also require the government to establish a clean economy expert panel to guide policy development. The panel would develop a series of emissions reduction plans for specific sectors \u2013 for example, energy, transport, agriculture and industry \u2013 by 2025. The minister would have to annually update parliament on progress. The panel will be required to have at least two but no more than five members appointed by the minister. The state Chief Scientist would automatically be a member. Under the proposed law, those people must have experience or qualifications in the science or economics of climate change or the development of low-emission industries, rural regional development or \u201canother area the minister considered relevant\u201d. Energy minister Mick de Brenni said the government would not appoint representatives of fossil fuel companies or other vested interests to the board. \u201cThey are real experts that will work with us with real strategies, an expert panel that is not made up of vested interests. It won\u2019t be an expert panel that relies on technology that doesn\u2019t exist. It won\u2019t be an expert panel that makes recommendations around over-reliance on offsets,\u201d de Brenni said. The premier said the plan would have \u201c an expert panel to guide us on that pathway and a series of sectoral plans so that we are identifying the best, most rational places to do those reductions\u201d. The legislation is officially called the Clean Economy Jobs bill and much of the pitch for the plan is about its purported positive impact on the economy. Introducing the bill on Wednesday, the premier told parliament it would secure \u201cblue collar jobs in our regions in both existing industries and new ones\u201d. \u201cThe targets we\u2019re setting to reduce emissions by 75% by 2035 are based on science and meeting internationally agreed targets,\u201d Miles said. \u201cBut more importantly, they will provide industry with the certainty to invest in converting existing industry to renewables and attracting new industries here. These targets are crucial to lock in the investment needed for our economic future.\u201d The state has already almost achieved its 2030 goal, with current emissions 29% below 2005 levels, he said. The bill will now go to parliament\u2019s Clean Economy Jobs, Resources and Transport Committee for scrutiny. Buckley said the increased emissions reduction target was another \u201ccourageous move\u201d after the government\u2019s progressive coal royalty scheme. \u201cThe longer we deny the science, the longer we delay investment in industries of the future,\u201d he said."

            "content": "China is off track on all of its core 2025 climate targets, despite the fact that clean energy is now the biggest driver of the country\u2019s economic growth, analysis has found. After years of extraordinarily rapid growth, China is now grappling with a slowdown that is causing ripples internally and internationally. The government has supercharged the growth of the renewable energy industry but it has simultaneously poured stimulus funds into construction and manufacturing, and continues to approve coal power. China\u2019s total energy consumption increased by 5.7% in 2023, in the first moment since 2005 that demand for energy grew faster than its GDP. China\u2019s economy grew by 5.2% last year, a rate that would be rapid for most countries but is slow in comparison with previous rates of growth. But carbon dioxide emissions have continued to grow, even as economic growth has slowed due to the fact that China\u2019s economic growth during and after the Covid-19 pandemic has been highly energy intensive. Between 2021 and 2023, CO2 emissions grew at an average of 3.8% a year, up from 0.9% a year between 2016 and 2020. GDP growth slowed slightly over the same period. The findings were published in an analysis from Carbon Brief conducted by Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Under the Paris agreement, China\u2019s climate pledges require a number of targets to be met by 2025; these include increasing the share of non-fossil energy sources to 20% and reducing the carbon intensity of the economy by 18%. Carbon intensity refers to how many grams of CO2 are released to produce a kilowatt hour of electricity. However, Myllyvirta\u2019s analysis found that China was \u201cway off track\u201d on many of these targets, primarily because of the carbon intensity of recent economic growth. CO2 emissions will have to fall by between 4% and 6% to meet the government\u2019s 2025 target, Myllyvirta predicts. Part of the problem stems from the fact that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the government supported the economy by injecting stimulus measures into the construction and manufacturing sector, \u201cshifting the pattern of growth into a more carbon-intensive direction\u201d, said Myllyvirta. At the same time, many other countries targeted their stimulus measures towards households, driving up demand for consumer goods, resulting in an export boom from China. It is not impossible to do, said Myllyvirta: \u201cOptimistically, these distortions to the economic structure before and during zero-Covid could be reversed, and that combined with the clean energy drive could serve to bring down emissions rapidly.\u201d Around one percentage point of China\u2019s CO2 emissions growth last year came from manufacturing clean energy technologies, such as solar PV, electric vehicles and batteries. These products will ultimately lead to a net drop in emissions, although some of that will be felt outside China as goods are exported. Part of the challenge in understanding China\u2019s energy transition is that the numbers involved in every sector are of global significance. Despite the fact that, in 2023, China commissioned as much solar PV as the entire world did in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency, the rapid growth in energy demand in recent years has outstripped the clean energy additions. On the current trend of increased energy demands, energy production from non-fossil sources would need to grow by more than 11% a year to meet the 2025 target. Currently, renewable energy production is increasing by an annual rate of 8.5%. Clean energy contributed $1.6tn (\u00a31.26tn) to China\u2019s economy in 2023, accounting for all of the growth in investment. And on the target of reducing the carbon intensity of China\u2019s economy by 18% by 2025, China has so far managed only a 5% reduction since 2020. That means that CO2 emissions will have to come down in absolute terms from 2023 to 2025 to meet the target. According to the National Energy Administration, China\u2019s installed capacity of renewable energy exceeded 1.45bn kilowatts in 2023, accounting for more than half of the country\u2019s total installed power generation capacity. But a separate report published on Thursday by CREA and Global Energy Monitor found that China approved 114 gigawatts (GW) of coal power in 2023, up from 104 GW in 2022. China\u2019s share of global coal emissions surpassed 64% in 2023. Since Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, pledged to \u201cstrictly control\u201d new coal power in 2021, the approval of new coal has actually increased rapidly. Nearly half of the growth in power generation between 2020 and 2023 came from coal. That is partly because some thermal power developers and government officials see this decade as a window of opportunity in which CO2 emissions can continue to increase before 2030, when Xi has promised they will peak. Still, China is widely expected to meet that target by 2025. Local governments, particularly mining provinces, often rely on investment in coalmines and thermal power sources to boost their GDP figures. Myllyvirta said: \u201cThe major acceleration in coal consumption growth and in approvals of new coal power plants that has taken place since President Xi made these pledges in 2021 contradicts the commitments \u2013 and China needs to take determined action in 2024-25 to avoid failing to respect them.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 February 2024 to credit Global Energy Monitor as co-authors with CREA of one of the reports cited."

            "date": "2024-02-29T15:35:25Z",
            "content": "The UK government is providing a \u20ac700m (\u00a3600m) guarantee for the billionaire Jim Ratcliffe to build the biggest petrochemical plant in Europe in 30 years that will turbocharge plastic production. The huge petrochemical plant has been described as a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d by campaigners. Being constructed in the Belgian city of Antwerp by Ratcliffe\u2019s company Ineos, it will bring plastic production to Europe on a scale not seen before, just as countries are trying to negotiate a binding global treaty to tackle the growing problem of plastic pollution. More than 350m metric tonnes of plastic waste is produced a year, and by 2060 plastic waste is set to increase to 1bn metric tonnes. Antwerp is a key production centre for plastic in Europe and has created pollution from plastic pellets and emissions that supercharge global heating, campaigners say. But despite admitting the plant\u2019s adverse impact on climate, biodiversity, the environment and the risks to social and human health, the British government has provided financial guarantees of \u20ac700m to support the building of Project One in Antwerp. The support from the UK government\u2019s export finance department, an arm of the Department for Business and Trade, to Ratfliffe, now a high-profile part-owner of Manchester United Football Club, exceeds that promised by the same department for countries in Africa and the Middle East to adapt to climate breakdown. Ratcliffe has been lobbying politicians in Europe pushing back against green policies which he claims are driving away investment. Project One will import fracked shale gas from the US, to provide the ethane for the cracker plant that will produce 1450 kilotons of ethylene, which is the building block of plastic, a year. Details of the financial support from the UK government emerged as environmental NGOs prepared a new legal challenge to stop Ratcliffe building Project One. The UK government argues its financial guarantees are in line with its support for a global transition towards net zero. But Jacob Kean-Hammerson, of the Environmental Investigations Agency in the UK, said: \u201cIneos is a big part of the plastic production supply chain and plastic producers themselves. \u201cBy supporting this plant the UK government is financing a huge climate emissions project. What we need is additional funds for climate-related adaptation but the UK is giving more money to a potentially huge emitter than to countries to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.\u201d Documents show UK Export Finance (UKEF) is aware of the climate impact of Project One. \u201cThe project was deemed to have potential to cause a number of adverse environmental and social impacts both during construction and operation,\u201d the UK documents said. Officials carried out a \u201cdesktop review\u201d rather than visiting the site at Antwerp. They said a \u201cproposed suite of controls as part of the project\u2019s environmental and social management systems, if implemented effectively, should facilitate the management of these impacts\u201d. UKEF said Ineos had promised to become carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions 10 years after the start of operations, which did not therefore hinder the ability of the EU to meet current climate-related policy or international commitments, including the Paris agreement. An Ineos spokesperson said: \u201cProject One will produce the raw material essential for medical products, insulation, transport and packaging. It will have the lowest carbon footprint compared with any plant of its kind in Europe. And by applying state of the art technology, it has a clear roadmap to carbon neutrality within 10 years of startup. Europe needs to be permitted to renew its manufacturing technology and we will strongly defend this project in the court.\u201d The production of plastic is, however, hugely carbon intensive. Over 99% of plastic comes from fossil fuels and plastic production is by far the largest industrial oil, gas and electricity user in the EU, according to the NGO Break Free from Plastic. Fossil fuels cannot be replaced as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry, something Ineos acknowledges. Jeroen Dagevos, of the Plastic Soup Foundation, one of the NGOs challenging Project One, said: \u201cThere is a huge problem of plastic pollution from nurdles already in Antwerp and the Netherlands. This plant will bring US-scale plastic production to Europe. The nurdles are everywhere, in the EU alone up to 23bn plastic nurdles end up in the environment every day. \u201cThe plastic pollution is not under control. Almost half of plastic production today is for consumer goods, single-use packaging that will be thrown away. We need the industry to solve the problem of pollution they have created, not build a huge new plant to massively increase plastic production.\u201d The UK said Ineos had promised that only 10% of the ethylene produced would be used for single-use plastic. The rest will be used for construction goods, including pipes and cable ducting, according to UKEF. Dagevos said: \u201cHow will they monitor this? There are no controls over who is buying the ethylene. This will just boost the production of single-use plastic packaging and throwaway consumer goods in Europe.\u201d A spokesperson for the government said: \u201cUK Export Finance helps UK businesses to win, deliver and get paid for overseas contracts. \u201cOur financing guarantee for Project One secures new export opportunities and is consistent with our continued support for a global transition towards net zero.\u201d Ineos is publicly pushing back against scientific evidence of the human health and environmental and climate impacts of plastic pollution. Research shows that microplastics have been found in human blood for the first time. The global production of single-use plastic is fuelling global heating and less than 10% of the 7bn tonnes of plastic waste already generated globally has been recycled. But Ratcliffe\u2019s company says on its website that plastic needs be treated with \u201cless emotion\u201d and defends the production of single-use plastic, saying less than 2g of plastic package protects a cucumber. \u201cThis will extend its \u2018shelf life\u2019 by 11 days! A little bit of plastic will prevent a whole lot of food waste.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-23T05:00:39Z",
            "content": "A big leak of data from a Chinese cybersecurity firm has revealed state security agents paying tens of thousands of pounds to harvest data on targets, including foreign governments, while hackers hoover up huge amounts of information on any person or institution who might be of interest to their prospective clients. The cache of more than 500 leaked files from the Chinese firm I-Soon was posted on the developer website Github and is thought by cybersecurity experts to be genuine. Some of the targets discussed include Nato and the UK Foreign Office. The leak provides an unprecedented insight into the world of China\u2019s hackers for hire, which the head of the UK\u2019s security services has called a \u201cmassive\u201d challenge for the country. The files, which are a mixture of chat logs, company prospectuses and data samples, reveal the extent of China\u2019s intelligence gathering operations, while also highlighting the market pressures felt by the country\u2019s commercial hackers as they vie for business in a struggling economy. I-Soon appears to have worked with \u2013 and later been embroiled in a commercial dispute with \u2013 another Chinese hacking outfit, Chengdu 404, whose hackers have been indicted by the US Department of Justice for cyber-attacks on companies in the US as well as pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, among other targets. Other targets discussed in the I-Soon leaks include the British thinktank Chatham House and the public health bureaux and foreign affairs ministries of Asean countries. Some of this data seems to have been gathered on spec, while in other cases there are specific contracts with a Chinese public security bureau to gather a certain type of data. A spokesperson for Chatham House said: \u201cWe are aware of this data coming to light and are naturally concerned. Chatham House takes data and information security extremely seriously. In the current climate, we, along with many other organisations, are the target of regular attempted attacks from both state and non-state actors. \u201cWe have protection measures in place including technology-based safeguards which are reviewed and upgraded on a regular basis.\u201d A Nato official said: \u201cThe alliance faces persistent cyber-threats and has prepared for this by investing in extensive cyber defences. Nato reviews every claim of cyber-threats.\u201d The UK Foreign Office declined to comment. The services offered by I-Soon are varied. In one example, the public security bureau of a city in Shandong paid nearly \u00a344,000 to obtain access to the email inboxes of 10 targets for one year. The company claimed to be able to hack accounts on X, obtain personal information from Facebook, obtain data from internal databases and compromise various operating systems including Mac and Android. In one of the files there is a screenshot of a folder entitled \u201cNotes from the secretariat of European Affairs of North Macedonia\u201d. Another screenshot shows files that appear to relate to the EU, including one entitled \u201cDraft EU position with regard to COP 15 part 2\u201d. The file names reference an encryption system used by EU entities to secure official data. In some cases, is not clear what the purpose of collecting the data was. \u201cThe Chinese state is basically hoovering up as much data as they can,\u201d said Alan Woodward, a computer security expert at the University of Surrey. \u201cThey just want as much information as they can in case it proves useful.\u201d Woodward noted that unlike Russian state-linked hackers who conduct ransomware attacks or other disruptive actions, Chinese attempts tended to focus on mass data harvesting. \u201cSome of it could be interpreted as laying the groundwork for being disruptive at a later stage,\u201d Woodward said. Last year, parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee report on China said: \u201cChina\u2019s cyber expertise allows it to target a diverse range of organisations and datasets \u2013 and increasingly unusual ones.\u201d Experts believe that the goal of data gathering may be to identify potential targets for human intelligence operations. I-Soon also targeted domestic victims. In an undated cooperation agreement with a local authority in Xinjiang, I-Soon stated that it could provide \u201canti-terrorism\u201d support to the local police in monitoring Uyghurs. I-Soon said that it had more than a decade of experience in accessing \u201cvarious server permissions and intranet permissions in multiple countries\u201d. The company claimed to have obtained data from counter-terrorism authorities in Pakistan and Pakistan\u2019s postal service. Pakistan\u2019s embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment. Some of the promises to clients might have been sales bluster. In one discussion, an employee asked: \u201cAre customers deceiving us, or are we deceiving customers?\u201d The worker continues that deceiving customers about the company\u2019s abilities is \u201cnormal, but it is not good for the company to deceive its employees\u201d. Mei Danowski, a China cybersecurity expert and author of the Natto Thoughts newsletter, said: \u201cWe think about [Chinese hackers] as \u2018Oh, the state gives them cash to do stuff.\u2019 In reality, if these leaked documents are true, it\u2019s not like that. They have to go and look for business. They have to build up a reputation.\u201d Other chat logs were strikingly mundane. Employees discussed Covid-19 and the financial pressures at I-Soon. \u201cOriginally, everyone knew that the company was having a hard time, and they all understood. After all, the epidemic is so severe,\u201d wrote one worker in March 2021. But, they complained, I-Soon \u201cdidn\u2019t say they wouldn\u2019t pay us wages\u201d. By the following year, the pressures at the company seemed to have intensified. The chief executive, Wu Haibo, who uses the pseudonym Shutd0wn, said that the loss of core staff had dented customers\u2019 confidence, leading to a loss of business. Wu did not respond to a request for comment. \u201cThe boss is really anxious,\u201d wrote one employee in September 2022. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the company can survive until the end of the year.\u201d In another chat log, workers spoke about the company\u2019s poor sales and a souring mood in the office. One employee turned to a universal solace: \u201cI\u2019ll probably scream if I can\u2019t have a drink.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-14T19:52:35Z",
            "content": "US adversaries \u2013 chiefly Iran and North Korea, and to a lesser extent Russia and China \u2013 are beginning to use generative artificial intelligence to mount or organize offensive cyber operations, Microsoft said on Wednesday. Microsoft said it detected and disrupted, in collaboration with business partner OpenAI, many threats that used or attempted to exploit AI technology they had developed. In a blogpost, the company said the techniques were \u201cearly-stage\u201d and neither \u201cparticularly novel or unique\u201d but that it was important to expose them publicly as US rivals leveraging large-language models to expand their ability to breach networks and conduct influence operations. Cybersecurity firms have long used machine-learning on defense, principally to detect anomalous behavior in networks. But criminals and offensive hackers use it as well, and the introduction of large-language models led by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT upped that game of cat-and-mouse. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, and Wednesday\u2019s announcement coincided with its release of a report noting that generative AI is expected to enhance malicious social engineering, leading to more sophisticated deepfakes and voice cloning. A threat to democracy in a year where over 50 countries will conduct elections, magnifying disinformation and already occurring, Microsoft provided some examples. In each case it said all generative AI accounts and assets of the named groups were disabled: \u2022 The North Korean cyber-espionage group known as Kimsuky has used the models to research foreign thinktanks that study the country, and to generate content likely to be used in spear-phishing hacking campaigns. \u2022 Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard has used large-language models to assist in social engineering, in troubleshooting software errors and even in studying how intruders might evade detection in a compromised network. That includes generating phishing emails \u201cincluding one pretending to come from an international development agency and another attempting to lure prominent feminists to an attacker-built website on feminism\u201d. The AI helps accelerate and boost the email production. \u2022 The Russian GRU military intelligence unit known as Fancy Bear has used the models to research satellite and radar technologies that may relate to the war in Ukraine. \u2022 The Chinese cyber-espionage group known as Aquatic Panda \u2013 which targets a broad range of industries, higher education and governments from France to Malaysia \u2013 has interacted with the models \u201cin ways that suggest a limited exploration of how LLMs can augment their technical operations\u201d. \u2022 The Chinese group Maverick Panda, which has targeted US defense contractors among other sectors for more than a decade, had interactions with large-language models suggesting it was evaluating their effectiveness as a source of information \u201con potentially sensitive topics, high profile individuals, regional geopolitics, US influence, and internal affairs\u201d. In a separate blog published on Wednesday, OpenAI said its current GPT-4 model chatbot offers \u201conly limited, incremental capabilities for malicious cybersecurity tasks beyond what is already achievable with publicly available, non-AI powered tools\u201d. Cybersecurity researchers expect that to change. Last April, the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, told Congress that \u201cthere are two epoch-defining threats and challenges. One is China, and the other is artificial intelligence.\u201d Easterly said at the time that the US needed to ensure AI is built with security in mind. Critics of the public release of ChatGPT in November 2022 \u2013 and subsequent releases by competitors including Google and Meta \u2013 contend it was irresponsibly hasty, considering security was largely an afterthought in their development. \u201cOf course bad actors are using large-language models \u2013 that decision was made when Pandora\u2019s Box was opened,\u201d said Amit Yoran, chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Tenable. Some cybersecurity professionals complain about Microsoft\u2019s creation and hawking of tools to address vulnerabilities in large-language models when it might more responsibly focus on making them more secure. \u201cWhy not create more secure black-box LLM foundation models instead of selling defensive tools for a problem they are helping to create?\u201d asked Gary McGraw, a computer security veteran and co-founder of the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning. The NYU professor and former AT&amp;T chief security officer Edward Amoroso said that while the use of AI and large-language models may not pose an immediately obvious threat, they \u201cwill eventually become one of the most powerful weapons in every nation-state military\u2019s offense\u201d."

            "date": "2024-02-06T12:13:10Z",
            "content": "It is not quite accurate to say that the cyber-attack against the British Library took place on 28 October 2023. Most probably, Rhysida, the hacker gang that orchestrated the attack and is thought to be Russian, had already been creeping undetected through the digital territories of the British Library for months, Enrico Mariconti, a lecturer in security and crime science at UCL, told me. Once it broke through to the library\u2019s virtual private network (VPN) \u2013 the remote connection that allows employees to access its network from any location \u2013 it could in theory start making its way through locked door after locked door of the library\u2019s many online systems, trawling until it discovered emails and documents containing details such as employees\u2019 passport scans and work contracts. It hoped these documents might tempt a single bidder to pay 20 bitcoins (about \u00a3600,000) for privileged access to all that personal information. Eventually, after the British Library refused to pay a \u00a3600,000 ransom, the hackers published close to 500,000 files of what they called \u201cexclusive, unique and impressive\u201d stolen data for anyone to download for free through the dark web. An image of the aftermath of Rhysida\u2019s October attack might look like this: a national library from the pre-digital era, no wifi, no computer access, with even the phone lines dead. Except there was one crucial difference. No one could even make use of the British Library\u2019s enormous collection of 170m items. Three months later, the library is still in the initial stages of its recovery, with many of its services and systems still down. Rhysida\u2019s attack, according to Ciaran Martin, the previous CEO of the National Cyber Security Centre, is \u201cone of the worst cyber incidents in British history\u201d. Long gone are the days of the solo-hackers who broke through computer security systems for kicks and bragging rights, like the bleached-haired teens in the 1995 film Hackers. In February 2022, years of internal messages from a Russian ransomware group were leaked, offering a window into the logistical dynamics of hacker groups. The group in question often had more than 100 employees on its payroll, each working remotely on the various moving parts of its fastidiously planned cyber-attacks. Its workforce was ordered into numerous departments, each with its own budget, and it had a committed HR department. In the past few years, cybercrime has expanded from a cottage industry to a slick, specialised crime racket. Rhysida is a ransomware-as-a-service group. This means anyone can contract it to target a victim of their choosing. Its clients need not have any native understanding of cybercrime, because Rhysida will do the heavy lifting. It discovers how to hack into its victim\u2019s private network, lift information, then encrypt the victim\u2019s data and send out the ransom note, having decided in advance on a number that will be significant but not enough to bankrupt the victim. Then, it liaises with the victim through a message portal, all the while providing the client with detailed analysis of its progress. Its motivations are varied. Mariconti told me he believes the British Library cyber-attack was probably a \u201cshowcase\u201d operation. High-profile attacks work like an advertisement for potential clients. \u201cIt says, \u2018Hey, we are able to attack a big institution,\u2019\u201d Mariconti said. \u201c\u2018Come to us, give us money, and we are going to take whatever you want.\u2019\u201d Then there is the opportunistic element. The British Library is a critically important site of knowledge, but unlike the NHS or GCHQ, a breach of its cybersecurity wouldn\u2019t cause an immediate threat to public safety, so there are fewer incentives for the government to improve its IT systems. The future of cybercrime is beginning to look like any other arms race. There are many Russian-affiliated hacker groups, which tend not to carry out attacks on their own country (indeed, many strains of malware don\u2019t even work on Russian computers). Nicole Perlroth, formerly the lead cybersecurity reporter for the New York Times, summarises Russia\u2019s guidelines for hackers as follows: \u201cFirst, no hacking inside the motherland. And second, when the Kremlin calls in a favour, you do whatever it asks.\u201d Meanwhile, in Britain, the government\u2019s lack of investment in cybersecurity has turned the country into an open goal for potential aggressors (last year, the Treasury posted a job advert for a head of cybersecurity with a starting salary of \u00a350,000; the median salary for a head of cybersecurity role in the private sector is almost double that number). And then there is the other hidden cost undergirding this arms race: its environmental impact. To run the servers that are either building the malware or defending against such attacks requires enormous carbon emissions. In 2020, an American cybersecurity firm managed to decrypt the malware that had locked a technology manufacturer out from their data in a few hours using nearly 100 cloud computer servers. The cloud reportedly now has a greater carbon footprint than the airline industry. I asked Prof Mariconti if a solution to the increasing global threat from cyber-attacks would be to create stronger internal borders within the internet, so that each country\u2019s firewalls came more to resemble those in China, whose servers block much international traffic and international websites. \u201cThat goes against the logic of the internet,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe internet was born out of the idea of being able to communicate without restrictions all over the world.\u201d This double-sided quality has existed since the internet\u2019s very inception: freedom to roam without borders, and the potential misuse of such a liberty. All that time the Rhysida hackers spent moving freely through the networks of the British Library, while we were down below in its physical reading rooms, naive to their existence, I wonder if they ever considered the irony of their attacks. The very conditions that have allowed them to conduct their trade across the open plains of cyberspace are those they now aim to abuse, by shutting down the possibility for communication and knowledge-sharing, stealing and encrypting information, forcing users to buy back or lose their data, and bringing vital institutions such as libraries \u2013 which protect and share all of this knowledge for anyone to access \u2013 to their knees.

Chainalysis said: \u201c2023 marks a major comeback for ransomware, with record-breaking payments and a substantial increase in the scope and complexity of attacks \u2013 a significant reversal from the decline observed in 2022.\u201d Ransomware attacks typically involve hackers entering a target\u2019s computer system and paralysing it with malware, which encrypts files and makes them inaccessible. A new trend in attacks involves assailants extracting data from the IT system, such as staff or customer details. The gang then asks for payment in cryptocurrency, usually bitcoin, to unlock the files or to delete their copy of the stolen data. Chainalysis said a number of factors contributed to the payments dip in 2022, including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Most ransomware groups are linked to eastern Europe, former Soviet republics and Russia in particular, with Chainalysis reporting that some rogue actors were either disrupted or shifted their focus from ransomware to politically motivated cyber-espionage. One major hacker group, Conti, disbanded amid internal upheaval after an anonymous leaker who expressed sympathy for Ukraine released 60,000 internal messages. The FBI also disrupted the Hive ransomware group by capturing its decryption keys and saving victims from making $130m in ransom payments. Chainalysis also cited research showing that attacks last year showed a growth in the number of attackers and ransomware variants. \u201cA major thing we\u2019re seeing is the astronomical growth in the number of threat actors carrying out ransomware attacks,\u201d said Allan Liska, analyst at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. According to Recorded Future, there were 538 new ransomware variants in 2023, which indicates the emergence of new, independent groups. The Clop group emerged as a significant player last year, claiming responsibility for the hack of the payroll provider Zellis, which targeted a vulnerability in MOVEit software, which is used to transfer files around internal networks. Affected customers included British Airways, Boots and the BBC. The British Library is still recovering from a ransomware attack by a rebranded group, Rhysida, that targeted the institution in October. The library has declined to pay a ransom. The growth of \u201cransomware as a service\u201d, where malware is hired out to criminals in exchange for a cut of the proceeds has also stoked activity, along with \u201cinitial access brokers\u201d who sell vulnerabilities in the networks of potential targets to ransomware attackers. Ellie Ludlam, a partner specialising in cybersecurity at UK law firm Pinsent Masons, said she expected the increase in attacks to continue. \u201cThis increase is expected to continue in 2024 and with an ongoing focus on mass data exfiltration by threat actor groups, which holds the potential for higher ransom payments by impacted companies,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2024-02-04T14:19:48Z",
            "content": "The credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned that water companies face an \u201celevated\u201d risk from cyber attackers targeting drinking water, as suppliers wait on permission from the industry regulator to ramp up spending on digital security. Moody\u2019s said, in a report to investors, that hackers are increasingly zeroing in on infrastructure companies, including water and wastewater treatment companies, and the use of AI (artificial intelligence) could accelerate this trend. Last month, Southern Water, which supplies 4.6 million customers in the south of England, said the Black Basta ransomware group had claimed to have accessed its systems, posting a \u201climited amount\u201d of data on the dark web. The same group hacked outsourcing firm Capita last year. Separately, South Staffordshire Water apologised in 2022 after hackers stole customers\u2019 personal data. Moody\u2019s warned that the growing use of data-logging equipment to monitor water consumption, and the use of digital smart meters, made companies more vulnerable to attacks. It said systems used in water treatment facilities were typically separated from the rest of the companies\u2019 IT \u2013 including customer databases \u2013 but some systems had been more closely integrated to improve efficiency. After a hack, companies typically have to employ specialist cybersecurity firms to repair systems, spend on communicating with customers, and face potential penalties from regulators. The UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office can fine firms up to 4% of group turnover, or \u20ac20m (\u00a317m), whichever is higher. Moody\u2019s said that the cost of fixing systems, including resecuring and strengthening existing cyber defences and paying potential fines, will typically result in only a \u201cmodest increase\u201d in debt levels if the incident is short-lived. However, Moody\u2019s cautioned: \u201cThe greater risk for the sector, and society, is if malicious actors are able to access operational technology systems to impair drinking water or wastewater treatment facilities.\u201d The agency said that water suppliers, the government and regulators had acknowledged the need to bolster cyber defences \u201cgiven the growing sophistication of attacks on critical infrastructure, with state-aligned actors a recent but growing class of cyber adversary\u201d. There are wider concerns about the digital security of British infrastructure assets, including the \u00a350bn project to build a vast underground nuclear waste store and the Sellafield nuclear site in Cumbria, where the Guardian revealed a string of problems with cybersecurity. The Moody\u2019s report comes as water companies in England and Wales hope to increase their spending on cyber defences by gaining allowances from Ofwat. The regulator is assessing their plans to raise bills from 2025 to 2030 to cover investments. Ofwat\u2019s determination, due later this year, comes at a critical juncture for an industry under fire for sewage dumping, poor leakage records and big executive pay packets. Last October, companies submitted five-year business plans detailing their planned bill increases, needed to fund a record \u00a396bn investment to fix raw sewage leaks, reduce leaks and build reservoirs. Moody\u2019s analysis showed companies hope to increase spending on security from less than \u00a3100m collectively to nearly \u00a3700m over the next five years. The increased scrutiny of the sector, and the hack at Southern Water, may strengthen its case, the credit agency said. The agency said that South Staffordshire Water costs related to the hack, including potential civil claims, could reach \u00a310m. Moody\u2019s warnings over the potential impact on water companies\u2019 debts come amid wider concerns over leverage in the water sector, with up to 28% of bill payments used to service debts in areas of England. Last week, the industry body, Water UK, said that average annual bills will go up by 6% from April, outstripping the current rate of inflation."

            "content": "Joe Biden declared the strong jobs figures released on Friday as proof that \u201cAmerica\u2019s economy is the strongest in the world\u201d. The US jobs market defied fears of a downturn again, when figures were released on growth in January, with employers adding 353,000 new jobs over the month, the labor department announced. The jobs market has remained strong despite an aggressive series of interest rate rises by the Federal Reserve, aimed at cooling the economy and bringing down the rate of inflation. In January the unemployment rate was 3.7%, close to a 50-year low. Economists had been predicting that the US would add less than 200,000 jobs over the month. The labor department also revised its job gains for December up from an initial estimate of 216,000 to 333,000. The news was another boost to the US president, whose polling on the economy has remained weak despite the robust jobs market. Hiring was broad-based with gains in healthcare, government, professional and business services and retail. Biden pointed out that the US has added almost 15m jobs since he was sworn in in January 2021. In a statement from the White House, Biden said: \u201cToday, we saw more proof, with another month of strong wage gains and employment gains of over 350,000 in January, continuing the strong growth from last year \u2026 It\u2019s great news for working families that wages, wealth and jobs are higher now than before the pandemic, and I won\u2019t stop fighting to lower costs and build an economy from the middle out and bottom up.\u201d He further said: \u201cI\u2019ll continue to stand in the way of efforts by congressional Republicans to enact massive tax giveaways for the wealthy and big corporations; cut Medicare, Medicaid and social security; and raise costs for American families.\u201d But there have been signs recently that the strong labor market is weakening. On Wednesday, ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll supplier, said private employers had added 107,000 new jobs in January, less than analysts expected and down from 158,000 in December. Several large employers have also announced layoffs recently, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, PayPal and UPS. The US added 2.7m jobs last year even as the Fed drove interest rates up to a 22-year high. This week, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the US economy remained resilient and the rate of inflation \u2013 which has fallen from a high of just over 9% in June 2022 to 3.4% in December \u2013 was moving in the right direction. But the Fed is still targeting an annual rate of inflation of 2%. Powell warned: \u201cInflation is still too high, the ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path forward is uncertain.\u201d The latest jobs report will add pressure for the Fed to maintain its current interest rates. \u201cThe big picture for now is that markets are no longer convinced that the Fed will cut rates in May, let alone March,\u201d Capital Economics said in a note."

            "date": "2024-02-27T06:00:13Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s net zero economy grew by 9% in 2023, a report has revealed, in stark contrast to the 0.1% growth seen in the economy overall. Nevertheless, the report pointed out that strong future growth from green businesses was being put at risk by government policy reversals, lack of investment and competition from the EU and US. Thousands of new green companies were founded in 2023 and overall the sector was responsible for the production of \u00a374bn in goods and services and 765,000 jobs, according to the report by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). Hotspots of net zero businesses and the well-paid jobs they provide occur across the country, rather than being concentrated in London and the south-east, the report found. It also highlighted strong net zero activity in some of the most deprived areas and in marginal constituencies that will be focal battlegrounds in the coming general election. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is vital to limiting the damage from the climate crisis. Doing so would not only bring an economic boost but also cut energy costs for households and businesses and ensure energy security by ending the UK\u2019s reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets, the report authors said. Peter Chalkley, the director of ECIU, said: \u201cAgainst the backdrop of economic stagnation, the net zero economy is bucking the trend, but it\u2019s clear that the policy U-turns of the past year have damaged investor confidence at a time when the US and EU are investing billions to compete for clean industries. The question now is: will political parties provide the leadership, stability and investment needed to generate further growth \u2013 or shy away from the global race for net zero?\u201d Louise Hellem, chief economist at the CBI, said: \u201cThe transition to net zero presents unprecedented opportunities for the UK to become a more resilient and productive economy while also tackling climate change. [Businesses] really don\u2019t want to see net zero issues politicised.\u201d Rishi Sunak, the Conservative prime minister, has weakened net zero policies including the rollout of electric vehicles and heat pumps and backed new oil and gas drilling, against the advice of scientists. The UK has also recently fallen down an index of attractiveness for renewable energy investment. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, recently halved a pledge to invest \u00a328bn a year in the green economy. Adriana Curca, manager of CBI Economics, said: \u201cWe quite often tend to think about the costs involved in the net zero transition, but there are a lot of economic opportunities, having a real potential to drive sustainable long-term growth.\u201d The new report analysed the green economy, including renewable energy, building energy efficiency, electric vehicles, carbon capture technology and green finance. It found net zero jobs were on average \u00a310,000 better paid than the UK average of \u00a335,400, and 50% more productive, generating \u00a3114,300 in economic activity overall. The number of net zero businesses rose by 4,000 to 23,745 in 2023. The report found hotspots of net zero activity in some of the most deprived parts of the country, including Hartlepool, Nottingham, Redcar and Cleveland, all of which are in the 10% most deprived local authorities. It also found that half of the top 50 net zero hotspots in England and Wales were in the top 50 most marginal Conservative seats to be contested at the general election, including High Peak, Cheadle, Derby North, and Lancaster and Wyre. Adriana Curca: \u201cThese [net zero] jobs go a long way towards improving living standards in those areas.\u201d Thomas Farquhar at cleantech business Heatio said: \u201cThe UK net zero economy offers huge opportunities for new, innovative businesses to grow. Frustratingly, we are lagging behind the rest of Europe.\u201d Farquhar said only 1% of UK homes had transitioned to low carbon dioxide heating, compared with 66% in Norway; and only 5% of suitable UK homes had installed solar panels, compared with 16% in the Netherlands. The UK\u2019s National Infrastructure Commission said on Friday that the \u201cgovernment needs to move faster to ensure that the necessary [energy] infrastructure can be delivered over the next decade\u201d. The International Monetary Fund said in December that the \u201ceconomic benefits of accelerating the transition to a low carbon economy vastly outweigh its cost\u201d. A London School of Economics report published in January concluded that \u201ctoo much current investment continues to be in the unsustainable economy\u201d, such as oil and gas and new homes and offices that are not energy-efficient. It said: \u201cThe UK needs to increase annual public investment by around 1% of GDP \u2013 \u00a326bn at current prices \u2013 to make up for decades of underinvestment. There will be upfront investment costs, but targeted and temporary borrowing for good public net investment is fiscally responsible.\u201d A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome these findings, which are testament to our world-leading plans to transform the energy industry towards more clean and renewable energy. We have a clear strategy to boost UK industry and reach net zero - with over 80,000 green jobs being supported or in the pipeline since 2020, and over \u00a3200bn in public and private low carbon investment since 2010.\u201d"

            "content": "A social media post about giraffe conservation has become the latest place for people in China who are unhappy about the economy to vent their frustration, as the Chinese government increasingly cracks down on negative commentary. On 2 February, the US embassy in China posted an update on its Weibo account about tracking giraffes in Namibia using GPS technology. As of Monday afternoon local time, the post had received approximately 166,000 comments, many of them about China\u2019s economic pains. \u201cWho can help me? I\u2019ve been unemployed for a long time,\u201d wrote one commenter. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few comments about stocks, will they be deleted?\u201d wrote another. Other comments, reported by Bloomberg, included: \u201cIf criticisms are not allowed, then praises are meaningless\u201d and negative references to China\u2019s stock market. Weibo, which has 593 million monthly active users, moderates comments that are posted on the platform. Threads beneath posts by foreign organisations, such as the US embassy, are a slightly more permissive environment for commenters than those below posts by Chinese state agencies, which often take it upon themselves to ensure that discussions stay within government\u2019s red lines. Many of the comments on the US embassy\u2019s post appeared to have been scrubbed from the platform as of Monday, or drowned out by comments saying variations on \u201cI love China\u201d. Chinese authorities are increasingly concerned about gloomy commentary as the economy struggles to rebuild momentum after the lifting of the country\u2019s harsh \u201czero-Covid\u201d pandemic restrictions. In December, social media influencers were warned against making public comments that would \u201cbad-mouth the economy\u201d. The restrictions on negative comments have failed to mask the fact that China\u2019s stock market is flailing. The CSI 300 index, which tracks the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, tumbled nearly 5% last week to a a five-year low. On Sunday, the Chinese securities regulatory commission said it would step up market stabilisation measures. The popularity of the US embassy\u2019s post about giraffes prompted giraffe-related comments elsewhere on Weibo. In one since deleted comment, a user wrote: \u201cThe giraffe has reached a new high. Even though many comments have been deleted and many likes have been deleted, it has still reached a new high! Weibo administrators and your editors, thank you for your hard work. The holidays keep you so busy.\u201d"

            "content": "Factories destroyed. Roads blown to pieces. Power plants put out of action. Steel exports decimated. A flood of refugees out of the country. Ukraine \u2013 the poorest country in Europe \u2013 has paid a heavy economic price for a two-year war against Russia waged almost entirely on its own soil. The figures are stark. More than 7 million people \u2013 about a fifth of the population \u2013 have been plunged into poverty. Fifteen years of human development have been lost. In the first year of the war, the economy contracted by 30%. Yet it could have been even worse. Beata Javorcik, chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said 90% of businesses in the areas of Ukraine where there was no fighting are still going concerns. Inflation has come down from a peak of 27% to less than 5%. Even so, Ukraine\u2019s economy remains on a knife edge. It needs more than $40bn (\u00a331bn) of western aid this year to balance the books and keep the military equipped. The costs of piecing the country back together again is put at $486bn over 10 years \u2013 up from $411bn a year ago. \u201cThe last two years have seen unprecedented suffering and loss for Ukraine and its people,\u201d said Antonella Bassani, World Bank vice-president for Europe and central Asia. By contrast, Russia has emerged from two years of war looking relatively unscathed. Soon after the war started, the International Monetary Fund said it expected the Russian economy to suffer a severe two-year recession \u2013 contracting by 8.5% in 2022 and a further 2.3% in 2023. The economy did shrink in 2022, but only by just over 2%, and in 2023 it grew \u2013 according to the latest IMF estimates \u2013 by 3%. There is no hard evidence that the war effort has forced ordinary Russians to tighten their belts. Generous welfare benefits have underpinned incomes while a tight labour market has supported strong wages growth. Illustrating the point, consumer spending rose 6% last year. Moreover, Russia entered the war in a strong position financially. Vladimir Putin planned for an invasion with a high oil price that filled his exchequer with funds, and with a debt-to-GDP ratio down about 20%. Last year, Russia\u2019s budget deficit was limited to just over 1% of GDP. On the downside, labour shortages caused by conscription have pushed up prices. The official inflation rate has almost halved, from 11.5% last autumn to 6.6% in January, but this month the central bank maintained its tough stance to prevent a resurgence, pegging interest rates at 16%. There are a number of reasons for Russia\u2019s resilience. Its economy was 10 times the size of Ukraine\u2019s when the war started. Its physical infrastructure has not been flattened. A huge increase in the defence budget has boosted growth. Finally, Putin has been preparing Russia for the conflict for years \u2013 using oil and gas proceeds to accumulate reserves and taking steps to sanction-proof the economy. Tim Ash, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, said Russia\u2019s resilience was unsurprising. \u201cOnly Putin knew there was going to be a war and he had prepared for it. But it\u2019s clear that sanctions are removing some of the financial buffers and stockpiles built up ahead of the invasion.\u201d Mark Harrison, an economic historian and emeritus professor at Warwick University, said Putin had ramped up defence spending from 3% of national income to nearer 7%, and it could hit 10% over the next year. \u201cBut Putin doesn\u2019t know any more than we do where the tolerance of the Russian people lies. The process of feeling for those limits is different for an authoritarian leader because he knows the people won\u2019t tell him, or at least not until it is too late for his leadership to survive.\u201d Javorcik said it was unrealistic to expect the first wave of sanctions to bring the economy to its knees. Domestically produced goods were replacing western imports, while Russia was also able to source goods directly through China and Turkey and indirectly from countries acting as intermediaries for western products. \u201cSanctions are working,\u201d Javorcik said. \u201cBut they are working slowly.\u201d Being cut off from western technology, capital, knowledge and management techniques will lead to weaker productivity growth, the impact of which will be amplified by the loss of human capital caused by skilled workers leaving the country. Mark Sobel, of the thinktank OMFIF, said: \u201cA cursory examination of current Russian data \u2013 such as growth and inflation \u2013 might suggest that the economy is \u2018resilient\u2019 in the face of the costs of Russia continuing its ruthless invasion. That view may contain elements of validity in the short term. But it overlooks weaknesses and realities. Significantly greater isolation and economic degradation are baked in the cake for the Russian economy and people.\u201d The scale of the damage to Ukraine coupled with the failure of sanctions to force Putin to back down have forced the west to consider what to do next. One option \u2013 favoured by both Ash and Harrison \u2013 is to tighten sanctions still further. Harrison draws a comparison with the western front in 1918 and the collapse of German morale after the allies tightened their blockade, preventing vital supplies reaching civilians and the army alike. \u201cRussia is not at this stage yet, but if sanctions are tightened, who knows when war-weariness takes hold,\u201d he said. \u201cA war plan involves your enemy running out of options as it runs out of resources. And in the interests of the west, that needs to be Russia.\u201d Ash said there were signs of sanctions becoming tougher. Big lenders in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are reported to have begun closing bank accounts of Russian nationals and limiting settlements with Russia. Some Chinese banks and Turkish lenders are understood to have reacted to US threats in December to cut off access to foreign banks doing business with companies that support Russia\u2019s defence industry. There is also also pressure on the G7 to seize Russia\u2019s frozen reserves and use them as collateral to raise debt for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Almost $300bn of Russian assets have been immobilised since the invasion two years ago. The UK and the US have warmed to this idea but EU members of the G7 warn there is no basis in international law for seizing the assets of a foreign country. Since more than half the Russian reserves are held in the EU \u2013 mainly in Belgium \u2013 there are fears seizure could lead to international investors dumping the euro on currency markets. A compromise could be to seize the interest on these reserves, which amounts to an estimated $15bn. While that debate goes on, Ukraine faces an immediate cash crisis and needs financial help to fill a $39bn black hole in its budget. Spending this year is expected to be just over $81bn while revenues are forecast to be a little more than $43bn. The defence budget alone comes to just under $42bn. The EU and the IMF have continued financial support but US aid is being blocked by Congress. \u201cIt would be extremely unfortunate if a lack of money meant that Ukraine\u2019s macroeconomic stability, which has been achieved during wartime, were thrown out of the window,\u201d Javorcik said. Without further funding, Ukraine would become a failed state, he said. \u201cAnd that would affect European countries through a potential second refugee wave and instability on its eastern border.\u201d"

            "title": "Should the UK embrace higher net migration or rethink the economy?",
            "date": "2024-02-04T11:06:27Z",
            "content": "Tough choices. We must be willing to make tough choices. It is a soundbite heard frequently from politicians, often accompanied by another chestnut: there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Both statements are true. Free lunches are few and far between. There are tough choices that need to be made. But, like most other developed countries in similar circumstances, Britain is reluctant to make them. Tough choices implies a willingness to make sacrifices and that doesn\u2019t fit well with the west\u2019s \u201cI want it all now\u201d culture. Politicians pander to this. They talk about the need to make tough choices but in fact look for the soft option, because that\u2019s what keeps the punters happy. The debate over immigration is a case in point. Migration is a hot topic here, as it is in Germany, France, the Netherlands and the US. What\u2019s more, it is certain to remain a salient political issue. Last week, the Office for National Statistics published its latest projections for the size of the UK\u2019s population. These showed the number of people living in the UK rising to 70 million by 2026 \u2013 a decade earlier than previously envisaged \u2013 and continuing to increase over the following decade to 73.7 million. Net migration \u2013 the number of people entering the UK minus the number leaving \u2013 is expected to account for more than 90% of the 6.6 million increase in the population between 2021 and 2036. Just to be clear, these are not ONS forecasts but rather projections based on net migration of 315,000 from 2028 onwards. This would be much lower than the record 672,000 in the year to June 2023 but significantly higher than in any previous period. When Tony Blair became prime minister in 1997, for example, net migration was 48,000. When David Cameron entered Downing Street in 2010 the figure stood at 256,000. One response to these projections is to say: what\u2019s the problem? If people from other parts of the world want to come here then they are welcome to come. Migration is globalisation in action: workers from poor countries seeking out job opportunities in countries where they can earn higher wages and enjoy better living standards. Migrants can make the economy grow faster and they do the jobs home-born workers are reluctant to do. Without migrant workers the care system would collapse and NHS waiting lists would be even longer than they are already. Without foreign students, the higher education system would be in deep financial trouble. Given the UK\u2019s ageing population, it makes no economic sense to put an arbitrary limit on net migration. Let\u2019s assume all the above is correct. Put to one side the fact that much higher levels of net migration have coincided with only weak growth in per capita incomes. Whether or not migration is good for growth, if the UK\u2019s population is to increase on the scale envisaged over the next decade or so, then this country will have to be prepared to build (and pay for) the infrastructure to service a much-expanded citizenry. That means more schools, more hospitals, more capacity on the transport network and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 more houses. The current level of homes built in the UK is about half that of its postwar peak of 425,000 recorded in 1968, a time when the population was 12 million smaller than it is today and 19 million smaller than it is expected to be by the mid-2030s. The supply of homes is already insufficient to meet existing demands and those pressures are only going to increase if the ONS projections are right. And that means, you guessed it, tough choices. If housing supply is to keep up with demand it will mean liberalising the planning rules. It might even involve building on the green belt. It will certainly lead to a struggle between whoever is in government and those who think demand can be met simply by developing brownfield sites. The consequences of a 10% increase in the population without a significant increase in the supply of new homes are obvious: rampant house-price inflation; more overcrowding; ever-higher numbers of children living with their parents into their 30s; more people squeezed into private-rented accommodation, and a growing divide between the housing haves and the housing have nots. So how about some serious immigration controls instead? Wouldn\u2019t they be an alternative to concreting over the green belt? In theory, yes. It was not so long ago that annual net migration hovered around zero. In 1990 and 1991, for example, it averaged 40,000 a year; in the following two years it fell by 6,000 a year on average. In practice, of course, returning to those levels of net migration would also have consequences. Care homes would need to charge more to attract UK-born workers. Universities would no longer be able to use the fees from foreign students to subsidise those from the UK. Businesses that have come to rely on migrant workers would become unviable. Again, one response would be: so what? If the business model of care homes relies on cheap foreign labour and that of universities relies on expensive foreign students then there is something wrong with those business models. But while the long-term solution might well be a different economic model \u2013 higher wage, higher productivity, more highly automated \u2013 getting to that better world will not be easy or cost-free. It means either higher taxes to pay for higher levels of public spending or higher prices for consumers, and quite possibly both. So there\u2019s a choice that has to be made: embrace high levels of net migration and fundamentally rethink housing; or reduce net migration to late 20th-century levels and fundamentally rethink the economy. It can\u2019t be ducked."

            "content": "Fifty years ago, then governor Ronald Reagan headlined the inaugural Conservative Political Action Conference. He spoke of the US as a city on a hill, an example of human virtue and excellence, a divinely inspired nation whose best days were ahead. The speakers at last week\u2019s conference were decidedly less inspiring. A lineup of extremists, insurrectionists and conspiracy theorists gathered for panels like \u201cCat Fight? Michelle v Kamala\u201d and \u201cPutting Our Heads in the Gas Stove\u201d. At CPAC, you can drink \u201cWoke Tears Water\u201d, buy rhinestone-studded firearms and play a January 6-themed pinball machine. But it would be wrong to dismiss CPAC as a crackpot convention. It is also a harbinger of what a second Donald Trump presidency would bring, influenced by a consortium of self-proclaimed Christian nationalists and reactionary dark money groups like the Heritage Foundation who see Trump as their return ticket to relevancy. The Heritage Foundation has poured $22m into Project 2025, their plan to gut the \u201cdeep state\u201d and radically reshape the government with a souped-up version of the unitary executive theory, which contends that the president should be allowed to enact his agenda without pesky checks and balances. To paraphrase one speaker at CPAC: \u201cWelcome to the end of democracy.\u201d The Heritage Foundation\u2019s policy agenda is disturbingly radical, even by the standards of the modern Republican party. They want to dismantle the administrative state, ban abortion completely at the state and federal level, and, as always, cut taxes for the rich. They would put religious liberties over civil ones, and Christian rights over the rights of women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people and really anyone who does not look and think exactly like they do. As Trump himself said in an alarmingly theocratic speech last week: \u201cNo one will be touching the cross of Christ under the Trump administration, I swear to you.\u201d And we have no reason to doubt him. Russell Vought, a radical involved with Project 2025 who speaks with Trump at least twice a month, is a candidate to be the next White House chief of staff. Vought works closely with the Christian nationalist William Wolfe, a former Trump administration official who has advocated for ending surrogacy, no-fault divorce, sex education in schools and policies that \u201csubsidize single motherhood\u201d. The Heritage Foundation has even called for \u201cending recreational sex\u201d. Media coverage of Trump tends to focus on his mounting legal woes (nearly half a billion in damages and counting) and increasingly bizarre rants (magnets don\u2019t work underwater). But such an approach misses the point. We can\u2019t risk focusing on spectacle at the expense of strategy, and he has made his strategy perfectly clear. He has said he will be a dictator on \u201cday one\u201d and \u201cgo after\u201d and indict those who challenge him. He\u2019s running on a 10-point \u201cPlan to Protect Children from Leftwing Gender Insanity\u201d. He\u2019s promised to send federal troops into Democratic-run \u201ccrime dens\u201d, by which he means New York City and Chicago. He will have advantages in the courts this time around, too. Groups such as the Article III Project \u2013 an advocacy group for \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d judges \u2013 are making sure of it. A3P is led by Mike Davis, a Trump loyalist lawyer who has been floated for attorney general. (You know, the role that Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr weren\u2019t extreme enough for?) He has promised: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s next generation of judges will be even more bold and tough.\u201d And in the meantime, his organization has taken out TV ads attacking the judges and prosecutors in Trump\u2019s criminal trials as \u201cactivists\u201d who have \u201cdestroyed the rule of law\u201d. If the Article III Project gets what they want, judges hearing challenges to Trump\u2019s proposals will be judges he appointed. Not only will his policies be more dangerous and dogmatic, they\u2019ll be better designed to withstand judicial scrutiny, especially in a friendly court. Look no further than the Alabama supreme court, which ruled last week that frozen embryos are children, imperiling the legality of IVF and foreshadowing far worse. Trump, clearly panicking, has distanced himself from this decision, but as long as he continues to nominate radical activist judges \u2013 and he will \u2013 it is nothing more than posturing. As was the case during his first term, Trump will serve as a vessel for some of the most regressive figures in American politics. And unlike last time \u2013 when he was incentivized to get re-elected legitimately \u2013 he will be unencumbered by any notion that he should abide by democratic norms or heed moderating voices. January 6 was a purity test, and he\u2019s since cleared his ranks of people who\u2019ve even whispered disapprovingly. Despite all of this, Trump is leading Biden in many polls. Most projections put the race at 50/50 at best. If Trump and his extremist cronies prevail in 2024, Project 2025 will be under way this time next year, stripping millions of Americans of our freedoms. The end of democracy, indeed.

            "date": "2024-02-07T11:01:12Z",
            "content": "Ten days ago Joe Biden did something remarkable, and almost without precedent \u2013 he actually said no to big oil. His administration halted the granting of new permits for building liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, something Washington had been handing out like M&amp;Ms on Halloween for nearly a decade. It\u2019s a provisional \u201cno\u201d \u2013 Department of Energy experts will spend the coming months figuring out a new formula for granting the licenses that takes the latest science and economics into account \u2013 but you can tell what a big deal it is because of the howls of rage coming from the petroleum industry and its gaggle of politicians. And you can tell something else too: just how threadbare their arguments have become over time. Biden has called their bluff, and it\u2019s beautiful to watch. To give you an idea, politicians beholden to the industry are using this week and next to hold hearings about natural gas in Congress. Joe Manchin \u2013 who has received more lobbying money from big oil than anyone else in Congress, and is the founder of a coal brokerage business \u2013 is convening a session in the Senate on Thursday, but on Tuesday the House began the action with a hearing before a subcommittee of the House committee on energy and commerce. One \u201cexpert\u201d summoned by the panel, Toby Rice, owns the company that produces more natural gas than any other in the country. And he immediately deployed the sleight of hand that his ilk have used over and over again. I\u2019ll try and slow it down enough that you can see the hand dealing from the bottom of the deck. The fracking revolution, Rice said, \u201chas powered our economy and prevented us from being reliant on foreign sources of natural gas \u2013 all the while driving over 60% of the emissions reduction the United States experienced since the turn of the century by displacing coal-fired power generation\u201d. The key word here is \u201cemissions\u201d, by which Rice means carbon dioxide. And indeed fracked gas, when burned in a power plant, produces fewer emissions than coal. But there\u2019s another major greenhouse gas \u2013 methane \u2013 and that\u2019s basically what \u201cnatural gas\u201d consists of. When it leaks from a well or a pipeline, it\u2019s 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, molecule per molecule, at trapping heat. And so much is leaking that \u2013 when you combine those emissions with the carbon that still comes from burning gas \u2013 America\u2019s total contribution to global warming has probably not gone down at all over the last two decades. Far from being a boon, natural gas has been a trap, one that the industry now wants to catch the rest of the globe in. What\u2019s more \u2013 as new research this fall showed \u2013 when you put fracked gas on a boat and send it on a long ocean cruise, so much leaks out that it\u2019s far worse than coal. If the White House had kept granting all the permits that industry wanted, within a decade US natural gas would be producing more greenhouse gas emissions than everything that happens on the continent of Europe. It\u2019s the biggest fossil fuel expansion project on Earth. That\u2019s half the problem with Rice\u2019s argument. The other half is, it\u2019s not coal that Rice\u2019s gas mostly undercuts. We now live on a planet where the cheapest way to produce power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun; there\u2019s no reason not to go straight from coal to renewable energy, with no intermediate stop at gas. The idea that it\u2019s a \u201cbridge fuel\u201d is a decade out of date, but it\u2019s an argument that big oil wants to extend four or five decades into the future, because that\u2019s how long this new infrastructure is supposed to last. If Rice\u2019s arguments were deceptive, the other industry witness was simply sad. Eric Cormier represented the Chamber Southwest Louisiana, where most of this infrastructure is located. It\u2019s his neighbors \u2013 environmental justice crusaders like Roishetta Ozane and James Hiatt \u2013 who have led this fight, pointing out the damage that these installations are doing to the air and water. Cormier, though, said LNG development was necessary because the region had taken such an economic hit from Hurricanes Laura and Delta, which had caused $17bn in damages, damaged 44,000 homes, and dropped the population by about 7%. He\u2019s not wrong about the damage \u2013 Lake Charles, the big city in the region, is arguably the blue tarp capital of the planet. But think about his argument for even a second: the climate crisis is causing such grievous loss along the coast of Louisiana that \u2026 we need to make the climate crisis worse to pay for all the damage. What? If any place on Earth should viscerally feel the urgent need to get off fossil fuels, the disappearing Louisiana coast would be it. But if you\u2019re the Chamber SWLA, short-term profit is the only metric you understand. This brand of greenwashing has been going on for years, of course. But big oil is having an ever-harder time making their argument, especially after a new economic survey published last week showed that continuing to build out the LNG export infrastructure would raise energy costs for Americans by 9 to 14%. And polling shows pretty conclusively that Americans don\u2019t want to frack their country to send cheap gas to China. That won\u2019t stop the industry from shouting. At this point, bypassed by new renewable technology, their only real hope is political gamesmanship. But it\u2019s getting far easier for enlightened leaders to stand up to them. In December, in Dubai, the world signed a pledge to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels. Last month, in Washington, Joe Biden started to show that he meant it. Bill McKibben is the founder of Third Act, which organizes Americans over 60 for progressive action and which worked this fall to persuade the administration to stop granting the LNG permits"

            "date": "2024-02-02T17:09:15Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s hard, from the US, to feel all that confident about the state of our climate policies. The Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 the Biden White House\u2019s trademark legislative achievement, which revolved around green investments \u2013 was a major accomplishment. Still, the US is breaking new records for its production and export of fossil fuels, last year extracting more oil and gas than ever before. Even more worrying is just how tenuous the country\u2019s modest progress on the climate feels in advance of November\u2019s presidential election: Donald Trump continues to lead Joe Biden in just about every poll. However, at the very least, the Biden administration has set a bar for the scale of green investment that centre-left parties should undertake. The same can\u2019t be said of the Labour party, which has reportedly now scrapped its laudable \u00a328bn green spending pledge in favour of some bizarre fealty to its leadership\u2019s own strange idea of fiscal responsibility. So what can Labour learn from the Democratic president\u2019s approach? To his great credit, Biden took seriously the need to win over progressive supporters of his main opponent in the Democratic primary in 2020. Bernie Sanders was an early adopter of the climate movement\u2019s calls for a \u201cgreen new deal\u201d, laying out an expansive $16tn plan to tackle global heating and inequality. Biden\u2019s $3.5tn Build Back Better agenda, produced with Sanders and his supporters in consultative roles, was decidedly not a green new deal. It did, however, reflect that platform\u2019s most valuable components, positing climate action as a job creator and driver of 21st-century economic dynamism. Inherent in that was a willingness to spend lots of money, fast, on the things that matter. Almost as soon as Biden took office, however, climate advocates in the US watched the White House\u2019s already too modest jobs and climate agenda get whittled down to what eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act\u2019s roughly $400bn in new spending on climate and environmental priorities. It\u2019s a shamefully slender programme, given how wealthy the US is, and its outsized historical responsibility for the climate crisis. But it\u2019s also the best we might have hoped for, given the political influence of a fossil fuel industry that\u2019s captured the Republican party virtually wholesale, along with key Democrats such as the West Virginia senator, Joe Manchin. Without the idiosyncrasies that weakened US climate policy, why do some members of the Labour party seem so keen to negotiate against themselves? The party\u2019s \u00a328bn a year green prosperity plan has now been dropped, thanks to the political cowardice of people such as the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who was already distancing herself from the policy in an interview with LBC earlier this week. The Labour veteran and podcast host Ed Balls suggested the problem with the plan was the number attached to it \u2013 urging Starmer and Reeves to \u201cU-turn\u201d away from it, so as to project fiscal responsibility and deflect repeated attacks from the right that Starmer would raise taxes to fund it. The party establishment is clearly spooked by the spectre of rightwing attacks, as Labour\u2019s latest move so clearly shows. If the US can offer any lessons about how to deal with a right wing yammering on about how green policies allegedly hurt \u201cordinary people\u201d while preaching painful austerity, it\u2019s that it won\u2019t give you a lick of credit for giving in to its ideas. Neither, moreover, will voters. The planet is even less forgiving. The costs of the climate crisis far outweigh the costs of acting on it. Under present policies, the climate crisis could cost the UK 3.3% of GDP a year by 2050. By 2100, that jumps to 7.4% of GDP a year; in today\u2019s terms, that would be about \u00a3168bn. Labour needn\u2019t look to the future, though, to make a straightforward case for going big on green spending. The Conservatives\u2019 long-running war on good climate policy has already made life more expensive for working-class Britons. David Cameron\u2019s bid to cut the \u201cgreen crap\u201d entailed doing away with a successful home insulation programme in 2013. And the average household could be paying gas bills of up to \u00a3400 lower if the Tories hadn\u2019t axed the energy price guarantee scheme. While Labour\u2019s green prosperity plan was designed with the Inflation Reduction Act in mind, there was an opportunity for Starmer to improve on it by emphasising the short-term benefits, such as the money households could save from national home insulation projects. Though it\u2019s a hot topic among wonkish types in the US, UK and other parts of Europe, very few people here could tell you what the Inflation Reduction Act actually is. As of last August \u2013 a year on from the act\u2019s passage \u2013 71% of US residents said they knew \u201clittle or nothing\u201d about it. Why is the White House\u2019s high-profile accomplishment so far from most Americans\u2019 minds? For one, the consultancy McKinsey has found that $216bn of the act\u2019s $394bn in climate and energy-related tax credits will flow to corporations. Meanwhile, many benefits, such as incentives for pricey items such as electric vehicles and solar panels, are completely inaccessible to lower-income people and renters, who account for about 36% of US households. Driving investment in low-carbon energy and technologies makes a lot of sense: green industries grew four times faster than the rest of the British economy in 2020-21. But courting private-sector investment in green industries above all else \u2013 a sadly salient critique of the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 threatens to leave voters in the dark about the benefits of climate action to their pockets. An active green industrial strategy should go hand in hand with an expansion of the public goods, services and planning capacities it will need to succeed. Upgrading public transit infrastructure and ensuring an abundant, affordable supply of low-carbon energy will be key to the success of the emerging green industries. More important, though, is that these can be the foundation on which Labour \u2013 should it ever choose to \u2013 builds both a broadly shared green prosperity and its electoral mandate for ever-stronger climate policies. The last few years of climate policymaking in the US point to at least one clear conclusion: Reeves and those who pushed to kill Labour\u2019s green spending pledge are dead wrong. Labour should be sparing no expense on reducing emissions and improving livelihoods; if anything, \u00a328bn a year is much too little. If party top brass can summon even an ounce of political courage they\u2019ll make another U-turn away from disastrous, outdated economic orthodoxy and revive their more ambitious climate plans. Should that happen, the party can make voters acutely aware of the choice before them \u2013 to live a good, green life under Labour, or to let another Tory government take away more of their hard-earned money. Otherwise, the differences between Tory and Labour rule will keep getting harder and harder to spot.

            "date": "2024-02-21T13:38:38Z",
            "content": "Criminal charges were brought against Julian Assange because he named sources and encouraged theft and hacking, not because of politics, lawyers for the US government have claimed at a critical extradition hearing. The WikiLeaks founder could be extradited to the US within days to face prosecution on espionage charges relating to the publication of thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents concerning the Afghanistan and Iraq wars if the high court in London refuses him permission to appeal against his removal from the UK. On Wednesday, lawyers for the US government sought to rebut the arguments made by the WikiLeaks founder\u2019s counsel the day before, when they claimed the US was seeking politically motivated retaliation for his exposure of state criminality, including torture, rendition and extrajudicial killings. Assange is being supported by organisations including Reporters Without Borders and the National Union of Journalists, and his lawyers described his prosecution as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. However, Clair Dobbin KC said the charges against him were not political but were brought because he went \u201cfar beyond the acts of a journalist who was merely gathering information\u201d. She told the court: \u201cHis prosecution is based upon the rule of law and evidence. The appellant\u2019s prosecution might be unprecedented but what he did was unprecedented.\u201d Dobbin said Assange had not merely published material but had conspired with and aided and abetted Chelsea Manning in stealing and disclosing classified information. He is also alleged to have sought to recruit other hackers and leakers of classified information. She said Assange also \u201cknowingly and indiscriminately published to the world the names of individuals who acted as sources of information to the United States\u201d. The lawyer added: \u201cIt is these core facts which distinguish the position of the appellant from the New York Times and other media outlets. \u201cIt is this which forms the objective basis for his prosecution. It is these facts which distinguish him, not his political opinions.\u201d On Tuesday, Mark Summers KC argued that the publication of unredacted cables was inadvertent but that, even if it were deliberate, the public interest could have outweighed the naming of individuals. He also said that that no harm to any of the named individuals had been proven. But Dobbin told the court there were people \u201cwho had to leave their homes, flee their homelands, because they had been identified in the state diplomatic cables\u201d. She said others lost jobs, had assets frozen or \u201cdisappeared\u201d, although their disappearance could not be proved to be as a result of having been named. Dobbin said those affected included individuals in Ethiopia, China, Iran and Syria. \u201cThe material that [Assange] published unredacted attracts no public interest whatsoever,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the weakness at the centre of the appellant\u2019s case.\u201d Responding on Wednesday, Summers said there was overwhelming public interest in the publications that exposed US war crimes and that the sources named were all \u201cagents in the criminality that has been exposed\u201d. Assange\u2019s lawyers said he faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison but a \u201clikely\u201d sentence of 30 to 40 years. Joel Smith, for the US, said that none of the potential sentences would be \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d given Assange\u2019s alleged offending \u201cbeyond the scope that any of the criminal courts in this country have had to grapple with\u201d. Assange is hoping the two judges hearing his case will grant his request for a full appeal hearing. If they do not, he will have exhausted all legal challenges in the UK and his only remaining legal avenue will be to apply to the European court of human rights to order the UK not to extradite him while it considers his case. However, if that application is refused he could be removed from the country by US marshals within days. Assange had been granted permission to attend the two-day hearing but he was said to be too ill to go to the Royal Courts of Justice or to follow the proceedings online. His supporters protested outside the court for a second day. The judges will give their decision at a later date."

            "content": "You excoriate the Labour leadership for \u201ca humiliating rowback\u201d on the green transition (Editorial, 8 February). But hold on! When the \u00a328bn ambition was declared in the autumn of 2021, interest rates on government debt were about 1% but are now 4.5%, with repayments of debt coincidentally increasing by around the same proportion of GDP. Last December, the repayments hit \u00a3119bn. In realistic household terms, since 2021 your mortgage payments have soared, and your family income has stagnated, so don\u2019t plan to buy a big electric car for some years. What the statement by Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves makes clear (Opinion, 8 February) is that they are not going to promise to spend \u00a328bn using power that they don\u2019t yet have and might not get access to because of the dire state of the economy and public finances that they will inherit. That\u2019s not \u201chawkish\u201d, it\u2019s plain honesty. And it\u2019s better than emulating the ostrich or repeating a boosterish Johnsonian pyramid of piffle. You say many traditional Labour voters will \u201cbe left asking what the party is for\u201d. It\u2019s for Great British Energy (\u00a37bn), the National Wealth Fund (\u00a38bn), green steel (\u00a33bn), and a housing and planning programme that can change the scale and strategy of public investment in generating growth, skills and jobs, and combating the climate crisis. That, as you say, \u201ccannot wait\u201d \u2013 but it cannot be fought by glowing, though notional, promises from a party still in powerless opposition. Better to have the truth about what will be done to secure the reality \u2013 not just the \u201chope\u201d \u2013 of a \u201cbetter life\u201d. After years of corroded integrity and economic and social impoverishment, surely that can \u201cinspire a generation\u201d. Neil Kinnock Labour, House of Lords \u2022 You note of Labour\u2019s retreat from its green investment strategy that some will argue that \u201ceconomic credibility is the rock on which everything redistributive rests\u201d. That was the view of Labour first chancellor, Philip Snowden, exactly 100 years ago too. Unfortunately, it led in quite short order not to a mildly more equal society but to the 1931 national government. Keith Flett Tottenham, London \u2022 Investing in a green future can\u2019t be a mere ambition, it has to be a necessity. We have to do everything possible to reduce carbon emissions, but do so in a way that creates a more equal society. This is the essence of a just transition. By training a green army of workers to insulate every house in the country that needs it, we lower emissions, reduce the worrying burden of heating bills and provide good, well-paid jobs to people across the country who need them. Labour simply cannot be allowed to backslide on the commitment to such a just transition. Not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do; it\u2019s also the popular thing to do \u2013 82% of potential Labour voters believe investing in renewable energy should be a priority. The pressure to cave in to the demands of rightwing politicians and the media is a direct consequence of our first-past-the-post voting system. Proportional representation creates a level playing field for ideas such as a just transition to flourish. To decarbonise, we must democratise. Labour has to put climate and equality first \u2013 and that means putting democracy first. Neal Lawson Director, Compass, Clare Short Former secretary of state for international development, Ruth Lister Labour, House of Lords, Carla Denyer Leader, Green party, Caroline Lucas MP Green, Brighton Pavilion, Tim Farron MP Former leader, Liberal Democrats \u2022 As a longstanding member of the Labour party, I am appalled by the apparent decision to abandon abolition of the House of Lords (Remaining Labour policies face \u2018bombproof\u2019 test to finalise manifesto, 9 February). The case for ridding us of this ludicrously bloated, undemocratic, archaic and expensive institution is surely overwhelming. Is it too cynical to suspect that part of the reasoning lies in the hope among those responsible that they too might one day enjoy the luxury of being members?

            "date": "2024-02-23T15:04:13Z",
            "content": "Officials with the justice department and the Biden administration have downplayed a report that US law enforcement spent years looking into allegations that allies of Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, were investigated for taking millions of dollars from drug cartels after the president took office. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who denied the report, also reacted to the New York Times report on Thursday by revealing the contact details of the journalist at its Mexico bureau, Natalie Kitroeff, including her telephone number \u2013 which Mexico\u2019s freedom of information body (INAI) immediately said it would launch an investigation into. \u201cDuring said event, the president made reference to an investigation by the aforementioned international newspaper and read, in front of everyone, the correspondent\u2019s telephone number,\u201d according to an INAI statement. A US justice department spokesperson told the New York Post that \u201cthere is no investigation into President Lopez Obrador\u201d, while the White House national security council spokesman, John Kirby, later echoed the justice department, saying the department has \u201cthe responsibility to review any allegation\u201d. The New York Times report said the US investigation had uncovered information that pointed to potential links between criminal drug cartels and what it called \u201cadvisers and officials close to the president\u201d. The US law enforcement agencies never opened a formal investigation into L\u00f3pez Obrador, widely known as Amlo, the paper said, after concluding that the US government \u201chad little appetite to pursue allegations against the leader of one of America\u2019s top allies\u201d. The Mexico president dismissed the allegations as \u201ccompletely false\u201d. He said news of the inquiry would not \u201cin any way\u201d affect Mexico\u2019s relationship with the US, but added he expected a response from Washington. The New York Times report follows the publication of articles by InSight Crime, ProPublica and Deutsche Welle last month that described another US-led investigation into financial connections during L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s unsuccessful 2006 presidential campaign between the Sinaloa cartel, then led by Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, and a close assistant to L\u00f3pez Obrador. ProPublica said the case raised \u201cdifficult questions about how far the United States should go to confront the official corruption that has been essential to the emergence of Mexican drug traffickers as a global criminal force\u201d. The reports come ahead of June\u2019s national elections in Mexico, in which opposition groups have latched on to signs of cartel-influenced corruption in L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s circle. There has been increasing domestic US pressure on the Biden administration to curb illegal Mexico-US immigration, often controlled by cartel-affiliated smugglers, and the importation of deadly cartel-manufactured fentanyl. According to Reporters Without Borders, 46 journalists have been killed in Mexico during L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration. \u201cMexico remains one of the world\u2019s most dangerous and deadly countries for journalists,\u201d the organization says. \u201cPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, in power since 2018, has not yet carried out the reforms and measures needed to stop the spiral of violence against the press.\u201d After revealing the journalist\u2019s details and reading out a letter from editors for comment on the allegations, L\u00f3pez Obrador dared the Biden administration to support to or deny the existence of the investigations. \u201cThis is interesting because the government of the United States is now going to have to respond,\u201d he said, according to the Hill."

            "title": "Congress \u2018gradually destroying\u2019 US relations with Pacific ally, Marshall Islands president warns",
            "date": "2024-02-28T01:28:33Z",
            "content": "Hilda Heine, the president of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, has warned relations with the US are \u201cgradually being destroyed by party politics\u201d as Congress delays approval of crucial funding for the Pacific nation. US lawmakers have not yet passed funding packages agreed in 2023 with the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), in a move some argue is opening the door to China to build its influence in the Pacific region. \u201cMembers of the Congress have to understand that the funds that the US has agreed to provide \u2026 did not come because of the generosity of the US government and its citizens, but rather because of hard negotiations between the parties,\u201d Heine told the Guardian in emailed comments. The support is part of the Compacts of Free Association (Cofa) agreements which the US has in place with the three nations in the north Pacific. Under Cofa, Washington provides visa-free residential and employment rights, economic assistance and other support to the nations, in return for exclusive military access to large and strategic areas of the Pacific. Asked about the impact of the Cofa funding delay, Heine said: \u201cAt the moment [the US-Marshall Islands relationship] is gradually being destroyed by party politics in the US Congress.\u201d Despite widespread bipartisan support, Cofa is struggling to achieve passage in a deeply divided Congress that is mired in gridlock over funding for Israel, Ukraine, border legislation and the US government\u2019s own operations. Cofa is seen by some in the Pacific as a test of Washington\u2019s commitment to the region. In the Marshall Islands, the delay has affected funding for health, education and other services, while also inflaming concerns that the US doesn\u2019t support it \u2013 something Pacific politicians are sensitive to. The compacts were first completed in the 1980s. Palau and FSM agreed to renew the compacts in mid-2023, while the Marshall Islands struck a deal in October. Under the deal, the US agreed to provide the Marshall Islands with $2.3bn over 20 years. \u201cBoth parties had something to bring to the table, otherwise there would have been no negotiations and no new compact,\u201d Heine said. The president added that at the United Nations, more often than not, Cofa nations have collectively voted with the US. A spokesperson for the US department of interior, office of insular affairs \u2013 which administers the Cofa assistance \u2013 declined to comment. The Cofa funding delay has raised questions about the impact it could have in a strategic region where Washington is competing with Beijing for influence and control. Heine said the Cofa nations are \u201cthe tip of the spear of US defence in the Pacific and are its most reliable ally\u201d. In a letter sent to US House speaker Mike Johnson on 21 February, a group of 48 bipartisan representatives said failure to ratify the compacts would be \u201cthe most self-destructive gift the United States could give to [China].\u201d They said under Cofa, the US secures \u201cvital defence rights in strategically critical areas of the Pacific\u201d as well as basing rights, operational control, and the right to deny military access by a third nation to an area of the western Pacific as large as the continental US. The US-run Ronald Reagan Ballistic missile defence test site is located in Kwajalein Atoll, in the Marshall Islands. The facility is described as a \u201cpremier \u2026 test range for the department of defence\u201d and provides \u201ctests of all missile classes and intercept scenarios as well as space operations\u201d. Heine, along with the leaders of Palau and FSM, have also written to Congress over the delay. In one letter, Palau\u2019s president Surangel Whipps Jr reportedly warned that the delay played into the hands of China and politicians in Palau who wanted to accept Chinese economic inducements to shift diplomatic recognition of Taiwan to Beijing. \u201cEvery day it is not approved plays into the hands of the [Chinese Communist party] and the leaders here,\u201d Whipps wrote. The Marshall Islands and Palau remain on a dwindling roster of twelve countries that have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. In January, Nauru abruptly shifted its alliance from Taipei to Beijing after Taiwanese elections. Cofa\u2019s funding delay does not directly jeopardise the Marshall Islands\u2019 commitment to diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Heine said, describing the relationship as \u201cdynamic\u201d and \u201cone of mutual respect and understanding, rooted in our common belief that democracy is the key to peace and security within and outside our region.\u201d \u201cThe bedrock of our relationship is our shared commitment to democracy and the rule of law,\u201d Heine said. \u201cChina has neither.\u201d Heine noted that US relations with the Marshall Islands go back over 200 years to nineteenth century whaling expeditions and Christian missionaries. She described a \u201cperson to person connection\u201d that has endured the \u201ctrials and turbulence\u201d of wars and 67 US nuclear tests conducted in the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 58. In 2016, Heine made history as the first female president of an independent Pacific Island nation. She later served as a senator in the Nitijela, the Marshall Islands\u2019 parliamentary body, before winning the presidency and a second non-consecutive term in January. Since taking office, she has grappled with food and energy crises and destructive coastal inundation in at least two atolls. The Marshall Islands recently completed a national adaptation plan in preparation for worsening climate change. After Marshallese experienced forced displacement resulting from US nuclear weapons testing, its citizens now face threats from sea level rise and other climate impacts. The delay in Cofa funding comes as the Marshall Islands commemorate Nuclear Remembrance Day on 1 March, marking the 70th anniversary of the Castle Bravo thermonuclear test at Bikini Atoll in 1954. Radioactive fallout from the largest-ever US nuclear weapons detonation caused devastating widespread health impacts. Heine said the needs of the four atolls, which have been recognised as most affected, \u201cas well as the trauma and impacts from the American nuclear weapons testing program are far from being addressed\u201d. Heine said the $700m included in the Cofa package to address the nuclear issue is \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but \u201cdoes not absolve the legacy of pain and suffering.\u201d Jack Niedenthal, a longtime resident of the Marshall Islands and consultant for the people of Bikini, said many people want to see an \u201cacknowledgment and an apology\u201d from the US. Niedenthal said Cofa funding delays impact government services in the Marshall Islands and makes the US \u201cappear as if they don\u2019t care\u201d. \u201cIt is not a good look for the US in this region.\u201d"

            "title": "Trump ranked as worst US president in history, with Biden 14th greatest",
            "date": "2024-02-20T14:37:04Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump finished 45th and rock bottom of a list ranking US presidents by greatness, trailing even \u201chistorically calamitous chief executives\u201d who failed to stop the civil war or botched its aftermath. Worse for the likely Republican nominee this year, his probable opponent, Joe Biden, debuted at No 14. \u201cBiden\u2019s most important achievements may be that he rescued the presidency from Trump, resumed a more traditional style of presidential leadership and is gearing up to keep the office out of his predecessor\u2019s hands this fall,\u201d Justin Vaughn and Brandon Rottinghaus, the political scientists behind the survey, wrote in the Los Angeles Times. Rottinghaus, of the University of Houston, and Vaughn, from Coastal Carolina University, considered responses from 154 scholars, most connected to the American Political Science Association. The aim, the authors said, \u201cwas to create a ranking of presidential greatness that covered all presidents from George Washington to Joe Biden\u201d, in succession to such lists compiled in 2015 and 2018. \u201cTo do this, we asked respondents to rate each president on a scale of 0-100 for their overall greatness, with 0=failure, 50=average, and 100=great. We then averaged the ratings for each president and ranked them from highest average to lowest.\u201d At the top of the chart, there was little change from previous surveys \u2013 the latter of which also saw Trump, then in office, placed last. Abraham Lincoln, who won the civil war and ended slavery, was ranked first, ahead of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who saw the US through the Great Depression and the second world war. Next came George Washington, the first president, who won independence from Britain, then Teddy Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson and Harry Truman. Barack Obama, the first Black president, to whom Biden was vice-president between 2009 and 2017, was seventh, up nine places. Considering drops for Andrew Jackson (ninth in 2015 to 21st now) and Woodrow Wilson (10th to 15th), Rottinghaus and Vaughn noted the impact of campaigns for racial justice. \u201cTheir reputations have consistently suffered in recent years as modern politics lead scholars to assess their early 19th and 20th century presidencies ever more harshly, especially their unacceptable treatment of marginalised people,\u201d the authors wrote. Jackson owned enslaved people and presided over the genocidal displacement of Native Americans. Wilson oversaw victory in the first world war and helped set up the League of Nations, but was an avowed racist who segregated the federal workforce. Other major movers included Ulysses S Grant (17th, up from 26th in 2015), whose administration generated significant corruption but whose attempts to enforce post-civil war Reconstruction in southern states, including fighting the Ku Klux Klan, have helped fuel reconsideration. Grant succeeded Andrew Johnson, Lincoln\u2019s successor and the first president to be impeached. Like Johnson, Lincoln\u2019s predecessor, James Buchanan, who failed to stop the slide to civil war, also sits higher than Trump on Rottinghaus and Vaughn\u2019s list. Trump is a uniquely divisive figure, his legislative record slim, his refusal to accept defeat by Biden leading to a deadly attack on Congress, and his post-presidential career dogged by 91 criminal charges arising from actions in office or on the campaign trail. In the presidential survey, Trump is also ranked behind \u201csuch lowlights as Franklin Pierce, Warren Harding and William Henry Harrison, who died a mere 31 days after taking office,\u201d Rottinghaus and Vaughn wrote. \u201cTrump\u2019s impact goes well beyond his own ranking and Biden\u2019s. Every contemporary Democratic president has moved up in the ranks \u2013 Barack Obama (No 7), Bill Clinton (No 12) and even Jimmy Carter (No 22). \u201cYes, these presidents had great accomplishments such as expanding healthcare access and working to end conflict in the Middle East, and they have two Nobel prizes among them. But given their shortcomings and failures, their rise seems to be less about reassessments of their administrations than it is a bonus for being neither Trump nor a member of his party. \u201cIndeed, every modern Republican president has dropped \u2026 including the transformational Ronald Reagan (No 16) and George HW Bush (No 19), who led the nation\u2019s last decisive military victory\u201d, the Gulf war of 1991. Accounting for Democratic climbs and Republican drops, the authors acknowledged that academics tend to lean left but also said, with a nod to Trump: \u201cWhat these results suggest is not just an added emphasis on a president\u2019s political affiliation, but also the emergence of a president\u2019s fealty to political and institutional norms as a criterion for what makes a president \u2018great\u2019. \u201c\u2026 As for the Americans casting a ballot for the next president [in November], they are in the historically rare position of knowing how both candidates have performed in the job.\u201d Trump has not yet secured the Republican nomination but Biden trails in most polls, prey to public concern that at 81 he is too old for a second term, even though Trump is 77 and equally vulnerable to public gaffes \u2013 never mind his insurrectionist past. Rottinghaus and Vaughn said: \u201cWhether [voters] will consider each president\u2019s commitment to the norms of presidential leadership, and come to rate them as differently as our experts, remains to be seen.\u201d"

            "content": "La Liga\u2019s president, Javier Tebas, says Mason Greenwood\u2019s past does not concern him and that he would like to see the on-loan Getafe forward prolong his career in Spain. Greenwood joined the club on loan from Manchester United last September, seven months after the Crown Prosecution Service announced that criminal proceedings against him over an alleged attempted rape had been dropped. He had previously been suspended by United and would have been due to stand trial last November. Since returning to the pitch he has been well received at his temporary club, scoring five goals in Spain\u2019s top flight, and Tebas is keen for him remain there for the long term. \u201cI\u2019m a lawyer,\u201d he said, speaking at the Financial Times business of football summit. \u201cFor someone that has come out of a legal case innocent, there\u2019s nothing to say. I think it\u2019s good because he\u2019s another great player. Maybe the circumstances have made it easier for him to come, but he\u2019s a great player and I have got no other comments to make. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really well at Getafe as a player and I hope he continues to be successful and continues to stay in Spanish football, because that\u2019s always good for us. When someone isn\u2019t condemned, what should we have done? This is what courts exist for. It is not up to me to know his case in detail. He is just another player.\u201d Asked about an investigation being conducted into Jude Bellingham after the Real Madrid player was alleged to have called Greenwood a \u201crapist\u201d during a match on 1 February, Tebas said: \u201cLa Liga investigated Bellingham and let\u2019s see what happens. It is not the first time we have done a lip-reading investigation and maybe he didn\u2019t say what we think.\u201d Tebas\u2019s answers betrayed a misapprehension that Greenwood had been acquitted by a jury. He was cleared of the charges after the CPS dropped them, saying \u201ca combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction\u201d. When that clarification was made, Tebas responded: \u201cGreenwood was not condemned, so I don\u2019t care.\u201d"

            "date": "2024-02-17T17:45:22Z",
            "content": "Kamala Harris on Saturday criticized Donald Trump\u2019s cajoling of Russia to attack Nato allies of the US who don\u2019t pay their dues, saying the American people would never accept a president who bowed to a dictator. The vice-president\u2019s comments, in a wide-ranging interview on MSNBC\u2019s The Weekend, represent some of the strongest criticism to date of Trump\u2019s apparent allegiance to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The Joe Biden White House has previously called the remarks by the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination \u2013 made last week at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania \u2013 \u201cappalling and unhinged\u201d. \u201cThe idea that the former president of the US would say that he \u2013 quote \u2013 encourages a brutal dictator to invade our allies, and that the United States of America would simply stand by and watch,\u201d Harris said. \u201cNo previous US president, regardless of their party, has bowed down to a Russian dictator before. \u201cWe are seeing an example of something I just believe that the American people would never support, which is a US president, current or former, bowing down with those kinds of words, and apparently an intention of conduct, to a Russian dictator.\u201d Harris, who was interviewed in Germany, where she is attending the Munich Security Conference, also attacked House Republicans who are stalling the Biden administration\u2019s $95bn foreign military aid package. The bill includes money for Ukraine\u2019s defense against the Russian invasion. But it has been disconnected from US border security measures that Republicans insisted they wanted \u2013 then voted down. \u201cWe need to do our part [to support Ukraine], and we have been very clear that Congress must act,\u201d she said. \u201cI think all members of Congress, and all elected leaders, would understand this is a moment where America has the ability to demonstrate through action where we stand on issues like this, which is, do we stand with our friends in the face of extreme brutality or not?\u201d She said she was confident the $95bn Ukraine and Israel package, which passed the Senate on Monday on a 66-33 vote, would also win bipartisan support in the Republican-controlled House. So far, however, Republican speaker Mike Johnson has refused to allow a vote, and the chamber is in recess. \u201cOne point that gives me some level of optimism is we are clear in the knowledge that there is bipartisan support, both in the Senate, which we\u2019ve seen a demonstration of, and the House,\u201d she said. \u201cSo let\u2019s put this to a vote in the House, and I\u2019m certain that it will pass. We are working to that end, and we\u2019re not giving up.\u201d Harris was also questioned about Biden\u2019s increasingly tougher approach to Israel\u2019s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with the president warning this week against an escalation of the military onslaught in Rafah without a safety plan for up to 1.5 million trapped Palestinian civilians. \u201cWe have been clear that we defend Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. However, how it does so matters,\u201d she said. \u201cFar too many Palestinians, innocent Palestinian civilians, have been killed. Israel [needs to take] concrete steps to protect innocent Palestinians.\u201d But she refused to say whether the US would restrict or halt weapons supplies to Israel if Netanyahu ignored Biden\u2019s urging and pressed ahead with operations in Rafah without civilian safety rails. \u201cWe have not made any decision to do that at this point, but I will tell you that I am very concerned that there are as many as 1.5 million people in Rafah who for the most part are people who have been displaced because they fled their homes, thinking they would be in a place of safety,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about where they would go and what they would do.\u201d"
