            "content": "It was the perfect story and Donald Trump pounced. In the final weeks of the 2020 election, officials in Luzerne county in north-east Pennsylvania had discovered nine mail-in ballots in the trash. Several of them were cast in favor of Trump, who had been railing for months that the election was rigged against him. William Barr, then the attorney general, briefed Trump on the matter before it was public and Trump immediately began spinning it. \u201cThey were Trump ballots \u2013 eight ballots in an office yesterday in \u2013 but in a certain state and they were \u2013 they had Trump written on it, and they were thrown in a garbage can. This is what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Trump said at the time. In an unusual move, the justice department quickly announced it was investigating the matter. Months later, it would announce the incident was caused by human error. Several months later there was a new election director in place. But there was also a new problem. When Republicans went to the voting machine in the primaries, a header popped up on their ballot telling them they were voting an \u201cofficial Democratic ballot\u201d. When the midterm elections came around in 2022, there was another new election director . Again, there was a problem. Just after the polls opened, many precincts quickly reported they did not have enough paper to feed the voting machines, prompting delays and forcing some voters to be turned away. All three incidents were caused by unintentional human error, exacerbated by a high level of turnover in the election office of a politically competitive county in a battleground state. (Trump won the county by 14 points in 2020, a five-point drop from his 2016 margin.) Between 2016 and 2019, the median experience for staffers in the office was between 17 and 22 years, according to an analysis by the news outlet Votebeat, which has reported extensively on the election office\u2019s turnover. In 2022, the median level of experience was just 1.5 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a good example of an office that hasn\u2019t been invested in and it shows,\u201d said Jennifer Morrell, the CEO and co-founder of The Elections Group, an election administration consultancy that worked with Luzerne county to improve processes in 2021. \u201cI think there are a lot of other offices like that maybe haven\u2019t had the public problems, but it\u2019s probably because they\u2019re kind of holding things together by a thread. Or more likely by duct tape.\u201d While the turnover in Luzerne county has been exceptionally high, it is emblematic of a larger crisis facing American elections. Experienced election officials, long underresourced and underpaid, are leaving the profession as they face a wave of threats and harassment, seeded by Trump and allies who have spread the myth that US election results can\u2019t be trusted. About 20% of local election officials are projected to be working their first presidential election in 2024, according to an April survey by the Brennan Center for Justice. Nearly 70 election directors or assistant directors in 40 of Pennsylvania\u2019s 67 counties have left since 2020, according to Al Schmidt, the secretary of state. With this exodus comes a massive loss of institutional knowledge. The people who know exactly how to proof a ballot, test election machines, or troubleshoot problems on election day won\u2019t be there. The result is a toxic cycle, where a lack of experience produces human error, fueling distrust in elections and anger, then pushing election officials to leave. \u201cAny wrinkle in an election process is immediately the subject of conspiracy theories,\u201d said Robert Morgan, who served as Luzerne county\u2019s election director for most of 2021 and was in the role when the ballot header issue occurred. \u201cIf you experience that level of turnover, there is a concern that you may not be as experienced, and you may not have handled this, or handled something this large, and yes, that doesn\u2019t help. That doesn\u2019t build confidence.\u201d As the county heads into another election year, it\u2019s under the magnifying glass. Officials know that any error can lead to more distrust and skepticism of elections. The county is now seeking to improve its internal election processes to regain trust of its residents. \u201cThere\u2019s certain things that we can\u2019t control. But what we need to do is make sure that we prepare for everything that we can control,\u201d Romilda Crocamo, the county manager, said. \u201cWe still hear from people who don\u2019t trust the election. And you\u2019re not going to get people\u2019s trust overnight. We\u2019re going to have to have a series of clean elections.\u201d As the justice department investigation found, for example, the ballots Trump seized on in 2020 weren\u2019t discarded because of a nefarious plot to steal the election, but rather because a temporary worker who had been on the job for a few days made a mistake. The worker appeared not to realize they were military ballots, which can arrive in different envelopes than regular mail-in votes and discarded them. The discarded ballots were quickly discovered by Shelby Watchilla, the county\u2019s director of elections. Federal prosecutors and the FBI would later say there was no evidence of criminal intent. Still, the damage was done. After the ballots were disclosed, Walter Griffith, a county councilman, had organized a protest outside the county office and criticized Watchilla as incompetent. She resigned in December, shortly after she filed a defamation lawsuit against Griffith. Public meetings of the election board became more heated in the aftermath of the 2020 election. \u201cThere were no filters for some people. They would immediately assume everybody was incompetent in the process and that sort of stuff because of what had happened in 2020,\u201d said Morgan, who took over in 2021. \u201cAnd you know it\u2019s tough to operate in an environment like that.\u201d Recent election directors in Luzerne county have also been paid $64,500 per year, according to Votebeat, among the lowest salaries in similarly sized counties across the country. \u201cYou\u2019re making $65,000 and you\u2019re going to work and people are publicly abusing you? And you\u2019re receiving threats. That\u2019s not an incentive to get out of bed and get to the office,\u201d Crocamo said. And as distrust built after the discarded ballots in 2020, another error from the election office only further escalated mistrust. When Morgan started his job as the election director in 2021, the elections office was already in the process of proofing the ballot for the upcoming primary. There wasn\u2019t a manual or protocol to follow. \u201cIt was basically an oral history tradition. It was a little frustrating. Because sometimes the stories weren\u2019t told in the order they might have been otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew a lot of things, but I didn\u2019t know anywhere near all the things that needed to go into it. It\u2019s a huge logistical process.\u201d When election day for the primary came around, Morgan made a mistake. When a representative of Dominion programmed the county\u2019s election machines, Morgan didn\u2019t catch that the representative had programmed the first page of all ballots to say it was a Democratic ballot. Polls opened at 7am and by 7.15am the office was swamped with phone calls. \u201cThat was not fun,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe should have caught it. But we didn\u2019t. You never proofread your own work and a lot of times when you proofread you\u2019re looking for the highlights,\u201d he added. \u201cThe problem is in a heightened situation where people don\u2019t feel you\u2019re credible and you make a simple error like that and it just lights the fire for everything everyone thought they were getting cheated by last time.\u201d Morgan resigned that fall to take another job, a decision that he said was unrelated to any harassment he faced. By November of last year, Beth Gilbert McBride, a city councilperson in Wilkes-Barre, was running the elections office. She started as a deputy in July 2022 and took over three months before election day when the elections director stepped down, according to Votebeat. Weeks before election day, the deputy director texted McBride that the county was low on paper but probably would be OK for the election. McBride said she would order more paper. That order never materialized and shortly after polls opened, several precincts reported they were running low on paper. County officials initially delivered extra paper from a warehouse to precincts with a shortage, but then had to take it back when a Dominion representative expressed concern it might not work with the machine. The county ultimately had to make a same-day order for the correct paper. There were immediate accusations that the paper issue was an attempt to suppress the vote in Republican areas of the county. Republicans on the elections board refused to certify the election, causing the county to miss the state\u2019s certification deadline (it ultimately certified after a lawsuit). The accusations went national \u2013 the US House administration committee held a hearing in March of this year focused on the paper shortage that was titled: \u201cGovernment Voter Suppression in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.\u201d Representative Bryan Steil, a Republican from Wisconsin, said that one-third of precincts had been turned away. But an extensive investigation by the district attorney\u2019s office found that wasn\u2019t true: 16 of the county\u2019s 143 polling locations had a paper shortage, and just four election judges reported a stoppage in voting. \u201cThe evidence shows that the failure to provide paper to the polling places was not a deliberate act, but rather a catastrophic oversight,\u201d the district attorney\u2019s report said, noting it was overlooked \u201camid the flurry of activities involved in the newly hired parties managing the election\u201d. The review offered a thorough, public audit of what went wrong in 2022 and how to fix it. That kind of transparency will be required to rebuild trust, said Morrell, the elections consultant. \u201cYou address the mistake, you don\u2019t brush it under the rug. You be transparent about why it happened and then \u2018What can we do to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again?\u2019\u201d she said. Crocamo, the county manager, said there was little doubt the issues the county has faced have had to do with turnover. \u201cWe had individuals who worked in the bureau who were very good, very competent, but who were being abused. They were being verbally abused by board members. Some government representatives. People in the public coming to meetings. Some of them were receiving threats,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there were individuals who worked in the bureau and had institutional memory and they were gone, that was gone as well. All that was gone.\u201d This year, she\u2019s determined not to have the same issues happen again. The county brought in a lawyer with expertise in elections to officially record its election procedures. Crocamo published a calendar of what needs to be done each week and expects an explanation if a deadline isn\u2019t met. And the county is doing extensive outreach for poll workers at high schools and senior centers. The new election director, Eryn Harvey, 28, has experience in the office \u2013 she left in 2022 to run for elected office, but returned. During an interview in mid-November, Crocamo was especially optimistic. Luzerne county had just pulled off largely successful municipal elections \u2013 a hugely complicated endeavor because of the wide variations in local races that can appear on a ballot. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not gonna convince everybody. That\u2019s impossible. There are people out there who want us to fail. But I think we can convince most of the people, most of the voting public, that they can have trust in our elections in Luzerne county,\u201d she said. She took a long pause. \u201cAbsolutely believe it.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-14T02:35:59Z",
            "content": "A decision by the US supreme court to take a case linked to the January 6 attack on the Capitol could have consequences altering the trajectory of the criminal case against Donald Trump over his effort to overturn the 2020 election as well as for hundreds of other people prosecuted for the riot. The nation\u2019s highest court has agreed to consider whether federal prosecutors can charge January 6 riot defendants with a statute that makes it a crime to obstruct an official proceeding of Congress \u2013 a charge also filed against Trump in his 2020 election interference case. The decision by the conservative-dominated court to take up the matter complicates and could delay Trump\u2019s trial in federal district court in Washington, which is currently scheduled for next March. The supreme court\u2019s eventual ruling in Fischer v United States will indicate whether the obstruction charge under section 1512 of title 18 of the US criminal code can be used against Trump, and could undercut the other general conspiracy charges brought against the former president by the special counsel, Jack Smith. The court could also end up by extension invalidating many convictions against rioters involved in the January 6 Capitol attack. The obstruction statute has been the justice department\u2019s primary weapon to hold accountable those involved in the violence of that day. The case involves Joseph Fischer, who was indicted in part on charges that he obstructed the congressional certification of the 2020 election results when he assaulted police officers during the riot. Fischer sought to dismiss part of his indictment, arguing that the obstruction statute passed under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to the Enron scandal, had to do with document or evidence tampering. The US district judge Carl Nichols, who presided in the case, interpreted the statute as requiring prosecutors to show that the defendant took some action with respect to a document or record and did not apply to Fischer as he assaulted police officers at the Capitol. But a split three-judge panel at the US court of appeals for the DC circuit reversed the decision, deciding that obstruction applied more broadly and encompassed impeding any official proceeding. Fischer, and two other January 6 defendants, appealed to the supreme court to resolve the issue. The supreme court may not decide whether the obstruction statute can be applied to the Capitol attack until June, when the next term ends. In the meantime, the viability of that charge \u2013 and potentially that of other general conspiracy charges \u2013 against Trump remains uncertain. It could also give Trump a separate opening to pause proceedings in his 2020 election interference case pending the supreme court\u2019s consideration in Fischer, although he is unlikely to succeed; similar cases typically go to trial and then if certain counts are thrown out, the sentences are adjusted. At issue for Trump is the definition of \u201ccorruptly\u201d in the obstruction statute. The DC circuit has been unable to agree, with Judge Justin Walker interpreting it as \u201cunlawful benefit\u201d, while Judge Greg Katsas interpreted it as \u201can unlawful financial, professional, or exculpatory advantage\u201d. The obstruction statute was never a natural fit for January 6 cases, and defense lawyers have repeatedly argued in trial and appeals courts in Washington that the justice department was using it in an overly broad fashion to target rioters because of the 20-year maximum sentence it carries. The problem for the justice department now is that the supreme court has previously chafed at the use of broad conspiracy arguments by federal prosecutors. In the case of Jeffrey Skilling in the Enron scandal, the court held in a unanimous decision that Skilling had been improperly charged with the \u201chonest services\u201d provision of the statute about a scheme to defraud, because it applied only to accepting bribes and kickbacks. \u201cThe court\u2019s been very clear that over-aggressive theories under general criminal statutes don\u2019t fly,\u201d said the former House general counsel Stanley Brand, whose firm Brand Woodward has also represented January 6 defendants. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson of Skilling and all these other cases.\u201d If the supreme court were to rule in favor of Fischer next year on the basis that the justice department was using charges that were too broad, Brand added, it could undercut the other general conspiracy statutes used in the indictment against Trump, as well."

            "date": "2023-12-27T16:00:09Z",
            "content": "The 60th US presidential election, which will unfold in 2024, will be quite unlike any that has gone before as the US, and the rest of the world, braces for a contest amid fears of eroding democracy and the looming threat of authoritarianism. It will be a fight marked by numerous unwanted firsts as the oldest president in the country\u2019s history is likely to face the first former US president to stand trial on criminal charges. A once aspirational nation will continue its plunge into anxiety and divisions about crime, immigration, race, foreign wars and the cost of living. Democrat Joe Biden, 81, is preparing for the kind of gruelling campaign he was able to avoid during coronavirus lockdowns in 2020. Republican Donald Trump will spend some of his campaign in a courtroom and has vowed authoritarian-style retribution if he wins. For voters it is a time of stark choices, unique spectacles and simmering danger. \u201cIt feels to me as if America is sitting on a powder keg and the fuse has been lit,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, the director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe protective shield that all democracies and social orders rely on \u2013 legitimacy of the governing body, some level of elite responsibility, the willingness of citizens to view their neighbors in a civic way \u2013 is in an advanced stage of decline or collapse. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that the powder keg that America\u2019s sitting on will explode over the course of 2024.\u201d US politics entered a new, turbulent era with Trump\u2019s shocking victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. The businessman and reality TV star, tapping into populist rage against the establishment, was the first president with no prior political or military experience. His chaotic four-year presidency was scarred by the Covid-19 pandemic and ended with a bitter defeat by Biden in a 2020 election that was itself billed as an unprecedented stress test of democracy. Trump never accepted the result and his attempts to overturn it culminated in a deadly riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, and his second impeachment. He has spent three years plotting revenge and describes the 5 November election as \u201cthe final battle\u201d. But he is running for president under the shadow of 91 criminal charges in four jurisdictions, knowing that regaining the White House might be his best hope of avoiding prison \u2013 a calculus that could make him and his supporters more desperate and volatile than ever. Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington, said: \u201cThis is the most astounding election I have ever seen. \u201cWe have never had an election where a likely major party nominee is indicted for major felony charges of the most serious nature; this is not shoplifting. He\u2019s being charged with an attempt to destroy our democracy and subverting our national security. Both in terms of Trump\u2019s personal morality and his incredibly serious crimes, we have never seen anything remotely like this.\u201d First Trump must win the Republican primary against Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley, putting the electoral and legal calendars on a collision course. On 16 January, a day after the Iowa caucuses kick off the Republican nomination process, Trump faces a defamation trial brought by the writer E Jean Carroll, who has already won a $5m judgment against him after a jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. On 4 March, Trump is due in court in Washington in a federal case accusing him of plotting to overturn the 2020 election result. The following day is Super Tuesday, when more than 15 states are scheduled to hold Republican primaries, the biggest delegate haul of the campaign. On 25 March, Trump also faces state charges in New York over hush-money payments to an adult film star, although the judge has acknowledged he may postpone that because of the federal trial. On 5 August, prosecutors have asked to start an election fraud trial in Georgia, less than three weeks after Trump is likely to have been nominated by the Republican national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Trump is hard at work to flip his legal troubles to his political advantage, contending that he is a victim of a Democratic deep state conspiracy. He frequently tells his supporters: \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re not coming after me. They\u2019re coming after you \u2013 and I\u2019m just standing in their way.\u201d His Georgia mugshot has been slapped on T-shirts and other merchandise like a lucrative badge of honor. It seems to be working, at least according to a series of opinion polls that show Trump leading Biden in a hypothetical matchup. A survey in early December for the Wall Street Journal newspaper showed Trump ahead by four points, 47% to 43%. When five potential third-party and independent candidates were included, Trump\u2019s lead over Biden expanded to six points, 37% to 31%. To Democrats, such figures are bewildering. Biden\u2019s defenders point to his record, including the creation of 14m jobs, strong GDP growth and four major legislative victories on coronavirus relief, infrastructure, domestic production of computer chips and the biggest climate action in history. He has also led the western alliance against Russian aggression in Ukraine. Lichtman added: \u201cHe gets credit for nothing. It\u2019s just amazing: I\u2019ve never seen a president do so much and get so little mileage on it. He has more domestic accomplishments than any American president since the 1960s. He\u2019s presided over an amazing economic recovery, a far better economy than was under Donald Trump even before the pandemic in terms of jobs, wages, GDP. Inflation has gone down by two-thirds. \u201cIt was Biden who single-handedly put together the coalition of the west that stopped [Vladimir] Putin from quickly overtaking Ukraine. He seems to get no credit for any of this whatsoever and that\u2019s partly his own fault and the fault of the Democratic party. The Democratic party has been horrible for some time now \u2013 at least 15 years. Republicans are so much better at messaging.\u201d The president\u2019s approval rating has been stubbornly low since around the time of the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021. He is grappling with record numbers of migrants entering the country \u2013 an issue that increasingly aggravates states beyond the US-Mexico border. His refusal to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza is costing him some support among progressives and young people. The latest Democratic messaging salvo \u2013 \u201cBidenomics\u201d \u2013 appears to have been a flop at a moment when many voters blame him for rising prices and a cost-of-living crisis. For all the barrage of positive economic data, Americans are lacking the feelgood factor. Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, said: \u201cPeople feel that Biden overpromised and underdelivered and ultimately what it came down to was he didn\u2019t make me feel good while he did it and he didn\u2019t make it look easy.\u201d Biden still holds a potential ace in the hole. Democrats plan to make abortion central to the 2024 campaign, with opinion polls showing most Americans do not favor strict limits on reproductive rights. The party is hoping threats to those rights will encourage millions of women and independents to vote their way next year. It is also seeking to put measures enshrining access to abortion in state constitutions on as many ballots as possible. The issue has flummoxed Republicans, with some concerned the party has gone too far with state-level restrictions since the supreme court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade ruling last year, ending constitutional protection for abortion. Trump has taken notice and is conspicuously trying to be vague on the issue. The Wall Street Journal poll found Biden leading Trump on abortion and democracy by double digits. But it gave Trump a double-digit lead on the economy, inflation, crime, border security, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and physical and mental fitness for office. Biden still has time to reshape perceptions but even close allies concede that he is not an inspirational speechmaker like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama. How can he turn it around? Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cMy advice would be to be aggressive, go on offence and set the narrative. They must make the contrast between a Biden America and a Trump America and ask people which America do they want to live in. \u201cA year out, most people are not paying attention so the polls are meaningless in that they are not predictive of what will happen in a year. Where they do have value is what the trend line shows, which is that the American people are not getting the messaging clearly enough now, so it\u2019s time to get up off their asses and activate the campaign at level 10 right now.\u201d Setmayer, a senior adviser to the anti-Trump group the Lincoln Project, added: \u201cWhat Donald Trump is telegraphing, what he plans to do to this country, I don\u2019t fully think most Americans understand. \u201cUse the power of incumbency, of the bully pulpit, of their record. Biden is surrounded by people who are experienced campaign veterans and so is he. Use it.\u201d Should Trump prevail, numerous critics have warned that his return would hollow out American democracy and presage a drift towards Hungarian-style authoritarianism. In a recent interview on Fox News, Trump was asked: \u201cYou are promising America tonight, you would never abuse this power as retribution against anybody?\u201d He did not give an outright denial but replied airily: \u201cExcept for day one.\u201d Should Biden serve a second term, he will be 86 when he leaves office. Dean Phillips, 54, a congressman from Minnesota, mounting a Democratic primary challenge, is calling for a new generation of leadership. Some Democrats privately wish that Biden had declared mission accomplished after the 2022 midterm elections and stepped down to make way for younger contenders such as Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer. It now appears too late. Frank Luntz, a prominent consultant and pollster, said: \u201cDemocrats should be apoplectic. Donald Trump has been indicted in felony after felony. The economy is relatively OK and yet Biden is sinking every week and it\u2019s because of something that no soundbite and no messaging can fix: his age. If I were a Democratic strategist, I would have been arrested in front of the White House for begging him to accept four years and move on. You can\u2019t fix age.\u201d Biden\u2019s potential for gaffes was limited during the pandemic election; this time he will be expected to travel far and wide, his every misstep amplified by rightwing media. The social media platform X, formerly Twitter, is now owned by Elon Musk and populated by extremists such as Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones. This has also been dubbed the first \u201cAI election\u201d, with deepfakes threatening to accelerate the spread of disinformation \u2013 a tempting target for foreign interference. It is unfolding in a febrile atmosphere of conspiracy theories, polarisation, gun violence and surging antisemitism and Islamophobia. Political opponents are increasingly framed as mortal enemies. Violence erupted on January 6 and again last year when a man broke into the home of the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and attacked her husband with a hammer. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cIf you have something like the last couple of elections where it\u2019s razor thin, and people who don\u2019t understand the American electoral process see malfeasance and misfeasance where there is none, we have a very non-trivial chance of violence. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even presume that we wouldn\u2019t have an outbreak of sporadic violence before that. The fact is when people see each other as the enemy, and talk about each other as the enemy, people who are mentally unbalanced and have access to firearms will do mentally unbalanced things.\u201d Luntz does not foresee violence. But nor is he optimistic about the future of a nation torn between hope and fear. \u201cWhat I do expect is a fraying no longer at the edges but at the heart of American democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that we are reaching the point of no return. In my conversations with senators and congressmen every day I\u2019m on the Hill \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter which party \u2013 we all agree that it\u2019s not coming, it\u2019s here, and no one knows what to do about it.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-24T15:00:01Z",
            "content": "The US supreme court, stacked with rightwing justices appointed by Donald Trump and facing a crisis of public confidence in its impartiality, has been thrust into the thick of the 2024 presidential election through a number of highly charged and critical cases. Last week\u2019s dynamite ruling from the Colorado supreme court disqualifying Trump from the state\u2019s presidential primary ballot on grounds that he engaged in insurrection on 6 January 2021 is almost certain to end up before the country\u2019s highest court. Trump\u2019s legal team has indicated it will appeal, and the nine supreme court justices will be under pressure to take the case or risk legal confusion spreading as the election year unfolds. In addition to the Colorado ruling, the top court was also asked to step into the legal battle between Trump and the department of justice\u2019s special counsel Jack Smith in the criminal prosecution of the former president over his attempt to subvert the 2020 election. At issue was whether Trump could claim presidential immunity even though he is no longer in the White House. Earlier this month Smith asked the supreme court to expedite a decision to avoid delaying a criminal trial in Washington DC scheduled to begin on 4 March. On Friday the court issued a one-sentence denial, which returns the case back to a Washington DC-based federal appeals court, though it is likely to be only a matter of time before such a fundamental question wends its way back to the highest court for final adjudication. The confluence of two white-knuckle legal tussles, both involving Trump and both having potentially far-reaching implications for the November election, threatens to drag the supreme court to the front and centre of the political fray. It comes at an awkward time for the court, which is already reeling from its own internal ethical scandals and plummeting public approval ratings. The legal scholar Rick Hasen likened the situation in his Election Law Blog to the 2000 election in which the supreme court in Bush v Gore effectively handed the presidency to George Bush. \u201cUnlike 2000, the general political instability in the US makes the situation now much more precarious,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cThe political ramifications of disqualification would be enormous.\u201d To be shoved into the heart of the election battle is likely to be a deeply uncomfortable experience for all the justices, three of whom \u2013 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 were appointed by Trump. The prospect is especially fraught for the chief justice, John Roberts, who is known to be sensitive about public opinion and keen to keep the court above the political ruckus. As the Colorado ruling was announced Mike Sacks, a writer on law and politics, quipped on social media: \u201cDid you all just hear John Roberts scream too because I def did\u201d. Legal pundits agree that the supreme court is almost duty bound to take the Colorado case and hear it expeditiously. David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said \u201cit\u2019s crucial for all Americans that the issue of Trump\u2019s eligibility be resolved as soon as possible. The Republican party needs to know if it has a qualified nominee, election officials need to know who to name on the ballot, and the voters need to know who they can vote for.\u201d Speed is all the more important given that Colorado\u2019s primary is fast approaching. It is scheduled for Super Tuesday, 5 March, when 17 states decide their preferred presidential candidates. The Colorado ruling revolves around section 3 of the 14th amendment of the US constitution, which disqualifies from public office anyone who has \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion\u201d. The decision raises a number of knotty legal issues which the supreme court has never faced before, including the core question of whether Trump acted as an insurrectionist in the buildup to, and on, 6 January 2021 when the US Capitol was stormed by his supporters. The justices will also have to deliberate on whether the 14th amendment can apply to a former president, and whether it requires a previous conviction related to insurrection for it to be invoked. Alternatively, the court might decide to sidestep such questions and avoid hearing the case on its merits, or knock the can down the road, though both those evasive options would leave a dark cloud of legal uncertainty hanging over the election. Either way, there\u2019s likely to be no happy way out for the top court. As Steve Vladeck, a constitutional law scholar at the University of Texas, put it on Substack: \u201cThere are significant chunks of the American populace that will find it very hard to respect a supreme court decision that keeps Trump off the ballot, and there are significant chunks of the American populace that will find it very hard to respect a supreme court decision that keeps Trump on the ballot.\u201d Trust in the court has already been strained to breaking point. The latest opinion poll from Gallup in September showed that only 41% approve of the justices\u2019s job performance, close to a record low. The top court, under its new 6-3 Trump-secured supermajority of rightwing justices, has been embroiled in ethics scandals for much of this year. A series of blockbuster expos\u00e9s by the investigative non-profit newsroom ProPublica has put it on the defensive, forcing the justices to adopt an ethics code last month. In April, ProPublica revealed the lavish international travel and vacations enjoyed by the longest-serving justice, Clarence Thomas, courtesy of a Republican mega-donor from Texas, Harlan Crow. Later, the fellow rightwing justice Samuel Alito was shown to have flown on a private jet owned by the billionaire Paul Singer. Thomas\u2019s ethical woes go further than big money largesse. His wife, Ginni, was exposed by the US House investigation into the January 6 insurrection to have been deeply mired in Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, sending texts to then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows imploring him to keep fighting to block Joe Biden\u2019s victory. A chorus of demands for Thomas to recuse himself from the Colorado case has already begun, even before the court accepts the appeal. Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a non-partisan group which advocates for reform, said that justices are under law required to step aside from cases where their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. \u201cWould any reasonable person believe that Justice Thomas can be impartial here? Well, there\u2019s your answer,\u201d Roth said. The supreme court is likely to have an outsized influence on the 2024 presidential election in other less direct but potentially critical ways, not least in its stance over abortion. The court\u2019s polarising decision to overturn the right to an abortion in June 2022 has had a long-term political impact. Backlash to the ruling led to the Democrats performing more strongly than expected in the midterm elections later that year. More recently, the Democratic governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, won re-election and Democrats gained control of the legislature in Virginia, both on the back of abortion rights. Into this febrile landscape, the supreme court is once again poised to meddle in the choices of American women with a second major abortion case currently on its docket. The justices are likely to rule by the end of June on mifepristone, one of two drugs used in most medication abortions which make up the majority of pregnancy terminations in the US. With a decision likely to fall less than five months from the presidential election, another contentious ruling from the rightwing supermajority could have a dramatic bearing on the outcome of the race for the White House."

            "title": "AfD ally wins mayoral election in east Germany",
            "date": "2023-12-18T13:30:38Z",
            "content": "The far-right populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland had another electoral success at the weekend when its candidate was elected as mayor of a town in east Germany, securing the party its second top municipal position in six months. Tim Lochner, who is not a member of the AfD but ran with the party\u2019s backing, in effect as its representative, secured 38.5% of the vote in the second round of a three-way runoff in the Saxon town of Pirna, near Dresden and close to the Czech border. The 53-year-old independent candidate, a carpenter by trade, was trailed by candidates for the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Germany\u2019s leading opposition force, who secured 31.4%, and the ultra-conservative Free Voters, who took 30.1%. It is the first time the AfD, which is riding high in the polls across the country, has secured the post of Oberb\u00fcrgermeister, similar to the post of lord mayor, designated to towns and cities of a significant size. Pirna has about 40,000 inhabitants. The party\u2019s first mayoral post was won in August in the municipality of Raguhn-Jessnitz, in Saxony-Anhalt. Its first head of a district administration, Robert Sesselmann, was elected in June in the Sonneberg district, in the state of Thuringia. All three posts are in former communist east German states, where the AfD has been most successful, due largely to disgruntlement on issues related to the economy and integration widely perceived as the result of unfair treatment towards the region since unification in 1990. Alice Weidel, a co-chair of the party, which was founded in 2013, called the win a historic result for the AfD. Last week, the Saxon office for the protection of the constitution \u2013 the regional branch of the domestic intelligence agency \u2013 classified the AfD in Saxony as \u201cfirmly rightwing extremist\u201d. The classification had already been given to the AfD in Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt by the respective agencies in those states. Writing on X, the Saxon branch of the Green party said: \u201cWe find the election of a mayor from a party which was classified as rightwing extremist by the office of the protection of the constitution just last week devastating.\u201d Lochner, when asked if he would have a problem entering the town hall as an AfD mayor after this ruling, said he did not view it as an obstacle. Lochner has come in for criticism for his use of the controversial term \u201cBew\u00f6lkerungsaustausch\u201d, or population exchange, also referred to as the \u201cGreat Exchange\u201d, a conspiracy narrative shared in rightwing extremist circles involving a belief that a secret elite is planning to eliminate the white population in the west by gradually swapping it for a non-white population. Asked after his election to comment on his use of the term, Lochner said he had only used it only in his capacity as a \u201cprivate person\u201d. He is a member of the AfD faction in the city council but is not a party member. He stood in the mayoral election in 2017 but lost definitively against the incumbent, independent candidate. The Pirna win sets the AfD up well for state elections in Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, also an eastern state, next September, political analysts said. Each successive win is seen as helping the party to break down barriers with voters who might previously have been cautious about voting for the nationalist, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim party. The party is in good stead to emerge as the strongest party in all three states. The AfD has been riding at a high in national polls, on about 20% in recent weeks and more than 30% in some areas. Voters cite discontentment with the chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition government\u2019s dealings on the economy, migration and the cost of living crisis."

            "date": "2023-12-06T00:01:55Z",
            "content": "On the eve of the deadline to formally register as a candidate for Taiwan\u2019s presidential elections in January, the ruling party\u2019s pick for vice-president held a slick and short press conference at a Taipei convention centre. Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan\u2019s high-profile diplomatic representative to the US, took few questions from the massive crowd of press. She presented herself as an experienced and pragmatic deputy to presidential candidate Lai Ching-te in a Democratic Progressive party (DPP) administration. An administration run by Lai and Hsiao, she said, would continue to defend Taiwan\u2019s democracy from Beijing\u2019s authoritarian threats of annexation and preserve \u201cthe status quo\u201d. Across town it was a very different story. At the historic Grand Hyatt hotel, three opposition candidates gathered for a very public last-ditch attempt to form a coalition and end the prospect of a split vote returning the DPP to power. The candidates \u2013 two former mayors and a tech tycoon \u2013 are united in wanting to see the DPP ousted, but it\u2019s there the shared vision ends. Previous attempts to agree on who might acquiesce to the second spot had already collapsed. But the circus wasn\u2019t over. Instead of engaging in negotiations, the event descended into squabbles; spokespeople arguing with each other in front of the gathered journalists while the candidates themselves lobbed accusations at each other, reading aloud private text messages, and hogging the microphone. In the background a large clock brought in as a prop counted down the hours left before registration closed. Ninety minutes later the farce \u2013 which had been livestreamed in entirety \u2013 ended when half the group walked out. The colourful tech tycoon, Terry Guo, later dropped out of the race, leaving the Kuomintang\u2019s (KMT) Hou You-yi and Ko Wen-je of the self-founded Taiwan\u2019 People\u2019s party (TPP) to fight over non-DPP votes. Taiwanese elections have always been colourful, and often messy. But this year adds another layer with a three-way race, says Australian National University political scientist Wen-ti Sung. Recent polls show the DPP is ahead, but only with around 35% of the vote. The choice for voters boils down to \u201ccontinuity vs change\u201d across domestic and foreign policy issues, he says, but with two similar \u201cchange\u201d candidates. \u201cSplitting the votes isn\u2019t necessary a problem, it\u2019s about how it\u2019s split,\u201d Sung says. \u201cBoth Hou and Ko will try to marginalise the other so as to monopolise most of the \u2018change\u2019 votes for themselves, and turn this back into a de facto two-way race.\u201d The sovereignty question Taiwan\u2019s presidential election, scheduled for 13 January, may be about determining the governance of 24 million people, but it\u2019s also of crucial importance to the world. Across the Taiwan Strait, the Chinese Communist party claims Taiwan as a province of China, and is preparing to \u201creunify\u201d it. Beijing has not renounced using force to do so, but prefers a peaceful transition, ideally with the help of a Taiwan government more amenable than the ruling DPP, which it considers to be a party of separatists. China has sanctioned Hsiao twice, and called the DPP\u2019s ticket \u201cindependence on top of independence\u201d. Outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen is considered a cautious and moderate figure on the pro Taiwan-sovereignty side of politics, but still her leadership has enraged Beijing. The CCP cut communications with her government when she was elected, launched live-fire military drills when she met US speaker Nancy Pelosi in Taipei and successor Kevin McCarthy in the US, and ratcheted up economic coercion, diplomatic isolation, and cognitive warfare. The opposition parties (like the vast majority of Taiwan\u2019s population) are not in favour of unification with China, but the KMT in particular says peace is more likely to be maintained by having closer ties and dialogue. The KMT\u2019s Hou says a vote for him is a vote for peace over war. The DPP candidate, Lai, who has pledged to continue what Tsai started, has framed the election as a choice between \u201cdictatorship and democracy\u201d. Ko claims to offer a largely undefined \u201cmiddle ground\u201d between the \u201coverly alert\u201d DPP and the \u201coverly relaxed\u201d KMT. Ko is the disruptor candidate who rode in on his popularity as mayor of the capital, Taipei, appearing to garner support from a youth demographic weary with the only leaders they really knew in the DPP, but who weren\u2019t keen on the KMT. But observers say his political inconsistency and a series of scandals involving less than progressive views has hurt his standing. Brian Hioe, a Taiwanese political commentator, notes that Ko is now proposing Taiwan revisit a controversial trade pact with China which sparked mass protests in 2014. It marks a stunning backflip. Ko was among those rallying at the protests that spawned the Sunflower Movement and a new generation of politics. \u201cKo\u2019s embrace of pro-sovereignty politics occurred at a moment when it was politically expedient to do so,\u201d Hioe tells the Guardian. \u201cNine years later, Ko may be acting on what he perceives as a shift in Taiwanese politics, in that the weakness of the KMT has created a space for a more moderate, youth-oriented \u2026 party.\u201d Fang-yu Chen, Assistant Professor from the department of political science at Soochow University, says the major parties will soon return to focus on their core issues: the China threat and foreign policy for the DPP, and domestic concerns for the KMT. \u201cKo has always been more uncontrollable and unpredictable, so I don\u2019t know what he will do. What\u2019s certain now is that TPP has to make sure that it\u2019s in second place, and the attacks between KMT and TPP will increase.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-08T04:09:27Z",
            "content": "Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry has said that a Chinese balloon crossed the Taiwan Strait median line on Thursday, about a month before Taiwan\u2019s presidential election. The ministry of national defence (MND) earlier described it as a \u201csurveillance balloon\u201d but the defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng later told reporters at parliament: \u201cour initial understanding is that it was a sounding balloon\u201d. A sounding balloon is a meteorology balloon which carries atmospheric measuring equipment to high altitudes. US officials have previously said large surveillance balloons are produced by the People\u2019s Liberation Army for collecting intelligence. The Guardian has contacted the MND for clarification on what was detected on Thursday. Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, frequently accuses Beijing of seeking to exert military or economic pressure to sway its elections toward outcomes favourable to the Chinese government. The island will hold presidential and parliamentary elections on 13 January. The defence ministry said the balloon was detected shortly before midday on Thursday, 101 nautical miles (187 km) southwest of the northern Taiwanese city of Keelung, and that it travelled eastward for about an hour before disappearing. An accompanying map showed a tracking line beginning near the Chinese coast and crossing the median line, which is an unofficial border splitting the Taiwan Strait. Chinese military aircraft were also detected in Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone in the last 24 hours. A reconnaissance plane and drone, 12 fighter jets and a transport plane were also detected, all reported by the MND as crossing the median line. China has stepped up its military pressure against Taiwan over the past four years, including staging two rounds of major military exercises around the island in the past year and a half, including the firing of missiles over Taiwan. Earlier this year, the defence ministry said a balloon that came down on a remote Taiwanese-held islet close to China\u2019s coast was used for weather monitoring and had no audio-visual recording equipment on board. The MND has not confirmed any other detections. In June BBC Panorama reported photographs taken by Taiwan\u2019s weather service revealed an apparent balloon flying over Taiwan\u2019s capital Taipei in 2021. Other satellite images appeared to show balloons launched from China flying over Japan and off Taiwan\u2019s coast. In February the US shot down what it said was a Chinese surveillance balloon flying in its airspace. The fallout saw the collapse of attempts to repair the US-China relationship, with US secretary of state Antony Blinken cancelling a visit to Beijing. The US later said it had not collected intelligence."

            "date": "2023-12-09T22:21:39Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has nudged ahead of Joe Biden in national polling for the 2024 presidential election, a survey published on Saturday revealed, a day after the US president branded his predecessor as \u201cdespicable\u201d at an event in California. The Wall Street Journal poll shows Biden with the lowest approval rating of his presidency, a finding broadly in line with other recent studies that have sparked concern in Democratic circles less than a year before voters go to the polls. It shows Trump leading Biden by four points, 47% to 43%, the first time this survey has shown that the former US president is favored in a head-to-head test of the likely 2024 White House matchup, the WSJ said. When five potential third-party and independent candidates are included, drawing a combined 17% support, Trump\u2019s lead expands to six points, 37-31. Although Biden has expressed his desire to run for a second term, many in the Democratic party would like to see him stand down, fearing his advancing age \u2013 81 on election day and 86 after eight years in the White House if he wins next year \u2013 will turn off voters. The indictment of the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, in California on Thursday on nine criminal tax charges places additional obstacles in his path to re-election. Meanwhile Trump, despite leading the race for the Republican nomination by almost 50 points, according to RealClearPolitics, is no shoo-in either, largely because of his own multiple legal woes. The candidate who will himself be 78 on polling day remains in peril from four concurrent criminal cases against him, some over his illegal efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. At a fundraiser on Friday night, Biden laid into Trump for his actions on 6 January 2021, the day of the Capitol riot by his supporters trying to prevent Congress certifying the election result. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable. It\u2019s simply despicable,\u201d Biden told an audience including the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and Democratic former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, referring to how Trump stood and watched the unfolding riot on television and did nothing to stop it. He also referenced Trump\u2019s interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity this week in which he was asked whether he would abuse his power if he were elected again. \u201cThe other day he said he would be a dictator only one day. God, only one day! He embraces political violence instead of rejecting it,\u201d Biden said. His speech was themed largely around the threat he said Trump posed to democracy, and avoided mention of the Israel-Gaza war. He told the audience of Democratic party supporters: \u201cYou\u2019re the reason that Donald Trump is a former president, or, he hates when I say it, a defeated president. My guess is that he won\u2019t show up at my next inauguration.\u201d While the WSJ survey will alarm many Democrats, others warn not to read too much into what some observers see as \u201cmad poll disease\u201d, anxiety induced by a belief that a succession of negative polls shows what will happen a year from now instead of providing an opportunity to act, or vote, to prevent it. Similarly, the WSJ notes that while its figures show many Democrats are widely unhappy with Biden now, they might still back him on election day, especially if Trump is the Republican candidate."

On Tuesday, he is expected to go to Capitol Hill to meet with Joe Biden at the White House. Vladimir Putin attended a televised flag-raising ceremony for two nuclear submarines. The Russian president travelled to Severodvinsk to view the vessels, the Krasnoyarsk and Emperor Alexander III, at the Sevmash shipbuilding yard. Russia will hold its presidential election in four annexed regions of Ukraine, Interfax news agency quoted the country\u2019s central election commission as saying. Russian forces have unleashed a major offensive on Avdiivka, with 610 artillery shellings reported near the eastern Ukrainian town over the past day, according to the Ukrainian military. Britain has said it delivered two mine-hunting ships to Ukraine. The mine hunters, originally HMS Grimsby and HMS Shoreham, were renamed Chernihiv and Cherkasy in Glasgow in June, and will help Ukraine to maintain a critical route for merchant shipping travelling across the Black Sea. Russia\u2019s federal security service (FSB) has said that it had cracked a network of Ukrainian agents in Crimea who were involved in attempts to assassinate pro-Russian figures, Reuters reported. The FSB also said that, overall, it had prevented 18 \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d this year in Crimea. Officials have said Russia attacked Kyiv with eight long-range ballistic missiles before dawn on Monday. The strike, at about 4am, marked the first major attack on the Ukrainian capital in recent months using ballistic missiles. A decision to start talks on Ukraine\u2019s EU accession is on a knife-edge after Hungary said it would not bow to mounting pressure to give the green light. Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s threat to veto the launch of negotiations is being taken seriously, with Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister warning of \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for his country if the talks are blocked. The 27 EU leaders are due to meet on Thursday and Friday and one diplomat said the mood in Brussels was increasingly bleak. Orb\u00e1n, the Hungarian prime minister, who boasts about his strong ties to Vladimir Putin, has said he will block the decision on EU enlargement and potentially block continued financial support for Ukraine.

He will continue budget negotiations with the finance minister, Christian Lindner, and the economy minister, Robert Habeck, on Monday evening, Reuters reports. According to the government spokesperson, Wolfgang Buechner, aid for Ukraine was not up for discussion. \u201cNothing will change in this regard,\u201d he said. Reporters from the Associated Press have witnessed some of the destruction in the district of Bortnychi on the south-eastern outskirts of Kyiv. A Russian missile attack on Ukraine\u2019s capital was reported to have earlier destroyed several homes and left more than 100 households without electricity. A home under construction was ripped apart and nearby buildings were partially damaged, with huge holes in the roofs and walls. Victor Demchenko, the owner of the destroyed house, was clearing debris from his property, next to a crater about 16ft deep in the backyard. He said he was in another part of the city when he heard the explosions. \u201cThen the neighbour called \u2026 and said all that is left of the house is a crater,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe him, so I took the car and drove here. Well, you can see it yourself, there is nothing to be found here.\u201d At another home about a mile away, Nadia Matvienko was lucky to escape uninjured when her home was damaged in the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s like I felt something. I couldn\u2019t sleep all night, was turning in my bed back and forth. Then \u2018bang, bang\u2019, we rushed to the hallway. Next thing we heard is the house being torn apart,\u201d she said. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he was grateful to Britain and Norway for launching the new coalition to support his country. Britain said on Monday it would transfer two Royal Navy minehunter ships to the Ukrainian navy, as it sets up a new maritime defence coalition alongside Norway to help strengthen Ukraine\u2019s sea operations. \u201cTogether, we will strengthen the Ukrainian navy, safeguard maritime transportation routes, and secure freedom of navigation,\u201d Zelenskiy wrote on X. Navalny\u2019s spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, said staff at the IK-6 colony in the town of Melekhovo had told his lawyer waiting outside that the opposition leader was no longer among its inmates. Navalny\u2019s lawyers have been unable to contact him since last Tuesday, according to Reuters. The Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been removed from the IK-6 penal colony in the Vladimir region, east of Moscow, and his current whereabouts are not known, his allies have said. Aides of Navalny have been preparing for his possible transfer to a harsher-regime colony. Navalny, 47, is serving more than 30 years in prison after being found guilty of crimes including extremism \u2013 charges his supporters say are politically motivated. Vladimir Putin has travelled to a shipyard to attend the commissioning of new nuclear submarines, the Associated Press reports. The Russian president\u2019s trip to the Sevmash shipyard in Severodvinsk, in Russia\u2019s north-western Archangelsk region, comes three days after he declared his intention to seek another six-year term. Monday\u2019s visit to Sevmash involved Putin raising the navy\u2019s flag on the newly built Emperor Alexander III and the Krasnoyarsk nuclear submarines. The Emperor Alexander III is the seventh Borei-class atomic-powered submarine to enter service. Each is armed with 16 nuclear-tipped Bulava intercontinental ballistic missiles. Putin reportedly announced that three more such submarines are under construction. They are part of Russia\u2019s nuclear triad, which also includes land-based nuclear missiles and nuclear-armed strategic bombers. New Amnesty International research has revealed how the war in Ukraine has affected the education of those living under Russian occupation. Amnesty Ukraine wrote on X: In the words of a regional education official, teachers, students and parents turned into \u201cpartisans digging holes in their gardens to hide laptops and mobile phones or hiding in the attics and old sheds to catch the mobile signal\u201d. A teacher from the occupied Berdiansk community in Zaporizhzhia region told Amnesty how the children are now forced to learn and sing the Russian national anthem. Those refusing are threatened with being taken away from their parents for \u201cre-education in Russian orphanages\u201d. At the same school, a notice, seen by our researchers, was distributed to all students which said: \u201cLook around you. You can see that Ukraine has destroyed Kharkiv, Mariupol and other cities. If you do not want Ukraine to kill you, tell us everything you see and know about it.\u201d You can read the research in full here. Ukraine may need to cede land to Russia in order to end the Russian invasion there, the Republican US senator JD Vance said on Sunday. The comments underscore how a bloc of GOP lawmakers are staunchly opposed to extending US support for Ukraine nearly two years on from when the world rallied around it after Russia\u2019s invasion of its borders. \u201cWhat\u2019s in America\u2019s best interest is to accept Ukraine is going to have to cede some territory to the Russians and we need to bring this war to a close,\u201d Vance, of Ohio, said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cThe idea that Ukraine was going to throw Russia back to the 1991 border was preposterous \u2013 nobody actually believed it.\u201d You can read the full story by my colleague, Sam Levine, here: EU member states have added six people and five entities to their Iran sanctions list, regarding their support for Russia in the war against Ukraine. Those being sanctioned include the company Shakad Sanat Asmari, its chief executive, deputy chief executive and chief scientist, and companies involved in the manufacturing of drones, Reuters reports. Ireland is set to introduce significant reduction in benefits for Ukrainian refugees, the Kyiv Independent reports. The proposed changes would reduce the welfare payments for Ukrainians and offer state-run housing for 90 days, it was reported. After this point, refugees would have to find their own housing. The existing scheme means that Ukrainian refugees can stay in state-provided housing indefinitely. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, met his Latvian counterpart, Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, on Monday where, according to Kuleba, the pair \u201cagreed that opening accession talks with Ukraine serves the best interests of the EU\u201d. Russia will hold its presidential election in four annexed regions of Ukraine, Interfax news agency quoted the country\u2019s central election commission as saying. Russian forces have unleashed a major offensive on Avdiivka, with 610 artillery shellings reported near the eastern Ukrainian town over the past day, according to the Ukrainian military. Britain has said it delivered two mine-hunting ships to Ukraine. The mine hunters, originally HMS Grimsby and HMS Shoreham, were renamed Chernihiv and Cherkasy in Glasgow in June, and will help Ukraine to maintain a critical route for merchant shipping travelling across the Black Sea. Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) has said that it had cracked a network of Ukrainian agents in Crimea who were involved in attempts to assassinate pro-Russian figures, Reuters reported. The FSB said that, overall, it had prevented 18 \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d this year in Crimea. Officials have said Russia attacked Kyiv with eight long-range ballistic missiles before dawn on Monday. Four people were reportedly injured by debris. The strike \u2013 at about 4am \u2013 marked the first major attack on the Ukrainian capital in recent months using ballistic missiles. Russia will hold its presidential election in four annexed regions of Ukraine, Interfax news agency quoted the country\u2019s central election commission as saying. Russia claimed last year to have annexed the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, though it does not control all their territory. Vladimir Putin confirmed last Friday that he will run again for president in the election due in March 2024. A new decree comes into force today giving some Russians five days to hand over their passports. Sky News reports: The Russian decree states authorities can impose a travel ban on conscripts, employees of the Federal Security Service (FSB), convicts, or people who have access to state secrets or \u201cinformation of special importance,\u201d among others. Once notified, people have five days to surrender their documents. The returned passport will be stored by the authorities that issued it, such as the interior ministry or the foreign ministry authorities. Ukraine downed eight Russian missiles targeting the capital, Kyiv, on Monday and another 18 attack drones over the rest of the country, AFP cited the air force as saying. Officials in Kyiv said air defences had downed the missiles at about 4am local time but falling debris over the Darnytskyi district injured four people (see earlier post at 08.26). \u201cMedics provided them with help at the scene,\u201d said the Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, on social media. \u201cAlso, a missile fragment was found on the territory of a warehouse in Darnytskyi district. There was no fire or damage to the building.\u201d The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief has urged the bloc to ramp up its backing for Ukraine, AFP reports. \u201cI hope that European unity will not be broken, because this isn\u2019t the moment to weaken our support to Ukraine,\u201d Josep Borrell said ahead of a meeting of the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers. The EU\u2019s 27 leaders will hold a crunch meeting on Thursday at which Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, is threatening to block billions in aid and delay EU membership talks for Kyiv. Finland\u2019s foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, called Hungary\u2019s position \u201cvery, very deplorable\u201d. \u201cIt is crucial that we keep on aiding Ukraine for as long as it\u2019s needed, and it\u2019s not only for the cause of Ukraine, but also for our own cause,\u201d she said. Some European diplomats think Orb\u00e1n is stalling support for Ukraine to pressure Brussels to release billions of euros of EU support to Budapest frozen over a rule-of-law dispute. Slovak truckers will restart a partial blockade of the country\u2019s sole freight road crossing with Ukraine at 3pm on Monday, a hauliers\u2019 association has said. Slovak and Polish truckers have been demanding restrictions on access by Ukrainian trucking firms to the EU that were removed after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. \u201cEntry to Slovakia will be blocked for truck traffic. Personal traffic will not be restrained in any way,\u201d the UNAS trucking association said. The blockade will be at the Vysne Nemecke/Uzhhorod crossing, it said, according to Reuters. In Poland, truckers have been blocking crossings since 6 November. Hungarian truckers also planned to start a protest on a Hungary-Ukraine border crossing on Monday. The protesters want to end Ukrainian truckers\u2019 permit-free access to the EU, saying Ukrainian drivers are undercutting their prices. Russian forces have unleashed a major offensive on Avdiivka, with 610 artillery shellings reported near the eastern Ukrainian town over the past day, according to the Ukrainian military. \u201cThe enemy launched yesterday massive assault actions with the support of armoured vehicles in Avdiivka and Mariinka directions,\u201d a military spokesperson, Oleksandr Stupun, told Ukrainian TV. \u201cThe fierce battles continue. Our fighters are firmly holding on defences,\u201d Stupun added. Avdiivka is a key Ukrainian strongpoint north-west of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk in the eastern Donbas region. Russia launched a renewed bid to capture the town more than two months ago and Moscow\u2019s forces have been inching forward on the flanks to try to cut supply lines. Only about 1,500 people are left out of its pre-war population of 32,000. Nearly half of American voters think the US is spending too much on aid for Ukraine, a poll has found. The Financial Times reports: The latest FT-Michigan Ross poll found that 48% believed the US was spending \u201ctoo much\u201d in military and financial aid to bolster Kyiv\u2019s war effort against Russia, compared with 27% who said Washington was spending the \u201cright amount\u201d and 11% who said the US was not spending enough. Opposition was particularly pronounced among Republicans, with 65% saying the US was spending too much in Ukraine, compared with roughly half \u2013 52% \u2013 of independents and just a third \u2013 32% \u2013 of Democrats. The findings come as Biden struggles to cajole a sharply divided Congress into approving a sweeping $111bn security spending package that would include about $60bn for Kyiv, as well as funding for Israel and Taiwan. Britain has said it delivered two mine-hunting ships to Ukraine, as Grant Shapps prepares to host a visit from his Norwegian counterpart aimed at bolstering Kyiv\u2019s fragile position in the Black Sea. The summit in London is aimed at building a \u201cmaritime capability coalition\u201d for Ukraine \u2013 but it will not be accompanied by an announcement of how much military aid the UK is prepared to provide Ukraine from April 2024. The mine hunters, originally HMS Grimsby and HMS Shoreham, were renamed Chernihiv and Cherkasy in Glasgow in June, and will help Ukraine to maintain a critical route for merchant shipping travelling across the Black Sea. You can read more from the Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, here: The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said that the most intense frontline fighting over the last week continued to be in Avdiivka, the beleaguered eastern Ukrainian town. In its latest intelligence update, the MoD said: As reflected in official Ukrainian public-release data, on some days approaching 40% of all combat engagements have likely taken place in this small sector. The Russian offensives have continued to be characterised by largely dismounted infantry assaults, often by Storm-Z penal units. Ukrainian units have likely conducted successful local counterattacks, denying Russian forces full control of the village of Stepove. It is here that Russia is attempting one part of a pincer movement to envelop Avdiivka and its heavily defended industrial zone. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said it would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for both Ukraine and the EU if leaders from the bloc do not give his country the green light for membership talks at a summit later this week. \u201cI cannot imagine, I don\u2019t even want to talk about the devastating consequences that will occur shall the (European) Council fail to make this decision,\u201d Kuleba told reporters as he arrived for a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Brussels, according to Reuters. The European Commission recommended in November that formal EU membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova should begin, which its president, Ursula von der Leyen, described as a response to \u201cthe call of history\u201d. The EU has said talks should formally be launched once Kyiv satisfied remaining conditions related to stepping up the fight against corruption, adopting a law on lobbying in line with EU standards and strengthening national minority safeguards. Ukraine\u2019s former president Leonid Kuchma has warned that the US \u201cwill lose face before the entire world\u201d if it abandons Kyiv, and said mistakes by the west contributed to Vladimir Putin\u2019s all-out invasion last year. In his first interview with a western publication since 2015, Kuchma described Putin as a career KGB operative. \u201cIt\u2019s his profession, with everything that implies,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cPeople say his obsession with Ukraine is a kind of mania or mental disorder. Maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d You can read the full story by my colleague, Luke Harding, here: Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) has said that it had cracked a network of Ukrainian agents in Crimea who were involved in attempts to assassinate pro-Russian figures, Reuters reports. It said the targets included the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, and a former pro-Russian member of the Ukrainian parliament, Oleg Tsaryov. Tsaryov survived despite being shot twice in an attack in October in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The FSB said the Ukrainian network had also targeted railway and energy infrastructure on the peninsula. It said it had found caches of arms and explosives, and detained 18 \u201cagents and accomplices of the Ukrainian special services\u201d. It said that, overall, it had prevented 18 \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d this year in Crimea. The FSB is the successor agency to the KGB, which operated throughout the cold war and was once led by Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, for a period in the 1990s. Here are some of the latest images coming from Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital: As we mentioned in the opening summary, the main news so far today is that officials have said Russia attacked Kyiv with eight long-range ballistic missiles before dawn on Monday. Four people were reportedly injured by debris. The strike \u2013 at about 4am \u2013 marked the first major attack on the Ukrainian capital in recent months using ballistic missiles. Four people were injured by shards of shattered glass in the Darnitskyi district in south-eastern Kyiv and needed medical assistance, the national police said in a statement, according to Reuters. Firefighters dispatched to the south-western Holosiivskyi district put out a fire that broke out when part of a missile landed on the roof of a residential building, mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on Telegram. These claims have not been independently verified. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Four people were injured by falling debris after Ukrainian air defences shot down eight ballistic missiles targeting Kyiv in the early hours of Monday, officials have said, in the latest Russian attack on the Ukrainian capital. Four people received medical aid in the Darnitskyi district in the south-eastern part of Kyiv, the capital\u2019s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram while emergency services sent to the south-western district of Holosiivskyi quickly doused a fire sparked when part of a missile fell on the roof of a residential building. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is heading to Washington, days after the Biden administration warned it would run out of money for aid for Ukraine within weeks due to feuding among US senators. Republican senators last week blocked $106bn in emergency aid primarily for Ukraine and Israel after conservatives balked at the exclusion of immigration reforms that they had demanded as part of the package. Here are the latest developments: Zelenskiy\u2019s office said he would arrive in Washington on Monday and that he would meet Biden during a working visit that would include \u201ca series of meetings and discussions\u201d. Zelenskiy has also been invited to address US senators on Tuesday morning in the Capitol, a Senate leadership aide said, while a private meeting between Zelenskiy and US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson will also be held in the Capitol on Tuesday, Johnson\u2019s spokesperson, Raj Shah, said. Zelenskiy attended the swearing-in of Argentina\u2019s new president, Javier Milei, on his first official trip to Latin America where he is attempting to court support among developing nations. Milei welcomed the Ukrainian at the presidential palace after his inauguration. The two men shared an extended hug, exchanged words, and then Milei, who has said he intends to convert to Judaism, presented his Ukrainian counterpart with a menorah as a gift. Zelenskiy said he had had a \u201cfrank\u201d conversation with the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, on the sidelines of the inauguration. \u201cIt was as frank as possible \u2013 and obviously, it was about our European affairs,\u201d Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Orb\u00e1n has threatened to block more EU aid for Ukraine as well as its membership accession talks. Britain said it had delivered two mine-hunting ships to Ukraine. The mine-hunters, originally HMS Grimsby and HMS Shoreham, were renamed Chernihiv and Cherkasy in Glasgow in June, and will help Ukraine to maintain a critical route for merchant shipping travelling across the Black Sea."

            "date": "2023-12-07T11:30:54Z",
            "content": "Good morning. The fourth Republican presidential debate opened and closed with deeply personal clashes as the four candidates on stage pressed their case to be the viable alternative to Donald Trump, the far-and-away frontrunner who again declined to participate. Smouldering rivalries burst into the open early in last night\u2019s debate, with Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, turning on Nikki Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and former UN ambassador with whom he is in an increasingly combative scrap for second place. The entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy jumped into the fray, teaming with DeSantis to attack Haley, accusing her of being captured by corporate interests and \u201cmore fascist\u201d than Joe Biden. \u201cI love all the attention, fellas, thank you for that,\u201d said Haley, whose candidacy has gained momentum in recent weeks. Of the criticism of her corporate donors, she said: \u201cThey\u2019re just jealous.\u201d Where was Trump? The former president, whom Chris Christie, a former governor of New Jersey, derided as a \u201cdictator\u201d and a \u201cbully\u201d who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the guts to show up\u201d to the debate, spent the evening at a fundraiser in Florida. Trump, who faces 91 federal charges in four cases, several of which are related to his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost, has sought to portray himself as the inevitable nominee who does not need to take part in debates. Gaza aid system at \u2018severe risk of collapse\u2019, says UN secretary general Israeli forces and Hamas are fighting house-to-house battles along the length of the Gaza Strip, with devastating consequences for the civilian population amid a complete collapse in humanitarian relief. As the war intensified yesterday, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, invoked a rarely used clause in the UN charter to raise the issue on his own initiative before the security council, warning the conflict \u201cmay aggravate existing threats to international peace and security\u201d. \u201cWe are facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system,\u201d Guterres wrote in a letter to the council. \u201cThe situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region.\u201d He added: \u201cAmid constant bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces, and without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible.\u201d How has Israel responded? Israel\u2019s UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, has reacted angrily, saying the secretary general invoked article 99 to pressure Israel, accusing the UN chief of \u201ca new moral low\u201d and \u201cbias against Israel.\u201d Senate Republicans block funding bill that included aid for Ukraine and Israel The Senate has blocked a supplemental funding bill that included financial aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan as well as provisions aimed at bolstering border security. The vote, which fell mostly along party lines, increases the likelihood that Congress will fail to approve more funding for Ukraine before the end of the year, even as the White House has warned that Kyiv is desperately in need of more aid. The vote was 49 to 51, as every Senate Republican opposed advancing the legislation. Sixty votes were needed to take up the bill. Republicans in both chambers of Congress had demanded stricter border regulations in exchange for their support, and said the bill failed to meet their requirements. The vote came a day after Senate Democrats formally unveiled the $111bn supplemental security bill, reflecting the funding request that Biden issued in October to provide assistance to US allies abroad. What has Biden said about the bill? Before the vote he said: \u201cWho is prepared to walk away from holding Putin accountable for this behaviour? Who among us is really prepared to do that? I\u2019m not prepared to walk away, and I don\u2019t think the American people are either.\u201d In other news \u2026 Abortion providers have experienced a record increase in out-of-state patients since Roe v Wade was overturned last year, according to newly released data from the Guttmacher Institute. The report showed that one in five patients crossed state lines to obtain an abortion in 2023, compared with one in 10 patients in 2020. Three people were killed in a shooting at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus yesterday, according to police officials, who confirmed that the suspect was also dead. A fourth victim was critically wounded in the attack, which took place at approximately 11.45am local time. Profiteering played a significant role in boosting inflation during 2022, according to a report that called for a global corporation tax. Excessive profits were even larger in the US, where many important sections of the economy are dominated by a few powerful companies. Facebook\u2019s parent company has begun introducing end-to-end encryption across Messenger and Facebook, Meta announced today. The company\u2019s vice-president for Messenger, Loredana Crisan, said the encryption was built on the Signal protocol and Meta\u2019s own Labyrinth protocol. Help us raise $1.5m to fund independent journalism in 2024 As we head into 2024, the Guardian\u2019s journalists are already hard at work preparing for one of the most consequential news cycles of our lifetimes. We need your support to raise $1.5m to fund our reporting into areas such as the 2024 election and the potential for another Trump presidency; war in the Middle East; the sweeping implications of artificial intelligence; the climate crisis; and investigations into high-stakes abuses of power. If you value our reporting, please make a year-end gift today. We\u2019re depending on you. Stat of the day: $700m pledged to loss and damage fund at Cop28 covers less than 0.2% needed Wealthy countries most responsible for the climate emergency have so far pledged a combined total of just over $700m (\u00a3556m) to the loss and damage fund \u2013 the equivalent of less than 0.2% of the irreversible economic and non-economic losses developing countries are facing from global heating every year. In a historic move, the loss and damage fund was agreed at the opening plenary of the first day the Cop28 summit in Dubai \u2013 a hard-won victory by developing countries that they hoped would indicate a commitment by the developed, polluting nations to finally provide financial support for some of the destruction already under way. Carbon pricing would raise trillions needed to tackle climate crisis, says IMF Don\u2019t miss this: 20 frugal tips to keep Christmas overspend at bay It may be too late to save for the festive season, but it is still possible to ignore the marketing hype and reduce spending, which will be better for the planet and your pocket. \u201cThere are ways that you can embrace all of the joy, warmth and connection of Christmas without creating a really difficult financial situation for yourself,\u201d says Clare Seal, the author of Five Steps to Financial Wellbeing and creator of the Instagram account @myfrugalyear. One way that Seal does this is by avoiding social media accounts that offer too much temptation. \u201cChristmas used to be about which family had the best lights on their house,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now we can see inside people\u2019s homes on social media and we have got a really distorted perception of how much stuff people are buying because influencers are quite often gifted lots of stuff.\u201d Climate check: \u2018It\u2019s kind of gross but we can do it\u2019 \u2013 how a community learned to go zero waste When Alexandre Garcin dreamed up Zero-Waste Roubaix, it wasn\u2019t sustainability he wanted to tackle, but the litter problem that plagued his city. In the middle of his campaign to become a city councillor, Garcin\u2019s brainwave was simple: rather than cleaning up more and more trash off the city\u2019s streets, why not produce less garbage in the first place? After he had won, Garcin sent out leaflets looking for 100 volunteers to participate in a free, year-long pilot programme that would teach them how to live waste-free \u2013 or, at least with less waste than usual. The benefits, proponents argue, could be huge. Cutting waste could boost biodiversity and improve food systems. One estimate reckons that a comprehensive strategy that includes better material sorting, more recycling and source reduction could reduce waste-sector greenhouse emissions by 84% globally.

            "date": "2023-12-04T05:00:35Z",
            "content": "Soon after news broke that the populist Geert Wilders and his anti-Islam Party for Freedom (PVV) had won the most votes of any party in the Dutch elections, Ahmed Marcouch found himself comforting his distraught eight-year-old. Earlier in the day, a teacher at his son\u2019s school had explained the election results, discussing the wide differences between parties. Now Marcouch\u2019s son was terrified that the family would have to leave the country. \u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d said Marcouch. But for Marcouch, the Moroccan-born mayor of the eastern Dutch city of Arnhem, it was also a worrying sign of just how deeply politics had veered into the personal. \u201cThis is the son of the mayor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s scared that the government \u2013 this party \u2013 will push them out of this society.\u201d Since 2017 the Labour party politician has been at the helm of Arnhem, seeking to bring together nearly 170,000 residents whose nationalities span more than 100 countries. But the election catapulted him into uncharted territory. For the past 10 days, Marcouch, a Muslim who moved to the Netherlands at the age of 10 and who has been directly targeted by Wilders during his political career, has grappled with how best to heal the wounds laid bare by the results. PVV emerged as the most voted-for party in the Gelderland province, home to Arnhem, with more than 20% backing promises that included the rejection of all new asylum claims, the banning of Islamic headscarves from public buildings, deporting dual-national criminals and ending the free movement of EU workers. Eye-catching promises aside, what Marcouch saw in the result was a pushback against traditional parties and institutions by people frustrated with spiralling housing costs and the soaring cost of living. \u201cFor 40 years they\u2019ve heard promises. \u2018Vote for me and your life will become better,\u2019\u201d said Marcouch. \u201cBut they haven\u2019t seen any change in their circumstances.\u201d This reality paved the way for Wilders, he believes. \u201cIn the meantime they see Wilders addressing their anger, their disappointment. They didn\u2019t hear any solutions but he gives words to their fears,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was enough for him to say \u2018I feel your pain.\u2019 It was enough for people to vote for his party.\u201d Marcouch described the result as a wake-up call for politicians, in that it had exposed how the longstanding failure to address these issues had given way to what he called a \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d in the Netherlands. \u201cDutch society is one of the richest in the world. But not every citizen benefits from this wealth.\u201d He pointed to the lack of affordable housing as an example. \u201cWe have a social crisis, like we have a climate crisis or energy crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of immigrants or refugees. It is because of mismanagement of politicians. It is because of political choices. We have to address the anger.\u201d He has begun taking steps to do just that, organising a dialogue days after the election to allow residents to share their views. \u201cFor me right now, it is very important to get people connected, to get people to fight this negative polarisation,\u201d he said. Among those still reeling from the results included many members of the Muslim community. \u201cI really understand the shock of a win by a party that has systemically humiliated Muslims for decades, that wants to ban mosques, the Qur\u2019an and wants to deprive Muslims of their fundamental rights,\u201d he said. In 2017, after news broke that Marcouch was set to become the mayor of Arnhem, Wilders was among those who showed up to the city to protest, describing Marcouch in a statement as \u201cmore suitable to be the mayor of Rabat\u201d than of Arnhem. \u201cHe tried to humiliate me, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d said Marcouch, who responded in 2017 by noting that everybody \u2013 including Wilders \u2013 was welcome in the city. \u201cBut of course, the problem is the signal he sent to all the youngsters with the name Ahmed or Mohamed or Fatima. With that kind of protest, he was saying even if do your best and get to a place where you have the competence to become a mayor, it\u2019s not enough to be accepted,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the tragedy of this kind of speech.\u201d Days after the election, he was again concerned that the election had left some young Muslims feeling alienated from Dutch society. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to pay attention to these youngsters and these members of our community, to support them and tell them that this is the voice of a very little minority. The majority of our society is against this.\u201d While there are likely to be protracted negotiations as Wilders attempts to cobble together enough support to lead the country\u2019s parliament, Marcouch was adamant that the election had offered a crystal-clear outcome when it came to the erosion of trust in democratic institutions. What was needed now was sustained funding in areas such as education, housing and safety, he said. \u201cWe need that kind of investment to earn back the trust of voters and make people see that democracy will also work for them. Because our democracy isn\u2019t working for everyone.\u201d"

Legumen says: \u201cYou know, I\u2019m actually mad keen on Layton and Nikita. On very rare occasions, I\u2019ve met people with whom I really click in a productive way so that we are/were more than the sum of our parts. I really get that vibe from those two. A real energy that\u2019s lifting them both up. Good luck, guys!\u201d styletraveller adds: \u201cEllie must be the biggest favourite for the final. Layton won\u2019t get the public votes and Bobby isn\u2019t as good.\u201d On Bobby Brazier\u2019s dance-off quickstep, bigflatfeet says: \u201cBobby really gave it some welly there. If he does go out, he did himself proud!\u201d Toesturnedin says of the judges\u2019 decision: \u201cThis is tighter than my wallet.\u201d On the eliminated couple, davidargile says: \u201cI do like this dance from Annabel and Johannes. It\u2019s so John Lewis and just perfect. Look at Jojo\u2019s face, he is so proud of her. Beautiful.\u201d Toeturnedin says: \u201cYou know I can\u2019t quite remember there being a more upstanding gentleman on our TV screen as Johannes. To turn and give thanks to Annabel\u2019s family was just so deeply respectful and kind. There are a very few people I\u2019ve watched over the years and thought, \u2018I\u2019d like to shake their hand\u2019. Peter Ustinov was one. Johannes is another. I know that might sound like a load of sentimental hogwash to some but it\u2019s said with sincerity and I don\u2019t care, lol. Amen.\u201d mcculloch29 says: \u201cOh Annabel, one little error. Going on what Craig said, she would have put Bobby out with a perfect dance. Cracking speech from her too, and she held it together beautifully at the end.\u201d joanieloves adds: \u201cThey are winners in my eyes. Such a fantastic journey, amazing partnership and it\u2019s been a pleasure watching them. Can JoJo win next year please?\u201d That gratuitous dog in the festive group number has prompted some superb canine chat below the line. Lovely to see. It\u2019s the ballroom meets Crufts crossover we never knew we needed. Strictly Come Barking, anyone? On musical guests Take That, eiwrite says: \u201cMy signal cut out just as Take That started. Good thing, they\u2019re sounding like Hall and Oates c.1987.\u201d Uglyduc says: \u201cTop of the Pops vibes with Pan\u2019s People! Loved that!\u201d MikeMoonlight says: \u201cAh, it\u2019s the ever diminishing Take That. It\u2019s possible that sometime in the future, the line up of Take That will be reduced to a hologram of Gary Barlow, Howard\u2019s brain floating in a jar and a small pile of children\u2019s clothes where Mark Owen used to be.\u201d IvanTiger says: \u201cBought some of Gary Barlow\u2019s wine. It was loads better than Kylie\u2019s.\u201d Sebnose adds: \u201cReminds me. I must do my tax return\u2026\u201d A rapidfire vox pop of your results show brainthoughts. On that show-opening group dance, Sebnose says: \u201cYes! The lamppost is back! DRINK!\u201d fihema says: \u201cI did enjoy that opening number. Classic \u2018White Christmas\u2019 type mood, dog, Graziano in civvies, and Lauren showing what an amazing dancer she is. Luba dancing with Karen was a nice touch, too. Felt even more festive than my Christmas tree.\u201d MarkRoche adds: \u201cAn absolutely exquisite opening dance, topped by that gorgeous hound. I imagine my bloody lunatic dog causing complete carnage if he was on.\u201d As the only finalist to have survived two dance-offs, Bobby Brazier will be mopping his brow tonight. And, no doubt, his proud dad Jeff\u2019s tears. The youngest celebrity in the contest and a dance novice, he\u2019s been a favourite of the judges, while many viewers have connected with his emotional back story and warmed to his sweet personality. Bobby went up a gear at exactly the right time, delivering two strong semi-final routines. A worthy finalist but it was touch and go there for a minute, especially when the judges were split. There were also nervous flutters for Layton Williams. Last time the public vote was open, after all, he was consigned to the dance-off. Not even two 40s out of his three accumulated dances would have made him feel completely safe, so it\u2019s lovely to see him deservedly make it through. The final will be higher quality and all-round better with Layton in it. What a gorgeous couple they were. \u201cTeam Johannabel\u201d formed probably this year\u2019s most endearing partnership. As she said in her farewell speech, he helped her dance through her grief after losing her husband Mel Coleman, a huge Strictly fan, in May - just weeks after being diagnosed with cancer, leaving her and their three children bereft. Much-loved South African pro Johannes Radebe was the perfect partner. He looked after her, tenderly wiping away her tears and helping bring love back into her broken heart. He steered her perfectly through the contest until they became dark horses for the final. Their close, mutually supportive bond was a delight to witness. He\u2019ll be disappointed to have missed out on his second final in three years (he finished runner-up with John Whaite in 2021) but he wouldn\u2019t have expected to get this far, so will be delighted they did. Johannes has cemented his status as one of Strictly\u2019s most-loved pros. A dream partner for men and women alike. What a total dude. \u201cYou\u2019re what Strictly is all about\u201d has become a hoary old clich\u00e9 but in the case of tennis player-turned-presenter Annabel Croft, it was completely apt. The 57-year-old began the contest as a newly widowed wallflower and blossomed into a swan. Strictly, she said, had given her a new lease of life. Under the wonderful tutelage of Johannes Radebe, she went from scoring a four in week two to notching a perfect 10 two months later. Improving steadily and training hard like a true sporting competitor - remember that adorable footage of her dancing solo in her slippers as she cooked her children\u2019s dinner? - Annabel became a beautiful ballroom dancer and surprised us in Latin at times too. She had exquisite arms, natural elegance and judge Anton Du Beke repeatedly hailed her as having \u201cthe best topline in the contest\u201d. Her highlights were that emotive contemporary Couple\u2019s Choice, her magical American smooth in Blackpool and her Wicked foxtrot in Musicals Week. Johannes described her as \u201ca Ferrari\u201d, which became Annabel\u2019s nickname among her friends. As November turned into December, Annabel was beginning to look like a potential finalist. It felt like the nation was rooting for her. Craig Revel Horwood reminded her that she was the only non-actor in the final five, so did brilliantly well to hold her own among experienced performers. She can count herself unlucky that her semi-final dances, the salsa and the Viennese waltz, lacked wow factor and showmanship compared to the other couples. She found herself getting eights as her rivals clocked up nines and 10s. Public support wasn\u2019t quite enough to lift her off the bottom of the scoreboard and she was always up against in the dance-off - although she did well to run Bobby Brazier so close in the end. Annabel leaves the contest having exceeded all expectations, with a friend for life in Jojo and many admirers nationwide. Bravo and all our best wishes. As the departing duo take one last turn around the ballroom to That\u2019s What Friends Are For by Dionne Warwick, the credits roll and their castmates gather around for damp-eyed hugs. Please stay with us for analysis and reaction. Annabel Croft continues: \u201cIt\u2019s been the most incredible rollercoaster ride.I have had every single emotion you can imagine. I really want to thank Strictly for letting me take part. I see this as a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle and I wish everyone in the public could see what goes on behind the scenes because it\u2019s quite extraordinary, the machinery that makes the show what it is. The most wholesome family entertainment show with so much glitz and glamour. Thank you again, Johannes, for the most special time I have had with you.\u201d Bobby Brazier is in tears too, bless him. His chin wobbling with emotion, Annabel\u2019s pro partner Johannes Radebe returns the compliment: \u201cI would like to say thank you. Thank you for making the decision to come here. Thank you to Strictly Come Dancing for sending her my way. My life is richer with you in it. I hope we dance long after this has ended. You know my heart and I just want to tell you thank you Annabel. Thank you Lily, thank you Amber, thank you Charlie.\u201d Just me or have you got something in your eye? In her exit interview, Annabel Croft tells Tess: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s been the most life-changing and magical experience of my life. Johannes, you have been absolutely extraordinary. You have given me a reason to get out of bed and come and dance with you, distract me and to heal me. I can\u2019t thank you enough for that. You have been so patient, so caring and so loving. You are an unbelievably special human being. I simply adore you. Thank you so much.\u201d Lovely words, well said. So it\u2019s sad but official. Annabel becomes this year\u2019s 12th celebrity to depart the dancefloor. Which means Bobby and Dianne are our third finalists. Bobby and Dianne, saying \u201cBoth couples lifted their performance but again, one tiny mistake coming out of a pivot turn\u201d. For the first time this series - they certainly saved up the tension for the last results show - head judge Shirley has the deciding vote. Drama! Bobby and Dianne, saying \u201c It was a very close run thing but because coming out of a pivoting section wasn\u2019t as clean as I would have liked\u201d. Two-one to Bobby. Tense. Bobby and Dianne, saying \u201cThis was a really tough one and I stood there for a few seconds making my decision but one dance had a slight hesitation at a turn\u201d. So it\u2019s one-all so far. Ooh. Annabel and Johannes, saying \u201cOne dance was flashy, one dance was quiet but both couples have equalised completely. I saw improvement in one couple who I think had the most exquisite technique\u201d. It\u2019s not a five-point difference but Bobby just shaded that for me, especially on the razzle-dazzle scale. However, let\u2019s hear from the famous foursome who will decide on our last finalist. Annabel Croft and her dance partner Johannes Radebe have another go at Viennese Waltz to Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want by Slow Moving Millie. The judges said last night it was \u201cthoroughly beautiful, gentle and serene, vulnerable in a way that shows strength, with lovely natural turns and dreamy pivots\u201d. They awarded it 33 points - a little undermarked to my mind but five points fewer than Bobby\u2019s quickstep. Can Annabel raise the quality and close the gap? First up, Bobby Brazier and his pro partner Dianne Buswell reprise their quickstep to Mack the Knife by Bobby Darin. It opened the show last night and the judges said it \u201cswept across the floor beautifully with smooth transitions\u201d. Shirley stripped Anton of his King Of Ballroom title and bestowed it on Bobby. He scored a personal best of 38 points, five more than Angela\u2019s Viennese, so he just needs to maintain that level and avoid dance dis-ah-sters. Up in the Clauditorium, a jubilant Layton professes to be shookTM. It\u2019s Nikita\u2019s first time in the final and with an airpunch, he says it\u2019s a dream come true. Layton is grateful for their friendship and says he feels like he\u2019s found a brother. Aww. Well done them. For all the griping and sniping about his prior dance experience, he fully deserves it. Layton Williams and Nikita Kuzmin are the highest scorers in the contest and have topped the leaderboard in seven weeks out of 12. After the frankly vile trolling Layton\u2019s been subjected to, I hope he takes comfort from knowing that justice has been done. I suppose that\u2019s no big surprise, as she was bottom of the scoreboard by some distance - nine points across three dances. Viewer votes haven\u2019t come to her rescue, meaning Annabel will dance for survival against Bobby. And it\u2019s the highest stakes dance-off of the lot. No pressure, babes. That pesky crimson spotlight is back to reveal who\u2019ll face Bobby in the dreaded dance-off. Claudia tees up a montage of judgely highlights. Props! Hair! Critiques! Tens! Nines from Craig, obv! The judges pick their standout moments of the series. Craig opts for Angela Rippon\u2019s levitating leg. Shirley goes for Krishnan Guru-Murthy\u2019s cha cha cha. Motsi picks her sparky exchanges with Craig. Anton goes for the return to Blackpool and Angela Scanlon\u2019s Argentine tango. Motsi Mabuse looking particularly fabulous. Also wearing a silver chain necklace so big, you could lock your bike up with it. For the last time this year, the judges perch on Claudia\u2019s banquette of badinage for a closer look at last night\u2019s routines. And a brief Tina Turner karaoke singalong. Not sure about Mark\u2019s moustache. A bit Joe Exotic stroke 1970s school caretaker. Mark Owen and Howard Donald venture into the audience. A rare chance to see Anton dad-dancing. A musical interlude now from Take That, performing new single This Life. Nothing to do with the seminal 90s lawyer houseshare drama, sadly. Lauren Oakley, Luba Mushtuk, Karen Hauer and Michelle Tsiakkas provide the twinkle-toed accompaniment. Which is all very nice but I\u2019d love to have seen Miles and Anna, Egg and Milly, or Warren and Ferdy on the dancefloor. This song is the title track from their chart-topping new album and the follow-up to previous single Windows. Nothing to do with the seminal Microsoft operating system. In the Clauditorium, Ellie and Vito are sweetly delighted and slightly shell-shocked to be finalist. Vito is tearful and \u201cunder the moon\u201d. Ellie explains how Strictly has been life-changing for her, boosted her confidence and she\u2019s learned a lot about herself. She thanks Vito. He hugs her and for once is lost for words. Bobby Brazier and Dianne Buswell must perform again for their place in the final. He survived the dance-off three weeks ago against Angela Rippon. Can he do it again? They\u2019ll be dancing their show-opening, 38-point quickstep. Ellie Leach and her dance partner Vito Coppola are going all the way. They\u2019re the most consistent couple in the contest, the second highest scorers and bookies\u2019 favourites for the title, so the right result. The scarlet spotlight is having one last hurrah. It\u2019s time to find out who\u2019s a Strictly finalist and who must dance again for their spot. Last night\u2019s highlights are rewound on-screen. Bobby\u2019s jazzy quickstep! Layton\u2019s wafty rumba! Annabel\u2019s spicy salsa! Ellie\u2019s cheeky cha cha! Bobby\u2019s powerful paso! Layton\u2019s wow-inducing Charleston! Annabel\u2019s elegant Viennese! Ellie\u2019s poptastic but mildly disappointing Couple\u2019s Choice! That\u2019s enough exclamation marks! Or is it?! Yes it is! Here are our co-hosts, so time for the regular stylistic smackdown. Both in white. Tess Daly is in a wrap top. Claudia Winkleman in white tuxedo with black-trimmed shirt beneath. Claudia wins. And a lovely waggy labrador. The dream. Snow falls. Or is it Anton\u2019s dandruff? As usual, we kick off with a group number from the Strictly professionals and this one\u2019s a Christmassy romance, set to When I Fall In Love by Nat King Cole. Love is in the air as Lauren Oakley decorates her Christmas tree but it\u2019s bittersweet because she\u2019s alone. She sees couples in the park, meets mystery man Graziano Di Prima, closes her eyes, dances with him and falls in love. It\u2019s American smooth in style with swooning lifts. A real couple\u2019s number with dreamy partnering all over the floor. A romcom-style routine, full of winter magic. Feeling seasonally soppy yet? Cue ba-ba-daa theme tune and roll clap-along credits. This is the penultimate time we\u2019ll see these sort-of-famous faces, familiar moves and cheesy grins this year. Sob. Turn on the tree lights, crack open the Quality Street early and take your sofa seats. We\u2019re about to go back to the Elstree Studios ballroom\u2026 Because they performed two routines apiece last night, the dance-off pairs can choose their favourite to reprise for the eliminator. It should be a fairly easy decision for Bobby and Layton, who scored three and four more points respectively for one dance than the other. For Ellie and Annabel, there was only one point in it, so it might be a tougher call. Just five minutes until sequin-spangled clapperboard comes down\u2026 Concluding episode of Planet Earth III just drawing to a close on BBC1 right now. This one is dedicated to the conservation heroes fighting to save the world\u2019s wildlife. Good luck, Sir David Attenborough, the scores are in. And it\u2019s four 10s. Just 10 minutes until we go from frogs to foxtrots, from rhinos to rumbas\u2026 For the second week running, Layton Williams tempted Craig Revel Horwood\u2019s 10 paddle out from hibernation and notched a perfect score for his blockbusting Singin\u2019 In The Rain routine - hailed as the best Charleston ever seen on Strictly. With last week\u2019s 40-point paso doble carried over and his rumba notching all the nines, it meant an impressive accumulated score of 116 points out of 120. Surely that\u2019s finalist form? It\u2019s 15 minutes until the glitterball starts spinning again\u2026 Another missive last night from Iain in Montreal, who wrote: \u201cYou\u2019ve got \u2018Claudia deliberately prompts one of Vito\u2019s epic rambles about animals or obscure steps\u2019 on your Strictly semi-final bingo card. Sadly, these are not in the clips that the BBC posts online for viewing outside the UK. I\u2019ve seen clips from It Takes Two that give me an idea what an epic Vito ramble might be like. They seem quite endearing. I\u2019m sorry to be missing them. \u201cOn the other hand, I\u2019m quite on board with \u2018Anton making noises instead of commenting staying on the cutting-room floor.\u201d Us too, Iain, us too. Just 15 minutes to wait now Tonight\u2019s musical guests are five-piece boyband turned three-piece manband Take That. Wonder if there\u2019ll be jelly and bare bottoms involved, like the infamous Do What You Like video? On that enduring image, it\u2019s 25 minutes until showtime\u2026 They\u2019re the bottom two on the four-couple scoreboard, sp Annabel Croft and Bobby Brazier will be praying for salvation in the public vote. Ellie Leach in the dance-off would be a major shock, while Layton Williams surely merits a final spot after that show-stopping Charleston, which means he\u2019s now scored the only two perfect 40s of the series. But could we see one last dance-off shocker? It\u2019s half an hour until sequin o\u2019clock\u2026 It\u2019s the last results show of the series and nobody wants to miss out on the big finale. Sadly someone has to. It\u2019s a cruel world, this ballroom and Latin lark. Good evening and welcome to the week 12 results show of Strictly Come Dancing 2023. I\u2019m Michael, your virtual dance partner. Please watch along with me as we find out who\u2019s waltzing through to the fil and who\u2019s doomed to ace the dreaded dance-off. Last night, our four surviving pro-celebrity pairs tackled two full routines for the first time in their bid to make it to the showpiece final. Their scores from last week\u2019s non-elimination weekend were also carried over. Layton Williams topped the standings after notching another perfect 40, with Ellie Leach just behind. Bobby Brazier was third and Annabel Croft was left propping up the rest,. But will voting viewers agree? It\u2019s showtime at 7.20pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 6.50pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and mild-to-medium snark. So snuggle down on this rainy Sunday night and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me at michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for glitter-dusted chat. I\u2019ll samba-bounce down there whenever possible to see what you\u2019re saying and report it up top. It\u2019s the most important results show of the series and someone\u2019s heart is about to be broken. Nearly time to staaaaaart dancing into the final! That concludes Saturday\u2019s liveblog but please feel free to continue the ballroom badinage in the comments section. Meet you back here tomorrow for this year\u2019s last results show. Where did the time go, my brilliant friends? It airs at 7.20pm Sunday on BBC1, with musical guests Take That. Scream! I\u2019ll reboot the blog at 6.50pm for build-up, so please rejoin me then. In the meantime, I\u2019m @michaelhogan on Twitter, so feel free to say hi. Thanks for watching along with me. Hopefully see you tomorrow but in the meantime, as if you need telling: keeeep dancing! Take care. TV viewers can now flip to Cher Meets Rylan on BBC2, The Great White Christmas of \u201981 on Channel 5, Hidden Assets on BBC4 or Bad Host: Hunting the Couchsurfing Predator on Sky Documentaries. Film-wise, tonight\u2019s picks are Traffic (9.40pm on Dave), The Warriors (9.55pm on MTV) or Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary (10.25pm on Channel 5). And a bonus radio tip for Sunday morning. At 11.15am on Radio 4 tomorrow, Lauren Laverne\u2019s castaway on Desert Island Discs is no less than Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas. Tune in for dance chat, festive reflections and showtunes. What did we think of the semi-final overall? Lots of high-standard dancing, especially from Layton Williams. High emotion as well. Bobby Brazier seemed to be peaking at the right time, while Annabel Croft\u2019s race looked run. But as always, the public vote could change all that. It promises to be a fascinating results show tomorrow. And finally, some of your comments on Ellie Leach. IvanTiger says: \u201cWell executed but more exercise class than dancing. What a waste of Ellie\u2019s talents.\u201d Lidoswimmer says: \u201cStrangely, that was the least entertaining of Ellie\u2019s dances for me, felt a bit sixth form show. Still voting for her for the win though.\u201d VelvetinaB says: \u201cVery dramatic and pretty polished by Ellie (great synchronicity), but I never like these Couple\u2019s Choices as much as the other dances. She\u2019s still my favourite and I love how her confidence has grown.\u201d Strictlylounging adds: \u201cDon\u2019t hate me but I kind of expected more from that CC. Felt like a lot of posing in various shapes to me. Great lift though!\u201d On Annabel Croft, Rufusonly says: \u201cAnnabel played second fiddle to Johannes for the opening of that samba and there was some lack of bounce but really this is the essence of Strictly. She\u2019s such a beautiful woman in all respects. And by the way, Anton too often lapses into the incomprehensible buffoon. Owbeck says: \u201cFelt Annabel didn\u2019t quite let go in that samba. She seemed very nervous too. She\u2019s gonna need some votes and then some more. Think she might just pip Bobby due to being \u2018what this show is about\u2019.\u201d defontherocks says: \u201cSplits! Come on, judges. You loved them when Angela Rippon did them.\u201d SparklingDormouse adds: \u201cLovely movement from Annabel. Enjoyable &amp; calm &amp; classy. Hideous asymmetrical dress &amp; distracting sleeve. Surprised Tess hasn\u2019t nicked it off her!\u201d Some thoughts from readers on Layton Williams. Rufusonly says: \u201cLayton\u2019s opening dance was a definite rumba and not a showdance. He might have lacked hip action but the balance of the dance was extraordinary. They looked a couple here and Layton was in the moment\u2026 I\u2019m warming to Layton. I look forward to his routines. I\u2019ve never seen a dance as good as that Charleston in any year of Strictly. It was astonishing. It\u2019s not a standard someone just setting out in the competition could ever attain. He\u2019s a special dancer, one of the country\u2019s best. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll win but he\u2019ll make the final special.\u201d Lidoswimmer says: \u201cMaybe the rumba should be retired from Strictly, it tends to be a bit \u2018meh\u2019 - think the Charleston will be more up Layton\u2019s street.\u201d fihema adds: \u201cWell that was a whole lot of fun. For once a different register for Layton and it really showed he CAN dance. Not just do show dances. Brilliant fun. Made me smile.\u201d Here\u2019s a round-up of your comments. On Bobby Brazier, YodaknowsAll says: \u201cBobby, that quickstep was quite frankly brilliant. Light, bright and gorgeous.\u201d Fleur01 says \u201cDianne\u2019s frock is fab. Ten from me.\u201d Wordiplyer says: \u201cDianne is brilliant when it comes to partnering the quickstep. She and Joe did a fantastic one to \u2018Dancing Fool\u2019 a couple of years ago in Blackpool. He got one of his best scores for that also.\u201d EastofStratford says: \u201cEvening all. Enjoying tonight\u2019s show. I particularly liked the way Bobbie used the \u201csmell under the nose\u201d acting technique of Joey from Friends, very effective.\u201d Rufusonly says: \u201cBobby\u2019s just danced himself into the final. The contrast with his previous dance was marked. If it\u2019s about the journey then Bobby has served his apprenticeship. He deserves that final spot. Owbeck says: \u201cWell, Bobby is pulling out all the stops, that\u2019s for sure. I might have been premature in heralding his demise Pancake01 adds: \u201cOoh I liked that from Bobby. I thought he could have been sharper in places, but I loved his outfit, his confidence and good capeology. Well done!\u201d Annabel Croft seems to have reached her limit and will be expecting that dreaded red light of doom tomorrow but who could she face? One of the boys, I expect. Bobby Brazier or (unjustly) Layton Williams. It\u2019s the penultimate round of envelope-opening this series. Here are this week\u2019s gong-getters\u2026 Best dance: Layton\u2019s Charleston by some distance. Silver medal to Bobby\u2019s quickstep. Worst dance: Annabel\u2019s salsa, I\u2019m afraid. Best music choice: Mack The Knife worked perfectly for Bobby\u2019s quickstep. Sometimes the old\u2019uns are the best. Worst music choice: Run Boy Run by Woodkid for Bobby\u2019s paso. Too ubiquitous. Layton\u2019s Rihanna rumba was a little dull too. Best outfit: Dianne\u2019s green velvet quickstep frock. Worst outfit: Annabel\u2019s yellow salsa frock was a crime against fashion. I didn\u2019t love Layton\u2019s wafty school uniform for his rumba either. Best judges\u2019 comment: Shirley stripping Anton of his King Of Ballroom title. Anton\u2019s \u201cfluffer\u201d faux-pas to Ellie was awkz. Worst VT: The messages from friends and family got a tad repetitive and felt like they should\u2019ve been saved for the final. Best Claudia quip: Her scene-setting for Vernon\u2019s handover to Tess and the usual Vito ramble-prompting. As Tess and Claud get in their traditional clinch and tell us to \u201cKeeeeeep dancing!\u201d, please stay with us for analysis, reaction and a round-up of your comments. The public vote is announced and the now traditional chaotic prop-fest erupts in the ballroom. A recap of tonight\u2019s eight routines on-screen now. Remember that last week\u2019s scores have been carried over and added to this week\u2019s two dances. Here\u2019s how they stand: Layton and Nikita - 40 + 36 + 40 = 116 points Ellie and Vito - 36 + 37 + 38 = 111 points Bobby and Dianne - 34 + 38 + 35 = 107 points Annabel and Johannes - 33 + 32 + 33 = 98 points Judges\u2019 scores: 9, 9, 10, 10 for a total of 38 points. Second on the combined leaderboard behind Layton. Judges\u2019 comments for Ellie and Vito: Motsi says \u201cyou\u2019ve gone from girl to woman, you owned it and you own yourself, transition went sideways but brilliant\u201d. Shirley says \u201cit\u2019s hard to keep up with Vito but you did just that, you\u2019re a worthy finalist\u201d. Anton says \u201cwham, quite the finish, you\u2019ve become a versatile dancer, clean timing, execution and commitment right on point, I\u2019m a huge fan\u201d. Craig concludes \u201csome timing discrepancies in the side-by-side but we\u2019ve seen a different side to you, feisty, grounded, fantastic shapes, amazing\u201d. Nines and maybe a 10 or two? They\u2019re the last pair this series to do a Couple\u2019s Choice. Ellie\u2019s a big Dua Lipa fan so is relishing this medley of contemporary bangers. She\u2019s looking like a pop star herself in a red sparkly catsuit. Canes and a chair prop. Fast, slick, sassy and fun with so much going on. Commercial style and a full-on performance. Floor work and changes of gear. Spectacular spinning lift that\u2019s more Dancing On Ice than Strictly. Wow. Song: Dua Lipa Medley. This mash-up of hits by the English-Albanian disco-pop diva includes Blow Your Mind (Mwah), Physical and Levitating. Fun Dua Lipa facts: despite being a Londoner, she\u2019s a Liverpool FC fan and has embraced the nickname \u201cDula Peep\u201d after a US talkshow host mispronounced her name five years ago. Johannes gets adorably emotional and calls Annabel \u201ca beautiful swan\u2019, paying tribute to her resilience and tells her \u201cyou have won my heart\u201d. No, you\u2019re crying. Tess is emosh too. Jojo is our king. Judges\u2019 scores: 8 (boo!), 8, 8, 9 for a total of 33 points. Bottom of the combined leaderboard. I fear she\u2019s reached her ceiling. Judges\u2019 comments for Annabel and Jojo: Craig says \u201cthoroughly beautiful, you came out and fought, amazing\u201d. Motsi says \u201cgentle, vulnerable in a way that shows strength, I connect with you, be proud of yourself\u201d. Shirley says \u201cyou went into the zone like a true competitor, loved your natural turns and fleckerl, serene and lovely\u201d. Anton concludes \u201cI wish I was doing it wit you, gorgeous line and pivots, dreamy mood\u201d. Nines all round? Annabel is back in Jojo\u2019s arms, where she feels safe. After last week\u2019s wobble in her normally reliable topline, she needs to get her posture and frame back. Drive forward with her heel but not tense up in shoulders. She\u2019s in a feathered pale pink frock. Gorgeous mood. Soft and fluid, moving as one across the floor. Fast spins and pivots. Grace and poise. Confetti falls to finish.. Just lovely but I fear Annabel is the weakest dancer tonight, not done any favours by her two dance styles lacking wow factor. Song: Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want by Slow Moving Millie. The Smiths\u2019 1984 song appeared on the Pretty In Pink soundtrack and has also been covered by Dream Academy. This version soundtracked the John Lewis ad for Christmas 2011 - the one called \u201cThe Long Wait\u201d where the little boy impatiently counts down the days to Christmas but not to open his own gifts - so he can give his parents a present. Aww/bleurgh (delete according to schmaltz tolerance levels). Lump-in-throat moment as Nikita pays tribute to Layton. They have a truly lovely bond. Judges\u2019 scores: 10, 10, 10, 10 for a total of 40 points. For the second week running. He can\u2019t be overtaken on the combined leaderboard. Judges\u2019 comments for Layton and Nikita: Anton says \u201cwow, the best thing you\u2019ve ever done\u201d. Craig gives a standing ovation and says \u201cbest Charleston I\u2019ve seen in 20 years, darling\u201d. Motsi says \u201cyou\u2019re at an unsurpassed level\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cdancer extraordinaire, I\u2019m in the company of dance royalty\u201d. I suspect we\u2019re about to see our second perfect 40 of the series. \u201cCharleston is going to be Layton\u2019s thing,\u201d predicted Craig last week. I suspect so too but let\u2019s see. Dancing to a Gene Kelly number, he has big shoes to fill. Matching checked suits for vaudeville vibes. Layton\u2019s cheeky chappie side is coming out to play. After criticism for previous dances, they\u2019ve been working hard on synchronisation in the side-by-side sections. Stepladder-ography to start and brollies. Flapping, flipping, twirling and cartwheeling. It\u2019s full-on, fast and fun with plenty of lifts and tricks. fiddle props. A showstopper which suits his theatricality. Goofy, kooky, amazing run of cartwheel lifts. A blockbuster. Bravo. Song: Fit As A Fiddle (And Ready for Love) by Gene Kelly &amp; Donald O\u2019Connor. Written in 1932, this vaudevillian classic found fame 20 years later when it appeared on the Singin\u2019 In The Rain soundtrack. Simon Rimmer and Karen Hauer performed a Charleston to it six series ago. Judges\u2019 scores: 8 (boo!), 9, 9, 9 for a total of 35 points. Judges\u2019 comments for Bobby and Dianne: Shirley says \u201cI can\u2019t cope, proud and grand, right attitude, kept the atmosphere going, just missing a breath in the body\u201d. Anton says \u201cloved the drag, reminded me of dragging Craig n the tour, stayed in the moment, needed more sideways stretch but terrific\u201d. Craig says \u201ctoo square and lacked shaping but you\u2019ve worked hard on your hands, strength and intent, plain to see your improvement\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cpeaked at the right time, convincing and committed, you deserve a space in the final\u201d. Nines ahoy? He could be dancing his way into the final here. Two very contrasting dances for them. The mood could hardly be more different to their quickstep. Time to lose Ballroom Bobby and let serious bullfighter Bobby take over. He\u2019s this year\u2019s youngest contestant but this is a mature dance style, so be needs to dig deep and deliver. Bags of drama, frowny faces and CGI forest setting. He\u2019s been working hard on finessing his arm. Cape work, knee walk and curved shapes. A slight lack of resistance and Spanish line, getting a tad stompy, but lovely tango section. He drags her across the floor for a killer finish. Song: Run Boy Run by Woodkid. This 2013 chamber pop hit by French artist Yoann Lemoine has become something of a fixture on ad soundtracks and film trailers. Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer danced a paso to it four series ago. Midway mark now. Costume changes coming up. On-screen, I mean, I\u2019m not demanding a sofa outfit change. Judges\u2019 scores: 9, 10, 9, 9 for a total of 37 points. Second on the night and second overall. Claudia tees up Vito for a textbook ramble about tarantella and mozzarella. Drink! Judges\u2019 comments for Ellie and Vito: Motsi says \u201cdifficult content and basics, neat and tidy, quick on the feet, you deserve that place in the final\u201d. Shirley says \u201cbeautiful energy and personality towards your partner, unique leg actions, one hiccup in a lift, otherwise leg action to die for\u201d. Anton says \u201csmooth technique enabled an elevated performance, made it look easy, great job\u201d. Craig concludes \u201ca bit too polite, wanted more attack and cheek, but clean, fantastic footwork, out-of-this world choreography\u201d. Nines? Maybe a 10 or two? Ellie has called the notoriously tricky technique of the Cuban carnival dance \u201ccha-cha-challenging\u201d. Remember Motsi\u2019s instructions in last week\u2019s Dance Debrief? She wants to see a strong core, straight leg and natural hip action. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple,\u201d she concluded. Yeah, right. A full-on routine with foot swivels, hip action, straight leg. Ellie is remarkably consistent. She hasn\u2019t scored below 35 since week 4 and there\u2019s only half a point\u2019s difference between her Latin and ballroom averages (34.2 compared to 34.75 points). This is another ripper. Sassy and spicy. She\u2019s rasing the performance value, which Craig wanted to see. Fast feet, lovely shapes, some tricks ad spinning lifts. Lots of solo work in the middle. Hip wiggles. Skirt swishes. Body ripples. Packed with content and stayed in character at the end. Wallop. Song: Mambo Italiano by by Bette Midler. Originally a 1954 novelty hit for Rosemary \u201caunt of George\u201d Clooney, this mambo pastiche has also been covered by Dean Martin and Lady Gaga. It appeared on the soundtrack to crime comedies Married To The Mob and Mickey Blue Eyes. Forgetaboutit. Judges\u2019 scores: 8, 8, 8, 8 for a total of 32 points. Lowest score so far tonight. Dance-off danger? Jojo is tearful and says Annabel is his mum\u2019s age. \u201cCan you imagine me asking my mother to backflip into my arms?\u201d Judges\u2019 comments for Annabel and Jojo: Goes down a storm in the studio. What do I know? Craig says \u201clacked fluidity, spiky and leg placement went awry but you threw yourself entirely into it and should be commended\u201d. Motsi says \u201cperfect is boring, we saw joy and love, you\u2019ve gone from novice to putting that on the floor\u201d. Shirley says \u201cyou work so hard, energy much better, you\u2019re what the show\u2019s about, bum spin went wrong but recovered well\u201d. Anton concludes with a series of noises. Nines a-coming? Ballroom is Annabel Croft\u2019s strength but she surprised us with her samba four weeks ago. Can she let herself go and embrace the Latin party spirit again? It needs to look spontaneous, free and fun. Flouncy feathery opening. Lots of hip action, lifts and tricks. Drops and spins. Spectacular splits. Lovely partnering, as you\u2019d expect from these two but too disco and lacking bounce for me. Song: You\u2019ll Be Mine (Party Time) by Gloria Estefan. The queen of Latin pop performed her 1996 hit at the Super Bowl Halftime Show with Stevie Wonder three years after its initial release and enjoyed a new lease of life commercially. It\u2019s been used twice before for Strictly salsas - in series seven by Natalie Cassidy and series 10 by Fern Britton. The latter was eliminated afterwards. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s not an omen. Judges\u2019 scores: 9, 9, 9, 9 for a total of 36 points. Highest scoring rumba of the series. Judges\u2019 comments for Layton and Nikita: Anton says \u201caccomplished, great musicality and mood but a little hard and too much attack\u201d. Craig says \u201cmissing rumba hip action, too punchy but upper body great, intense, superb emotion\u201d. Motsi says \u201clove the control, very few people can handle that, well done, you softened and reacted\u201d. Shirley concludes \u201cbeautiful musical elements and fluidity but one or two footwork issues\u201d. Nines a-hoy and maybe an 8 from Craig? They\u2019re dancing their quickest and slowest dances of the series tonight. Huge contrast in pace. First up it\u2019s a romantic and sensuous rumba - usually tricky for celebrity males but Layton is the king of Latin. He needs to settle into his hips and nail that undulating, earthy action. Contemporary feel to start but smouldering and passionate. Lots of rumba walks and balance tricks. It\u2019s like a love letter to their partnership. Is it rumba-ish enough? Lacks continuous motion, a bit stop-start for me. Awkward at times but lovely mood. Song: Lift Me Up by Rihanna. This R&amp;B ballad by the by Barbadian megastar was the lead single from the soundtrack of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It acted as a tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman and was Oscar-nominated for Best Song. Up in the Clauditorium, Vernon Kay is this week\u2019s VIP guest, reading out the voting smallprint. Wonder if they shared a minicab? He\u2019s tall. And did brilliant work for Children In Need recently. He romantically hands back to Tess. Judges\u2019 scores: 9, 9, 10, 10 for a total of 38 points. His highest score and the top quickstep of the series. Judges\u2019 comments for Bobby and Dianne: Shirley says \u201cI strip Anton of his King Of Ballroom title and give it to Bobby, you had the frame, no gapping, beautiful partnering, shifted across the floor\u201d. Anton says \u201cit took me years to get that title and you got it in five minutes, I got a bit emotional watching that, you\u2019ve come so far, swept across the flor, transitions smooth, proud of you\u201d. Craig says \u201clacked swing and sway, banana hands but amazing improvement, brilliant\u201d. Motsi concludes \u201cclear intentions, one of your best ballroom dances\u201d. Two 10s and two nines? It\u2019s pro Dianne Buswell\u2019s favourite dance and Bobby Brazier has been excited to don a tailsuit for the first time. Their height difference could make it a challenge to maintain a strong frame but on the upside, he should be able to drive across the floor with those long legs. Jazzy, old Hollywood feel. Elegant but lively with ease of movement. Nicely controlled and the traditional music helps but footwork hesitant mid-routine. Swivel for the Charleston section. Wacky finish. Rather fabulous. Song: Mack The Knife by Bobby Darin. This swing version of the 1928 Kurt Weill standard was a number one hit for Darin on both sides of the Atlantic in 1959 and earned him two Grammys. He recorded it in three takes and it includes not one but five key changes. Frank Sinatra himself called it \u201cthe definitive\u201d version. Sorry, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald. Ole Blue Eyes has spoken. Everyone seems to have buttons and sleeves missing tonight. Pesky moths. After a reminder of the carried-over scores from last week, we get our first sight of the four semi-finalists. Bobby Brazier in a tailsuit. Annabel Croft has come dressed as Big Bird. A rare chance to see their legs as we welcome the paddle-raising panel. Motsi Mabuse is metallic sparkles. Shirley Ballas in bright pink to match Tess. Twinning is winning. Here come our presenting duo, so time for the regular frockular face-off. Tess Daly is hot pink one-shouldered gown with capey sleeve thinh. Claudia Winkleman is in a black mini-dress with white stilletoes. Claud wins. Jody! Eddie! The other Nikita! Other people we\u2019d kinda forgotten existed! Cue ye olde traditional VT to crank up the tension. Last chance for a nervous semi-final loo trip. We\u2019re about to go over live to Elstree Studios\u2026 What the what? Who the who now? Pick the bones out of that, The Guardian\u2019s Martin Belam. The Charleston is a fan favourite and, when done well, tends to score highly. In fact, three of the last five Strictly glitterball champions have performed it in their semi-finals: Hamza Yassin, Bill Bailey and Stacey Dooley. A promising sign for Layton Williams, perhaps? Five minutes until sequin o\u2019clock\u2026 News this week that Lauren Oakley, who partnered Krishnan Guru- Murphy this year, won the annual Pro Challenge and earned herself a Guinness World Record in the process. She successfully performed 15 pendulum steps in 30 seconds, pipping Nancy Xu, Neil Jones, Carlos Gu and Nadiya Byvhkova, who all managed 14. Krishnan was sweetly proud of her on social media. Congrats, Lozza.. The Giggle, the third and final Doctor Who 60th anniversary special, on BBC1 right now. Already a twisty-turny, timey-wimey, wibbly-wobbly thing. Does Russell T Davies still have more surprises up his sleeve? Mere minutes to wait now\u2026 After the snappy hour-long live shows of the past fortnight, double dancing means a longer show tonight. It weighs in at 85 minutes, finishing on the stroke of 9pm. Ten minutes until the choreographic clapperboard comes down\u2026 A swift reminder of last week\u2019s quarter-final action. After Nigel Harman\u2019s late withdrawal with an injured rib, we were told there\u2019d be no public vote, dance-off nor elimination but scores would instead be carried forward. Layton Williams proceeded to top the standings when his Moulin Rouge paso doble scored the first perfect 40 of the series. He was followed by Ellie Leach\u2019s Disney quickstep with all the nines. Bobby Brazier was in third after not quite nailing \u201cthat\u201d lift in his Dirty Dancing salsa, with Annabel Croft bottom after her Wicked foxtrot wobbled. Now we\u2019ve done our revision, not long until the glitterball starts spinning\u2026. Tick them off when you spot them on screen! Take a drink for each! End up stoving into the Christmas Bailey\u2019s early! Here\u2019s your 10-point spotter\u2019s guide for tonight\u2019s proceedings\u2026 Claudia deliberately prompts one of Vito\u2019s epic rambles about animals or obscure steps Craig is roundly booed for raising his \u201cnine\u201d paddle Johannes weeps with pride about Annabel Shirley Ballas shushes the studio audience heckling her about a technicality-focuses critique Dianne refers to Bobby as her \u201clittle brother\u201d, just to reassure us there\u2019s no funny business Tess Daly\u2019s frock has some kind of superfluous asymmetry or strange neck detail Anton De Beke says he would\u2019ve liked to have danced that quickstep or Viennese The glitterball trophy is in the studio and greeted with audience \u201coohs\u201d Motsi tells Craig he\u2019s wrong with such charm that he can\u2019t help laughing Tess tells a couple \u201cthey\u2019re on their feet!\u201d We\u2019ll see a lovely mix of Latin, ballroom and freestyle tonight. Ballroom devotees will be treated to a Viennese waltz and a quickstep. For Latin lovers, there\u2019s a salsa, a cha-cha-cha, a rumba and a paso doble. Freestyle fans should enjoy Layton\u2019s Charleston and Ellie\u2019s Couple\u2019s Choice. Appetites whetted? Not long now until ballroom blast-off\u2026 In the rehearsal rooms this week, our couples have been dividing their time between two dances. Some have been training for one on the mornings, then other in the afternoons. Others have mixed it up and done entire days practice on each. Wonder if anyone solved this time management challenge with spreadsheets or highlighter pens? It\u2019s going to be a test of stamina, as well as skill. Twenty minutes until that ba-ba-da theme tune\u2026 Bookies say Bobby Brazier is favourite to bid farewell, with Annabel Croft just behind. According to the betting, Ellie Leach and Layton Williams seem relatively safe. Barring dance dis-ah-sters or public vote shockers, they should be quietly confident of a place in the final. Do you agree? It\u2019s all to dance for and 23 minutes until glittery go-time\u2026 Dust off that GCSE and root out that solar-powered Casio calculator because we\u2019ll be doing some maths tonight. The couples will accumulate scores from three dances. Last week\u2019s scores will be carried over and added to week\u2019s two routines. That total score will be combined with the reopened viewer vote, the bottom two will dance-off and one couple will miss out on the final. Clear us mud? Thought so. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll keep you abreast of the numbers. It\u2019s 25 minutes until the sparkly curtain comes up\u2026 No pressure, everyone, but it\u2019s do-or-dance time. Good evening and welcome to the semi-final weekend of Strictly Come Dancing 2023. I\u2019m Michael, your virtual dance partner. I\u2019d love you to watch along with me as our four remaining couples bid to make it through to this year\u2019s showpiece final. Unlike last weekend, there\u2019s been no injury dropout drama, so we\u2019re good to go. For the first time, our pro-celebrity pairs tackle two full routines apiece, so it\u2019s been quite the week in the training rooms. Long days, sore feet, lots of carb-loading. And that\u2019s just my prep for this liveblog. It\u2019s showtime at 7.35pm on BBC One. I\u2019ll be liveblogging from 7.05pm, providing build-up, rolling coverage, analysis, reaction and gentle semi-final snark. So snuggle down, buckle up and I\u2019ll see you on the sofa. As always, I\u2019d totally love to hear from you too. You can tweet me @michaelhogan, email me michael.hogan.freelance@guardian.co.uk and the comments section below is open for ballroom business. I\u2019ll flick and kick to see what you\u2019re all saying and report some of your comments up top. The remarkably consistent Ellie Leach is surely a shoo-in for the grand final. As for the rest, it could be any two from three. Layton Williams and Bobby Brazier have both survived aa dance-off in recent weeks, while Annabel Croft is the lowest scorer of the four semi-finalists. Who will rise to the occasion and who will fall at the last hurdle? It\u2019s nearly time to staaaaart double dancing!"

            "content": "Cop28 ended with yet more dashed hopes on fossil fuels, with a watered-down call for countries to move away from them rather than phasing them out (Report, 14 December). I feel ashamed and frustrated that our government doesn\u2019t seem to grasp the urgency of the climate emergency, and we see it repeatedly rowing back on net zero targets and perfectly workable carbon-reduction initiatives. Thankfully, in spite of the hostility that the government has shown towards renewable energy in the last decade, many communities across the country have banded together to build clean-energy projects in their local area. Community Energy England counts as many as 500 community groups around the UK that have installed solar panels in schools, introduced insulation programmes on their streets and provided free advice to those in fuel poverty. I strongly support the idea of energy generation being owned by the local community and run in its interests. I see it as a route to tangible progress towards decarbonisation, and more effective than the hot air that we get in conferences.

            "date": "2023-12-07T15:45:35Z",
            "content": "The first trial in Africa of two combination vaccines to prevent HIV has been halted after researchers concluded it was not working. The vaccines (part of the PrEPVacc study) were being tested on 1,500 people aged between 18 and 40 in Uganda, Tanzania and South Africa. The African-led trial, which began in December 2020, was stopped last month after an interim review of progress. The final results are expected to be made public in late 2024. The trial of a pre-exposure prophylaxis pill running alongside the vaccines tests will continue. Dr Eugene Ruzagira, trial director from the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) and assistant professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cVaccinations to PrEPVacc trial participants have been stopped because an analysis of the data collected so far by our independent data-monitoring committee has led them to conclude that there is little or no chance of demonstrating that the vaccines we are testing are reducing the risk of acquiring HIV.\u201d The PrEPVacc trials, led by African researchers with support from European scientists, tested two different combinations of HIV vaccines to see if either could prevent infection in populations particularly at risk of infection. The trials were funded with a \u20ac15m (\u00a312.8m) grant from the EU\u2019s European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership. Prof Jonathan Weber, from Imperial College London, one of the trial\u2019s sponsors, said: \u201cWe do clinical trials because we don\u2019t know the answer to questions. It was important to find out whether the combination vaccine regimens in PrEPVacc, developed over 20 years, should be ruled out or further developed for preventing HIV. \u201cWhile we await the final results and analysis of individual products, I believe that our interim result puts this generation of putative HIV vaccines to bed,\u201d he said. Previous trials in South Africa to test the only vaccine that had shown any success in protecting against HIV \u2013 the RV144 \u2013 developed in Thailand, was stopped in February 2020 after interim results found it was not working. Prof Pontiano Kaleebu, PrEPVacc\u2019s chief investigator at UVRI, said developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection was \u201ca critical goal for Africa\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is a goal that must have even greater urgency now that no HIV vaccines are being trialled for efficacy anywhere in the world. \u201cWe have come so far in our HIV-prevention journey, but we must look to a new generation of vaccine approaches and technology to take us forward again.\u201d About 39 million people worldwide are living with HIV, more than 25 million in sub-Saharan Africa. Ruzagira told an Aids conference in Zimbabwe on Wednesday that he remained optimistic. \u201cThe scientific hurdles are high, but I have equally high hopes that an HIV vaccine will be developed one day,\u201d he said. The RV144 vaccine was trialled in Thailand between 2003 and 2006, which after three years reduced infection rates by almost a third. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 December 2023 to clarify that the trials involved testing of two different combinations of HIV vaccines, not of HIV, as an earlier version said."

            "date": "2023-12-19T09:39:53Z",
            "content": "The woes of Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which owns the streaming rights to artists ranging from Beyonc\u00e9 to Neil Young, have deepened, as it delayed the publication of its half-year results at the last minute. Hipgnosis said it was postponing its results because the company valuation by its independent valuer was \u201cmaterially higher\u201d than the valuation implied by proposed and recent transactions in the sector, in particular its recent sale of song rights at a steep discount. The fund last week sold 20,000 \u201cnon-core\u201d songs for $23.1m (\u00a318.4m), at a 14% discount to their previous valuation. Tuesday\u2019s statement also referred to a proposed sale of assets for $417.5m at a 24% discount to their previous valuation, when Hipgnosis failed in its attempt to sell almost a fifth of its back catalogue to the private equity group Blackstone. Blackstone had previously invested in Hipgnosis Song Management, the entity that decides on investments in the fund. Shareholders in the Hipgnosis fund voted against the deal in late October. The board sought advice from Hipgnosis Song Management on its opinion on the independent valuer\u2019s valuation. \u201cHipgnosis Song Management eventually provided an opinion, which was heavily caveated, such that the board has concerns as to the valuation of the company\u2019s assets in its interim results,\u201d the fund said. It now expects to publish its results for the six months to 30 September, which were originally scheduled to be published on Tuesday, by 31 December. Higher interest rates have plunged the fund into turmoil, making the prospect of future income from streaming royalties less attractive to investors and forcing changes to how the fund calculates the value of future revenues. The company cancelled dividend payments to shareholders in October, saying that changes to US royalties had reduced its income. It said paying a dividend would force it to breach its covenants \u2013 agreements with lenders. Hipgnosis was founded in 2018 by Merck Mercuriadis, who believed that online streaming had made the rights to long-lasting music hits an attractive investment proposition. Mercuriadis previously managed artists including Elton John, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Morrissey and Iron Maiden, and used his contacts to snap up the rights to song catalogues in a series of deals. He built up a portfolio of almost 61,000 songs worth $2.2bn. The fund announced in October that Andrew Wilkinson and Paul Burger had resigned as non-executive directors the day before its AGM, in which its chair, Andrew Sutch, was ousted. The investment specialist Rob Naylor and music industry executive Francis Keeling were later made chairman and non-executive director, respectively. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase said: \u201cThis is an early blow to the credibility of the new board, and casts further doubt over the credibility of the independent valuer, Citrin Cooperman. Given all that has occurred over recent months we are surprised that another party had not been hired to provide a valuation.\u201d Hipgnosis Song Management said that it had \u201cfulfilled its duties to the company with respect to both the independent valuation and preparation of the interim results in a timely and efficient manner. \u201cNotwithstanding the board\u2019s decision to delay publication of the interim financial statements, the investment adviser will continue to work in a constructive manner to support the interests of the company and its shareholders.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-20T22:19:28Z",
            "content": "Five Congolese opposition presidential candidates have jointly called for a rerun of the country\u2019s general elections, saying a decision by the election commission to extend the ballot was unconstitutional. After a day plagued by administrative chaos, delays and closed polling stations, electoral authorities said late on Wednesday that voting would continue on the following day in areas where voters could not cast ballots. But opposition candidates, including the Nobel peace laureate Denis Mukwege and the former oil executive Martin Fayulu, said that the move was illegal and called for a new election. There had long been fears that the four concurrent polls \u2013 to elect a president, along with national and regional lawmakers and local councillors \u2013 might turn chaotic in the impoverished but mineral-rich central African nation. Those fears were borne out on Wednesday. Although voting started at 6am, an observer mission linked to churches said that by midday 31% of polling stations were still closed while 45% of voting machines in those that had opened had experienced problems. The National Episcopal Conference of Congo and the Church of Christ in Congo observer mission also said some of its 25,000 observers were blocked from polling stations. President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, 60, who took office in 2019 and is running for a second five-year term, is considered the frontrunner to win in the single-round presidential vote. About 44 million Congolese, in a country of 111 million, are registered to vote. More than 100,000 candidates are running for various positions, and while counting was due to begin as soon as polling stations closed, results are not expected to be announced for several days. Studio Hirondelle RDC, a grouping of independent radio stations in the DRC, reported angry crowds at polling stations in several parts of the country because of long queues. The problems were thought to have been caused by delays in delivering voting materials to polling stations, some not having voter registration lists and experiencing problems with poor quality voter ID cards where the ink had faded, making names and pictures unclear. \u201cI am worried about the multiplication of serious malfunctions and irregularities that punctuate the current election, confirming our fears of obviously planned electoral fraud,\u201d said Mukwege, who won the 2018 Nobel peace prize for his work treating survivors of rape. In a statement published on Wednesday afternoon, Mukwege said there had been reports of voting machines not being delivered, voters not being able to find their names on voting lists, observers being blocked and some cases of people being told how to vote. \u201cWe fear that the results from such a chaotic vote will not reflect the will of the people and their deep desire for change.\u201d The first voters cast their ballots at a polling station in the eastern city of Kisangani, in a region an hour ahead of the west of the huge country, which straddles two time zones. Voting then began in several other cities, but with delays and bureaucratic difficulties. A 30-year-old man, who had waited in line for three hours in the eastern city of Goma, said he was getting impatient and would soon give up. \u201cWe\u2019re tired. It\u2019s always a mess here,\u201d he said. Richard Moncrieff, project director for the Great Lakes at the International Crisis Group, said many of the problems on the day had been anticipated before the election, when concerns were raised about a lack of investment and late supply of election materials. \u201cThe credibility of the elections has been severely damaged and the opposition may contest not only the outcome but the entire process,\u201d said Moncrieff. \u201cThere\u2019s no legal threshold for the number of voters required to make an election legal so one danger is a very large number of people might not be able to vote for no reason of their own.\u201d Studio Hirondelle RDC also reported that a polling station in Ituri province was attacked by displaced people who found out only the day before the election that they were not allowed to vote. Ituri hosts many of the residents displaced in eastern DRC, where the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels launched a new rebellion against the government in 2022. DRC\u2019s election commission announced last week that displaced people in the North Kivu province, the centre of the fighting, would not be able to vote because the insecurity had prevented voters from enrolling. Frontrunner Tshisekedi\u2019s record, as he has acknowledged, is mixed. He has presided over years of economic growth but little job creation and soaring inflation. He is asking for another term to \u201cconsolidate his gains\u201d. Throughout the campaign, he poured scorn on what he termed \u201cforeign candidates\u201d \u2013 suggesting that his opponents have dual loyalties and lack the will to stand up to Rwanda, which the DRC accuses of funding rebel groups on its soil. Mo\u00efse Katumbi, a 58-year-old businessman and former governor of mineral-rich Katanga province, is the main target of such attacks. All the major opposition candidates say they suspect the government of preparing electoral fraud."

            "title": "What is at stake in Rudy Giuliani poll workers defamation trial?",
            "date": "2023-12-11T11:00:16Z",
            "content": "A closely watched defamation trial kicks off on Monday in which Rudy Giuliani is set to defend himself against having to pay tens of millions of dollars to two Georgia election workers whom he made false statements about the 2020 election about. What is this case about? Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss are suing the former New York mayor and lawyer for Donald Trump for tens of millions of dollars for making false, defamatory statements about them after the 2020 election. They are seeking between $15m and $43m in damages. Freeman and Moss, both of whom are Black, served as election workers in Fulton county, which includes Atlanta, after the 2020 election. As part of efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s loss in the state, Giuliani repeatedly made false claims about the women and amplified misleading security footage that he claimed showed them counting ballots after counting had officially concluded. He also accused both women of passing a USB drive like \u201cvials of cocaine or heroin\u201d. The item in question was actually a breath mint. Freeman and Moss had their lives upended because of the attacks. They received death threats and other forms of harassment. Freeman fled her home and has said she is still afraid to give her name in public. Moss has said she experienced anxiety and depression. Her son, who used a phone with a phone number that once belonged to her also received threats and began failing in school. What are both sides likely to argue at the case? Giuliani has already conceded he made false statements about Freeman and Moss, and Beryl Howell, the US district judge who is overseeing the case, has already found him liable for defamation. The only remaining question for the jury is what kind of penalty he should have to pay. Freeman and Moss are both expected to testify during the trial about the vicious harassment they faced and its consequences. Giuliani is also expected to take the stand. The thrust of his defense is likely to focus on the idea that any suffering Moss and Freeman experienced cannot be directly linked to his statements. The trial is likely to wrap up on Friday. Why is this case important? The harassment of Freeman and Moss represents the best example of the human consequences of the lies Giuliani and other Trump allies spread after the election. Their lies have fueled a deep-seated distrust of American elections and prompted a wave of harassment since 2020 against election officials and workers \u2013 many of whom are leaving the profession. The trial offers a chance for two of the most prominent victims of election denialism to confront one of its biggest propagators. Second, the case offers another significant attempt to hold a key actor accountable for spreading lies about the 2020 election. It is part of a suite of efforts, including the criminal charges Giuliani and others face in Georgia and the $787m settlement between Fox and the voting machine equipment vendor Dominion, seeking to bring consequences to those who told election lies. Why is the case taking place in a Washington DC courtroom? Lawyers for Freeman and Moss filed the case in Washington DC because it involves a dispute between citizens of different states and because Giuliani \u201cmade defamatory statements that were produced and published in the District of Columbia\u201d. The decision to hold the case in Washington DC is also of strategic advantage to Moss and Freeman because the jury pool is extremely unlikely to be friendly to Trump (the city voted for Biden 93-5 in 2020). Giuliani is likely to use that context to assail any adverse verdict in the case. Is Trump being sued as part of this case? No. Trump is not a named defendant in the case. How is this case related to the criminal charges Giuliani faces in Fulton county? Legally, the two cases are different and unconnected. The defamation case is a civil lawsuit filed directly by Freeman and Moss in federal court seeking damages. The Fulton county case is a criminal process taking place in a Georgia state court and could result in jail time. That said, the defamation case could provide insight into Giuliani\u2019s state of mind as well as operations in Trump\u2019s orbit as they made false claims about the election. Some of the criminal charges against Giuliani stem from his false statements about Freeman and Moss. Willis also charged three other people as part of a scheme to try to get Freeman to falsely confess to election fraud."

            "date": "2023-12-09T22:21:39Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump has nudged ahead of Joe Biden in national polling for the 2024 presidential election, a survey published on Saturday revealed, a day after the US president branded his predecessor as \u201cdespicable\u201d at an event in California. The Wall Street Journal poll shows Biden with the lowest approval rating of his presidency, a finding broadly in line with other recent studies that have sparked concern in Democratic circles less than a year before voters go to the polls. It shows Trump leading Biden by four points, 47% to 43%, the first time this survey has shown that the former US president is favored in a head-to-head test of the likely 2024 White House matchup, the WSJ said. When five potential third-party and independent candidates are included, drawing a combined 17% support, Trump\u2019s lead expands to six points, 37-31. Although Biden has expressed his desire to run for a second term, many in the Democratic party would like to see him stand down, fearing his advancing age \u2013 81 on election day and 86 after eight years in the White House if he wins next year \u2013 will turn off voters. The indictment of the president\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, in California on Thursday on nine criminal tax charges places additional obstacles in his path to re-election. Meanwhile Trump, despite leading the race for the Republican nomination by almost 50 points, according to RealClearPolitics, is no shoo-in either, largely because of his own multiple legal woes. The candidate who will himself be 78 on polling day remains in peril from four concurrent criminal cases against him, some over his illegal efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. At a fundraiser on Friday night, Biden laid into Trump for his actions on 6 January 2021, the day of the Capitol riot by his supporters trying to prevent Congress certifying the election result. \u201cIt\u2019s despicable. It\u2019s simply despicable,\u201d Biden told an audience including the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and Democratic former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, referring to how Trump stood and watched the unfolding riot on television and did nothing to stop it. He also referenced Trump\u2019s interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity this week in which he was asked whether he would abuse his power if he were elected again. \u201cThe other day he said he would be a dictator only one day. God, only one day! He embraces political violence instead of rejecting it,\u201d Biden said. His speech was themed largely around the threat he said Trump posed to democracy, and avoided mention of the Israel-Gaza war. He told the audience of Democratic party supporters: \u201cYou\u2019re the reason that Donald Trump is a former president, or, he hates when I say it, a defeated president. My guess is that he won\u2019t show up at my next inauguration.\u201d While the WSJ survey will alarm many Democrats, others warn not to read too much into what some observers see as \u201cmad poll disease\u201d, anxiety induced by a belief that a succession of negative polls shows what will happen a year from now instead of providing an opportunity to act, or vote, to prevent it. Similarly, the WSJ notes that while its figures show many Democrats are widely unhappy with Biden now, they might still back him on election day, especially if Trump is the Republican candidate."

            "date": "2023-12-23T15:41:13Z",
            "content": "The former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley has pulled within four percentage points of frontrunner Donald Trump in New Hampshire\u2019s 2024 Republican presidential primary, a contest which could prove closer than expected for the ex-president, according to a new poll. In an American Research Group Inc poll released on Thursday which had asked voters whom they preferred in the New Hampshire primary scheduled for 23 January, Haley earned 29% support to Trump\u2019s 33%. That meant the gap between Haley and Trump was within the survey\u2019s 4% margin of error after the former president had long held dominating polling leads in the race for the 2024 Republican White House nomination. Haley\u2019s strong showing in the American Research Group Inc survey came a day after a poll from the Saint Anselm College New Hampshire Institute of Politics found she had doubled her support in the state since September, seemingly cementing her as a clear alternate choice to Trump for conservative voters. The Saint Anselm survey\u2019s findings were more favorable to Trump, however, showing him with a 44% to 30% lead over Haley. But while Haley still has ground to gain to take the lead in the state, Trump coming in at less than 50% support \u201cshows he has serious competition in the party\u201d, the University of New Hampshire survey center director, Andrew Smith, has previously told USA Today. Haley\u2019s strong poll showings appear to have drawn a mixed reaction from Trump, who is separately contending with more than 90 criminal charges as he seeks a second presidency. On one hand, he went on his Truth Social site on Friday and insulted Haley with his preferred nickname for her, writing: \u201cFake New Hampshire poll was released on Birdbrain. Just another scam!\u201d He additionally spoke with the rightwing radio show host Hugh Hewitt on Friday and dismissed the polls showing Haley performing well against him as \u201cfake\u201d and insisted he was untroubled by her as a potential primary contender. Yet citing two sources familiar with the conversations, CBS News reported on Friday that Trump had also simultaneously been asking his team about tapping Haley to serve as a vice-presidential candidate if he eventually wins the Republican primary to be the 2024 Oval Office nominee, which if accurate would be a sign that he covets capitalizing on her support. CBS said its sources had indicated the far-right reaction to a Trump-Haley ticket has been negative, however. Haley for now has been touting her recent polling performances. \u201cDonald Trump has started to attack me,\u201d Haley said at a campaign town hall on Wednesday in Iowa, where the caucuses that customarily kick off presidential election years are scheduled for 15 January. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what this Nikki Haley surge is all about.\u2019 Do you want me to tell you what it\u2019s about? \u2026 We\u2019re surging.\u201d Haley was the US ambassador to the United Nations after Trump won the presidency in 2016, but she resigned in 2018. Prior to that, she was governor of South Carolina from 2011 to 2017. One of her more prominent acts as South Carolina governor was signing into law a ban on abortion which contained no exceptions for rape or incest. That ban took effect, along with similar ones in other states, after the US supreme court last year eliminated the federal right to abortion which had been established by the landmark Roe v Wade decision. Trump, for his part, faces 91 criminal charges accusing him of trying to forcibly reverse his defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, illegally retaining government secrets after he left the Oval Office and illicit hush-money payments to the adult film actor Stormy Daniels. He has also grappled with civil litigation over his business practices and a rape allegation deemed \u201csubstantially true\u201d by a judge. Trump more recently has been on the defensive against resurfaced claims that he kept writings by Adolf Hitler \u2013 the Nazi leader who orchestrated the murders of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust \u2013 by his bed. Academics, commentators and political opponents have been quick to link Trump\u2019s recent remarks that certain immigrants were \u201cpoisoning the blood of\u201d the US to rhetoric used historically by Hitler, Benito Mussolini and other authoritarian world rulers. \u201cI know nothing about Hitler,\u201d Trump said to Hewitt on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m not a student of Hitler.\u201d He then implied having at least some familiarity with Hitler\u2019s sayings in regards to purity of blood. \u201cThey say he said something about blood,\u201d Trump told Hewitt. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say it the way I said it, either, by the way. It\u2019s a very different kind of statement.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 December 2023. An early version said Donald Trump had polled 39% in the American Research Group Inc poll, when 33% was meant."

            "title": "Most Garrick club members favour admitting women, poll reveals",
            "date": "2023-12-03T16:41:07Z",
            "content": "The slow-moving campaign to force the Garrick, one of London\u2019s last remaining gentlemen\u2019s clubs, to admit women has notched a partial victory with an internal poll revealing that a majority of members are in favour of dropping the men-only rule. This is the second significant development in the space of a year in the remarkably languid battle for gender equality at the club, which counts among its members the former supreme court judges Lord Neuberger and Lord Sumption, actors Hugh Bonneville and Stephen Fry, and Michael Gove, a cabinet minister. Earlier this year, members learned that a senior barrister had updated his advice from when he previously told the club in 2011 that its rules prohibited the admission of female members. Michael Beloff KC later gave the club revised legal advice concluding there was no justification for excluding women. In a postal vote, organised to canvass members\u2019 views in the wake of this changed legal advice, 51% of those members who participated indicated that they were in favour of admitting women, while 44% were opposed. In total, 76% of the club\u2019s membership took part in the ballot; 53 people (4%) said they were still undecided. The proportion of members in favour of admitting women has risen by just half a percentage point over the eight years since the last poll in 2015, when 50.5% of members voted in favour of women at an annual general meeting; this fell short of the two-thirds majority required for a rule change. However, members campaigning for women to be allowed to join noted that the proportion of those opposed to a change had dropped from 48% to 44%, and said the result was an important advance. These members argue that given Beloff\u2019s revised legal opinion, it would be undemocratic to prevent members from nominating women to join. The club\u2019s chair, Christopher Kirker, emailed members with the polling result last Friday, writing: \u201cThis has been a most helpful exercise and the general committee is extremely grateful to you all for your response. Quite clearly you are all engaged with the club and you care about it a great deal.\u201d He did not say how the club\u2019s organising committee proposed to respond to the poll. If members do decide to attempt to nominate women, by writing candidates\u2019 names on cards, which fellow members can then sign if they support the nomination, they can expect a worsening of the already fractious atmosphere within the club on the question of women. When Joanna Lumley was proposed as a member in 2011, prompting the club to take legal advice on the issue, \u201cugly, rude things were written on the [nomination] card, expletives, and comments that said \u2018who do they think they are?\u2019 and \u2018women aren\u2019t allowed here and never will be\u2019\u201d, one member recalled. The Garrick is one of a handful of remaining men-only gentlemen\u2019s clubs, including White\u2019s (which does not allow women on the premises, with the exception of cleaning staff and the queen), the East India Club (which recruits members from boarding schools), the Travellers Club, and Boodle\u2019s (where women are allowed as guests, but are discouraged from entering through the front door). Newer members are not always more progressive on this issue. Seth Alexander Th\u00e9voz, the author of Behind Closed Doors, a study of London clubs, said: \u201cThe younger members in historic clubs can be among the most traditionalist, joining because they want a sort of Victorian cosplay, whereas it\u2019s often the older members who can be rather more liberal.\u201d The large number of senior lawyers who are Garrick members has caused persistent unease within the profession. At the time of the last vote, the human rights lawyer Dinah Rose KC said: \u201cIf you\u2019re a judge, publicly committed to the principle of equality, it is incompatible with that, to be a member of that type of club.\u201d The Garrick did not respond to a request for a comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 January 2024 to correct the surname of Christopher Kirker, which in an earlier version was given as \u201cCoker\u201d."

            "date": "2023-12-02T15:06:49Z",
            "content": "England travel to Glasgow on Tuesday with the strangest of propositions, needing a win against a team who will do anything to beat them but some of whose players stand to benefit from England\u2019s progression from their Nations League group. Scotland\u2019s predicament is not a predicament, in that none of their players would contemplate defeat to England in any circumstances. But that Scotland players could be included in a Team GB squad at next summer\u2019s Paris Olympics, were England to earn a qualifying spot, creates an interesting conflict of interests. It is a quirk caused by England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland having to come together as Team GB for the Olympics. With England selected as the nominated team that can earn Olympic qualification on behalf of all four, they will need to beat Scotland at Hampden Park on Tuesday to have any chance of advancing, with only the group leaders progressing. It is a new problem, with the inaugural Nations League determining Olympic qualification. Previously, the nominated team had to finish as one of the top two European sides at the World Cup to qualify for the Olympics. England and Scotland were paired against each other in Group D of the 2019 World Cup, but the importance of a strong showing on the biggest stage overshadowed any Olympic qualification aspirations. How fair is it then on the Netherlands and Belgium, who could both still top the group and head into the Nations League finals ahead of England, that the Lionesses play Scotland when they need a big win to top the group? The Netherlands manager, Andries Jonker, pointed to the problem after their 3-2 defeat to England at Wembley on Friday left everything to play for going into the final round of fixtures. \u201cWhen the draw was made, I said to the players: \u2018The only thing we can do is keep this in our hands.\u2019 Straight away, it was annoying, but it wasn\u2019t going to change,\u201d he said. Knowing that an England win is the route to the Olympics, Beth Mead said: \u201cWe\u2019ll concentrate on ourselves. We\u2019re the team nominated, we want to win the game, we want to score goals so that\u2019s our aim.\u201d England have a goal difference gap to close, trailing the Dutch by three: should the Netherlands beat Belgium 1-0, then they would need to beat Scotland by four to advance on goals scored. Throw into the mix that the Scotland goalkeeper Sandy MacIver swapped countries, playing in one international friendly for the Lionesses before making her debut for her new team on 31 October, and the narrative gets more interesting. Should Uefa step in and say that these teams cannot be drawn against each other in Nations League groups or matches in future? Possibly. With four teams involved it could become a logistical nightmare. However, it was confirmed on Friday that Scotland and Wales will be relegated to League B while Northern Ireland earned a place in the playoffs for promotion to League A, so the likelihood of all four being drawn against each other is slim. More likely is that the nature of the Olympics changes, which would make the problem at senior level go away. Despite the pride players feel at being Olympians and competing in a multisport tournament, there is increasingly a clamouring, in Europe at least, for women\u2019s football at the Olympics to become an under-23 tournament. That would bring it in line with the men\u2019s tournament and alleviate some of the pressure on the schedules of senior international teams and their players.On Friday, England were forced to come from 2-0 down with goals by Georgia Stanway, Lauren Hemp and Ella Toone after Lineth Beerensteyn\u2019s first-half double for the Netherlands. \u201cThe first half let us down,\u201d said Mead. \u201cWe were chasing the game and you don\u2019t want to be 2-0 down at half-time. But we had the belief in the team, we knew we could score goals and we came out in the second half and the team was amazing. \u201cEvery single person on the pitch and every player that came on is a gamechanger. Now we\u2019ve got to do that for 90 minutes and be more consistent throughout the next game.\u201d"

            "content": "The eruption of gunfire in Sudan\u2019s capital on 15 April was not a complete surprise to Mohamed Eisa, a gastroenterologist living in Pittsburgh who had returned to Sudan to bury his father. He had seen pickup trucks full of armed men circling the streets of Khartoum, and was aware of the rivalry between the country\u2019s military and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group. As open warfare erupted that Saturday, Eisa expected the combat would be brief. Africa\u2019s third-largest country lies on the strategic Red Sea and shares borders with a number of states important to western powers like the United States and their allies in the Gulf and Europe \u2013 all players whom he expected to end the clash between the armed groups. \u201cThat\u2019s why I thought this is going to be contained very quickly, sort of diplomatically, [by] Sudan\u2019s allies or from the big players in the region or the big players internationally, the United States or the European Union,\u201d Eisa recalled. Instead, the opposite occurred. The conflict between the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) has now raged for eight months with no end in sight, killing thousands of people and creating what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest human displacement crisis. Beyond trapping civilians and destroying infrastructure in a country that already struggles with high rates of poverty, international observers have accused both sides of committing war crimes. Evidence is also emerging that the RSF and their allies have massacred members of an African ethnic group in west Darfur, potentially repeating the genocide that took place there two decades ago. For the Sudanese diaspora, the conflict between the two military factions is the latest depressing turn of events for a country that just a few years ago seemed on the path to shaking off decades of dictatorship. In 2019, the despotic president Omar al-Bashir was overthrown by security forces after months of street protests, but those same forces staged a coup in 2021 that ended the transition to a democratic, civilian-led government, and intensified the issues that brought the RSF and SAF to war in April of this year. The United States has one of the largest populations of Sudanese in the west, numbering around 51,000 people, according to the Migration Policy Institute. The UK Office for National Statistics estimates 35,000 people born in Sudan are living in Britain. \u201cNo one was expecting this. No one was prepared for it,\u201d said Ibrahim Babiker, a Virginia-based activist with Girifna, a pro-democracy group whose volunteers have shifted to getting food and medical supplies to cut-off areas of Khartoum and elsewhere in the country. Seven million people have fled their homes due to the fighting that began in April, according to the United Nations, and the Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project, a Wisconsin-based crisis-mapping group, estimates 12,190 people have been killed. Even this is likely an undercount since many of the areas where fighting is happening are inaccessible to independent observers. Earlier this month, the World Food Programme warned war-wracked areas could face \u201ccatastrophic hunger\u201d by next May unless more food assistance gets in. Sudan has dealt with civil wars practically since independence in 1956, which led to its southern half splitting off to form South Sudan. But this war is unique in that one of its main battlegrounds is Khartoum, the capital and heart of a state that is home to an estimated 9.4 million people. The months of fighting have left bodies strewn in its streets, destroyed densely populated neighborhoods, damaged a crucial bridge over the Nile River and gutted the skyline, including a prominent oil company headquarters and the justice ministry. \u201cI think this is what people have not realized, that this is not business as usual, you\u2019re not going to be delivering assistance as you did it before, or, fundamentally, the country is being broken,\u201d said Bashair Ahmed, the CEO of Shabaka, a UK-based research organization that, after the start of the conflict, founded the Sudan Crisis Coordination Unit to act as a clearinghouse for information about the situation on the ground. Many of those displaced from Khartoum went to Sudan\u2019s second city Wad Madani, and are now fleeing again after the RSF stormed it a few days ago. Clashes have also resumed in El Fasher, the last major city in Darfur still under army control. After fleeing Khartoum by road and then taking a boat to Saudi Arabia, Eisa returned to the US, where he is the secretary general of the Sudanese American Physicians Association. With Sudan\u2019s healthcare system barely able to cope with the war\u2019s impacts, the association is now focused on providing supplies and money to clinics and hospitals caught up in the war or overwhelmed by displaced people. Six months after the fighting began in Sudan, Israel and Hamas went to war in the Gaza Strip. Eisa said this event caused an \u201covernight\u201d drop-off in the response to his country\u2019s conflict from donors and non-governmental organizations. Both diaspora and international humanitarian groups acknowledge Sudan\u2019s needs are competing with the crises in Gaza and Ukraine, where Russia\u2019s invasion will soon enter its third year. The United Nations said it had received from donors only 39% of the $2.6bn it needs to respond to Sudan\u2019s crisis, with about half of that money coming from the US. Among western countries, Washington is viewed as taking the lead in trying to mediate between the warring sides, although negotiations are reportedly deadlocked. In August, the UK\u2019s Africa minister, Andrew Mitchell, said evidence suggested \u201cserious atrocities\u201d are being committed against civilians in the country, especially in Darfur, and this month, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said both warring parties have committed \u201cwar crimes\u201d, while the RSF and its allies \u201chave committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing\u201d. Washington has sanctioned RSF commanders and former Bashir officials for their role in the conflict, and the US vice-president Kamala Harris recently discussed the war with United Arab Emirates president Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. News outlets have reported that the UAE is sending the RSF weapons and treating its fighters at an airbase in Chad, near the border with Sudan. The White House is in a protracted negotiation with Congress over approving military aid for both Israel and Ukraine, but despite Sudan\u2019s unraveling over the past eight months, Joe Biden has not appointed a special envoy to the country, as his predecessors did. Cameron Hudson, who served as chief of staff to several former envoys and is now a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said such an appointee could articulate the administration\u2019s response to the crisis, rally US allies and fill the void created when the American embassy in Khartoum evacuated after the fighting began. He also said Blinken missed an opportunity by using a press release to declare that atrocities were happening, rather than an in-person speech. Hudson contrasted it with the former secretary of state Colin Powell\u2019s 2004 appearance before a US Senate committee to announce \u201cthat genocide has been committed in Darfur\u201d, which was crucial to highlighting that conflict\u2019s severity. \u201cFor somebody who\u2019s been watching this issue for 20 years myself, every step of the way seems like a kind of downgrade,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cI reject the notion that Gaza or Ukraine are just too much for this administration to handle because previous administrations have been able to handle major geopolitical shifts and even wars that America was involved in and have enough bandwidth to care about what\u2019s happening in this country. So, I don\u2019t fully understand why today is particularly different from 15 or 20 years ago, but it is in every single measure that you could look at.\u201d Last week, the top Democratic and Republican lawmakers on the House and Senate committees handling foreign affairs proposed resolutions calling on the Biden administration to appoint a special envoy to Sudan, sanction the warring parties and investigate atrocities. \u201cDespite global focus on crises in Europe and the Middle East, the dire situation in Sudan \u2013 characterized by extreme suffering, widespread destruction, and horrendous crimes \u2013 must not be overlooked,\u201d said Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee. In testimony before the House foreign affairs committee earlier in December, Molly Phee, the state department\u2019s top diplomat for Africa, said appointing a special envoy was \u201cunder active and serious consideration by the administration\u201d but did not say when it might happen. Ahmed said Sudanese people trapped in the country by fighting are aware of the ebbing international attention, recalling a conversation with a displaced person who had fled Khartoum. \u201cHer son was saying to her, why is everyone focusing on Ukraine or other contexts? Why are they forgetting about us?\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cAnd no one wants to help us, even though they\u2019re under shelling. Everything they owned, everything they had, that\u2019s been lost, essentially. And everyone has to start from zero.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-02T12:00:45Z",
            "content": "On a chilly day outside the White House, tourists milled about, Secret Service agents stood guard and a group of protesters held aloft a banner that demanded: \u201cOver 14,850 Palestinians killed, how many more before a ceasefire?\u201d Among activists embarking on a five-day hunger strike is a face instantly recognisable to fans of TV series such as Sex and the City and The Gilded Age. Cynthia Nixon is following in a long tradition of actors using their platform to further a Washington cause. But she is also stepping into a Hollywood rift. While the entertainment industry has shown remarkable unity in recent years over Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Black Lives Matter and abortion rights, the Israel-Hamas war is proving uniquely divisive. The air is thick with terms such as antisemitism and genocide. One-time allies are trading accusations of censorship, hypocrisy and betrayal. High profile figures who take a stand are facing abuse, ostracism or, in some cases, dismissal. \u201cPeople are being penalized for speaking out,\u201d says Nixon, wearing a long black coat and cream scarf and holding a water bottle. \u201cBut there are a lot of actors and performers getting together a response to that and saying, \u2018Hey, this isn\u2019t OK,\u2019 we may not agree about everything \u2013 and maybe some of us can express ourselves a little more carefully \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t mean that people should then lose their livelihoods.\u201d Israel has historically enjoyed staunch support in Hollywood. Its birth in 1948, in the aftermath of the Holocaust, was celebrated by a capacity crowd at the Hollywood Bowl who listened to a recorded message from founding prime minister David Ben-Gurion. In 1967, at the same venue, a \u201cRally for the Survival of Israel\u201d demonstrated solidarity after the six-day war with stars such as Frank Sinatra, Peter Sellers and Barbra Streisand. But as decades went by, some in the community came to identify Israel not first and foremost as a left-leaning underdog but a US-backed oppressor of the Palestinians now led by the most rightwing government in its history. Its current bombing of Gaza, which has killed nearly 15,000 people, according to the territory\u2019s health ministry, has prompted outrage and demands for a ceasefire. David Clennon, an Emmy-winning actor and longtime supporter of Palestinian rights, says via email: \u201cHollywood used to be unanimous in showing its admiration and loyalty to Israel. A new show business generation is beginning to challenge that dominant ideology. And of course the old guard will do everything in their power to intimidate them.\u201d Clennon admits: \u201cI considered requesting anonymity for this interview, but I\u2019m an old-timer, and I don\u2019t have as much to lose as the younger folks who feel empathy and solidarity with the people of Palestine. \u201cOther actors, writers and industry employees have been fired, or threatened, for criticising the ideology and practice of Zionism. But these same criticisms are made by Israelis themselves \u2013 intellectuals and political activists. It\u2019s ironic that there is more open debate about Zionism in Israel than is allowed in Hollywood.\u201d Among those who have paid the price for speaking out is Susan Sarandon. The Oscar-winning actor and activist was dropped by the United Talent Agency (UTA) after comments she made at a recent pro-Palestinian rally in New York: \u201cThere are a lot of people that are afraid, afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence.\u201d Variety magazine reported that several agents at UTA also demanded that the agency axe writer Ta-Nehisi Coates after he led an open letter that used language including: \u201cHamas militants broke out of Gaza. More than 1,300 Israelis were subsequently killed.\u201d But Coates survived. The Creative Arts Agency (CAA) has also been shaken. Last month one of its most prominent agents, Maha Dakhil, resigned her board seat after sharing a social media post accusing Israel of genocide; she later apologised. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin subsequently announced he was quitting CAA, saying: \u201cMaha isn\u2019t an antisemite, she\u2019s just wrong.\u201d According to Variety, a group of assistants threatened to walk out over CAA\u2019s treatment of Dakhil, who will continue as an agent. The magazine noted: \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt that her most important client, Tom Cruise, made it known to CAA that he was backing her. Cruise met with Dakhil at her CAA office on 15 November. A knowledgeable source says he took the rare step of going in person to show support for his embattled agent.\u201d But CAA did sever ties with assistant Jouman Barakat, who described all participants at a pro-Israel rally as white supremacists, and writing team Regina Jackson and Saira Rao after the latter posted on social media: \u201cZionists are starting to panic that more and more of the world sees them for the bloodthirsty genocidal ghouls they are.\u201d Meanwhile the actor Melissa Barrera was fired from the film Scream VII by production company Spyglass Media over social media posts interpreted as antisemitic. Barrera had described Israel as committing \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201cbrutally killing innocent Palestinians, mothers and children, under the pretence of destroying Hamas\u201d. The industry\u2019s punishments worry free speech advocates such as Donzaleigh Abernathy, an actor and activist who is the daughter of civil rights stalwart Ralph Abernathy and goddaughter of Martin Luther King. She says: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the actors who suffered because they\u2019ve expressed their opinion. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. The bottom line is we\u2019ve got to figure out how to save lives and we shouldn\u2019t punish each other. Are the advocates of war being punished and discriminated against? I don\u2019t know. But the war has to stop and the hostages must be freed.\u201d Many artists do continue to take a stand. Bradley Cooper, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Selena Gomez, Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Jenna Ortega, Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Ruffalo and Mark Rylance were among more than 260 who signed a letter urging Joe Biden and Congress to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. So too was Nixon, a former candidate for New York governor whose film credits include Amadeus, James White and A Quiet Passion. Sitting outside the White House with Muslim and Jewish activists and state legislators, she argues that the term antisemitic is being abused in an effort to silence critics. \u201cTwo of my three children are Jewish and their grandparents are Holocaust survivors,\u201d Nixon says. \u201cMy oldest son in particular is very active in the demonstrations and he was arrested about a week and a half ago. For him, never again means never again for anybody and, as the grandchild of survivors, it\u2019s so incredibly personal for him. \u201cAntisemitism is no joke. It\u2019s a terrifying force: 6 million Jews were killed in world war two. But to see anybody saying that any criticism of the far-right Israeli government, which is wildly unpopular with its own people, is antisemitic? Antisemitism is not a political football to be tossed around by warmongers. It\u2019s a serious thing that we mustn\u2019t tarnish and abuse and put up every time somebody says something that we disagree with or that scares us.\u201d Similar arguments have rattled corporate boardrooms, college campuses, street protests, the halls of Congress and even the Biden White House. A different perspective is offered by some progressive Jews who say they have been shocked by a lack of compassion shown by people with whom they allied in numerous other causes. They feel that many pushing for a ceasefire have repeatedly failed to acknowledge the magnitude of the 7 October assault in which Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals and took around 240 hostages. Last month Michael Seitzman, a film and TV writer and showrunner, published a column on the Deadline website highlighting a letter making the rounds in Hollywood that condemned civilian deaths in Gaza but \u201ccouldn\u2019t find one word for the rape, torture, murder and kidnapping of Jewish civilians, including children\u201d. In a phone interview, Seitzman says: \u201cI\u2019m not perplexed by their criticism of Israel necessarily. I am perplexed by how they manage to ignore what happened on October 7th. If you\u2019re somehow unable to say that rape, murder and kidnapping is antithetical to a civilised society then aren\u2019t you saying that rape, murder and kidnapping is in fact ethical? And shouldn\u2019t you have a problem with that? \u201cIt\u2019s fine to criticise Israel. It\u2019s fine to criticise the [prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu coalition, which I certainly do, and in my piece I do. It\u2019s just odd how many of these people seem to ignore what started all this. They ignore this event that is singularly the most horrific act of barbarism against Jews since the Holocaust.\u201d Seitzman, whose credits include the film North Country and series Code Black, argues that agencies and producers have the right to not work with actors who engage in hate speech. Nor is he impressed by Nixon\u2019s hunger strike in Washington. \u201cWhat\u2019s she planning on doing to free the hostages? I wish that these people who are screaming ceasefire could just spend 10% of their energy saying, let go of the infants that you\u2019re holding hostage. It is confusing to me that there is not even a mention of October 7th in many of these open letters and so many of these protests. It\u2019s depressing but also just incredibly confusing.\u201d The furious finger pointing and scrambled allegiances stand in contrast to the solidarity that Hollywood actors and writers displayed during long strikes this year. In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack, when many organisations issued statements condemning the atrocity, the Writers Guild of America did not, having failed to come to an agreement. Seitzman was among those who felt let down. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for proof that people are afraid to speak out, you need to look no further than the Writers Guild of America. There\u2019s an organisation founded in large part by Jews, likely has the largest percentage of Jewish members of any secular organisation in the country and yet, when confronted with the most horrific, unimaginable acts of evil committed against innocent Jews since the Holocaust, they couldn\u2019t muster up the courage to say a word about it. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not because they don\u2019t view October 7th as horrific. It\u2019s either that they were in disagreement with each other about whether to say something, which to me is already problematic, or they\u2019re fearful of the backlash that they\u2019re going to get.\u201d Some Jewish people have turned to WhatsApp, the mobile messaging platform which, encrypted and invitation-only, allows them to say in private what they prefer not to say in public. It has been an outlet to cite instances of perceived antisemitism or share articles such as a Simon Sebag Montefiore essay for the Atlantic magazine that contends leftist intellectuals are using a fashionable but false ideology, \u201cdecolonization\u201d, to justify the killing of Israeli civilians. Others in Hollywood advocate empathy, humility and lowering the temperature after turbulent years that have witnessed the Trump presidency, a coronavirus pandemic that shut down production and a paralysing double strike. Kieren van den Blink, an actor and writer, says: \u201cMy industry is very sensitive right now and very raw. This issue is very intimate for people. Speaking out, like any action we ever take, is going to have a consequence. That doesn\u2019t mean that the consequences are condoned. It means that we have to be aware that it will, that it could, and that\u2019s all of our own personal responsibility. How far are we willing to go?\u201d Van den Blink resists impulsively tweeting herself into the fray. \u201cI will sit quietly and I will listen because I don\u2019t know enough and I don\u2019t know what it feels like to be Jewish and I don\u2019t know what it feels like to be Palestinian. I don\u2019t want to become part of a violent, angry, racist rhetoric on either side. I want to be part of a solution. I want to be part of love. I want to be part of peace.\u201d Activists pushing for Israel to show restraint and end the bombing welcome the intervention of Hollywood stars who are using their public megaphone. Rae Abileah, who in 2011 disrupted Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to a joint session of Congress, says: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that so many celebrities are speaking out for a ceasefire. \u201cThere has been somewhat of a gag order on people to speak out because there\u2019s been so much fear of repression, of being blacklisted, of being labelled - wrongfully of course \u2013 as antisemitic. The number of people that signed on to a ceasefire and the calibre of celebrities that signed on is pretty amazing. Of course some are facing repercussions and we need to fight back against that because people are facing issues of job loss left and right.\u201d Abileah, a Jewish clergyperson and creative change strategist based in Half Moon Bay, California, recalls meeting Sarandon years ago at a protest against the Iraq war. \u201cShe\u2019s an inspiring person for her consistency of being anti-war but there\u2019s a lot of others who are newcomers who are speaking out and it takes a lot of courage to do that when you think future work might be on the line. \u201cBut it\u2019s nowhere near the amount of courage that it takes to wake up in the morning and go through another day with your children when you\u2019re in Gaza City.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-14T16:00:03Z",
            "content": "It is a precipitous moment for Venezuela and Guyana this week as they meet to address the longstanding dispute over the Essequibo region. Leaders from both nations have said they will come to the table with the Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the St Vincent and Grenadines prime minister Ralph Gonsalves, and the UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. In recent weeks, the two have seemed to be drawing closer to conflict. Venezuela has threatened to annex the densely forested Essequibo region, which constitutes two-thirds of Guyana\u2019s territory, after holding a referendum to seek support. While the Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s pseudo-referendum further exposed his disregard for international law, both countries are reenacting what was a colonial conflict between the British and the Spanish. The prevailing western sentiment asserts that slavery, indentureship and colonialism are mere relics of the past, holding no sway over the future. Such a stance, characterised by intellectual laziness, belies the historical threads woven through the Caribbean islands \u2013 a constellation of minuscule paradises whose tumultuous pasts continue to reverberate. The Caribbean was a contested chessboard, a theatre of geopolitical manoeuvres, where the world\u2019s mightiest engaged in a high-stakes \u201crace for wealth\u201d throughout the 15th century. The Spanish, Portuguese, British, Dutch and French orchestrated a relentless violent exchange of \u201cownership\u201d, leaving in their wake the genocide of Indigenous inhabitants and the legacy of human bondage of stolen Africans. Guyana was once encompassed within \u201cthe Guianas\u201d. This geographical expanse included present-day Guyana (British Guiana), Suriname (Dutch Guiana), French Guiana, the Guayana region in Venezuela (Spanish Guyana), and Amap\u00e1 in Brazil (Portuguese Guiana). The Essequibo dispute has roots centuries deep, involving Spanish, Dutch and British claims. The Dutch ruled until the 1814 treaty handed over control to the British, shaping Guyana\u2019s predominantly plantation-style economy. Then came the discovery of gold. By 1841, Venezuela was contesting the territorial boundaries established by the British-appointed surveyor Robert Hermann Schomburgk, arguing that it violated the understood delineation at the time of Venezuela\u2019s 1811 independence. In 1895, the US president Grover Cleveland intervened. Cleveland\u2019s secretary of state, Richard Olney, revived the Monroe Doctrine, warning Britain against European colonial projects in the western hemisphere. Olney pressed for US sovereignty. The British scepticism of the doctrine\u2019s compatibility with international law led Cleveland to seek congressional authority to appoint a boundary commission while warning Britain of potential military action, a threat that fuelled outrage. Britain eventually yielded to US demands for arbitration. The commission \u2013 two Americans representing Venezuela, two British and one Russian \u2013 was established in 1899 and led to the settling of the border dispute, with some variations. This favoured Britain as it included the prized goldmines, and was contested by Venezuela, which alleged undue pressure on the Russian arbitrator. The dispute simmered on. In 1966, long after the end of British empire, the UK, Venezuela and Guyana signed the Geneva agreement. Despite Guyana\u2019s independence that year, Venezuela explicitly included a claim to the area east of the Essequibo. The Geneva agreement imposed a four-year deadline for resolution. Numerous UN-appointed diplomats attempted to mediate, but no progress was made. In 2018, the UN referred the matter to the international court of justice (ICJ), a move supported by Guyana but opposed by Venezuela, which contested the ICJ\u2019s jurisdiction. Earlier this year, the ICJ affirmed its jurisdiction, paving the way for further legal proceedings. Guyana, uniquely as a South American nation, is paradoxically part of the Caribbean, with cultural, historical and political bonds to neighbouring countries. It is the headquarters for the Caribbean Community (Caricom), which has strongly supported the preservation of Guyana\u2019s sovereignty, condemning any aggressive actions by Venezuela and urging that the dispute be adjudicated at the ICJ. In 2017, 41% of Guyana\u2019s population lived below the poverty line, a telling marker of socioeconomic challenges. Guyana\u2019s economic landscape underwent a paradigm shift when crude oil deposits were unearthed and commercial drilling started in 2019. Guyana achieved 49% GDP growth in 2020, defying the global economic downturn induced by the Covid pandemic. This catapulted the nation into the echelons of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies. The revelation of an estimated 11bn barrels in oil reserves underscores Guyana\u2019s role in the global energy panorama. Should current trends persist, Guyana is poised to emerge as one of the foremost per capita oil producers worldwide by 2030. This discovery constitutes the most substantial addition to global oil reserves since the 1970s, bringing a shift in dynamics of the international energy landscape. Guyana has ascended to the ranks of the Americas\u2019 fourth-highest GDP per capita, behind the US, Canada and the Bahamas, a position that Trinidad and Tobago once held during its \u201coil boom\u201d heyday. Historically, Guyana\u2019s borders have been contested by Venezuela and Suriname but become cemented over time. So why is Maduro acting like the bully in the playground and suddenly threatening annexation to add to his empire, a failed state that has seen 7 million people abandon their home country? A quarter of the Venezuelan population has departed since 2015 as a result of economic and political turmoil. Their primary destination has been Latin America and the Caribbean, where more than 80% of migrants have resettled, many of them facing considerable obstacles to finding housing and employment. This all presents questions about the sudden and aggressive stance of Maduro. Is it driven by the oil discoveries or the involvement of the US oil company Exxon? Or is it the proximity of a potential US military base along the disputed border? Or the Venezuelan electoral landscape? Maduro is in danger of losing the election for the first time in years, especially if the courts authorise the leading opposition candidates. In this scenario, autocratic leaders typically employ a time-honoured strategy of identifying an external adversary to galvanise public sentiment, solidifying their image as the nationalistic hero. Many Caribbean islands are now reflecting on their ties with Venezuela. Venezuela provided crude and refined oil to several Caribbean neighbours under suspiciously favourable terms in 2005. Known as the Petrocaribe alliance, it was supposedly established to promote regional economic cooperation. In reality, it was seen to counterbalance US influence in the region. *** President Biden\u2019s recent decision to lift certain sanctions on Venezuela, aimed at addressing surging crude prices, which had spiked to nearly $90 a barrel after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October, adds another layer to the geopolitics. The conditions attached, calling for free elections in Venezuela, have faced scepticism due to the broader challenges confronting PDVSA, the national oil company, which extends beyond the impact of sanctions. The company has been plagued by deteriorating infrastructure, and production equipment that has been neglected, dismantled and sold for scrap. This, along with rampant corruption, has resulted in substantial losses of $21.2bn. The arrest of PDVSA\u2019s former vice-president and more than 60 government officials and businesspeople on corruption charges in April raised doubts about their ability to revive Venezuela\u2019s collapsing oil industry. So Guyana, predicted to increase its output from 400,000 to 1.2m barrels a day, holds significant importance. Despite a warning from the ICJ, Maduro went ahead with the referendum, which triggered concerns reminiscent of when the former president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez seized all Exxon\u2019s oil assets overnight in 2007. Maduro has already ordered Exxon to leave, and instructed PDVSA to issue new licences. President Biden may appear eager for a confrontation with Venezuela to bolster his position before next year\u2019s US election, but he is potentially setting the stage for another proxy war with Russia, given Putin\u2019s likely support for Maduro. Amid this maelstrom, Thursday\u2019s proposed meeting aims to de-escalate through face-to-face dialogue while Maduro remains committed to historical sovereign rights over Essequibo, and Guyana\u2019s president, Irfaan Ali, reiterates that Guyana\u2019s land borders are non-negotiable. Guterres wants the Essequibo standoff settled peacefully and has urged ICJ cooperation. The ICJ will hold a trial in the spring, despite Venezuela\u2019s rejection of its jurisdiction. Gonsalves has stressed the importance of respectful dialogue, highlighting the urgency of avoiding escalation or use of force. As the drama unfolds, historical grievances, geopolitical interests and economic considerations converge to challenge the destiny of Venezuela and Guyana, and the reverberations will be felt across the Caribbean and Latin American landscape."

            "date": "2023-12-31T07:00:56Z",
            "content": "The Middle East has been slipping towards the precipice of a regional war ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October and the ferocious Israeli response in Gaza. The past week has shown how the cliff edge keeping it from that abyss could quickly crumble away. Within hours of the outbreak of the Gaza war, the Hezbollah Shia militia in Lebanon began to fire on northern Israeli towns and villages in solidarity with Palestinians, triggering Israeli air strikes in response, and Houthi forces in Yemen attacked ships in the Red Sea with real or perceived Israeli connections. The US moved two aircraft carriers and their accompanying strike groups to the region as American bases in Syria and Iraq came under repeated attacks from Iran-affiliated groups, drawing swift retaliation from Washington. At the same time the West Bank erupted in protests at the bombing of civilians in Gaza and extremist Jewish settlers quickly sought to ride the wave of Israeli anger by seizing Palestinian land and terrorising its residents. Each of these theatres of conflict has the potential to ignite a much-feared Middle East conflagration, and the past few days have demonstrated just how easily escalation, intended or not, could bring Israel into open confrontation with Iran, and suck in the US too. An Israeli airstrike just outside Damascus killed a senior figure in Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Sayyed Razi Mousavi, who was responsible for military liaison between Syria and Iran. After Mousavi\u2019s death last Monday, the IRGC issued a statement declaring the \u201cusurper and savage Zionist regime will pay for this crime\u201d. Tehran\u2019s Houthi allies have meanwhile have been firing on the US-led \u201cProsperity Guardian\u201d naval task force assembled to protect shipping in the Red Sea. American warships shot down dozens of drones and also a handful of ballistic missiles. US Central Command issued a statement to say that Washington had \u201cevery reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran\u201d. If a US warship is struck, Joe Biden would be under intense pressure to deliver a decisive response, as he enters an election year with his tenure hanging in the balance and Republicans looking to focus on any trace of weakness. On Thursday, a former Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, wrote a commentary in a US newspaper expressing the view of many on the hawkish end of the security establishments in both the Israel and the US that they are doomed to fight Iranian proxies indefinitely until Iran is taken on directly. \u201cThe evil empire of Iran must be brought down,\u201d Bennett argued in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe US and Israel must set the clear goal of bringing down Iran\u2019s evil regime. Not only is this possible. It is vital for the safety and security of the Middle East \u2013 and the entire civilised world.\u201d On Friday, the UN security council convened to discuss violence on the West Bank, but the session was quickly drawn into a discussion of a regional war. The Israeli ambassador, Gilad Erdan, dismissed the issue of settler violence in the West Bank as a distraction from the threat from Hezbollah in Lebanon. \u201cThe situation in northern Israel is reaching a point of no return,\u201d Erdan said, echoing an increasingly frequent warning from Israeli officials that their country would take matters into its own hands, possibly by carving out a buffer zone in southern Lebanon. \u201cIf these attacks continue, I reiterate the situation will escalate and may lead to a full-scale war. Lebanon must be held accountable for the aggression carried out from its territory,\u201d the Israeli envoy said. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, a UN assistant secretary-general, told security council members that, while most of the exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah had been around the border, some strikes were going deeper into each other\u2019s territory, \u201craising the spectre of an uncontained conflict with devastating consequences for the people of both countries\u201d. Khiari added that \u201cthe risk of miscalculation and further escalation is increasing as the conflict in Gaza continues\u201d. Lana Nusseibeh, the envoy of the United Arab Emirates, expressed the uneasiness of the Arab world that in the absence of \u201cbold and perhaps uncomfortable decisions\u201d to reverse the drift towards regional conflict, \u201cthe alternative is the hellscape of Gaza expanded into the West Bank, Israel, Lebanon, and other parts of the Middle East\u201d. Since the 7 October Hamas attack, the UN estimates that 304 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, including 79 children, along with four Israelis, three of them soldiers. Four more Israelis were killed in West Jerusalem in an attack by Palestinian gunmen on 30 November. One of the dead was mistakenly shot by an Israeli soldier. The disproportionate number of Palestinian dead showed that Israeli forces have been conducting an overkill campaign in an effort to deter an uprising in the West Bank in solidarity with Gaza, argued Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. \u201cThe Israeli mindset is that they think they are preventing a third Intifada,\u201d Elgindy said. \u201cBut I think the way they\u2019re operating, they\u2019re probably more like causing one.\u201d He pointed to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as a particularly volatile element in the combustible state of the region. Overwhelmingly blamed by Israelis for the security lapses that allowed the Hamas attack to happen, Netanyahu faces a fall from power, but only when the fighting ends, or at least lessens in intensity. An escalation, on the other hand, could keep him in his post. \u201cIt is Netanyahu, frankly, who is dictating the terms on all fronts \u2013 in Gaza, on the Lebanon border, across the region \u2013 for Netanyahu\u2019s reasons. This is his war,\u201d Elgindy said. He added: \u201c I think every day that this goes on, you get closer to regional expansion of this whole mess.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-14T02:35:59Z",
            "content": "A decision by the US supreme court to take a case linked to the January 6 attack on the Capitol could have consequences altering the trajectory of the criminal case against Donald Trump over his effort to overturn the 2020 election as well as for hundreds of other people prosecuted for the riot. The nation\u2019s highest court has agreed to consider whether federal prosecutors can charge January 6 riot defendants with a statute that makes it a crime to obstruct an official proceeding of Congress \u2013 a charge also filed against Trump in his 2020 election interference case. The decision by the conservative-dominated court to take up the matter complicates and could delay Trump\u2019s trial in federal district court in Washington, which is currently scheduled for next March. The supreme court\u2019s eventual ruling in Fischer v United States will indicate whether the obstruction charge under section 1512 of title 18 of the US criminal code can be used against Trump, and could undercut the other general conspiracy charges brought against the former president by the special counsel, Jack Smith. The court could also end up by extension invalidating many convictions against rioters involved in the January 6 Capitol attack. The obstruction statute has been the justice department\u2019s primary weapon to hold accountable those involved in the violence of that day. The case involves Joseph Fischer, who was indicted in part on charges that he obstructed the congressional certification of the 2020 election results when he assaulted police officers during the riot. Fischer sought to dismiss part of his indictment, arguing that the obstruction statute passed under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in response to the Enron scandal, had to do with document or evidence tampering. The US district judge Carl Nichols, who presided in the case, interpreted the statute as requiring prosecutors to show that the defendant took some action with respect to a document or record and did not apply to Fischer as he assaulted police officers at the Capitol. But a split three-judge panel at the US court of appeals for the DC circuit reversed the decision, deciding that obstruction applied more broadly and encompassed impeding any official proceeding. Fischer, and two other January 6 defendants, appealed to the supreme court to resolve the issue. The supreme court may not decide whether the obstruction statute can be applied to the Capitol attack until June, when the next term ends. In the meantime, the viability of that charge \u2013 and potentially that of other general conspiracy charges \u2013 against Trump remains uncertain. It could also give Trump a separate opening to pause proceedings in his 2020 election interference case pending the supreme court\u2019s consideration in Fischer, although he is unlikely to succeed; similar cases typically go to trial and then if certain counts are thrown out, the sentences are adjusted. At issue for Trump is the definition of \u201ccorruptly\u201d in the obstruction statute. The DC circuit has been unable to agree, with Judge Justin Walker interpreting it as \u201cunlawful benefit\u201d, while Judge Greg Katsas interpreted it as \u201can unlawful financial, professional, or exculpatory advantage\u201d. The obstruction statute was never a natural fit for January 6 cases, and defense lawyers have repeatedly argued in trial and appeals courts in Washington that the justice department was using it in an overly broad fashion to target rioters because of the 20-year maximum sentence it carries. The problem for the justice department now is that the supreme court has previously chafed at the use of broad conspiracy arguments by federal prosecutors. In the case of Jeffrey Skilling in the Enron scandal, the court held in a unanimous decision that Skilling had been improperly charged with the \u201chonest services\u201d provision of the statute about a scheme to defraud, because it applied only to accepting bribes and kickbacks. \u201cThe court\u2019s been very clear that over-aggressive theories under general criminal statutes don\u2019t fly,\u201d said the former House general counsel Stanley Brand, whose firm Brand Woodward has also represented January 6 defendants. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson of Skilling and all these other cases.\u201d If the supreme court were to rule in favor of Fischer next year on the basis that the justice department was using charges that were too broad, Brand added, it could undercut the other general conspiracy statutes used in the indictment against Trump, as well."

            "title": "Congress passes defense bill authorizing biggest pay rise for troops in 20 years",
            "date": "2023-12-14T16:24:36Z",
            "content": "Congress passed a US defense policy bill on Thursday that authorizes the biggest pay rise for troops in more than two decades, while leaving behind many of the policy priorities that social conservatives were clamoring for. Lawmakers have been negotiating a final bill for months. Some of the priorities championed by social conservatives were a no-go for Democrats, so negotiators dropped them from the final product to get it over the finish line. The bill passed the House on Thursday by 310 to 118, with 73 Republicans and 45 Democrats opposing it. It passed the Senate a day earlier, by a vote of 87-13. House opponents were more vocal about their concerns than in the Senate. It now goes to the president, Joe Biden, to be signed into law. Most notably, the bill does not include language blocking the Pentagon\u2019s abortion travel policy and restricting gender-affirming healthcare for transgender service members and dependents. Republicans prevailed, however, in winning some concessions on diversity and inclusion training in the military. For example, the bill freezes hiring for such training until a full accounting of the programming and costs is completed and reported to Congress. The bill sets key Pentagon policy that lawmakers will attempt to fund through a follow-up appropriations bill. Lawmakers were keen to emphasize how the bill calls for a 5.2% boost in service member pay, the biggest increase in more than 20 years. The bill authorizes $886bn for national defense programs for the current fiscal year that began 1 October, about 3% more than the prior year. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said the bill would ensure \u201cAmerica\u2019s military remains state of the art at all times all around the world\u201d. The bill also includes a short-term extension of a surveillance program aimed at preventing terrorism and catching spies. But the program has detractors on both sides of the political aisle who view it as a threat to the privacy of ordinary Americans. The extension continues a program that permits the US government to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country to gather foreign intelligence. US officials have said the tool, first authorized in 2008 and renewed several times since then, is crucial in disrupting terror attacks, cyber intrusions and other national security threats. It has produced vital intelligence that the US has relied on for specific operations, such as the killing last year of the al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. But the administration\u2019s efforts to secure reauthorization of the program have encountered strong bipartisan pushback. Democrats such as the senator Ron Wyden, who has long championed civil liberties, have aligned with Republican supporters of the former president Donald Trump to demand better privacy protections for Americans and have proposed a slew of competing bills. The White House called for swift passage of the defense bill, saying it \u201cprovides the critical authorities we need to build the military required to deter future conflicts while supporting the servicemembers and their spouses and families who carry out that mission every day\u201d. On Ukraine, the bill includes the creation of a special inspector general for Ukraine to address concerns about whether taxpayer dollars are being spent in Ukraine as intended. That is on top of oversight work already being conducted by other agency watchdogs. On China, the bill establishes a new training program with Taiwan, requires a plan to accelerate deliveries of Harpoon anti-ship missiles to Taiwan, and approves an agreement that enables Australia to access nuclear-powered submarines, which are stealthier and more capable than conventionally powered vessels. Dozens of House Republicans balked because the bill would keep in place a Pentagon rule that allows for travel reimbursement when a service member has to go out of state to get an abortion or other reproductive care. The Biden administration instituted the new rules after the supreme court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion, and some states have limited or banned the procedure. Tommy Tuberville, a Republican senator, had for months blocked the promotion of more than 400 senior military leaders over his objections to the policy."

            "content": "It\u2019s Friday morning at the Kyogle library in the New South Wales northern rivers region and Luca Barbieri is running an Italian language class. His students are seated across from crafters, teenagers studying or downloading videos, people using the bank of computers \u2013 and, of course, those checking out books. There\u2019s a sense of community here that has survived catastrophic local events: the economic devastation of the pandemic followed swiftly by floods that destroyed houses and damaged roads. In 2022-23, the library ran and hosted nearly 250 programs, events, meetings and groups ranging from adults\u2019 colouring-in to a Lego club, says Corinne Hughes, who has worked at Kyogle library for 23 years. When the floods hit in March 2022, residents sought refuge \u2013 and internet services \u2013 at the library. An urn for tea and coffee was set up and jigsaw puzzles came out. As the only place in town with wifi, the library also served as an administration support hub. During the Covid pandemic, Hughes and fellow librarians Cheryl Thompson and Ian McLean sent out packages of books with garden seeds, calm colouring sheets and a positive, handwritten note. \u201cThe phone rang all day and it wasn\u2019t always about books,\u201d says Hughes. \u201cOur message was, and continues to be, we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d All of this was done on a budget of $60.22 per person, funded by the council and the state government. It\u2019s a lot to deliver for the cost of two new books. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Regional libraries that service lower socio-economic areas receive slightly more state government funding than those in wealthier areas, says Morley. Funding starts at $2.85 per capita then grants and levies are added in. Taken together, it amounts to about $50,000 or more per council, which then make up the shortfall. That funding is an increase in previous levels, after a 10-year campaign by local governments resulted in a commitment to boost funding in 2020. The NSW government is set to deliver $40.89m in funding for public libraries in 2023-24, up from $24.53m in 2018-19, with another $6m distributed in grants for infrastructure and service upgrades. In Kyogle, the council budget allocated $473,000 to the library in 2023-24, with the state government contributing $94,154. It\u2019s a \u201cpriceless\u201d investment in the community, says Kyogle\u2019s mayor, Kylie Thomas. Catching those left behind Even with that increased funding, Morley says, services in regional libraries can still be \u201ca bit patchy\u201d, with some not able to open five days a week or provide more than one staff member. But libraries are increasingly called on to deliver a broad range of services. As the social cohesion index plummets to its lowest level in 16 years, they play a vital role as a social hub. Cost-of-living increases and the migration of services online, exacerbated by the closure of local bank branches, leaves many Australians \u2013 particularly older Australians \u2013 in need of help to access the internet. \u201cPeople are asking more of their local library and for that reason we\u2019re encouraging councils to extend services and space,\u201d says Cameron Morley, the head of public library services for the State Library of NSW. \u201cPretty much all of our libraries do computer assistance for older people, often funded through the tech-savvy seniors programs we administer.\u201d Providing access and affordability to all as the digital divide widens is a priority, says Cathie Warburton, CEO of the Australian Library and Information Association (Alia). Libraries, she says, \u201ccatch anyone left behind\u201d. The services that make up that net are broad, and often region-specific. At Lambton library in Newcastle, there is a heavily-frequented centre to repair household goods. At Bathurst library, staff who noticed an increase in people experiencing homelessness visiting the library created a brochure on emergency housing, food and showers. They also created a no-fixed-address membership to promote inclusivity. At Queanbeyan library, staff recently collaborated with Headspace to host a youth wellbeing night, while at Port Stephens library parents were invited to focus on their own health during a week that included yoga and meditation. Most regional libraries also provide a toy library, taking pressure off the family budget, and in some regional libraries including Kyogle, a new speech pathology section has been introduced to support families who have children with learning difficulties. In some communities, services such as Rainbow Storytime \u2013 a Pride event that involves drag queens reading stories to children \u2013 have been delivered against the backdrop of campaigns against inclusive programming, \u201cLibraries have seen people filming books that contain subject matter they may not agree with and effectively calling for libraries to ban them,\u201d Warburton says. \u201cIt is a real threat to democracy.\u201d Alia has provided support to librarians and says it stands firm in its purpose \u2013 to promote a strong, future-focused Australian library and information sector that advances an inclusive and informed society.

            "title": "Why UK chancellor should avoid inheritance tax sugar rush in budget | Arun Advani",
            "date": "2023-12-28T18:30:53Z",
            "content": "Since the summer, there have been rumours that the government is looking to cut inheritance tax. The prospect of an early election has only heightened speculation that this is coming in the March budget. While commentators and pundits argue over the question of whether or not a cut is coming, they miss the more important question: how would an inheritance tax cut be made? When he stands up on 6 March, Jeremy Hunt will have two options for how he could make such a cut. The first, reported to be popular on the right of the party, is simply to cut the headline rate. Halving it to 20% would cost about \u00a35bn, and would provide a short-term sugar rush \u2013 a big, bold, headline-grabbing move that might sound good now but would ultimately need to be paid for. Deferring the pain might be politically sensible \u2013 the current polls suggest finding the money later won\u2019t be Hunt\u2019s problem \u2013 but would damage any claims the Conservatives might want to make about fiscal responsibility, unless paired with specific spending cuts, which would rather blunt the electoral benefits. The benefits would also be extremely concentrated: four-fifths of the gain would go to millionaires, and the top 5% would get \u00a3180,000 each. Unsurprisingly, the majority of the benefit would go to those in London and the south-east, so many constituencies would see little gain, even in Conservative seats. The more responsible alternative would be to reform inheritance tax by closing loopholes to pay for a lower headline rate or a higher wealth threshold after which it is paid. The biggest of these loopholes is the unlimited amount of farmland, private businesses and AIM shares that can be passed on entirely tax-free. These tax breaks are the key reason that HMRC\u2019s own figures show the average rate of inheritance tax paid by estates worth more than \u00a310m was just 17%, lower than the rate paid by estates worth \u00a31.5-\u00a32m (20%) \u2013 just half of the headline rate of 40%. And these figures are before accounting for the far greater use of trusts by the wealthiest. While there are some social arguments for wanting to protect small family farms and family businesses, the current tax breaks have perverse effects. Uncapped relief for agricultural land leads farms to be snapped up by the very wealthy. Such policies can lead to local farmers being priced out. The tax break for private businesses is both badly targeted and smacks of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Four in every five pounds of the relief \u2013 totalling more than \u00a31bn \u2013 applies to AIM shares, where the deceased is just an arm\u2019s-length investor. Even among businesses where the deceased actually ran the organisation, most of the tax break goes to a small number of individuals with extremely large businesses, not to the many who run small plumbing or corner store businesses. About 90% of business wealth passed on comes from an estate worth more than \u00a32m. A happy medium might be to cap these reliefs at \u00a31m per couple, on top of the current \u00a31m that a couple with a house would typically have. This protects genuinely small farms and businesses, while ensuring that wealthier individuals actually pay. Doing this, alongside tidying up the treatment of pensions in inheritance tax, would allow a revenue-neutral cut in inheritance tax from 40% to 30% for estates worth less than \u00a32m. A related reform that stopped capital gains tax from being wiped out at death would allow a revenue-neutral cut to 20% rather than 30%. The number of direct beneficiaries from any reform to inheritance tax would be small. Even accounting for growing wealth among the generations coming to the end of their life, only one in 10 people will have inheritance tax paid on either their death or that of their spouse/civil partner. Choosing reform, rather than a straight cut, would benefit all but the wealthiest 1%, who would lose access to the concessions that allow them to reduce their tax rate. Reform would make the system fairer and deliver a large reduction in the rate that affects most of those who pay inheritance tax. For a chancellor keen to deal with immediate political concerns and to leave a legacy, the current mess of inheritance tax provides a real opportunity.

            "title": "Jeremy Hunt fuels election speculation as 6 March spring budget announced",
            "date": "2023-12-27T19:18:55Z",
            "content": "Jeremy Hunt has announced that a spring budget expected to feature a host of tax cuts will be held on 6 March, fuelling speculation over an early general election. While government sources insisted nothing should be read into the date, it is the earliest the set-piece fiscal event has been held in 13 years of Conservative government \u2013 apart from 2021 when the Treasury was trying to kickstart the economy after Covid. Budgets must take place before the end of March, but are more commonly scheduled for the second or third week of the month. The decision to hold it at the beginning of the month has prompted speculation that Sunak has not ruled out an early vote, despite currently abject poll ratings. The announcement was made in a Treasury tweet saying Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, had commissioned the Office for Budget Responsibility to prepare forecasts for the economy and public finances and will reaffirm Labour\u2019s decision to prepare for a possible spring election. Keir Starmer has already ordered his shadow ministers to finalise their manifesto policies by mid-January, in time for the manifesto to be completed by 8 February, the Guardian revealed. A Labour source said: \u201cWhatever they tell people, every decision the Tories have made has been geared to calling an election in May, if they believe that is to their advantage. \u201cLabour will be ready whenever they call it but for the country\u2019s sake, the sooner people are given a chance to turn the page on the Tory years and make a new start, the better.\u201d Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said the early March budget was \u201ca last throw of the dice by a flailing Conservative government\u201d. Whatever election date is chosen, the budget will almost certainly be Hunt\u2019s last major set piece fiscal event before it takes place, and he is under increasing pressure from Tory backbenchers to slash taxes. There is particular focus on inheritance tax, the abolition of which is the subject of a vehement joint campaign by backbenchers and some newspapers, despite the fact it currently affects the estates of fewer than 4% of Britons. Downing Street is actively thinking about whether to entirely scrap inheritance tax, the Telegraph reported, as part of a wider \u201cgear change\u201d on tax in the budget. However, a No 10 source said it was speculation, and not an idea being pushed by Downing Street. Asked about scrapping inheritance tax, Sunak\u2019s deputy spokesperson declined to comment directly, but stressed both the limited scope of the tax \u2013 fewer than 4% of estates currently pay it \u2013 and the amount of money it raises. \u201cOn inheritance tax more broadly, the vast majority of estates do not pay inheritance tax, and the tax is forecast to contribute almost \u00a310bn a year by 2028-29 to help fund public services that millions of us rely on,\u201d she said. There is also some division among Tory MPs about the idea. Jonathan Gullis, a former minister on the right of the party, tweeted that while he wanted inheritance tax to be scrapped, a priority should be cuts to income tax. Neil O\u2019Brien, another former minister, pointed to polling suggesting that most people would prefer tax cuts that help lower and middle earners. Under the current rules an election takes place 25 working days after parliament is dissolved. A 2 May vote, a date that would coincide with local elections in England and Wales, would thus require dissolution by 28 March. Such an early budget could even allow Sunak\u2019s government to try to rush a slimmed-down finance bill through parliament, putting any tax cuts into law. This would force Labour to say whether or not they would repeal the tax cuts. This was done in 1992 when John Major\u2019s Conservative government passed a tax-cutting finance bill within days of the budget, and went on to unexpected victory in a spring election. While this precedent might seem alluring, Tory ministers and strategists will note that before 1992 Labour had a poll lead of at best a few percentage points, not the near-20 point margin enjoyed by Keir Starmer. Many Conservative ministers still believe an election later in 2024 \u2013 by law it must happen before 28 January 2025 \u2013 is still more likely. The 6 March date also gives Hunt time to make changes to fuel duty before the expiry of a temporary 5p cut in the tax on petrol, diesel and other fuels, which would come alongside a planned inflation-matching rise pencilled in for the end of the month."

            "content": "Incidents of sexual harassment and assault have been on the rise across the US military for roughly the last 15 years. Now, a new law has been passed that will change how they are dealt with, putting independent lawyers in charge of decisions and sidelining commanders. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important reform to our military justice system since the creation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1950,\u201d the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said in a statement. Under the new system, which was made effective on 28 December, special counsels will have the power to make prosecution decisions on several offenses such as murder, rape and domestic violence within the military. These special counsels are in effect legal organizations within each military service and will be spread nationwide. There will be more counsels positioned near large bases or in locations with higher numbers of reported crimes. Officials told the Associated Press that the army will have 65 certified trial counsels, the air force 40, the marines 33 and the navy 24. Each counsel will handle as many as 50 investigations and roughly eight to 12 trials annually. In 2022, Congress passed legislation to strengthen support for service members, and in July, President Joe Biden approved the special counsel system, spearheaded by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, but also supported by Republicans such as Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa. The special counsel system followed increased pressure from members of Congress, who believed that the commanders previously in charge of making prosecution decisions have failed to take victims\u2019 complaints seriously or try to protect alleged perpetrators in their units. These members of Congress were supported by military activists and advocate groups, all of whom have been pushing for an impartial justice system independent from the military chain of command. Last year, the air force, the marines and the navy saw increased reports of sexual assault and harassment, according to the Pentagon\u2019s annual report on sexual assault in the military. Incidents rose 13% in the navy, 9% in the air force and 3.6% in the marines. Although there was a 9% drop in claims from within the army, there were still 8,942 reports of sexual assault across the entire force. The number of reported assaults like these have increased nearly every year since 2006. In a confidential survey conducted in 2018, 20,000 service members said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact. US military officials said this rose to 36,000 in the same poll conducted four years later. While it is not clear at this point what impact the new law will have, whether it will lead to more prosecutions, or if it will do anything to influence the wider systematic issue of sexual assault in the military, many are convinced it\u2019s a step in the right direction. \u201cI fought for nearly a decade to reform the military justice system,\u201d said Gillibrand on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cIt took a long time to pass my reforms, but finally, victims of sexual assault and other serious crimes have the independent, impartial justice system they deserve,\u201d she added. Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732). Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html"

Speaking afterwards, Lindsey Graham, a senator for South Carolina, told reporters that he had told Zelenskiy that the problem was \u201cnothing to do with you\u201d. He added: \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019ve done everything anybody could ask of you. This is not your problem here.\u2019\u201d The senior Republican went on to accuse the White House of having failed to tackle the southern border issue and called for \u201cthe commander in chief\u201d \u2013 Joe Biden \u2013 to become personally involved in the negotiations. Senate Republicans last week blocked an emergency aid package primarily for Ukraine and Israel after conservatives complained at the exclusion of immigration policy changes they had demanded as part of the package. Zelenskiy sought to reassure senators concerned about whether US military aid would be wasted because of corruption, Mike Rounds, a Republican, told CNN, and that Ukraine needed more air defence systems to support its counteroffensives. Senior Democrats, meanwhile, expressed frustration with the lack of progress. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, said \u201cThe one person happiest right now about the gridlock in Congress is Vladimir Putin. He is delighting in the fact that Donald Trump\u2019s border policies are sabotaging military aid to Ukraine.\u201d The Ukrainian president then moved on to a meeting with Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat House minority leader, and after that with the recently elected Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who has been relatively sceptical about further financial support for Ukraine. After their meeting, Johnson complained that the White House was asking Congress to approve the spending of billions of dollars \u201cwith no appropriate oversight, without a clear strategy to win\u201d. Johnson added that \u201cour first condition on any national security supplemental spending package is about our own national security first\u201d but he also insisted that the US did stand with Zelenskiy \u201cagainst Putin\u2019s brutal invasion\u201d. Zelenskiy posted a picture on X, formerly Twitter, of him addressing senators, saying he had had \u201ca friendly and candid conversation\u201d. He emphasised the importance of US military aid in his country\u2019s fight against Russia. Moscow said it was watching developments closely. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said that \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d already provided by Washington had failed to turn the tide of war and more money would make little difference. Zelenskiy\u2019s authority was being undermined by the failures, he added. Congress is due to break for the year on Friday and there appeared little prospect of a breakthrough that would allow a funding package to be passed before then \u2013 meaning that negotiations will have to pick up in the new year at a time when the amounts available to Ukraine are running short. Last week, Shalanda Young, the White House\u2019s director of the office of management and budget, said that the Pentagon had used up 97% of the $62.3bn Ukraine allocations previously authorised by Congress, while the state department has none of its $4.7bn remaining. Zelenskiy is due to hold a private meeting with Biden and a joint press conference in the afternoon. The White House has previously signalled it is willing to make concessions on the Mexico border issue as it tries to get the funding package through. Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the White House national security council, said Russia believes that \u201ca military deadlock through the winter will drain western support for Ukraine\u201d, ultimately handing Moscow the advantage. Newly declassified US intelligence concluded that the war had cost Russia 315,000 dead and injured troops, amounting to nearly 90% of the personnel it had before the war, started in February 2022. In Ukraine, the country\u2019s biggest mobile phone network, Kyivstar, was badly hit on Tuesday by what appeared to be the largest cyber-attack of the war with Russia so far. Phone signals, the internet and some of Kyiv region\u2019s air alert system were knocked out, in an attack that the company\u2019s chief executive was \u201ca result of\u201d the war with Russia. Ukrainian sources indicated that the attack was not financially motivated, but destructive in nature, and it was unclear who precisely was responsible. The country\u2019s SBU intelligence service said it was investigating whether the attack had been directed by one of Russia\u2019s intelligence agencies."

            "date": "2023-12-28T19:52:39Z",
            "content": "Venezuela\u2019s president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has ordered more than 5,600 military personnel to participate in \u201cdefensive\u201d exercises, after the UK deployed a warship to waters off the coast of Guyana in a show of support for the former British colony. Maduro said he was launching an action \u201cof a defensive nature in response to the provocation and threat of the UK against peace and the sovereignty of our country\u201d. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) on Sunday announced that it would send the patrol vessel HMS Trent to Guyana, amid a simmering territorial dispute that began when Maduro renewed Venezuela\u2019s claim to the oil-rich Essequibo region. The 62,000 sq mile (160,000 sq km) Essequibo region is generally recognised as part of Guyana but, in recent years, Venezuela has revived its claim to the territory and offshore areas after major oil and gas discoveries. Tensions rose sharply this month after voters in a Venezuelan referendum backed a move to make the Essequibo area a new Venezuelan state and rejected the jurisdiction of the international court of justice (ICJ), which is hearing the case on the border dispute. Guyana and Venezuela agreed earlier this month to avoid the use of force and resist increasing tensions. Royal Navy patrol vessel HMS Trent is visiting Guyana, a British ally and former colony, as part of a series of engagements in the region, the MoD said, without referring to Venezuela or the border dispute. \u201cIt is the breaking of the spirit of dialogue, diplomacy and peace of the agreements,\u201d Maduro said on Thursday. He said the deployment was \u201cpractically a military threat from London\u201d. Maduro has ordered \u201cthe activation of a joint defensive action of the Bolivarian national armed forces\u201d off the coast of Essequibo, he said in a state televised broadcast, but did not give more information. \u201cWe believe in diplomacy, in dialogue, in peace,\u201d said Maduro. \u201cBut no one should threaten Venezuela, no one should mess with Venezuela. We are men of peace, we are a people of peace, but we are warriors and this threat is unacceptable for any sovereign country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe threat of the decadent, rotten, ex-empire of the United Kingdom is unacceptable.\u201d Military leaders in Venezuela\u2019s east said during the broadcast that 5,600 uniformed personnel were ready for the operation. In a statement, Venezuela\u2019s foreign ministry said the country \u201creserves all actions, within the framework of the constitution and international law, to defend its maritime and territorial integrity\u201d. A UK foreign minister, David Rutley, visited Guyana earlier this month and reiterated that its territorial integrity should be respected. \u201cThe border issue has been settled for more than 120 years \u2026 We welcome the recent agreement by Venezuela \u2026 to refrain from the use of force and any further escalation.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-02T10:00:43Z",
            "content": "Wealthy nations should divert 5% of their military budgets to climate finance, advocates argue. The call comes as global leaders at Cop28 in Dubai gather for a special-themed day on \u201crelief, recovery, and peace\u201d on Sunday, marking the first time climate-fueled conflict has ever been on an international climate conference agenda. Participants will discuss the need to direct aid to \u201chighly vulnerable, fragile, and conflict-affected communities\u201d as evidence mounts that climate disasters put regions at greater risk of war, and amid ongoing conflict in Palestine as well as Ukraine, Sudan, and other areas. But truly protecting communities from climate and conflict will require a shift in priorities, says the Transnational Institute, an international research and advocacy group. \u201cMoney is being spent on militarization rather than on climate action,\u201d said Nick Buxton, a researcher with the Transnational Institute, \u201cthough the climate crisis is the biggest [common] security threat that we face today.\u201d By diverting just 5% of global military budgets, the world could raise $110.4bn for climate finance \u2013 more than enough to meet a repeatedly broken annual climate finance target of $100bn, the organization has found. \u201cNational \u2013 and global \u2013 security in the 21st century will depend on limiting the rise in temperature and resulting havoc more than on any other thing,\u201d said the environmental activist and author Bill McKibben. The world\u2019s militaries produce at least 5.5% of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 more than the total footprint of Japan \u2013 according to one 2022 estimate. But no country is required to provide data on military emissions thanks to successful lobbying by the US at the Kyoto conference in 1997. Leaders removed the exemption in 2015 but made reporting military emissions optional. Military spending has grown by more than a quarter in the past decade, exceeding $2.2tn in 2022. During the same time period, attempts to mobilize funds for climate finance have faltered. In 2009, for instance, rich countries agreed to spend $100bn on climate finance for developing world annually by 2020, but they broke that promise, providing only $90bn for climate finance in 2021. Preliminary data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released this month indicates that the $100bn goal may have finally been met in 2022, but some experts say that assessment is based on inflated numbers. A 2022 investigation from Oxfam concluded that due to wealthy nations\u2019 \u201cdishonest and misleading\u201d accounting, climate finance estimates in 2020 were as much as 225% too high. Even if it turns out wealthy nations genuinely met the commitment, said Buxton, countries should still reallocate 5% of their military budgets. The $100bn number is widely understood to be far below the true need in poor countries; one 2022 report found that developing nations need $1tn per year to cope with the climate crisis. Highly polluting nations will also need to come up with funding for loss and damage in poor countries. The need is already greater than $400bn annually and rising, by one estimate. Countries with the largest militaries \u2013 largely the richest, most polluting nations \u2013 should bear the most responsibility for cutting global defense spending, the researchers say. They place particular focus on Nato, whose 31 members include the UK, Canada and the US, whose military, which is the world\u2019s top-funded, is also the world\u2019s largest institutional emitter. Nato members accounted for more than half of all global military spending last year, and budgets are expected to rise. This year, members made \u201can enduring commitment to invest at least 2%\u201d of their national budgets to their militaries. If that promise is fulfilled, by 2028, the additional funding would be enough to pay for all needed climate adaptation in hard-hit countries for seven years, the researchers calculated based on United Nations data. Increased militarization harms climate-affected countries in other ways, too, the researchers say. For instance, they found that Nato members are currently selling arms to 39 of the 40 most climate-vulnerable countries; 17 of which are already in armed conflict. \u201cIt\u2019s a real perversion: rather than providing support for communities we are actually making the situation more dangerous and more unstable,\u201d said Buxton. Diverting some military spending to climate finance would make the world safer, said Perry O\u2019Brien, climate justice organizer at US veteran-led advocacy group Common Defense. \u201cWe know true national security means protecting people and communities from harm,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-12-29T03:17:14Z",
            "content": "The US military\u2019s secretive X-37B robot spaceplane has blasted off from Florida on its seventh mission, the first launched atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket capable of delivering it to a higher orbit than ever before. As on previous missions, there\u2019s no one on board the reusable plane, which resembles a mini space shuttle and carries classified experiments. The Falcon Heavy, composed of three rocket cores strapped together, took off from Nasa\u2019s Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral more than two weeks late because of technical issues. Three earlier countdowns were aborted due to poor weather and unspecified technical issues, leading ground crews to roll the spacecraft back to its hangar before proceeding with Thursday\u2019s flight. The launch came two weeks after China\u2019s robot spaceplane, known as the Shenlong, or \u201cDivine Dragon,\u201d was launched on its third mission to orbit since 2020, adding a new twist to the growing US-Sino rivalry in space. The Pentagon has disclosed few details about the X-37B mission, which is conducted by the US Space Force under the military\u2019s national security space launch programme. Thursday\u2019s launch marked the seventh flight of an X-37B, which has logged more than 10 years in orbit since its debut in 2010. The last flight, the longest one yet, lasted two and a half years before ending on a runway at Kennedy a year ago. The Pentagon has not said how high the spaceplane will fly this time. But in a statement last month, the air force rapid capabilities office said mission No. 7 would involve tests of \u201cnew orbital regimes, experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies.\u201d The X-37B also is carrying a Nasa experiment to study how plant seeds are affected by prolonged exposure to the harsh environment of radiation in space. The ability to cultivate crops in space has major implications for keeping astronauts nourished during future long-term missions to the moon and Mars. China\u2019s equally secretive Shenlong was carried to space on 14 December by a Long March 2F rocket, a launch system less powerful than SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy and believed to be limited to delivering payloads to low-Earth orbit. Still, Space Force General B Chance Saltzman told reporters at an industry conference earlier this month he expected China to launch Shenlong at around the same time as the X-37B flight in what he suggested was a competitive move. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the Chinese are extremely interested in our spaceplane. We\u2019re extremely interested in theirs,\u201d Saltzman said, according to remarks published in Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine, a US aerospace journal. \u201cThese are two of the most watched objects on orbit while they\u2019re on orbit. It\u2019s probably no coincidence that they\u2019re trying to match us in timing and sequence of this,\u201d he said. The planned duration of the latest X-37B mission has not been made public, but it will presumably run until June 2026 or later, given the prevailing pattern of successively longer flights. Built by Boeing, the X-37B resembles Nasa\u2019s retired space shuttles but they\u2019re just one-fourth the size at 29 feet (9 metres) long. No astronauts are needed; the X-37B has an autonomous landing system. They take off vertically like rockets but land horizontally like planes, and are designed to orbit between 150 miles and 500 miles (240 kilometres and 800 kilometres) high.

            "content": "Cyber-hackers have targeted the company behind a \u00a350bn project to build a vast underground nuclear waste store in Britain, its developer has said. Radioactive Waste Management, the company behind the Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) project, has said that hackers unsuccessfully attempted to breach the business using LinkedIn. RWM is the government-owned entity behind a trio of nuclear bodies that merged last year to create Nuclear Waste Services (NWS). The new body brought together the GDF project, the long-established Low Level Waste Repository in west Cumbria and another body responsible for managing waste to develop a store expected to last 175 years. In accounts for RWM filed at Companies House, NWS\u2019s chief executive, Corhyn Parr, said of the merger that \u201cwe have seen instances of potential exploitation of ownership change through specific attack vectors, predominantly LinkedIn targeting\u201d. Parr said that none of the \u201ccyber incidents\u201d at RWM last year had had a \u201cmaterial effect\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cNWS has seen, like many other UK businesses, that LinkedIn has been used as a source to identify the people who work within our business. These attempts were detected and denied through our multi-layered defences.\u201d Experts have warned that social media sites are used by hackers to break through security mechanisms in a number of ways. These include creating fake business accounts, deceptive messages to gather information or cause recipients to click on malicious links, as well as directly trying to steal users credentials for other secure logins. This type of social engineering \u2013 which also includes attacks via email, phone and text \u2013 can be a gateway to gain sensitive information from companies and individuals. The government is in the process of finding a site for the GDF project, a subterranean network tunnels and vaults designed to house Britain\u2019s highly radioactive nuclear waste. The project is forecast to cost between \u00a320bn and \u00a353bn, and expected to receive its first waste in the 2050s. It echoes similar deep repository projects in Finland and France. Earlier this year, Allerdale in Cumbria was deemed geologically unsuitable for the facility, leaving two other sites in Cumbria and one on the Lincolnshire coast remaining on the shortlist. NWS is in the process of surveying each site and convincing communities to approve of a development, in the face of local opposition. Parr said that NWS\u2019s \u201cfocus is around the threat intent and activity\u201d around development consent for a GDF. Against this backdrop, the company said threats included \u201ca cyber event, social engineering, fake news, attempts to gain information around community partnerships, online activism and staff safety in the online world\u201d. LinkedIn has alerted users to possible scams in the past and posted ways to avoid being harmed. Digital security in the nuclear industry has been in focus since the Guardian revealed a string of problems with cybersecurity at the Sellafield site in Cumbria. A spokesperson for NWS said: \u201cLike many nationally significant sectors we recognise we will always be a target for cyber threats. \u201cThere has never been a cyber incident at NWS which has disrupted our business or site operations. Low-level phishing attempts have been detected and denied through our cyber defences. We have no evidence that suggests cyber threats are being used to influence local opinion on where a Geological Disposal Facility could be located. \u201cWe remain vigilant and focused on further strengthening our approach to ensure the highest standards of cybersecurity and we continuously improve our continuity and recovery planning in line with our evolving business need.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-22T13:29:30Z",
            "content": "A former national security adviser Sir Stephen Lovegrove is to join the Rolls-Royce-led consortium developing small nuclear reactors as chair of its board, raising concerns about the revolving door between the public and private sectors. The role, which has been approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), will begin in the new year. Lovegrove\u2019s background as a permanent secretary, the most senior civil servant, in the energy department from 2013-2016 are likely to prove valuable to the consortium. Lovegrove will be paid for his part-time role at Rolls-Royce SMR, a consortium that includes the Qatar Investment Authority as a partner. Rolls-Royce SMR is developing small modular reactor technology in part funded by the UK government. The relationship is managed through Great British Nuclear (GBN), an arm\u2019s-length body of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). GBN\u2019s non-executive directors include Hugo Robson, a senior civil servant who is the chief commercial negotiator for DESNZ. Robson has previously worked under Lovegrove in the energy department and in 2017 they gave evidence to a Commons select committee together. GBN is running a competition with six companies vying for lucrative contracts to build the small modular reactors the government hopes will expand nuclear power in the UK. Billions of pounds of public and private investment await the companies that successfully develop small modular reactors. Lovegrove will begin his work for Rolls-Royce SMR in 2024 when GBN hopes to announce contracts by the summer. His role as chair will include managing stakeholder and shareholder relations. Acoba has given Lovegrove, who served as permanent secretary in a predecessor department to DESNZ from 2013 to 2016, permission to \u201cdraw on his skills and experience gained in office to advise the Rolls-Royce SMR Board on its strategy and proposals. That includes those related to government funding [\u2026] provided he does not draw on any privileged information or contacts from his time in office\u201d. Along with the other members of the company\u2019s board, Lovegrove will review, scrutinise and approve proposals by Rolls-Royce SMR\u2019s executive on the \u201cdeployment of its small modular reactors with proposed customers \u2013 including GBN\u201d. The Guardian has discovered, however, that while Lovegrove and Rolls-Royce SMR told Acoba he has had \u201cno prior contact or engagement with the individuals within GBN\u201d, he has known and worked with DESNZ\u2019s chief commercial negotiator for a number of years. Lovegrove signed a letter in 2015 formalising Robson\u2019s appointment to a senior role on the Hinkley Point C nuclear power project, noting Robson was a member of the department\u2019s senior leadership team. In 2017, Robson and Lovegrove, by then the permanent secretary at the MoD, gave evidence to the public accounts committee in the same hearing on Hinkley Point C. At times, Lovegrove suggested Robson may be better placed to answer the committee\u2019s questions. Now, Lovegrove is in a position to advise Rolls-Royce SMR as it prepares to negotiate with GBN, with years of experience as a senior manager to Robson, a non-executive director of GBN, which has given him a vantage point to understand his negotiation strategies, thinking and character, if Robson has a role in the negotiations. DESNZ refused to say what role, if any, Robson might play in negotiations on behalf of GBN. They said the GBN competition had \u201crobust conflict of interest policies\u201d. Rolls-Royce SMR told Acoba that Lovegrove will not be involved in developing bids or contributing to the negotiation process run by GBN. A spokesperson for Rolls-Royce SMR said Lovegrove has had no dealings with, contact or engagement, with the individuals at GBN in relation to their roles there. Lovegrove did not comment. An Acoba spokesperson said: \u201cAcoba does not consider that engagement with individuals during his time at DECC seven years ago and who are now with GBN would be material to this application.\u201d Rose Whiffen, a senior research officer at Transparency International UK, said: \u201cUnfortunately, there are threadbare rules in place to regulate the so-called revolving door but at the very least, former officials should be able to abide by these, including full transparency about their time in government.\u201d"

Israeli tanks have reached the heart of Gaza\u2019s southern city of Khan Younis, as Hamas issued fresh demands for Palestinian prisoners to be released while at the same time threatening the lives of the hostages they continue to hold. Residents of Khan Younis said tanks could be seen on the main north-south road through the city on Sunday after intense combat through the night that had slowed the Israeli advance from the east. Warplanes were reported to be pounding the area west of the assault. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said dozens of Hamas fighters had surrendered, calling it the beginning of the end for the organisation. The Palestinian militant group denied this, calling the claim \u201cfalse and baseless\u201d. In a statement yesterday, Hamas said none of the hostages that were still being held would leave Gaza alive unless its demands for prisoner releases by Israel were met. In a televised statement, a Hamas spokesperson said the movement was \u201cready to release all soldiers in exchange for all our prisoners\u201d. Why is the US president under scrutiny over his support for Israel? The support of Joe Biden\u2019s administration for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has come under intensified scrutiny after it revealed it had bypassed Congress to supply tank shells, and was reported not to be carrying out continual assessments of whether Israel was committing possible war crimes. Zelenskiy to visit Washington in attempt to break Senate deadlock on Ukraine aid Biden has invited his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to the White House, days after his administration warned it would run out of money for Ukraine aid in weeks unless feuding US lawmakers act. The meeting on Tuesday is intended \u201cto underscore the United States\u2019 unshakeable commitment to supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia\u2019s brutal invasion\u201d, the White House said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cAs Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine, the leaders will discuss Ukraine\u2019s urgent needs and the vital importance of the United States\u2019 continued support at this critical moment.\u201d Republican senators last week blocked $106bn in emergency aid primarily for Ukraine and Israel after conservatives balked at the exclusion of immigration reforms they had demanded as part of the package. What will Zelenskiy do while in Washington? As well as meeting Biden, he has also been invited to address US senators on Tuesday morning in the Capitol, a Senate leadership aide said. A private meeting between Zelenskiy and the US House of Representatives speaker, Mike Johnson, will also be held in the Capitol on Tuesday, Johnson\u2019s spokesperson Raj Shah said in an email to Reuters. What are opponents to US support for Ukraine up to? Allies of Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, will hold a closed-door meeting with Republicans in Washington to push for an end to US military support for Ukraine, the Guardian has learned. Members of the Hungarian Institute of International Affairs and staff from the Hungarian embassy in Washington will on Monday begin a two-day event hosted by the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank, with some attenders, including Republican members of Congress, invited to join closed-door talks the next day. Trump says he won\u2019t return to witness stand in $250m New York fraud trial Donald Trump announced he would not take the witness stand for a second time at his fraud trial in New York today, the former US president\u2019s last chance to make his case as he contests a potential $250m fine that hangs over his family business. Trump had been expected to take the stand again as the hearings draw to a close. But yesterday he announced on the Truth Social site that he would no longer be making an appearance. Trump first testified in court on 6 November, an appearance that was more political rally than attempt to persuade judge Arthur Engoron of his innocence. Engoron has already ruled that fraud took place and is using the trial to weigh what punishment he will mete out. What is the trial about? The New York attorney general, Letitia James, has argued that Trump, his adult sons and other company executives inflated the value of their assets in order to obtain more favorable loans. What is their defence? Trump\u2019s team has argued through witness testimony that the former president had the right to value his properties however he pleased, and that it was up to lenders and accountants to make sure the numbers were right. In other news \u2026 The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has been speaking to reporters at Cop28, underlining the significance of the next few hours of negotiations. \u201cCop28 is scheduled to wrap up tomorrow, but there are still large gaps that need to be bridged. Now is the time for maximum ambition and maximum flexibility,\u201d he said. Rudy Giuliani, the politician who was once lauded as \u201cAmerica\u2019s mayor\u201d but descended into the rabbit hole of Donald Trump\u2019s election denial lies, will face a Washington DC jury today in a landmark case that could see him saddled with millions of dollars in damages. The Utah senator Mitt Romney declined to rule out voting for Joe Biden next year and said he hasn\u2019t offered an endorsement in the Republican race because his backing would probably be a \u201ckiss of death\u201d. In an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press he joked that he should maybe endorse the candidate he liked the least. Hipgnosis Songs Fund, which owns the streaming rights to artists ranging from Beyonc\u00e9 to Neil Young, has sold a chunk of its song rights at a steep discount to raise cash. The fund said on Monday that it had sold 20,000 unspecified \u201cnon-core\u201d songs for $23.1m (\u00a318.4m), in a statement to the London Stock Exchange, where it is listed. A Catholic priest in a small Nebraska community died yesterday after being attacked in a church rectory, authorities said. Stephen Gutgsell was assaulted \u201cduring an invasion\u201d of St John the Baptist Catholic church in Fort Calhoun, Nebraska, the archdiocese of Omaha said in a statement on Sunday. Stat of the day: the oldest black hole ever observed, dating to dawn of universe Astronomers have detected the oldest black hole ever observed, dating back more than 13bn years to the dawn of the universe. The observations, by the James Webb space telescope (JWST), reveal it to be at the heart of a galaxy 440m years after the big bang. At around a million times the mass of the sun, it is surprisingly big for a baby black hole, raising the question of how it grew so big so quickly. Prof Roberto Maiolino, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge, who led the observations, said: \u201cThe surprise is in it being so very massive. That was the most unexpected thing.\u201d Help us raise $1.5m to fund independent journalism in 2024 As we head into 2024, the Guardian\u2019s journalists are already hard at work preparing for one of the most consequential news cycles of our lifetimes. We need your support to raise $1.5m to fund our reporting on areas such as the 2024 election and the potential for another Trump presidency; war in the Middle East; the sweeping implications of artificial intelligence; the climate crisis; and investigations into high-stakes abuses of power. If you value our reporting, please make a year-end gift today. We\u2019re depending on you. Don\u2019t miss this: Black women are more likely to experience infertility than white women. They\u2019re less likely to get help, too IVF has helped hundreds of thousands get pregnant. But Black women in the US, saddled with the myth of hyper-fertility and biased reproductive care, often lack the assistance they need, writes Lisa Armstrong. While more than 13% of American women aged 15 to 49 have impaired fecundity, Black women are twice as likely as white women to experience infertility. (The most recent infertility data from the Centers for Disease Control is from 2013.) They are also half as likely as white women to seek help for infertility; one review of 80,390 assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles (defined as any fertility treatments in which either eggs or embryos are handled) showed that white women were involved in 85.4% of them, whereas only 4.6% involved Black women. \u2026 Or this: Society \u2018disappears\u2019 ageing women. So I harnessed that cloak of invisibility to do all sorts of \u2018inappropriate\u2019 things \u201cThe notion of becoming invisible as an ageing woman has become an accepted trope,\u201d writes Deborah Wood. \u201cMy friends and I, from our late 50s onwards, were first gobsmacked then increasingly enraged at being talked over, not served, not replied to, brushed aside and not taken seriously. Small accretions of casual insult that eroded our hard-earned sense of self and agency. Instead of simmering in a stew of rage and resentment I began to wonder if that conferred invisibility could be harnessed. If I reframed it as a cloak of invisibility I could do all sorts of things \u2018inappropriate\u2019 for my age. \u201cI refrained from robbing a bank (though fairly sure I could have got away with the loot), instead turning my attention to street art.\u201d Climate check: Fossil fuel phase-out will \u2018not avert climate breakdown without protections for nature\u2019 Human destruction of nature is pushing the planet to a point of no return, and even a phase-out of fossil fuels will not stave off climate breakdown unless we also protect the natural world, one of the world\u2019s top climate scientists has warned. Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told the Guardian: \u201cEven if we phase out all fossil fuels, if we do not get involved in nature, [the destruction of natural landscapes and habitats] can make us lose what we all have agreed on the safe future for humanity on Earth \u2013 that is, to stay within the 1.5C limit. It\u2019s really decisive, that we get it right on nature.\u201d Last Thing: Paris Ritz finds missing \u20ac750,000 ring in vacuum cleaner bag The questions began swirling soon after police were notified that a \u20ac750,000 (\u00a3644,000) ring had gone missing from the Ritz hotel in Paris. Was it a meticulously planned and targeted robbery? An act of carelessness? Or simply a quick swipe, carried out when the opportunity presented itself? Two days after a Malaysian guest at the hotel reported the missing diamond ring to police, the hotel proffered an answer, albeit less exciting than many of the theories that had circulated online: the hotel said security had found the ring in the bag of a vacuum cleaner.

            "title": "House bill to make US healthcare costs transparent unlikely to bring down prices",
            "date": "2023-12-19T12:00:40Z",
            "content": "A bipartisan healthcare reform bill passed by the House could make it easier for Americans to find out the cost of a doctor\u2019s appointment or procedure before a patient receives it \u2013 a task that currently ranges in difficulty from Herculean to impossible. The bill would require hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, imaging services, surgical centers and pharmacy benefit managers to publicly post prices. That, supporters said, could bring down the cost of healthcare as \u201cconsumers\u201d shop around. \u201cWe all know that healthcare is too expensive, and the system is far too complicated,\u201d House energy and commerce committee chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington state, said Monday at a floor vote in the House. The bill passed 320-71. The new bill \u201clowers costs for Americans through increased healthcare price transparency\u201d, McMorris Rodgers said. But even as transparency has many fans, including consumer advocates, few outside of the Republican party have cast the bill as a silver bullet to bring Americans affordable healthcare. The bill \u201cis a tremendous step forward\u201d, said Patricia Kelmar, healthcare campaign director for US Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization that lobbied in favor of the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s such basic information consumers just deserve to know,\u201d Kelmar said, adding that at the same time, \u201cthere\u2019s no one solution to the high cost or price for healthcare.\u201d Healthcare has gobbled up a growing share of gross domestic product since the mid-20th century, rising from 5% of GDP in 1960 to more than 18% in 2022. Today, the US spends more than $12,000 per person on average for healthcare. Individuals have increasingly borne the brunt of these sky-high health prices in the last decade, thanks in part to a philosophy that has dominated health reform political discourse since the turn of the millennium. The ideology, often promoted by Republicans, emphasizes patients are \u201cconsumers\u201d, promotes the necessity for \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d and requires people to have \u201cskin in the game\u201d (read: money). With this ideology in mind, Republicans helped popularize the \u201cconsumer driven\u201d health plan when by creating a tax-exempt savings plan attached to health insurance with very high deductibles. Now commonly called high deductible health plans, patients are required to spend thousands of dollars before insurers start paying the bills, as much as $9,050 per year for individual plans. In the last decade, large employers have found these plans especially attractive, even as they are blamed for casting patients into medical debt. The overall market for high deductible health plans grew from just 4% of employer-sponsored health insurance in 2005 to 28% in 2022. About two-thirds of Americans who work for big companies (more than 1,000 employees) now have a high deductible health plan. When Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it largely left these plans untouched. At the time, the most prescient issue in health reform was seen as providing insurance to millions who had no way to obtain it. In a way, those reforms succeeded \u2013 the rate of people without health insurance in the US has never been lower, and currently hovers around 8%, or 26 million people. But the rate of people who are under-insured, or who cannot afford to use the insurance they have, has grown steadily with the popularity of high deductible health plans. In 2022, 43% of working age adults were inadequately insured, according to the Commonwealth Fund. \u201cThis really is the Republican ideal of a healthcare system,\u201d said Eagan Kemp, a healthcare policy advocate at Public Citizen, about the US\u2019s health system today. \u201cYou can extract maximum profit, it\u2019s the wild west compared to similarly wealthy countries.\u201d For Republican members of Congress, it\u2019s also the easiest to agree on. Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, continues to argue Obamacare should be repealed, even as it is broadly popular, and an effort to repeal the ACA failed dramatically in 2017. Hospital transparency was enacted two years later by executive order. As of February 2023, only a quarter of hospitals complied with the law. \u201cThe real issue is often disparity in information and disparity in bargaining power \u2013 and transparency does not address\u201d the latter, said Harold Pollack, a health economist and professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cA lot of the high prices in medical care are not coming from any lack of transparency. They\u2019re coming from the sheer ability to charge what they want to charge.\u201d In addition to lack of negotiating power \u2013 Pollack compares the power imbalance between patients and hospitals to playing a one-on-one basketball game with LeBron James \u2013 there are also vulnerable moments when people need healthcare, and comparison shopping is simply unrealistic. In just an example from Pollack\u2019s life, there was an incident a few years ago when his wife needed emergency cardiac care. \u201cAt that point, I was a health services research expert and I didn\u2019t do any comparison shopping at all \u2013 I didn\u2019t even look into the relative skill in providing cardiac care\u201d between hospitals, said Pollack. \u201cMy wife had an emergency \u2013 I took her to the nearest hospital.\u201d Critics of market-based transparency rules argue that getting a knee replacement is not like buying a car, and that even if US healthcare were not an opaque and labyrinthine viper\u2019s nest of predatory billing, \u201cdemand\u201d for health services is not like demand for a new mattress. In other words, you can\u2019t negotiate from a gurney. \u201cThe only folks really doing great are insurers, pharmaceutical makers, some of the big for-profit hospitals and even some non-profit hospitals that have billions in reserves. Those are the folks doing well,\u201d said Kemp. \u201cThe folks doing poorly are patients.\u201d Public Citizen promotes Medicare for All, a single-payer system that would more closely resemble the National Health Service in the United Kingdom than traditional private insurance. In that system, payments would be negotiated between the government and healthcare providers \u2013 not shopped by patients. The Lower Prices, More Transparency Act still needs to be passed by the Senate and signed by Joe Biden to become law. Advocates, like Kelmar, hope the Senate will pass the bill before 19 January 2024, when Congress hits a self-imposed fiscal cliff. The bill also includes a number of important funding measures, including payments to hospitals that provide care to large numbers of low-income individuals (called Disproportionate Share Hospital payments), funding for community health clinics and significant cuts to Medicare payments to hospitals who provide care off-site."

            "title": "Ohio governor breaks ranks to veto bill banning healthcare for trans minors",
            "date": "2023-12-29T19:49:29Z",
            "content": "Ohio\u2019s governor, Mike DeWine, on Friday vetoed a bill by fellow Republicans that would have banned gender-confirming healthcare for minors in the state, and prohibited transgender athletes from taking part in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports. The surprise move, which DeWine said was \u201cultimately about protecting human life\u201d, was largely welcomed by pro-LGBTQ+ activists, although the governor indicated he still intended to enact some of the provisions of the bill through executive action. DeWine announced the veto at a news conference on Friday morning, in which he said he had listened to people on both sides of the legislation who believed their position best protected children. \u201cWere I to sign, Ohio would be saying that the state, that the government, knows what is best medically for a child rather than the two people who love that child the most, the parents,\u201d he said. \u201cMany parents have told me that their child would be dead today if they had not received the treatment they received from an Ohio children\u2019s hospital. I have also been told, by those that are now grown adults, that but for this care, they would have taken their lives when they were teenagers.\u201d DeWine said he believed the law was \u201cnot in the best interests of Ohioans\u201d. Republicans have enough of a majority in the state legislature to ultimately override the veto, but it was not immediately clear whether or when they would attempt to do so. In a tweet, the ACLU of Ohio said: \u201cThank you Mike DeWine. Ohio is home. Protect trans youth.\u201d The Human Rights Campaign said it was \u201ca huge win for trans youth and their families in Ohio\u201d. Restrictions or outright bans on gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth have passed in more than 20 Republican-controlled legislatures nationwide since 2021, the Associated Press reports, making DeWine\u2019s resistance a break with precedent. Many of the actions have become the subject of legal challenges, with a growing number of judges blocking laws passed by conservative states. In Ohio, minors would have been banned from taking puberty blockers and undergoing other hormone therapies, or receiving gender-confirmation surgery to further align them with their gender identities, according to the bill that passed with only Republican support. Those already receiving care would have been allowed to continue. Opponents branded the bill as \u201ccruel\u201d, with dozens of doctors and mental health professionals, parents of transgender children and transgender youths giving testimony. Despite the veto, DeWine said he would take administrative actions that would address some provisions of the bill and \u201chave a better chance of surviving judicial review and being adopted\u201d. He said he was directing state agencies to ban gender-confirmation surgery for people under age 18; that he will require \u201crelevant agencies\u201d to report to the legislature information about minors and adults seeking gender-confirmation healthcare; and that his administration will prevent \u201cpop-up clinics or fly-by-night operations\u201d to ensure families receive \u201cadequate counseling\u201d over gender-confirmation care. \u201cI adamantly agree with the general assembly that no surgery of this kind should ever be performed on those under the age of 18,\u201d DeWine said. Similar to passing restrictions on transgender healthcare, numerous Republican-controlled states have acted to ban transgender athletes from women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports at school and college levels. In Florida last month, high school students protested in support of staff suspended for allowing a transgender athlete to play on a volleyball team. The Biden administration hopes to formalize a proposal into Title IX legislation next year that would effectively nullify state bans on transgender athletes.

            "title": "Victoria to offer free healthcare to those who have fled Israel-Gaza war",
            "date": "2023-12-22T14:00:05Z",
            "content": "People fleeing the Israel-Gaza war will receive free healthcare under a Victorian initiative, amid calls for other states to follow suit. The state\u2019s health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, will on Saturday announce people fleeing the conflict \u2013 who aren\u2019t eligible for Medicare due to their visa \u2013 will be able to access essential healthcare, specialised mental health support and language services. It comes after New South Wales announced earlier in December that it would provide free hospital emergency care, some surgery and outpatient services, hospital tests and limited emergency dental care, as well as maternity care, mental health care, ambulances and the use of interpreters, to people fleeing the conflict. But the Victorian program will go further. It will include care in public hospitals, public dental, and maternal child health, as well as services from community health providers, priority primary care centres, local mental health and wellbeing hubs and specialised refugee and asylum seeker health services. Thomas said the advice is being communicated to service providers by the health department, and was consistent with the support offered to asylum seekers and refugees. \u201cFor people escaping the devastating humanitarian crisis that is occurring in Palestine and Israel, the displacement and trauma of conflict is unimaginable \u2013 so we\u2019re proud to be supporting those who arrive in Victoria by providing free, accessible public healthcare,\u201d Thomas said. The health department expects the majority of arrivals will be women and children, who will have unidentified healthcare needs, including medication and diagnostic requirements related to chronic health conditions and trauma. Health services are also being encouraged to offer influenza and Covid-19 vaccinations. Dr Mohamad Assoum, an epidemiologist and global health specialist, who has organised pro-Palestine events in western Sydney, welcomed the Victorian commitment and said other states and territories should follow suit. \u201cThis has to be a priority for people coming in from Gaza, because their health is going to be absolutely dire. We know severe and acute malnutrition and dehydration is occurring because of the embargos that have been placed by the IDF [Israel Defence Force] and the Israeli government,\u201d Assoum said. \u201cWe also know that the level of injuries the physical injuries are incredibly traumatic and very severe, ranging from amputations to loss of vision.\u201d He said trauma and mental health effects were also likely to be ongoing, particularly for children. Israel\u2019s air and ground assault on Gaza was launched after Hamas\u2019s 7 October attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people. Unicef, the UN\u2019s children\u2019s fund, estimates that minors account for at least 40% of the estimated 20,000 people killed so far. Between 7 October and 20 November, the federal government granted visas to 1,793 Israeli citizens and 860 to Palestinians. The subclass 600 visa offered to Palestinians and Israeli citizens wanting to come to Australia is not a permanent visa. The visitor visa allows for temporary entry for up to 12 months but does not provide access to Medicare, Centrelink or settlement services. The same visa has been previously issued to Ukrainian citizens, after the Russian invasion in 2022."

            "date": "2023-12-11T13:00:35Z",
            "content": "For many Black women in the US, infertility has a complicated duality. The inability to conceive is often invisible, pushed out of view by shame, the racist notion that Black women are hyper-fertile, or the idea that such struggles should remain private. Yet for people aspiring to parenthood amid fertility problems, getting the family they want often requires complete transparency about their condition. Community support is particularly critical for Black women, who face a slew of health disparities in fertility medicine. They\u2019re much less likely to be referred by doctors for fertility treatment \u2013 perhaps due to the myth Black women get pregnant with ease \u2013 even though studies suggest that they experience infertility at a rate twice as high as white women. Black women are also less likely than white women to have insurance. Even if they do, full coverage for procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), in which a harvested egg is united with sperm outside the body and later implanted, or intrauterine insemination (IUI), where sperm gets a fast-track injection into the uterus, is rare. One round of IVF can cost upwards of $10,000, and the medications, which people usually have to pay for out of pocket, are also expensive, placing the treatment far out of reach for many lower- and middle-income people. For the Black women who can afford assisted reproductive technology (ART) and this highly specialized care, if they also need donor sperm, they have to contend with the fact that Black men comprise just a small fraction of US sperm donors. Faced with these barriers, Black women often turn to mutual aid to navigate the medical system and infertility\u2019s emotional, financial and bodily tolls. The sharing of resources: information, medications, money and even donated biological material such as sperm, eggs and embryos is a key component of these groups. Venues for connection include professional settings, support and prayer circles, and online forums on platforms such as Facebook, where women trade notes about finding the right doctor, the hormonal side effects of fertility treatments, and rituals like eating french fries and other high-fat foods after embryo implantation. These outlets offer support that many Black women say they rarely receive in clinical settings, which can feel almost impossibly technical, transactional and implicitly or overtly racist. \u2018I couldn\u2019t believe this act of kindness\u2019 This past summer, Kailey Townsend called her co-worker Jamila Galloway with a generous offer: she wanted to give her an egg, one of many she\u2019d retrieved and stored for future use. Because Townsend has endometriosis, a condition in which the uterine lining grows outside the organ, and a bleeding disorder related to hemophilia, she decided to act when she had an abundant supply of youthful eggs in case her conditions worsened later. The 27-year-old\u2019s egg freezing procedure yielded more than she\u2019d ever need. Townsend, a social media director based in Connecticut, and Galloway, a communications executive in Washington DC, work at a company where fertility treatments are covered by insurance and people openly discuss their own wellbeing and health. That\u2019s why Townsend, who is also a certified doula, knew that Galloway had been trying to conceive through multiple methods, including using ART. \u201cI literally bawled like a baby,\u201d Galloway said of receiving the call from Townsend. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe this act of kindness, mainly because many women freeze their eggs, but they don\u2019t do anything with them.\u201d A review of studies about egg freezing outcomes found that only about 16% of women return to use them. \u201cI understand it\u2019s very personal,\u201d Galloway continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a piece of your DNA.\u201d After two miscarriages and several unsuccessful attempts to get pregnant through IVF and IUI over the last three years, Galloway\u2019s supply of sperm and her own eggs have dwindled. Her procedures were done with sperm she\u2019d bought from a cryobank, sometimes costing her up to $1,700 per vial (estimates vary about how many vials are needed per insemination, but it\u2019s often at least two). \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of Black sperm donors,\u201d so their stock is coveted and sometimes sells out, said Galloway, who is 41. \u201cAnd there\u2019s obviously not a lot of Black egg donors. I\u2019ve had a couple of associates who were on the list for about a year to wait and receive one.\u201d She\u2019s carefully considering Townsend\u2019s offer. For Townsend, offering this part of herself to Galloway was uncomplicated. Her brother had donated sperm to someone, and her family and partner approved. Townsend said that giving an egg to Galloway fits within her expansive notion of family and African American tradition. \u201cThere is something really important about Black community and how we\u2019ve always raised each other that has been essential to my being. And I think that\u2019s why it comes very simple to me. I think about my aunts and my people who aren\u2019t even related to me also being mother figures who I call \u2018mama\u2019. This is just the 2023 version of what our ancestors have been doing all along.\u201d One hundred-mile drives and clinic stakeouts Even though stories like Townsend and Galloway\u2019s probably aren\u2019t as rare as one may think, the more common swaps between Black women are for information and research. D\u00e1na-Ain Davis, a medical anthropologist and professor at the City of New York Graduate Center, said she\u2019s observed what she calls acts of \u201cracial reconnaissance\u201d, in which Black women go to extreme and tiresome lengths to mitigate the effects of inadequate healthcare, such as scoping out fertility clinics for red flags. \u201cThe amount of time that they spent trying to find clinics that would not be racist, that would provide them with information, that would treat them with respect, was unbelievable,\u201d said Davis, who is also a doula who accompanies clients throughout their reproductive journeys. She remembered a woman \u201cwho drove within a 100-mile radius of her house and visited all the clinics, and she\u2019d sit outside at different times and see if any Black people walked in\u201d. What many Black infertility patients are looking for is that proverbial needle in the haystack: a Black specialist. And social media and other online resources can offer intel on clinic demographics, atmosphere or providers to try or avoid. \u201cThere is a lot of self-advocacy where they\u2019re specifically trying to obtain racial and gender concordance with their providers,\u201d said Isabel Morgan, a University of North Carolina public health doctoral student studying Black women and infertility. That racial concordance \u2013 when provider and patient share the same background \u2013 contributes to better health outcomes is a fact in many corners of US medicine; for example, Black children\u2019s risk of dying in infancy drops by half when they are cared for by a Black doctor. Davis noted data that suggests that for many women who are able to secure a Black provider, \u201cthe process improves. They get the treatment that they need. They might not necessarily get to the live birth, but they might get pregnant. They might start ovulating\u201d when they hadn\u2019t before. Independent networks also provide spaces for women to ask medical questions from others going through the same process: Do you like a certain injector for your shot? Did your doctor tell you to lose weight? Did you cramp after embryo implantation? In some online spaces, Black women have developed relationships with \u201cretrieval sisters\u201d or \u201ctransfer buddies\u201d who are undergoing egg harvesting on the same day or around the same time. Because of their reach, online sites tend to double as a marketplace for fertility drugs. Women frequently give, swap or sell their surplus medications, including the daily shots that spark ovulation. \u201cYou might buy more than you need or be given more than you need,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cYou might have some left over\u201d due to a successful pregnancy, a failed IVF cycle or a decision to cease treatment. \u201cSo you might donate it to someone or you might sell it. There\u2019s sort of a black market for it because of how expensive it is. If insurance companies are covering IVF, typically they\u2019re not covering the medication. You have to pay for that out of pocket.\u201d Some Black women \u2013 none of whom would speak to Guardian US on the record about medication sharing, which is technically illegal \u2013 said they\u2019d prefer to share meds with another Black woman, knowing as they do how Black and lower-income people are often priced out of fertility treatment. And the same goes for the trade in donated sperm, eggs or embryos; since there\u2019s a very limited menu of Black donor sperm or other biological matter available at traditional banks, Black donors often want to contribute to making Black families possible. Crowdfunding a baby The prohibitive costs of IVF treatment have given rise to crowdfunding campaigns that raise money for individuals\u2019 procedures. Ebony Pierre-Louis, a 40-year-old early-education specialist based in Woodside, New York, recently launched a GoFundMe to raise money for egg donation and IVF. She had elective bariatric weight-loss surgery; though she made that decision herself, many fertility doctors recommend weight loss pre-pregnancy. She will also undergo fibroid removal. Pierre-Louis and her husband of two years had been trying to get pregnant before she was diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), which can reduce egg supply and bring on premature menopause. She wants to carry her own pregnancy and worries her time is running out. But money \u2013 an estimated $30,000 for both an egg donor and Pierre-Louis\u2019 medication \u2013 is the couple\u2019s biggest barrier. Taking her case to the internet and asking strangers for money wasn\u2019t easy. She\u2019d suffered depression and suicidal thoughts when she couldn\u2019t get pregnant, but she\u2019s working through those issues with a therapist. Then, the couple faced blowback from relatives, some of whom asked: \u201c\u2018Why are you putting people in your business? Why are you begging for money? We can do this on our own.\u2019 It was kind of an embarrassment thing\u201d, said Pierre-Louis. Still, their desire for children outweighed the criticism. So her husband took a second job, but the couple knows they can\u2019t do it alone. Friends have been behind them, however, running the campaign and donating. Providing financial support has been a large component of the work of Fertility for Colored Girls, one of the most active reproductive organizations for Black women. The Rev Dr Stacey Edwards-Dunn, a former sexuality education instructor and ordained minister who pastors a church in Chicago, founded the group partly because of her own journey with ART once she learned she had an abnormally shaped uterus with only one fallopian tube. After three unsuccessful IVF rounds in the US and Barbados, Edwards-Dunn, who is 53, noticed that parishioners were increasingly talking about infertility in pastoral counseling. Couples passed through Edwards-Dunn\u2019s sessions, not knowing that she was going through the same thing. She and her husband had \u201cspent over $100,000 and we still had no baby\u201d, she said. Edwards-Dunn organized a community event in 2013 that attracted 100 people who were hungry for the discussion. \u201cTwo of the hardest conversations in church, and particularly the Black church, have always been around human sexuality and money,\u201d she said. That meeting evolved into Fertility for Colored Girls, a group that has more than 8,300 members on Facebook, chapters in 16 US states and support groups nationwide, including a weekly prayer circle and workshops that introduce women to Black endocrinologists. She knew that facilitating emotional support was important, but financial support was necessary. So Fertility for Colored Girls created an array of grants: one of the largest provides $50,000 worth of services at the co-sponsoring KindBody fertility clinic chain in select markets. That\u2019s a drop in the bucket for many patients \u2013 especially if they need repeat treatments \u2013 but it can reduce the chaos of searching for medically sound, compassionate advice and care. Edwards-Dunn eventually gave birth to three healthy babies, including a set of twins at age 50. But before she and others founded fertility groups just for Black women, \u201cwe had nowhere to go talk about our unique experiences as women of African descent who were experiencing infertility, whether it was the treatment and services that were being provided, our experiences in our homes or in our communities.\u201d Support is crucial because stress may affect conception. And, as she noted, there are fewer things more stressful than a lack of options and navigating infertility in a vacuum. Fertility doulas and the tradition of Black communal care Networks of community-based care for Black women have deep roots. And as more Black women, people and families explore fertility treatment and ART, many are guided by birth workers who draw from historical traditions. Michelle Drew, a 53-year-old professional nurse-midwife from Wilmington, Delaware, followed her grandmother and great-grandmother into midwifery. She noted how they tended to women of reproductive age in rural Hopewell, Virginia, from the 1950s to the 1970s. \u201cIf Granny had somebody who\u2019d had several stillbirths or who\u2019d had preterm births, she would give them wild yam,\u201d Drew said. The vegetable contains a natural estrogen that can be converted into the synthetic hormone, though there\u2019s no medical evidence to suggest it is an effective fertility drug in its unaltered state. \u201cIf she wanted to \u2018hold the baby in\u2019\u201d, she\u2019d mix a tincture of botanicals. Part of Drew\u2019s grandmother\u2019s prescription was for the woman\u2019s neighbors, friends and family; the community had its own job, to lighten the pregnant person\u2019s load. She\u2019d recommend that pregnant women abstain from sex and heavy labor. And in farming communities, where Black women often did back-breaking agricultural labor or domestic work at home or in white people\u2019s houses, other women or neighbors might pick up her slack and do her chores so she could rest and create optimal conditions for a healthy birth. Hospitals were few in the rural US and even less accessible for Black patients, and much of the country \u2013 Black or white \u2013 was delivered by midwives, until they were maligned as superstitious and dangerous vectors of infection by modern doctors, who rapidly took over their business. As the country moved away from traditional birth attendants and to institutionalized healthcare, the notion of community-based care gradually deteriorated. Today\u2019s doulas are trying to bring it back. They are the modern successors of midwives like Drew\u2019s forebears, who \u201ccaught\u201d or delivered babies. Davis, the medical anthropologist and doula, helped her fellow academic, LeCont\u00e9 Dill, a professor and poet, through fertility appointments and taught her how to focus her energy in culturally meaningful ways. Davis encouraged her to develop a spiritual birth-centered practice that reduced her stress: asking friends to send her energy on important days, making offerings of honey to an Afro-diasporic goddess, meditating. Davis\u2019s warmth and care beyond the medical helped steer Dill through a lonely and isolating process. Birth workers are also creating pathways for Black people to learn about infertility. Sierra Bizzell, a 38-year-old doula and nursing student, determined her career as a result of her own experience. A caesarean section scarred her fallopian tubes and during surgery to address the damage, her surgeon told her husband that she\u2019d be at great risk for an ectopic pregnancy if they didn\u2019t fully remove them. She awoke to the news that \u201cyou have no tubes and you\u2019re 30.\u201d From her home in North Carolina, Bizzell runs Ultimate Fertility Consulting and Faithfully Fertile Foundation. She helps individuals navigate the hyper-specialized world of infertility care, which is dominated by an acronym soup of procedures and medications. She also trains healthcare providers such as midwives and birth workers to better steward their patients through options including IVF. When her Black clients see her, they tend to inundate her with questions, which they say physicians often just won\u2019t answer. She characterizes herself as a recovering hippie who used to rely on herbs and all-natural everything. Now she tries to balance the natural with the scientifically proven, checking to see if this tea might elevate someone\u2019s blood pressure and helping people figure out what questions to ask about their hormone numbers. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018I\u2019m not the doctor. But I can try to make sure that I connect you with this person and connect you with that person. I\u2019m having to give out community resources to people in the hospital because they don\u2019t trust anybody in there. We have so many years of trauma that caused us to feel the way we feel about the medical system, and rightfully so, because history tells us that they do terrible things to our bodies. But we\u2019re sometimes in a position where we need them and where we need to be able to trust somebody.\u201d In the absence of trust in the medical establishment, many Black individuals and communities are providing for each other through words of advice, doctor referrals and giving the gift of literal life. Galloway, the communications executive, said that the more she\u2019s shared about her infertility journey, \u201cthe more people want to help\u201d. And she\u2019s now realized that there are diverse and beautiful ways to become a mother, parent or family. She\u2019s in the middle of an IVF cycle, and will know if she\u2019s pregnant by year\u2019s end. If not, she will pursue parenthood by adoption or some other means."

            "date": "2023-12-11T12:00:35Z",
            "content": "In a few short months, 37-year-old Kimberly Cooley went from sprinting up stairs to faltering after several steps. Unbeknownst to her, she was experiencing a cascade of symptoms related to autoimmune hepatitis, a rare and chronic inflammation of the liver. She was diagnosed, shot to the top of the liver transplant list, and quickly realized she could not handle the financial repercussions of such a surgery alone. A private person by nature, Cooley took the extraordinary step of publicizing her condition \u2013 a step she understood well as a marketing consultant. In a matter of days, her loved ones raised more than $17,000 for her liver transplant surgery. \u201cI did have the support of friends and family,\u201d said Cooley, 42, who lives in rural Duck Hill, Mississippi. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been.\u201d Cooley is doing well. But her finances are another story. She is more than $4,000 in debt to AccessOne, a private-equity backed medical credit card company. As transplant patients need ongoing medication and care, she expects that debt to roughly double next year. \u201cI start referring to it as \u2018transplant life\u2019,\u201d said Cooley. \u201cThings are going to pop up, and that\u2019s just part of it.\u201d As a new year and presidential election approach, Americans face a worsening crisis: the affordability of healthcare. More Americans than ever, about 92%, now have health insurance \u2013 and simultaneously face enormous bills. Over the last decade, insurers and employers have pushed more cost-sharing onto individuals and families. Now, squeezed by medical costs and inflation, more than 100 million Americans have medical debt and roughly the same proportion report avoiding a prescription because of it. Sara Collins, a health policy scholar and vice-president at the Commonwealth Fund, said \u201cthose are the trends we\u2019ve seen\u201d, referring to \u201cgrowth in healthcare costs, household incomes that haven\u2019t kept pace with those costs, and employers\u2019 use of increased cost-sharing\u201d. Cooley\u2019s story represents the intersecting issues that plague the health system, as high prices and a push to offload those costs to patients collide. \u201cThose trends are all still there, they haven\u2019t changed, and unless they\u2019re addressed\u201d, problems will continue, added Collins. The Biden administration has sought to make these struggles a centerpiece of the upcoming campaign. His administration has taken aim at medical credit card companies, like AccessOne; instructed Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices for the first time; and is writing rules to stop medical debt from appearing on credit reports. Biden\u2019s administration also continued the rollout of the No Surprises Act, originally signed by Donald Trump, which bans doctors and hospitals from sticking consumers with a \u201cbalance bill\u201d when they can\u2019t agree with insurers on a fair price. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, also has an extensive record on healthcare. He led a failed repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, which would likely have left tens of millions of Americans uninsured and effectively worsened healthcare rationing by income. He tilted the balance of the supreme court to the right, which led to the reversal of a constitutional right to an abortion and the severe abortion restrictions across a large swath of conservative southern states. Now, campaigning for a second term, Trump has said \u201cObamacare sucks\u201d, and vowed to try to \u201creplace\u201d it. He\u2019s offered no details of such a policy. Neither candidate has squarely tackled the biggest issue in American healthcare: its cost. The US health system sucks up a whopping 16% of gross domestic product (GDP). That\u2019s more \u2013 by a long shot \u2013 than any other wealthy, developed nation. France and Germany are the next closest, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which each spend around 12% of GDP on healthcare. Over roughly the last decade, insurers and employers have sought to push more of those growing costs onto patients, which has in turn revealed the unfinished work of Obamacare. The focus of the ACA was to get more people insured, and was very effective at doing so through both Medicaid and markets for individuals to buy health insurance, which is where Cooley got her health plan. It did not focus on employer-based health coverage, since those were generally comprehensive and heavily subsidized by tax breaks to companies. Since the ACA, as health insurers have been required to provide more comprehensive coverage, they have also pushed costs onto the insured. More than half of Americans (51%) now have trouble handling out-of-pocket insurance expenses, according to a survey by the Commonwealth Foundation. High-deductible health plans offer a flagrant example of why. Laurie, a 62-year-old resident of the Atlanta, Georgia, metro area, is required to spend $7,450 each year before her insurance kicks in. As a result, she buys her ulcerative colitis medications from Canada at roughly a 90% discount from the American price \u2013 which is typically around $1,800 for a 90-day supply. \u201cThe insurance companies are now sticking it to everyone with the maximum out-of-pocket and deductibles,\u201d said Laurie, who asked that her last name not be used because she worried about the legality of buying drugs internationally. \u201cBy the way, I pay $120 a month for the privilege of having this plan.\u201d In another case, a mother of six in Ohio said she faced a $6,000 deductible for an employer plan that \u201cbarely pays anything\u201d. She now avoids taking her children to the doctor for small colds, because she has to pay a $95 co-pay for each doctor\u2019s visit. \u201cWe feel as if we are being forced to carry this insurance for fear that one of us may have an accident or illness and have no insurance to cover it at all,\u201d she said, adding her husband\u2019s pay as a welder would be much more \u201csufficient\u201d if insurance costs weren\u2019t so high. A slew of studies show how high-deductible plans can make a family\u2019s life precarious. One study found that such plans \u201csubstantially and problematically\u201d reduce how often low-income diabetics seek care. Another found that children enrolled in their parents\u2019 high-deductible plans scored worse on seven out of 10 health metrics. A third found that people with high-deductible health plans are more likely to be in medical debt, and subsequently have difficulty affording food and housing. Still, a shockingly high number of health plans, especially on marketplaces, include these provisions. For \u201cObamacare\u201d plans, like Laurie\u2019s, deductibles can range up to $9,050 per year. The chronically ill also face special challenges. Cooley has no deductible, and out-of-pocket expenses are capped at $3,150 per year. A healthy person might never hit that limit. But Cooley will reach it every year. What\u2019s more, Laurie points out, she still faces dental bills, for which health insurance is useless. \u201cThat insurance doesn\u2019t cover your hearing, your teeth, your eyes,\u201d said Laurie, who said a dentist told her that replacing a single problematic crown would cost her $5,000. \u201cI\u2019m like, those aren\u2019t part of my body?\u201d Hundreds of millions of American adults will likely nod in agreement with a conclusion Laurie reached : \u201cDon\u2019t get sick. It\u2019s too expensive.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-03T22:01:03Z",
            "content": "A study of US prison deaths at the height of the Covid-19 crisis in 2020 has found that mortality rates soared by 77% relative to 2019, or more than three times the increase in the general population. The study, published by Science Advances last week, is the most comprehensive analysis of in-custody deaths since 2020. The report found that \u201cCovid-19 was the primary driver for increases in mortality due to natural causes; some states also experienced substantial increases due to unnatural causes.\u201d The report was compiled using data from record requests and some publicly available data, when necessary, from 49 state and federal departments of corrections. Its lead author, Naomi Sugie, an associate professor of criminology, law and society at the University of California at Irvine, told Courthouse News that the actual toll of Covid-19 in the prison system had been little understood. \u201cWe staffed a hotline and started this archival project hearing what people were going through in California prisons,\u201d Sugie told the outlet. \u201cAnd the conditions that people were describing were so dire and upsetting and really just violations of their health and, some may argue, human rights.\u201d Sugie began studying the effect of Covid-19 in California prisons after they imposed containment lockdowns in 2020. The PrisonPandemic project found that the institutions reduced facility communication and transparency down to zero with some facilities not recording causes of death that year at all. The authors write that there has been no publicly available information about mortality in US prisons since 2019 despite the Death in Custody Reporting Act passed in 2000 and reauthorized in 2014 that requires the collection of information regarding the death of any person who is under arrest, en route to be incarcerated, incarcerated at a municipal or county jail, state prison, or other local or state correctional facility. The 2022 Bureau of Justice statistics found that roughly 2,500 prisoners died of Covid-related causes between March 2020 and February 2021, but the number did not include a rise in mortality rates of natural deaths or unnatural deaths. \u201cThese steep increases suggest systemic failures that simultaneously increased risk of illness and limited access to medical care,\u201d the authors of the study wrote. The study also found that pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions on movement, including isolation, visitor prohibitions and solitary confinement in place of medical isolation, designed to mitigate infection had \u201cincreased stress, mental health challenges, and violence exacerbating the risk of deaths due to unnatural causes, such as drug overdoses, suicide, and violence\u201d. Sugie told the outlet that \u201cfor all of those deaths that are related to the pandemic, for various ways, we don\u2019t know about them because they\u2019re not officially coded as Covid-related\u201d. Just like in the general population, she added, a lot of states did not test systemically, \u201cso even if someone died of Covid, their death may not have been recorded as Covid-related\u201d."

            "content": "The attorney general of Texas is suing the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, alleging that it exaggerated the effectiveness of its Covid-19 vaccine and deceived the public. Ken Paxton announced the lawsuit on Thursday after filing it in Lubbock state district court in north-west Texas, the Texas Tribune reported. Paxton\u2019s suit comes as a consensus of health experts and scientists have said that the vaccine prevents severe infection and death from Covid-19. Paxton accused Pfizer of \u201c[engaging] in false, deceptive, and misleading acts and practices by making unsupported claims regarding the company\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine in violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act\u201d, according to a press release shared to X, formerly known as Twitter. Paxton argued that Pfizer\u2019s claims about effectiveness implied that it would effectively end the Covid-19 pandemic, and that it failed to do so within a year of being introduced. The lawsuit also added that claims the vaccine was 95% effective were not accurate, and that Covid-19 infection as well as death rates worsened as the vaccine became increasingly available. Pfizer released results on the effectiveness of Covid in November 2020, finding that the shot was 95% effective in the first 28 days after receiving the vaccine. The suit also claims that Pfizer \u201c[conspired]\u201d to silence those who were critical of the shot, common arguments made amid other anti-vaccine figures. Paxton\u2019s suit asks that Pfizer be prohibited from \u201cmaking representations about the efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine\u201d, the Hill reported. The attorney general is also requesting $10,000 for every alleged violation by Pfizer, in addition to other financial restitution. The total civil penalties against Pfizer total up to more than $10m, according to Reuters. In a statement, Pfizer said the \u201cstate\u2019s case has no merit\u201d, adding that the vaccine has been administered to 1.5 billion people \u201cand helped protect against severe Covid-19 outcomes, including hospitalization and death\u201d. \u201cThe representations made by the company about its Covid-19 vaccine have been accurate and science-based,\u201d it read. The lawsuit is Paxton\u2019s second against Pfizer in November. The attorney general previously sued the pharmaceutical company and an additional supplier for allegedly altering quality-control tests on ADHD medication for children."

            "date": "2023-12-19T07:07:49Z",
            "content": "This afternoon we heard from lip-reader Tim Reedy, who travelled from the UK. Bruce Lehrmann is suing Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson for defamation over an interview with Higgins broadcast on The Project and online which did not name him but alleged she had been raped by a Liberal staffer in March 2019. Lehrmann has denied raping Brittany Higgins and pleaded not guilty to a charge of sexual intercourse without consent. His criminal trial was abandoned due to juror misconduct and the second did not proceed due to prosecutors\u2019 fears for Higgins\u2019 mental health. Here\u2019s what we heard this afternoon: Reedy \u2013 who used the assistance of a \u201clip-speaker\u201d to help him answer questions in court \u2013 said he spent three days studying CCTV footage from the night of Brittany Higgins\u2019 alleged rape. Reedy said the difference between forensic lip-reading and real time lip-reading is that when he is studying a video he has the liberty of going back and watching it again. Reedy said he believed CCTV footage showed Higgins being \u201cplied with alcohol\u201d he saw a segment of the footage in which Lehrmann lined up drinks for her on the corner of the table. The court also heard that Reedy\u2019s transcript of the CCTV had Lehrmann saying \u201cdrink that all now\u201d and Higgins saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d. Justice Lee ruled the lip-reading evidence was admissible, although it is \u201cnot an exact science\u201d. Justice Lee also said \u201cdisgraceful\u201d things have been published about Lehrmann, Fiona Brown and Higgins, and said he planned to issue contempt of court orders against those responsible. To read more about what we heard this morning, click here. Court will resume on Thursday when Justice Lee is set to start hearing closing submissions. Justice Lee says \u2018disgraceful\u2019 things have been published about Lehrmann, Higgins and Brown The court has adjourned until 10.15am on Thursday when Justice Lee will hear closing submissions from the parties: the applicant on Thursday and the defence on Friday. Before rising, Justice Lee said the principal witnesses Brittany Higgins, Bruce Lehrmann and Fiona Brown have been subjected to scurrilous and disgraceful abuse on social media and he is planning to issue contempt orders against those responsible. Lee said he warned at the beginning of the trial there would be consequences. \u201cI made it clear that I wouldn\u2019t tolerate abuse of witnesses for the purposes of giving evidence, and I said that the law of contempt is an appropriate remedial response in the event that there has been,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret to say when it comes to all the principal witnesses being Mr Lehrmann, Ms Higgins and Ms Brown, some of the things that have been published on any view of it are disgraceful. And I do propose at the end of this process to consider \u2013 and also threats against the court I might say \u2013 to prepare a schedule of the persons to whom [contempt] orders will be served.\u201d Court played phone call between Higgins and Samantha Maiden The court is now tendering exhibits. One exhibit is an audio recording of a phone call between Higgins and Samantha Maiden from news.com.au. The court has been played the audio of the call. Higgins\u2019 fiance David Sharaz can be heard on the call asking Maiden a question. The topic of the conversation was a news story which would say that Lehrmann, as yet unnamed, was going to deny the alleged rape. The news story they were discussing followed Maiden\u2019s first story on the allegations. Lehrmann was not named in Maiden\u2019s story or by The Project. His lawyers issued a denial without naming their client. The court has adjourned until 4.35pm. Justice Lee rules lip-reading evidence is admissible although it is not \u2018an exact science\u2019 Lip-reader Tim Reedy has finished his evidence. The court heard that in his notes Reedy wrote: \u201cMan is lining up drinks, plying the woman with alcohol.\u201d The defence would like to enter his lip-reading report into evidence but Lehrmann\u2019s barrister objects because he has not been subjected to any \u201cobjective assessment as to the accuracy of his work\u201d. Collins said while lip-reading is \u201cnot an exact science\u201d, he thinks the lip-reading report is useful to the court. Justice Lee has accepted the tender of Reedy\u2019s evidence, which he said was very frank. \u201cI accept that lip-reading is not an exact science but the guide for the admissibility of expert evidence is not a counsel of perfection. One has to take areas of specialised knowledge as one finds them.\u201d Tim Reedy said he believed Higgins was being \u201cplied with alcohol\u201d because he saw a segment of the CCTV in which Lehrmann lined up drinks for her on the corner of the table. Justice Lee and legal counsel have gathered behind Reedy in the witness box to watch his laptop screen so they can see what he is seeing. Lehrmann\u2019s barrister Steve Whybrow SC has asked Reedy to watch the CCTV footage from the bar and match it up with what he identified in his report that the people in the bar were saying. Reedy said the CCTV showed that everyone was having fun at the party but \u201cwhat stuck out\u201d for him was that Higgins was being plied with drinks. Whybrow said the transcript had Lehrmann saying \u201cdrink that all now\u201d and Higgins saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d. Lip-reader used computer program to help assess CCTV of Higgins and Lehrmann speaking Tim Reedy said the resolution on the CCTV video being played in court is 1080p or high definition. He said the CCTV cameras in the courtyard where Bruce Lehrmann and Brittany Higgins were on the night of the alleged rape were in colour but the bar was in black and white, and is harder to see. Reedy said he used a program on his Apple computer which magnified the screen to help his assessment of the words which were spoken by Higgins and Lehrmann. He said he has been asked \u201cmany times\u201d over the years to examine CCTV to asses what people are saying. \u201cOver the years technology gets better,\u201d Reedy said. \u201cIn CCTV from 10 years ago the quality is not so good but in this instance it\u2019s a good example of CCTV.\u201d Lip-reader faces cross-examination by Lehrmann\u2019s barrister Tim Reedy is now facing cross-examination by Lehrmann\u2019s barrister Steve Whybrow SC. The court has adjourned to sort out technical issues after Whybrow asked if Reedy could watch the CCTV footage again and match it up with the transcript he made. Matt Collins KC, for Network Ten, said Reedy needs specialist equipment to do that. Lip-reader spent three days studying CCTV footage from night of alleged rape Tim Reedy has told the court he spent three days studying the CCTV footage from the bar in Canberra where Bruce Lehrmann and Brittany Higgins were the night of the alleged rape. His experience includes lip-reading the coronation for the Sunday Times. He added that the newspaper \u201clikes a bit of gossip\u201d. \u201cI should make it clear I have never been cross-examined before but I have helped police and investigations,\u201d he said. Reedy said the difference between forensic lip-reading and real time lip-reading is that when he is studying a video he has the liberty of going back and watching it again. \u201cI listen with my eyes,\u201d Reedy said about listening to the lip-speaker in court. Tim Reedy, a lip-reader who travelled from the UK, is now in the witness box and he will give his evidence with the assistance of a \u201clip-speaker\u201d. The \u201clip-speaker\u201d has travelled from the UK with Reedy to help him answer questions in court. He has been profoundly deaf since the age of three. Reedy said he has written a report which analyses a video. Reedy said when a lip-reader watches a video there are times when he can tell what is being said and others when it makes no sense. He says in his report he has placed words in brackets it means he is \u201cnot quite sure\u201d of the accuracy of words, and he will go back to it later. Fiona Brown\u2019s evidence concluded before lunch and the next witness is the lip-reader who has flown out from the UK, Tim Reedy. Before the break Brown was asked by Sue Chrysanthou, for Wilkinson, if the two ministers, Reynolds and Hawke, were \u201ccovering for themselves\u201d when they instructed her to report the alleged incident to the police. Brown: \u201cYes.\u201d Brown also denied a suggestion by Chrysanthou that she had amended her notes after the fact. Former Liberal staffer Fiona Brown returned to the witness box this morning, where she was cross examined by Sue Chrysanthou SC, who is acting for Lisa Wilkinson. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve heard so far: Brown said she was told to use \u201cneutral language\u201d when interviewing Brittany Higgins and Bruce Lehrmann, and that\u2019s why she asked Higgins if \u201csomething had happened that she didn\u2019t want to happen\u201d. Brown said when Higgins said \u201cBruce was on top of me\u201d, she was shocked, and said she can\u2019t remember telling Senator Linda Reynolds in a phone call that Higgins had reported to her the words \u201cBruce was on top of me\u201d. Brown agreed she didn\u2019t follow Reynolds\u2019 instruction to report the incident to police. Brown said a police report should not be made without Higgins, and that she believed agency meant that \u201ca complainant needed to be in control and it was up to them to be in control\u201d. \u201cHiggins had still not given me an allegation \u2026 to me I needed more than that,\u201d she said. Brown said the only information she had was that Higgins told her \u201che was on top of me\u201d. Brown agreed that when she had a meeting with Reynolds and Higgins in the minister\u2019s suite, she and Reynolds were in no doubt that Higgins had been found naked on the couch. However, she believed there was some doubt about whether when Higgins said \u201che was on top of me\u201d it meant it was not consensual. Brown said she was surprised when she found out Higgins was proceeding with her complaint of rape with the sexual assault unit. She said she was surprised Higgins had not told her she\u2019d been assaulted because she had expressed she was happy with the support she had received from her office: \u201cWe received almost gushing comments from Higgins\u201d. Brown was asked about the process of finding Higgins another job during the 2019 election campaign. Chrysanthou asked Brown if the discussion about welfare concern was because Higgins had been assaulted, and Brown replied: \u201cShe\u2019d never told me she\u2019d been assaulted\u201d. Chrysanthou questioned Brown about Lehrmann\u2019s termination letter in which Higgins was not mentioned. Chrysanthou suggested that Higgins was deliberately left out of the termination letter despite one of the reasons for his termination being that he left Higgins in Parliament House without checking on her welfare. Brown disagreed. Brown said there was no \u201ccover-up\u201d for \u201cpolitical expediency\u201d and all the relevant agencies including police and government departments were informed of Higgins\u2019 allegation. The trial will resume this afternoon. Fiona Brown has said repeatedly there was no cover-up for \u201cpolitical expediency\u201d and all the relevant agencies, including police and government departments, were informed of Brittany Higgins\u2019 allegation. \u201cThere was none, absolutely none,\u201d she said. \u201cThese were two 23-year-olds and there was no cover-up. The police were consulted, the department of finance was consulted, the DPS [department of parliamentary services] knew. There was no cover-up.\u2019\u2019 Bruce Lehrmann\u2019s barrister Steve Whybrow SC asked Brown if she had heard the allegation that there had been a cover-up by the government. \u201cThere was no cover-up,\u201d Brown said, adding that everyone that should have been informed was informed. She said the two staffers were \u201cnot parliamentarians\u201d, they were just \u201ctwo 23-year-olds\u201d and \u201cno one would want to have that reported on\u201d. Barrister suggests Higgins deliberately omitted from Lehrmann\u2019s termination letter Fiona Brown is being questioned by Sue Chrysanthou SC about Bruce Lehrmann\u2019s termination letter in which Higgins was not mentioned. Brown said that leaving a colleague in the office without checking on her welfare was a health and safety issue. Lehrmann said he left the minister\u2019s suite without checking on Higgins. Chrysanthou suggested that Higgins was deliberately left out of the termination letter despite one of the reasons for his termination being that he left Higgins in Parliament House without checking on her welfare. Brown disagreed. Fiona Brown: \u2018She\u2019d never told me she\u2019d been assaulted Fiona Brown is now being asked about the process of finding Brittany Higgins another job during the 2019 election campaign. There was internal discussion about Higgins doing social media for Linda Reynolds in Perth and about her moving to the Gold Coast to be closer to her family, the court heard. Sue Chrysanthou SC asked Brown if the discussion about welfare concern was because Higgins had been assaulted. Brown: \u201cShe\u2019d never told me she\u2019d been assaulted\u201d. Fiona Brown said she was surprised when she found out Brittany Higgins was proceeding with her complaint of rape with the sexual assault unit. She said she was surprised Higgins had not told her she\u2019d been assaulted because she had expressed she was happy with the support she had received from her office: \u201cWe received almost gushing comments from Higgins\u201d. \u201cMs Higgins clearly didn\u2019t want to tell me or she would have told me,\u201d Brown said. Reynolds \u2018dissatisfied\u2019 with Lehrmann\u2019s response to \u2018show cause\u2019 letter, Brown tells court Fiona Brown is being asked questions about Bruce Lehrmann\u2019s termination process. After Lehrmann had packed up and left the office after a meeting with Brown he was sent a \u201cshow cause\u201d letter about why he should not be sacked after a security breach. Brown said she recalls Senator Linda Reynolds saying she was dissatisfied with Lehrmann\u2019s response to the letter. Brown agreed that she was told by Reynolds that the AFP commissioner told the minister on 4 April that a sexual assault had been reported. Brown said she was not told about this conversation until 5 April. Justice Lee denies request from Brown\u2019s team to clear court of all but accredited media Justice Michael Lee has denied a request from Fiona Brown\u2019s legal team that the court be cleared of everyone but accredited media. Her lawyers interrupted the cross-examination to say non-journalists were wandering \u201cin and out\u201d of the court which is contrary to the understanding that Brown could give her evidence in front of counsel and media only. Lee said \u2018no\u2019 because he is opposed to closed courts and any citizen was free to see the administration of justice in action. Bruce Lehrmann is not in court today. Fiona Brown recounts meeting with Senator Reynolds, Brittany Higgins Fiona Brown agreed that she sent a message saying Alex Hawke was \u201chot to trot\u201d, by which she meant he wanted her to go to the police station to report what Brittany Higgins had said. She has agreed that she resisted calls by Hawke and Senator Linda Reynolds to go to police, and that this led to her being fearful she may lose her job. She said she thought the ministers were trying to protect their positions. Brown agreed she gave Higgins information about calling a sexual assault hotline 1800respect. Brown is now being asked about the meeting she had with Reynolds and Higgins in the minister\u2019s suite. She said the minister wanted to catch up with Higgins as they had \u201cnot spoken\u201d since the incident \u201cand it was a welfare check\u201d. She agreed that by that stage she and Reynolds were in no doubt that Higgins had been found naked on the couch. However, she believed here was some doubt about whether when Higgins said \u201che was on top of me\u201d it meant it was not consensual. Brown agreed the topics that were discussed at the meeting included: if Higgins goes to police they will support her; that she should keep them informed; and that the minister said she was sorry. Brown said Reynolds also said she had an experience in her life that she had \u201csuppressed something\u201d and it was important to be in control. Fiona Brown wanted Brittany Higgins to have \u2018agency\u2019 over any reports to police Justice Michael Lee has intervened and asked Fiona Brown if, given everything she knew about the circumstances of Brittany Higgins and Bruce Lehrmann being drunk and Higgins saying \u201che was on top of me\u201d, she thought at the time that something sexual had happened, regardless of whether it was consensual or not. Brown: \u201cIt was possible\u201d. Brown has said she resisted the orders of two ministers, Senator Linda Reynolds and Alex Hawke, to go to the police because she wanted to give Higgins agency. Brown can\u2019t explain why she didn\u2019t takes notes of phone calls with Linda Reynolds Fiona Brown has said she can\u2019t recall certain conversations she had with colleagues about the incident. \u201cI was doing my professional best under a fast-paced environment,\u201d she said. Brown said she can\u2019t explain why she did not take notes of her phone calls with Senator Linda Reynolds. Brown said she can\u2019t remember events that she didn\u2019t take a note of. Brown agreed that she did not follow senator Reynolds\u2019 instruction to report the incident to police. Senior staffer Lauren Barons had a conversation with Brown and expressed her concern that Higgins should have \u201cagency\u201d and it was up to her to make the report. Brown said she agreed a police report should not be made without Higgins, and that she believed agency meant that \u201ca complainant needed to be in control and it was up to them to be in control\u201d. \u201cHiggins had still not given me an allegation \u2026 to me I needed more than that\u201d. Brown said the only information she had was that Higgins told her \u201che was on top of me\u201d. Fiona Brown \u2018shocked\u2019 when Brittany Higgins said \u2018Bruce was on top of me\u2019 Justice Michael Lee has asked Fiona Brown if it is fair for him to assume her contemporaneous notes are the best memory she has due to the stress she has suffered since the story came out, rather than relying on her memory of events. She agreed. Brown said when Brittany Higgins said \u201cBruce was on top of me\u201d she was shocked. \u201cIt came out of the blue \u2026 there was no hint \u2026 it was a blindside and it took me by surprise,\u201d Brown said. Brown says she can\u2019t remember telling Senator Linda Reynolds in a phone call that Higgins had reported to her the words \u201cBruce was on top of me\u201d. Fiona Brown says she was told to use \u2018neutral language\u2019 when interviewing Higgins, Lehrmann Sue Chrysanthou SC has returned to her line of questioning about a meeting Fiona Brown had with Brittany Higgins on Thursday 28 March, which was the second meeting after the alleged rape. Brown has qualified her answers by saying her answers are her \u201cbest recollection\u201d \u201cdue to the mental trauma I\u2019ve suffered\u201d. Brown said she was told to use \u201cneutral language\u201d when interviewing both Higgins and Bruce Lehrmann and that\u2019s why she asked Higgins if \u201csomething had happened that she didn\u2019t want to happen\u201d. She agrees that there is nothing in her contemporaneous notes about those instructions to use neutral language. Fiona Brown says she doesn\u2019t remember text exchange with News journalist Sue Chrysanthou SC, acting for Lisa Wilkinson, has asked Fiona Brown about communication she had with journalist Samantha Maiden from news.com.au who broke the story. Brown says she does not remember the text exchange but accepts it took place. She said she was \u201cshocked\u201d to see the article. In the message to Maiden she said she would leave any comment up to the prime minister\u2019s spokesman Andrew Carswell. Brown agrees she did tell Maiden to go to Carswell for a response. Live stream disabled ahead of Fiona Brown\u2019s cross-examination Justice Michael Lee said Fiona Brown will have access to medical support when the recording of her evidence is streamed on the federal court YouTube channel tomorrow. But the recording will be played in the interests of complete transparency. Wednesday will be a non-sitting day so the parties can write their submissions. The live stream has now been disabled, ahead of Brown entering the courtroom. Former Liberal staffer Fiona Brown arrives at court to be cross-examined Former Liberal staffer Fiona Brown has arrived at the federal court in Sydney to continue being cross-examined by Sue Chrysanthou SC, who is acting for Lisa Wilkinson. Wilkinson is in court again today. The public gallery is packed with accredited media as the live stream of the proceedings has been disabled until midday. Brown requested to give her evidence without the live stream because of her mental health. Justice Michael Lee has said he determined yesterday that it was in the interests of justice that the evidence be \u201cstreamed but not live streamed\u201d. After Brown\u2019s evidence is complete the court will hear from UK-based lip reader Tim Reedy. The cross-examination of former Liberal staffer Fiona Brown will continue this morning without the federal court\u2019s live stream but with media present in the courtroom. Brown was compelled to give evidence in Bruce Lehrmann\u2019s defamation trial yesterday after Justice Michael Lee rejected a request from her lawyer for her subpoena to be discharged on medical grounds. Lee had the YouTube live stream disabled and the court sat until 7.45pm on Monday \u2013 more than three hours after the usual finishing time. The judge said despite some criticism on social media that Brown was getting \u201cspecial treatment\u201d he was \u201ctaking appropriate judicial recognition of the evidence\u201d and \u201censuring there is public interest in open justice\u201d. Brown\u2019s evidence is due to be replayed on the court\u2019s YouTube channel on Wednesday morning. Last night Lisa Wilkinson\u2019s barrister, Sue Chrysanthou SC, asked Brown about her meetings with Lehrmann and Brittany Higgins. Lehrmann is suing Wilkinson and her employer Network Ten for an interview with Higgins that was broadcast on The Project in 2021. He alleges the story, which did not name him, defamed him by suggesting he raped Higgins in 2019. On Monday morning the Queensland state MP Sam O\u2019Connor said Higgins had told him that Lehrmann had raped her. Lehrmann has always denied the rape allegation and, in a previous criminal trial, pleaded not guilty to one charge of sexual intercourse without consent. He denied that any sexual activity had occurred. The criminal trial was aborted after it was discovered a juror had conducted their own research in relation to the case. In December last year prosecutors dropped charges against Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Higgins, saying a retrial would pose an \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d to her health."

            "date": "2023-12-03T08:00:11Z",
            "content": "Families bereaved during the Covid-19 pandemic will this week confront Boris Johnson over claims that he told colleagues he would prefer to see people die in large numbers than order a second lockdown that would harm the economy. Many relatives who lost loves ones will descend on the Covid inquiry en masse on Wednesday and Thursday, when Johnson will give two days of evidence in what promises to be the most emotionally charged and explosive sessions of the official investigation so far. The families are planning to greet Johnson on his arrival with photographs of those who died. They will also unveil a billboard poster by the campaign group 38 Degrees with the comment \u201cLet the bodies pile high\u201d, which former advisers, including Dominic Cummings, claim Johnson made at a key meeting in Downing Street in late 2020. The inquiry has already heard that the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, noted in his diary on 25 October 2020: \u201cPM meeting \u2013 begins to argue for letting it all rip. Saying yes, there will be more casualties, but so be it \u2013 \u2018they have had a good innings\u2019.\u201d The same entry also quoted Johnson as saying: \u201cMost people who die have reached their time anyway.\u201d Another former adviser to Johnson, Lord Udny-Lister, has also told the inquiry that he too heard the comments about letting the bodies pile high. Johnson has strongly denied having used such words. Cummings, however, says he heard his boss make the remarks after also declaring \u201cNo more fucking lockdowns\u201d in November 2020, following a meeting in which Johnson had felt he had been corralled into agreeing to four weeks of restrictions against his instincts. At the time a source corroborated the Cummings account to the Guardian and hinted that the comments had been heard by a small number of people outside Johnson\u2019s office. The relatives are this weekend still waiting to hear from the inquiry about arrangements for putting questions to the former prime minister. Nicola Brook, solicitor at Broudie Jackson Canter, who represents the 7,000 members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said: \u201cOur clients want us to focus on three core questions, namely: in the face of a wealth of scientific advice, why was there so much indecision, delay and dithering, which undoubtedly led to more deaths? Did Mr Johnson view older people as expendable? And does he share Matt Hancock\u2019s view that the first lockdown happened way too late?\u201d One of those who will be attending on Wednesday is Naomi Fulop, who lost her mother during the second wave of Covid, a few days before one of the infamous lockdown-busting parties held in Downing Street during Johnson\u2019s premiership. \u201cI want him to directly answer questions about the mistakes that he made, first of all leading up to the first lockdown,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the evidence we\u2019ve already heard from senior scientists that the lockdown was called late. \u201cBut even more unforgivably, following that first wave [what is his explanation for] not learning the lessons in advance of winter 2020 to 2021, and making a number of unforced huge mistakes in ignoring scientific advice about the two-week circuit breaker in September and having policies like \u2018eat out to help out\u2019. \u201cSo, mistake on mistake, ignoring scientists\u2019 advice, leading to the second wave in 2020 to 2021, which was even worse than the first wave. That\u2019s when my mother died.\u201d Fulop said Johnson had to explain \u201cthe terrible things\u201d he is supposed to have said. He has to account for those decisions and how he made them. Did his views on \u2018Let the bodies pile high\u2019 and \u2018They\u2019ve had a good innings\u2019 influence those decisions? \u201cHe seems to be revealing what he thinks \u2013 how did that influence his decision-making?\u201d Johnson has had many months to prepare for his appearance, along with a team of lawyers paid for by the Cabinet Office, as is the case with the legal expenses of all \u201ccore participants\u201d. He is expected to apologise for decisions that he and the government got wrong but make clear that in his view he got many of the major judgments right, including that about the vaccine. It is also understood that Johnson will try to frame his evidence in a way that avoids criticism of individuals including Cummings, who has likened Johnson to an out-of-control shopping trolley. Johnson wants his evidence to come across as constructive and helpful in assisting the inquiry in reaching conclusions on how the government can react better to another pandemic. Johnson is likely to be asked what he knew in advance about the controversial \u201ceat out to help out\u201d policy introduced by his successor but one, Rishi Sunak, in August 2020, when Sunak was chancellor. The scheme, which offered discounts for people going out to dine in restaurants, was regarded as high-risk by scientists who feared it would cause a spike in infections at a time when the government was still battling to control the virus. Several scientists and even former health secretary Matt Hancock have said they were not consulted in advance about the scheme. Sunak will appear at the inquiry next week."

            "content": "A 19-year-old British national has been killed while fighting for the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza. Binyamin Needham was one of two soldiers killed during an operation in the north of the territory on Sunday, according to a statement released by the IDF. Needham, the youngest of five siblings, was born in England and emigrated with his family to Israel at the age of eight, Haaretz reported. The newspaper said he was from the town of Zichron Yaakov. Needham is thought to be the second British national to have been killed serving with the IDF during or after the 7 October attacks. The first was 20-year-old Nathanel Young. The IDF said Needham was killed in close combat after his unit entered a building and encountered Hamas militants. It said Sgt Ben Zussman was also killed and that another two soldiers were wounded. Needham\u2019s sister, Orly, was quoted by Haaretz as saying her brother was \u201cso proud\u201d to be fighting with the IDF. \u201cHe had just finished basic training. He was happy to defend the country,\u201d she said. After his death, Needham was promoted to the rank of sergeant. The IDF said 75 soldiers have now been killed in operations in Gaza since 7 October, not including the personnel killed in the attacks themselves. Friday saw Israeli operations in Gaza resume after the end of a seven-day ceasefire during which more than 100 hostages had been released and the flow of aid into the territory had increased. On Monday, civilians in about 20 areas of central Gaza were told to move further south, with maps posted online for people to access via smartphones. Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were also seen moving down the main north-to-south road in Gaza near the southern city of Khan Younis. This movement came after Brig Gen Hisham Ibrahim, the commander of Israel\u2019s armoured corps, said the goals of Israeli forces in northern Gaza had \u201calmost been met\u201d. Gaza\u2019s health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, says more than 15,500 people, about 70% of them women and children, have so far been killed in the territory. Speaking on Saturday at his first press conference since fighting resumed, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the war would continue \u201cuntil we achieve all its aims\u201d. He added that the temporary ceasefire had allowed Israel\u2019s soldiers to prepare for \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas."

            "content": "Australian book sales have plateaued after a record year in 2022, with the post-Covid boom showing signs of subsiding. Nielsen BookScan has found that in this year to date, revenue in the Australian book market declined by 3% compared with the same time last year. But the consumer research and retail sales analyst believes this could be an overcorrection as readers get back to normal after significant year-on-year growth since the pandemic hit. \u201c2022 set new records, highlighting the enduring appeal of books as a source of joy and inspiration, particularly resilient in challenging economic conditions,\u201d the general manager of Nielsen BookData Australia, Bianca Whiteley, said. \u201cAlthough 2023 shows a modest adjustment, sales remain notably elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels, emphasising the enduring popularity of books.\u201d In the four weeks leading up to the week of Christmas, books sales typically surge by 100% (from 7% over a four week period to 14%). Last week alone people bought 143,113 different book titles, with the fifth volume of Alice Oseman\u2019s graphic novel Heartstopper becoming the number one Christmas bestseller, the first time in three years the spot has not been taken by an Australian author. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Last week the British writer and illustrator sold 60,012 copies of the coming of age work in its first three days of release, making it the UK\u2019s fastest-selling graphic novel ever and the overall bestselling book of the week across all categories, including adult and children\u2019s fiction and nonfiction. In Australia, Heartstopper Volume 5 sold 12,300 copies last week, taking the Australian total for copies of the series sold to almost 390,000 since 2019. Lola in the Mirror, the third novel by Trent Dalton, came in second place with 9,780 copies sold, while the third-highest bestseller was the 28th instalment in the crime thriller Jack Reacher series, The Secret. Jack Reacher has become something of a franchise since the creator of the eponymous protagonist, Lee Child, announced his retirement three years ago and passed the pen to his brother, Andrew Grant, who is now writing under the pseudonym Andrew Child. Last year\u2019s bestseller, the Australian cookbook by Nagi Maehashi, RecipeTin Eats: Dinner, which was also named book of the year in the 2022 Australian Book Industry Awards, continues to sell thousands of copies more than a year after its release. It was the fourth bestseller. Despite the overall slight drop in revenue for 2023, adult fiction recorded a 4% increase uplift in value, meaning an additional 230,000 books in that genre were sold compared with last year. In October this year, the multinational market analyst RationalStat predicted demand for Australian-authored books, now growing at a rate of 1.8% a year, would be worth US$ 968.9m by 2030."

            "date": "2023-12-27T16:21:13Z",
            "content": "Bargain hunters flocked to Britain\u2019s high streets in greater numbers this Boxing Day than last, with crowds of shoppers in central London returning to pre-pandemic levels for the first time. Full-day footfall was up by 4% compared with 26 December 2022 on a national level, according to figures from the retail analysts MRI Software, improving on initial estimates at midday of a 1.4% increase. On high streets the picture was even better, with a full-day rise of 8.8% year on year. Central London registered the most noteworthy improvement. The capital\u2019s famous shopping streets welcomed nearly 11% more people than last year and even managed a 1.6% increase compared with 2019, as visitors combined retail therapy with leisure activities. Overall, UK shopping areas registered lower footfall than on the last Boxing Day before the pandemic, with numbers down by 4.5% on high streets and by nearly 15% nationally. The biggest drop-off since Covid-19 has been felt in retail parks and shopping centres, where numbers have fallen by about a quarter since 2019. Jenni Matthews, the marketing and insights director at MRI Software, said the long-term trend of lower footfall reflected the long-term impact of online shopping, with many consumers starting their bargain-hunting online as early as the evening of Christmas Day. \u201cWe also can\u2019t forget that many people may be tightening their purse strings given the cost of living status, or may still be spending time with their families on Boxing Day and not be heading out to stores and destinations until later in the week.\u201d Some of the footfall that high street shops might have expected may also have been absorbed by Black Friday, the annual event in which retailers drop their prices dramatically to lure people into spending more overall in search of bargains. Black Friday took place closer to Christmas this year than it normally does. Matthews added that the particularly strong revival in central London could be down to the volume of festive events and attractions bringing in tourists and people from out of town. MRI Software measures the number of shoppers on the streets at nearly 2,800 \u201ccounting points\u201d on high streets and at retail parks and shopping centres."

            "content": "Call waiting times for the government\u2019s tax helplines are worse than during the pandemic, with HM Revenue and Customs now restricting access for millions of taxpayers. Accountants warn that callers face waits of up to an hour to get through, while some people have reported being cut off before a call is even answered. The most recent figures reveal the average time for a call to be answered was nearly 24 minutes in October, compared with less than 10 minutes in October 2020. HMRC says it faces increased demand and is keen for taxpayers to use its online services, which it says are quick and convenient to use. The service faced criticism last week after it announced that from Monday its self-assessment helpline will only focus on \u201cpriority\u201d calls, with most callers directed to online services. The restrictions will stay in place until 31 January, the deadline for submitting an online tax return. HMRC received 38 million calls in 2022/23 and received 16m items of correspondence that required a response. A Commons public accounts committee report published in January found that HMRC customer service staff numbers had fallen from 25,500 to 19,500 over five years. It warned that the level of customer service was not acceptable. The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) says the HMRC restrictions come as many people will have to complete a self-assessment return for the first time, due to frozen thresholds and rising incomes. About 5.5 million people a year call the self-assessment helpline. Glenn Collins, head of policy, technical and strategic engagement at ACCA, said: \u201cThe dramatically reduced service will be a worry for taxpayers and financial professionals. This move by HMRC once again demonstrates it lacks the proper resources that it desperately needs. \u201cWe have reports of spending almost up to an hour waiting for calls to be answered. People are also being cut off before their calls progress. This is a system at breaking point.\u201d Harriett Baldwin, chair of the Commons Treasury committee, wrote to HMRC last week highlighting concerns about its service standards. HMRC previously closed its self-assessment helpline between 12 June and 4 September this year, directing callers online. In the letter to Jim Harra, chief executive and first permanent secretary at HMRC, Baldwin wrote: \u201cThe restriction of access to the helpline was only announced on 7 December. Why have you not given taxpayers more notice?\u201d She has also asked for details of monitoring by HMRC to ensure people are not denied services. Tax experts say they are concerned that the digital services cannot properly support taxpayers. But HMRC says millions of taxpayers already file their taxes online, with 83% satisfied with the experience. Kelly Sizer, senior manager at the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which works to improve tax processes and policy for those on low incomes, said the group was not opposed to digital services, but HMRC was moving \u201ctoo fast, too soon\u201d. \u201cThey closed the self-assessment helpline over the summer and they are now restricting access in this busy period,\u201d said Sizer. \u201cHMRC\u2019s view seems to be that everyone can do everything online and so there\u2019s no need to ring. People sometimes just want assurance they are doing the right thing.\u201d Senga Prior, chair of the Association of Taxation Technicians\u2019 technical steering group, said: \u201cThere is a greater push [for taxpayers to use] digital resources, and fewer ways for them to speak to an actual person at HMRC. \u201cNot only will some people be left behind in that journey, but the services available to taxpayers and professional advisers via digital channels are too often incomplete, disjointed and poorly designed.\u201d HMRC says increased use of its online service will be more cost effective and free up expert advisers for those who genuinely need their help. The service says it is moving to a digital-first approach and its HMRC app is already used by more than a million people each month."

            "date": "2023-12-06T06:54:24Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson will face the first of two days of questioning over his handling of the pandemic when he appears before the UK\u2019s Covid inquiry on Wednesday. The former prime minister\u2019s appearance comes as the mystery of his Covid-era WhatsApp messages took another twist on Tuesday after it was reported that nearly six months of messages could not be retrieved. There has already been a lengthy saga over the evidence Johnson has submitted, with Rishi Sunak\u2019s government refusing to hand over the ex-PM\u2019s unredacted messages, notebooks and diaries until ordered to do so by the high court. Johnson, who begins two days of evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday morning, said previously he had been unable to access WhatsApp messages on an old phone he used during the start of Covid because he could not remember the passcode. He has denied deleting the messages. With assistance, he was able to access the phone. But, as reported in the Guardian in October, no WhatsApp messages from 31 January 2020 to 7 June that year, covering the arrival of the virus and the period leading up to and after the first lockdown, could be retrieved. The Times has now reported that technical teams have still been unable to access the messages. The paper said Johnson told the inquiry: \u201cThe technical team has been unable to determine the cause of this.\u201d A source close to Johnson declined to confirm this exact version of events. A spokesperson for the former prime minister said: \u201cBoris Johnson has fully cooperated with the inquiry\u2019s disclosure process and has submitted hundreds of pages of material. He has not deleted any messages. The Times report refers to a technical issue in recovery of material that is for the technical team to address.\u201d While Johnson\u2019s WhatsApp messages would most likely be a significant source of information for the current module of the inquiry, which is looking at government decision making, the hope is that the bulk of his messages will be retained by those to whom he sent them, who will have included them in their own evidence. The inquiry has already seen messages from Johnson during testimony from earlier witnesses. Johnson stopped using the iPhone in question in May 2021 on security advice, after it emerged that his phone number had been accessible online for at least 15 years. The information on the phone, Johnson\u2019s diary and his notebooks were passed to the inquiry without redactions after the high court dismissed an attempt by the Cabinet Office to seek judicial review of the decision by its chair, Lady Heather Hallett, that they should be handed over. Ministers had initially resisted giving up the full tranche of unredacted documents because of concerns that they contained private details, for example of a child\u2019s schooling arrangements. Some of the most eye-catching evidence seen so far has been from WhatsApp messages, including ones setting out the worries of people working with Johnson about his Downing Street operation. Exchanges between Mark Sedwill, who started the pandemic as the most senior civil servant in the UK, and Simon Case, the man who succeeded him and who is still in the job, saw Case describe the atmosphere as \u201cpoisonous\u201d and \u201cmad\u201d."

            "date": "2023-12-08T16:22:02Z",
            "content": "In his appearance before the Covid inquiry this week, Boris Johnson defended his handling of the pandemic. The former prime minister also expressed surprise that scientists were not consulted about the \u201ceat out to help out\u201d scheme, justified saying that older people should \u201caccept their fate\u201d, and claimed reporting on the Partygate scandal was a \u201ctravesty of the truth\u201d. Here five people whose personal and professional lives were deeply affected by the pandemic share their verdict on his performance. Suzanne Ford-Dunn, palliative care consultant On day one, Boris Johnson had quite a lot of responses where he said he couldn\u2019t recall and it struck me he\u2019s quite good at forgetting, whereas I have memories of that time that are etched on my brain that I would love to be able to forget. I can still see the young woman who looked at me through her Cpap [continuous positive airway pressure device] and mouthed: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. The young man who begged me not to turn off his ventilator, to give him another day. Almost more traumatic was the relatives who would come to the hospital and beg to be let in to say goodbye. [On Partygate], so many of us within healthcare absolutely followed the guidance even when it did seem to change every day and was difficult to keep up with, or seemed irrational or incoherent. Johnson\u2019s excuse was his staff were working extremely hard, and in the conditions they were working it would be very hard to follow. I think that\u2019s how we were all working in the NHS, yet we weren\u2019t having parties. His apparent lack of remorse and defending of all of it is very difficult for people to hear. But particularly people who have either worked through it like I have, or people who have been very unwell themselves or have lost loved ones. For most doctors as we watched scenes unfold in Lombardy, absolutely it twigged for us \u2013 we realised there was no way we were going to escape this. We knew we were already working in a broken healthcare system. It\u2019s interesting that it didn\u2019t twig, as Boris puts it. Mandy Yin, restaurateur and owner of Sambal Shiok, north London It didn\u2019t really surprise me, anything he said, but it was quite astonishing \u2013 one of the phrases he used, he should have twigged earlier. It\u2019s mind-blowing. It shows that he is completely out of touch. I, as a restaurateur, was watching very closely what everyone else worldwide was doing. In New York, restaurants had already started to close in mid-March. I remember a customer walking in completely covered head to toe with full protective gear. The severity of the situation had already started to pass to the general population. For a PM and his team to tell people to stay away from restaurants, but not shut us down properly, that was incredibly traumatic. I had to unilaterally make the decision to shut both my sites on the 16th for the safety of my team. There was no leadership, no clarity, confusion everywhere and that permeated the rest of the two years. [On Johnson\u2019s surprise that scientists weren\u2019t consulted on eat out to help out] \u2013 it\u2019s just sheer utter incompetence as a leader to not double check things \u2013 you don\u2019t assume something. Eat out to help out was incredibly stressful and put a lot of strain on hospitality businesses going from only being able to do takeaway to suddenly coping with three, four, five times the number of customers. Especially when there wasn\u2019t even a vaccine at that point, it was just very shortsighted. We would have appreciated not having that slight bump in sales but not having a second lockdown. We were left rudderless. I\u2019ve blocked this whole time out of my mind because it was so traumatic. Having to think about it is quite stressful. Naomi Fulop, member of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice My mother, Christina Fulop, died of Covid aged 94 on 8 January 2021 at the height of the second wave. I blame the government \u2013 I hold Boris Johnson accountable for my mother\u2019s death. In the summer of 2020, Johnson did not learn the lessons from the first wave. There were thousands of unnecessary deaths that winter, including my mother\u2019s. The NHS was overwhelmed, which he denied \u2013 there was a gasp in the public gallery when he said that. Johnson claimed that the UK did pretty well because we came in the middle of the pack. Pete Weatherby KC put to him evidence commissioned by the inquiry that is a league table of countries\u2019 excess deaths \u2013 the gold standard measure \u2013 and compared with France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, in western Europe, we are second from bottom: only Italy did worse than us. Countries like South Korea and Japan did a lot better. Hugo Keith, KC for the inquiry, put to him the comments such as people dying having \u201chad their innings\u201d, which I found incredibly painful. Johnson clearly did not like that. One of the KCs called them shamefully ageist comments, which is what they are. It\u2019s very painful to hear; he\u2019s talking about my mother and thousands of other people who died before their time and in an awful context. It really got to me. He\u2019s trying to rewrite his legacy. We challenged it yesterday and he didn\u2019t like it, he said: \u2018I don\u2019t believe your evidence stacks up.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t like when evidence is put to him that shows he failed. He failed in the thing he\u2019s meant to do, which is keep people safe. David Wilson, who received a \u00a31,000 fine after hosting an outdoor party he believed followed coronavirus rules at his restaurant, Calypso, in Blackburn Obviously it makes me feel quite angry. Even Johnson himself said it was all so confusing: it just kept on changing, the rules. I think it was really confusing to us. We got permission to have an event, there were football matches on throughout the country, but the government were saying one thing, the police a different thing. Then they came and fined us \u00a31,000 because someone was sitting with seven people instead of six \u2013 [No 10 staff] didn\u2019t get fined \u00a31,000, they got nothing like that. And they were blatantly breaking the rules. The strain of it all, being fined and going to court, it was like no end. Seeing on the news them partying, and now watching him in the inquiry, and all right he looked upset, saying they should have done things differently \u2013 but the photos don\u2019t lie, they were pure partying. Even with the inquiry, what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 all the millions of pound spent on it. Nobody is going to be charged or brought to book about it. If it was us that did it, we would have been prosecuted. Stephen Brierley, headteacher, St Margaret\u2019s school, south-west London Decisions that were made regarding schools back in 2020 and 2021 have had profound effects on the education system going forward and I hope the inquiry is able to give significant airtime to whether the best decisions were made. [On Johnson\u2019s defence of going against advice from scientists to implement a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d lockdown in September 2020] \u2013 that was a period when we were contact tracing and where any report of any kid with Covid, we had the responsibility to work out who they\u2019d been in contact with \u2013 which was not easy \u2013 and to tell other students they had to isolate for a period of days. That was an incredibly labour-intensive thing to have to do. The workload for teachers was certainly significant during that time, the responsibility as well \u2013 we weren\u2019t just responsible for education of students but the social aspects, poverty relief, we became responsible for health in a big way. I think most people would have gone for a lockdown earlier and Boris is almost saying: \u2018yes, I vastly underestimated\u2019 in the early stages of the pandemic. If we\u2019d locked down for less time would public finances have been in a better state? We would have benefited if they had. And the impact on student mental health has been significant."

            "content": "AstraZeneca is buying its first vaccine company in a $1.1bn deal that will expand the vaccine and immune therapy business it set up during the Covid pandemic. Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker has agreed to take over the Seattle-based company Icosavax, which is developing a potential vaccine for two common respiratory diseases. The US firm\u2019s lead product targets two diseases \u2013 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) \u2013 that cause severe illness and hospitalisation in adults over 60 and people with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular, kidney and respiratory disease. RSV and hMPV can also be serious in young children. In intermediate studies known as phase II trials, the vaccine showed robust immune responses against RSV and hMPV one month after vaccination. It is now going into late-stage, phase III trials which will involve between 20,000 and 30,000 volunteers. It is a combination protein VLP (virus-like particles) vaccine that is given as a single shot in the arm. AstraZeneca says because VLP vaccines mimic how naturally occurring viruses appear to the body\u2019s immune system, they may offer benefits over other vaccines, including a stronger immune response, greater breadth of protection, longer durability requiring fewer boosters and, compared with the current RSV vaccine from GSK, fewer side-effects. UK rival GSK and US firm Pfizer launched RSV vaccines this year. The GSK shot, called Arexvy, which was approved in the US in May and in the UK in July, is expected to bring in more than \u00a31bn in revenues in its first year on the market, making it a \u201cblockbuster drug\u201d. The Massachusetts-based Moderna is awaiting regulatory approval in the US and EU for its RSV vaccine, which is based on the mRNA technology that it used for its Covid jab. It is also testing a combination and hopes to have a triple vaccine against flu, Covid and RSV ready for 2026. Iskra Reic, the executive vice-president of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccines &amp; immune therapies division, said: \u201cThis virus-like particle vaccine technology has the potential to transform prevention against severe infectious diseases, including RSV and hMPV.\u201d She said it could be used to develop other combination vaccines against respiratory viruses. \u201cThis aligns with our strategy to deliver a portfolio of therapies to address high unmet needs in infectious diseases, and our ambition to protect the most vulnerable patients who have high risk of severe outcomes,\u201d she added. AstraZeneca said the deal built on its RSV expertise. It has developed an antibody treatment that protects infants from the respiratory disease, and sells it in partnership with France\u2019s Sanofi. The shot, called Beyfortus, has been approved in the UK, EU and the US."

            "content": "The attorney general of Texas is suing the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, alleging that it exaggerated the effectiveness of its Covid-19 vaccine and deceived the public. Ken Paxton announced the lawsuit on Thursday after filing it in Lubbock state district court in north-west Texas, the Texas Tribune reported. Paxton\u2019s suit comes as a consensus of health experts and scientists have said that the vaccine prevents severe infection and death from Covid-19. Paxton accused Pfizer of \u201c[engaging] in false, deceptive, and misleading acts and practices by making unsupported claims regarding the company\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine in violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act\u201d, according to a press release shared to X, formerly known as Twitter. Paxton argued that Pfizer\u2019s claims about effectiveness implied that it would effectively end the Covid-19 pandemic, and that it failed to do so within a year of being introduced. The lawsuit also added that claims the vaccine was 95% effective were not accurate, and that Covid-19 infection as well as death rates worsened as the vaccine became increasingly available. Pfizer released results on the effectiveness of Covid in November 2020, finding that the shot was 95% effective in the first 28 days after receiving the vaccine. The suit also claims that Pfizer \u201c[conspired]\u201d to silence those who were critical of the shot, common arguments made amid other anti-vaccine figures. Paxton\u2019s suit asks that Pfizer be prohibited from \u201cmaking representations about the efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine\u201d, the Hill reported. The attorney general is also requesting $10,000 for every alleged violation by Pfizer, in addition to other financial restitution. The total civil penalties against Pfizer total up to more than $10m, according to Reuters. In a statement, Pfizer said the \u201cstate\u2019s case has no merit\u201d, adding that the vaccine has been administered to 1.5 billion people \u201cand helped protect against severe Covid-19 outcomes, including hospitalization and death\u201d. \u201cThe representations made by the company about its Covid-19 vaccine have been accurate and science-based,\u201d it read. The lawsuit is Paxton\u2019s second against Pfizer in November. The attorney general previously sued the pharmaceutical company and an additional supplier for allegedly altering quality-control tests on ADHD medication for children."

            "date": "2023-12-07T15:45:35Z",
            "content": "The first trial in Africa of two combination vaccines to prevent HIV has been halted after researchers concluded it was not working. The vaccines (part of the PrEPVacc study) were being tested on 1,500 people aged between 18 and 40 in Uganda, Tanzania and South Africa. The African-led trial, which began in December 2020, was stopped last month after an interim review of progress. The final results are expected to be made public in late 2024. The trial of a pre-exposure prophylaxis pill running alongside the vaccines tests will continue. Dr Eugene Ruzagira, trial director from the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) and assistant professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cVaccinations to PrEPVacc trial participants have been stopped because an analysis of the data collected so far by our independent data-monitoring committee has led them to conclude that there is little or no chance of demonstrating that the vaccines we are testing are reducing the risk of acquiring HIV.\u201d The PrEPVacc trials, led by African researchers with support from European scientists, tested two different combinations of HIV vaccines to see if either could prevent infection in populations particularly at risk of infection. The trials were funded with a \u20ac15m (\u00a312.8m) grant from the EU\u2019s European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership. Prof Jonathan Weber, from Imperial College London, one of the trial\u2019s sponsors, said: \u201cWe do clinical trials because we don\u2019t know the answer to questions. It was important to find out whether the combination vaccine regimens in PrEPVacc, developed over 20 years, should be ruled out or further developed for preventing HIV. \u201cWhile we await the final results and analysis of individual products, I believe that our interim result puts this generation of putative HIV vaccines to bed,\u201d he said. Previous trials in South Africa to test the only vaccine that had shown any success in protecting against HIV \u2013 the RV144 \u2013 developed in Thailand, was stopped in February 2020 after interim results found it was not working. Prof Pontiano Kaleebu, PrEPVacc\u2019s chief investigator at UVRI, said developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection was \u201ca critical goal for Africa\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is a goal that must have even greater urgency now that no HIV vaccines are being trialled for efficacy anywhere in the world. \u201cWe have come so far in our HIV-prevention journey, but we must look to a new generation of vaccine approaches and technology to take us forward again.\u201d About 39 million people worldwide are living with HIV, more than 25 million in sub-Saharan Africa. Ruzagira told an Aids conference in Zimbabwe on Wednesday that he remained optimistic. \u201cThe scientific hurdles are high, but I have equally high hopes that an HIV vaccine will be developed one day,\u201d he said. The RV144 vaccine was trialled in Thailand between 2003 and 2006, which after three years reduced infection rates by almost a third. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 December 2023 to clarify that the trials involved testing of two different combinations of HIV vaccines, not of HIV, as an earlier version said."

            "content": "Boris Johnson\u2019s appearance before the Covid-19 inquiry is not until Wednesday but it is already making headlines in the Netherlands amid a mixture of amusement and alarm at claims he asked for British spies to plan a \u201craid\u201d on a Dutch vaccine plant. The operation \u2013 according to sources who briefed Johnson\u2019s employer, the Daily Mail \u2013 would have taken place against the backdrop of a tit-for-tat row in March 2021 between the then prime minister and the EU, which was moving towards restricting exports of vaccines across the Channel. An \u201cenraged\u201d Johnson asked security services to draw up \u201cmilitary options\u201d to obtain \u201cimpounded\u201d doses of AstraZeneca vaccine from a plant in Leiden after Britain had negotiated a deal with the company. But while Britain\u2019s security services were spared their biggest debacle on Dutch soil since Operation Market Garden, the claim has been widely reported on front pages in the Netherlands. Elsewhere, Russian state media generated a po-faced report on the claims, interspersing clips of Johnson with footage of British special forces and overlaying them with a sinister backing track. The Dutch ministry of foreign affairs confirmed it was \u201caware\u201d of the report but declined to comment. Johnson is expected to refer to the episode, potentially in a written statement accompanying his evidence to the inquiry, which will take place over the course of Wednesday and Thursday. Figures close to Johnson have been busily briefing the media before his appearance, advising that he will reject claims that he was not sufficiently engaged in policy during the 10-day period. The former Conservative leader will reject claims that he did not concentrate on the looming threat of the pandemic during the half-term break in February 2020 because he was supposedly writing a biography about William Shakespeare. A spokesperson for Johnson previously rejected reports that he was focused on the book during the critical period in question but Downing Street also did not deny that Johnson had worked on the book, for which he received a \u00a388,000 advance from his publisher Hodder &amp; Stoughton UK in 2015, since becoming prime minister in July 2019. \u201cThe evidence shows, from the diary extracts, that he wasn\u2019t away all the time. He came back into the office from Chevening. The records show he was working the whole time, he wasn\u2019t writing a book \u2026 We think this one is quite easily dealt with.\u201d the Telegraph quoted a source close to Johnson as saying. Johnson is expected to admit some fault when he is cross examined at the inquiry but will also seek to talk up the things that he believed he got right, ranging from the vaccines rollout to eventually opening up the economy. He will argue that those criticising him have been doing so from specific perspectives \u2013 including science, the economy and broader public health \u2013 and that he was the only person who had to balance all of these things. The former prime minister will resist going on the attack, according to his supporters, and will also seek to offer ideas about how the UK could cope with a future pandemic."

            "content": "Africa\u2019s leading public health body is using the first ever health day at Cop on 3 December to call for increased funding to fight the health impacts of the climate crisis on the continent and create more resilient systems to ensure it is prepared for the next pandemic. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) launched the second phase of its three-year, $1.5bn Saving Lives and Livelihoods drive this week, but its director general, Dr Jean Kaseya, said multiple disease outbreaks combined with the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and recovery from Covid means that much more financial support is needed. \u201cWe want our partners to understand that in Africa we are doing our best to provide funding to tackle these issues but we need more money from multilateral mechanisms such as the [World Bank] pandemic fund, [the US aid fund] Pepfar and the Global Fund,\u201d said Kaseya. \u201cBetween January and November 2023, Africa faced 158 disease outbreaks. These come immediately after Covid when economies were almost destroyed. Now countries have to respond to these outbreaks.\u201d He added that the climate crisis is a leading contributor to the problem, including the current rise in cholera cases. \u201cToday we have 18 countries affected by cholera with 4,000 deaths; we have dengue in west Africa killing people.\u201d He added that Africa needed a resilient health system to be able to cope with every outbreak. \u201cEach outbreak we miss can become a pandemic \u2013 and that is the major concern we have today. We don\u2019t want the next pandemic to come from Africa due to climate change. This is why we are pushing for more funding.\u201d The 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic as well as Covid revealed the extent of Africa\u2019s health insecurity, said Kaseya, and highlighted the need for African manufacturers of vaccines and other medicines. Speaking this week at the Conference on Public Health in Africa in Lusaka, Zambia, Kaseya likened the drive for local manufacturing to \u201cAfrica\u2019s second independence\u201d. \u201cWhen we had Covid, we discovered that Africa was abandoned. We saw we were not independent. Africa begged the world to get even masks and gloves.\u201d Only 1% of vaccines used in Africa come from suppliers on the continent. Africa CDC\u2019s goal is that by 2040 at least 60% of all vaccines used in Africa will be home-produced. \u201c[Local manufacturing] will build our economy; it will create jobs; it will be an opportunity for innovation, and it will contribute to peace and security because we know when people have jobs and access to a number of commodities they are not fighting,\u201d said Kaseya. Africa CDC is also supporting a drive to train thousands of new health workers to fill gaps in expertise. \u201cLess than 10% of African countries are able to respond to a major outbreak with a skilled health workforce,\u201d said Kaseya. \u201cAfrica requires 6,000 field epidemiologists, yet we currently only have 1,900. Additionally, the continent needs 25,000 frontline epidemiologists, but we presently have just 5,000.\u201d National governments are being encouraged to finance Africa CDC\u2019s vision for a resilient health system across the continent, but budgets vary widely from country to country, and Covid and the climate crisis have taken a toll on economies. \u201cMy message to Cop28 is we want Africa to be heard. We want to say: \u2018Listen, we are bringing evidence on how climate change is affecting us directly and indirectly.\u2019 Every year Africa is losing 5 to 15% in GDP from climate change. When you are losing that you don\u2019t have enough [budget] for health,\u201d said Kaseya."

            "date": "2023-12-01T06:00:07Z",
            "content": "Each passing week there seems to be a strengthening in the evidence that air pollution harms our health. Now research in Rome has revealed the impact of air pollution on our mental health. Dr Federica Nobile of the department of epidemiology of the Lazio regional health service explained what led to the research. \u201cRecent studies have linked air pollution to the development of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and psychotic episodes. However, all these associations have been mainly investigated in small groups, making their results challenging to generalise.\u201d Nobile\u2019s team started with census data on more than 1.7 million adults that were living in Rome in 2011 and matched these with medical and public health insurance records. Health records were scanned for the next eight years for new cases of mental health problems, including people admitted to hospital or those with new repeat prescriptions for antipsychotics, antidepressants and mood stabilisers. These were compared with air pollution data and traffic noise where people lived as well other societal factors that may affect mental health including poverty, unemployment, education and marital status. They found that people living in areas with higher particle pollution had a greater chance of developing schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders. This was matched by analysis of drug prescriptions, where people aged between 30 and 64 had the clearest association with air pollution. Using data from the study, it is possible to predict the benefits from improving the city\u2019s air. Reducing Rome\u2019s average particle pollution by 10% could reduce these common mental health conditions by 10-30%. Even greater improvements would be achieved by meeting the European Commission\u2019s proposed air pollution limits for 2030 and the World Health Organization guidelines. Prof Francesco Forastiere of Italy\u2019s National Research Council and Imperial College London said: \u201cOur discovery underscores the critical importance of implementing stringent measures to reduce human exposure to air pollutants. These are crucial not only for safeguarding against physical ailments but also for preserving mental wellbeing.\u201d Understanding of these issues has been slowly improving. Seventy-one years ago, London\u2019s great smog of 1952 led to the deaths of about 12,000 people, mainly from breathing problems, heart attacks and strokes. Research from the 1990s added lung cancer to the list of air pollution impacts but the effects on brain health were overlooked. A study on pet dogs in Mexico in 2002 helped lead to conclusions that air pollution exposure added to dementia risk in later life. And it was observations of the association between living in an urban area and the greater risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders that led researchers to investigate air pollution as a possible cause. Other studies, including a seven-year investigation led by King\u2019s College London, found that air pollution also had a role in severity and relapse in people with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Dr Ioannis Bakolis, of King\u2019s College London, who was not involved in the Rome study, said: \u201cThe large-scale study in Rome provides much-needed evidence and increases our confidence on the link between air pollution and psychiatric disorders, augmenting previous findings from the UK, US and Denmark. \u201cRome residents\u2019 average exposure to annual PM2.5 is more than three time higher than what the WHO suggests. Reducing air pollution to WHO guidelines could not only improve brain health but also reduce demand to already overstretched post-pandemic psychiatric services.\u201d"

            "title": "Huge delays to access maternal mental health care in England called a scandal",
            "date": "2023-12-05T05:00:33Z",
            "content": "Almost 20,000 women a year living with mental health problems triggered by being pregnant or giving birth are being denied support by the NHS, the Guardian can reveal. Furthermore, those who do receive mental health help for their trauma are having to wait up to 19 months to start treatment in some parts of England because specialist services are so overstretched. The situation has been described as \u201can absolute scandal\u201d and sparked warnings that \u201crationing\u201d of such vital care could leave women who do not get it in a very vulnerable state and risk their children facing lifelong health problems and stop mothers bonding with their baby. One in four mothers develop a mental health problem as a result of pregnancy or childbirth, for example, because she has experienced birth trauma or lost her baby. Common conditions include postnatal depression as well as anxiety, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder that emerge after the birth. The widespread refusal of help and huge delays in accessing maternal mental health care has emerged in new NHS figures obtained by Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, Labour\u2019s former shadow minister for mental health, in freedom of information requests to England\u2019s 54 NHS mental health trusts. Last year 11,507 women who sought care for such problems did not get any after they had been assessed, according to figures provided by 34 specialist trusts. But extrapolating those findings to the other 20 trusts that did not release data, despite their legal duty to do so, means that an estimated 18,953 mothers across England as a whole were denied care, Allin-Khan said. \u201cIt is an absolute scandal that new mothers are facing long waits for mental health services and all too often end up being turned away. No mother should be left behind to suffer in silence,\u201d Allin-Khan told the Guardian. \u201cWe know all too well how important the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life are. Failing to support new mothers during this crucial period will have an unfathomable human cost.\u201d During 2022-23 the Southern Health mental health trust did not provide treatment for 1,644 women seeking perinatal \u2013 or maternal \u2013 mental health care once it had assessed them. It \u201cclosed\u201d their referral. In Essex 929 women were refused help, as were 924 in Kent and Medway. However, only one of those who sought care from the Berkshire and Norfolk and Suffolk mental health trusts last year were denied it, according to those trusts\u2019 figures. Dr Alain Gregoire, the president of the Maternal Mental Health Alliance, said the \u201cunacceptable\u201d situation Allin-Khan had revealed was mainly due to most services trying in vain to meet demand despite having sometimes significant shortages of doctors, nurses and therapists. \u201cStaff are working absolutely flat-out but can\u2019t deliver the amount of care they should be delivering. So they are having to make clinical decisions about who gets priority. No one is saying \u2018don\u2019t see this woman\u2019. They just don\u2019t have the capacity to do it. \u201cIt is rationing of care at a clinical level because there just isn\u2019t the capacity to deliver that care, largely because there aren\u2019t enough staff.\u201d Maternal mental ill health is estimated to cost the NHS \u00a31.2bn a year and society as a whole \u00a38.1bn. Much of the NHS\u2019s \u00a31.2bn bill is care for children whose mothers struggled to form a close bond with them because of their maternity-related mental ill health. The dire situation facing women struggling with such problems comes despite NHS England having created in recent years what it describes as a \u201cworld-leading programme\u201d to expand the help available. It has set up a specialist team in every part of England and increased the number of places in mother and baby units, which treat the most seriously ill women as inpatients, for example those with postpartum psychosis. NHS England did not respond when asked about the large number of women whose pleas for care are being rejected and the long waits that Allin-Khan uncovered or offer any explanation for them. But Angela McConville, the chief executive of parenting charity NCT, said: \u201cThe lack of mental health support services for pregnant women and women in the postnatal period is now at a stage where we would consider them to be dangerously patchy and unreliable. Access \u2026 remains a postcode lottery. \u201cServices are inconsistent and poorly-resourced, with long wait times that are detrimental to the long-term health and wellbeing of new parents and their babies.\u201d That scarcity of NHS care means that the NCT is receiving more and more referrals for \u201cwomen with increasingly complex mental health needs who cannot easily access NHS services\u201d to the perinatal mental health services it runs itself, McConville added. Warning signs of mental distress among pregnant women and mothers are more likely to be missed because of a recent fall in the number of specialist perinatal mental health midwives, she said. Care delays also increase the risk of a woman taking her own life, experts warn. A report from the annual confidential inquiry into maternal deaths published in October highlighted that \u201csuicide is the leading direct cause of death between six weeks and 12 months after the end of pregnancy\u201d. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cWomen across England are benefiting from specialist perinatal mental health support, with an estimated 51,000 new mums treated over the last year, up nearly 70% compared to three years ago, with every local health system now having access to a specialist community perinatal mental health team.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-03T18:00:20Z",
            "content": "When the destructive summer blaze swept across Lahaina, in west Maui, Maryann Kobatake\u2019s nephew helped ferry a friend\u2019s grandmother and cousins to safety. On the drive out of a burning Front Street, the town\u2019s main thoroughfare, she said the 18-year-old heard screams and witnessed carnage that haunts him still. He has not discussed what he saw with her or other family members. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to relive it by talking,\u201d she said, adding that she had tried to get him to open up to her. \u201cBecause he\u2019s had it tough in life, I think that\u2019s just how he copes with it.\u201d Kobatake, who is Native Hawaiian, said she was worried that her nephew\u2019s habit of suppressing his emotions may leave him unprepared to navigate PTSD symptoms and triggers, especially given that, every day, he has to drive by the ravaged town on his way to school. The 8 August wildfire that devastated the centuries-old town was the deadliest in modern US history, killing 100 people and displacing 11,000. The blaze reduced Front Street\u2019s brightly painted wooden storefronts, cultural institutions and mid-century homes to block upon block of rubble and charred palm trees. Survivors evoked Pompeii in describing scenes of melting cars and bodies in trees. The trauma of seeing homes turned to ash, and the stress of shuffling among temporary living arrangements, carries serious mental health implications for children and adolescents, who process grief more acutely than adults. \u2018Every single person is going to need help\u2019 Since schools in Lahaina reopened in mid-October, the Maui county certified community behavioral health clinic \u2013 the only remaining federally funded behavioral health site in Lahaina \u2013 has seen an influx of parents seeking counseling and psychotherapy for their children. Instability, loss and fear of the unknown are the greatest challenges children are confronting post-fire, the long-term impact of which could include depression, anxiety and increased risk of substance abuse, said John Oliver, the clinic\u2019s director. In Lahaina, parents and children are grieving together. \u201cIf a child loses someone in a different situation, the parents can be a pillar of support,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now they\u2019re grieving alongside their kids too.\u201d After losing their homes three months ago, Kobatake\u2019s nephew \u2013 a high school football player \u2013 is one of three teenage boys staying with Kobatake and her husband at their temporary home, a two-bedroom vacation rental arranged by the Red Cross sheltering program. She also looks after her son, also 18, and a younger nephew, she said, as they adjust to their new reality, sharing donated clothes, food and water from family-run distribution hubs. Kobatake said the trio of teenagers had firmly bottled up their feelings since the tragedy; not once have they openly grieved, lashed out or reacted emotionally. As with many boys their age, she said, they may take crying to be a sign of weakness, but she\u2019s convinced the valve will burst sooner or later. \u201cIf nothing triggers a reaction for them to cry,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s going to happen during their graduation next year.\u201d In September, Kobatake said, she declined counseling service from a Red Cross volunteer \u2013 and not because she wasn\u2019t struggling with what had happened. She has suffered from bouts of insomnia and grief over belongings lost in the flames, such as her children\u2019s baby photos and schoolwork from kindergarten. She left her job as a Safeway manager near the resorts, she said, because her capacity for customer service has \u201cgone out the door\u201d. But finding long-term shelter for her family has taken up all her time, and the return of tourism is delaying her ability to heal. \u201cEventually, after we find housing and get settled in, every single person is going to need help,\u201d Kobatake said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger, a lot of stress, because we were forced to accommodate these tourists even though we lost everything.\u201d \u2018A new normal of moving around\u2019 For Miguel Ceballos, a father of four with deep-set eyes and thick eyebrows, the biggest concern is housing insecurity. Since the fire, which destroyed their three-bedroom rental apartment, Ceballos, his wife and their children have been displaced seven more times under the Red Cross sheltering program. Their room assignments, in various resorts across west Maui, rarely accommodated six people. Ceballos said his family was once placed in a one-bedroom unit where they had to take turns sleeping atop couch cushions on the floor; another unit didn\u2019t have a kitchen where he could cook the meals his children craved. The moves affected his children differently, Ceballos said. His youngest son, age five, lost interest in school and refused to wake up in the morning; his formerly buoyant older daughter, 13, became sad and withdrawn. A family counselor with Catholic Charities Hawaii has been exceptionally useful, Ceballos said, in helping him communicate with his children. \u201cI\u2019m learning to let them know I\u2019m mourning and hurting as well so they don\u2019t bottle it up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so important not only for the children but also us.\u201d Ceballos and his wife came up with some solutions of their own: they instructed their children not to unpack their suitcases after each move so they wouldn\u2019t become attached to the place. \u201cWe tell them, \u2018We\u2019re on an adventure,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that the family had created a routine of watching the sunset and going sightseeing together. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when the next one\u2019s gonna come, but we\u2019re going and we\u2019re going to find new things.\u201d Skye Horie, a licensed marriage and family therapist at the clinic Play Therapy Maui, said that adjusting to \u201ca new normal of moving around\u201d can be particularly traumatizing for young people. \u201cUntil they have more permanent housing, there will be that ongoing stress of not feeling safe and settled,\u201d she said. To model healthy coping behaviors, Horie encourages parents to share with their children their own thoughts and feelings about the fire, including what went wrong and what could have been done differently. \u201cIf parents are avoiding talking about it, of course kids will do the same thing,\u201d she said. There are many obstacles to residents getting the help they need. A longstanding distrust of the government, given the history of colonization and neglect, and the decision to prioritize the return of tourism over long-term housing for survivors, has prevented people from seeking available care, practitioners say. Oliver, of the behavioral health clinic, said some patients expressed frustration with having to repeatedly check in with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the Red Cross to continue receiving benefits. They\u2019re also skeptical about dealing with a changing cast of government workers \u201cwho don\u2019t know the island\u201d, he said. Other barriers include medical bills and a lack of transportation to and from services. Having easy access to care and a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d treatment team is pivotal, Oliver said, because people are so focused on surviving that they might not have the capacity to navigate bureaucratic healthcare obstacles. \u201cPeople need more transparency in what is happening to them because everything feels so out of control,\u2019\u201d he said. Ceballos said he wants to secure a permanent home for his children before the holiday season, but said finding an affordable rental apartment in west Maui was like searching for a \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d. The market rent for a three-bedroom unit is at least $7,000, more than twice what he had been paying for their last apartment. That figure was unthinkable even before he lost his job at Ono Gelato Company, which suffered extensive damage from the fire. Facing the scale of what he\u2019s lost, Ceballos is still hopeful. In late September, seven weeks after the fire, he and his wife returned to their burned apartment to look for remains of the life they\u2019d built. Sifting through heaps of ash and rubble, they found, undamaged, a heart-shaped memorial glass engraved with the name of their fifth child, who died years ago. \u201cThings that remind us of where we come from also reminds us that we will overcome,\u201d Ceballos said. This story is part of a series on the aftermath of the Maui wildfires"

            "date": "2023-12-18T19:50:28Z",
            "content": "Mothers in England will be asked in detail if pregnancy or giving birth has affected their mental health as a result of new NHS guidance to GPs. The move is part of a drive by NHS England to improve support for women suffering postnatal depression or other mental health problems linked to their pregnancy or childbirth. Under the new guidance GPs will ask women more questions than before about how they are feeling when they attend their postnatal health check six to eight weeks after giving birth. Family doctors will look for any sign that the woman may have a condition such as postnatal PTSD as a result of experiencing a traumatic birth or psychosis induced by bearing a child. Anyone who the GP feels needs help with their mental wellbeing will be referred to specialist maternal mental health services, which have been expanded in recent years. One in four of the 600,000 women a year who gives birth in England develops a mental health problem as a result of her pregnancy or experience of giving birth. NHS England has drawn up the new guidance \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 with the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) in an attempt to reduce suffering, tackle the annual \u00a38.1bn cost of maternal mental ill-health and lower the risk that a new mother may take her own life. \u201cMothers should be supported after giving birth. This includes being able to get the mental and physical health support needed for a healthy recovery, while giving newborns the best start in life,\u201d said Victoria Atkins, the health secretary. The health check is also an opportunity for mothers to ask about physical health problems. \u201cThis new advice for GPs around the long-term health implications of conditions that may first appear during pregnancy such as gestational diabetes, hypertension and depression, will mean women are offered guidance about conditions that may develop or become more severe in later life,\u201d said Dame Lesley Regan, the women\u2019s health ambassador for the government. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the RCGP\u2019s chair, said the guidance \u201crecognises the importance and complexity of the six to eight-week postnatal consultation, highlighting the opportunity to identify and offer evidence-based treatment for issues such as postnatal mental health problems and pelvic health complications of pregnancy and birth.\u201d But GPs need more time to help women who have recently given birth because many postnatal conditions require longer appointments than the standard 10 minutes and then will require follow-up consultations, she added."

            "content": "The data collected by Dr Rosena Allin-Khan (Huge delays to access maternal mental health care in England called a scandal, 5 December) rightly highlights the urgent need to provide pregnant women, women who have recently given birth and those who have experienced complications of pregnancy and childbirth with better access to mental health support. Every mother knows pregnancy can affect the mind just as much as the body. Postnatal depression, psychosis, OCD, PTSD and similar conditions can have a devastating impact on families and the ability for new parents to enjoy time with their babies and other children. We wouldn\u2019t expect someone to wait 19 months for life-saving surgery, so why is it acceptable for people with serious mental illness to wait that long for treatment? While timely mental health care for new parents is key to healthy childhood development, we know that many pregnant women and new mothers feel isolated and vulnerable. In my experience, community perinatal mental health teams and maternal mental health services want to provide patients with the best care possible, but a lack of staff can prevent them from seeing everyone quickly. This needs to be addressed through secure funding, and better recruitment and retention policies that support all services across the country. Many women and their families are in a position where they have to juggle multiple concerns, such as debt and insecure housing, which can significantly affect their mental health, wellbeing and recovery. We all need to come together as a society to support mothers across the board to enable them to reach their full potential. Research consistently tells us that investing in maternal mental health yields long-term benefits for families and significantly improves outcomes for children.

            "date": "2023-12-29T11:00:03Z",
            "content": "The UK is entering an election year with the economy struggling to grow as households and businesses come under pressure from rising borrowing costs, higher taxes and elevated living expenses. Rishi Sunak is expected to send voters to the polls in 2024 having declared victory on his primary economic target to halve inflation in 2023. However, the Bank of England has warned the UK is facing a 50-50 chance of a recession, while living standards are on track to be lower at the end of the parliament than they were at the start of it for the first time on record. Here are five charts underpinning the UK\u2019s economic prospects in 2024. Falling but stubbornly above-target inflation Inflation has fallen from more than 10% in January 2023 to 3.9% in November, driven mainly by cooling energy prices. However, the annual rate has stuck at persistently higher levels than anticipated, as the UK grapples with the highest rate in the G7. While inflation is expected to continue to fall in 2024, the Bank is forecasting it to remain above its government-set target until the end of 2025, maintaining pressure on households. Lower inflation does not mean prices are coming down, only that they are rising less quickly. Financial markets are predicting that cooling inflation and weak economic growth will force the Bank to start cutting interest rates from the current level of 5.25% from as early as the summer, as central banks across advanced economies begin to dial back the toughest increase in borrowing costs for decades. However, there are risks inflation could remain persistently high amid geopolitical tensions and a tight UK labour market. The Bank has said it is watching closely for signs of inflation persistence from pay growth and prices in the services sector. Weak GDP growth Economic activity has slowed to a crawl in recent months, with gross domestic product (GDP) unexpectedly shrinking in October, according to the latest official figures, as households come under sustained pressure from higher living costs. The Bank of England has warned there is a 50-50 chance of a recession, beginning around the time a spring general election could be held, amid the impact from higher borrowing costs. It expects zero growth for 2024 as a whole. Sunak has placed growing the economy among his top priorities after years of lacklustre performance. While growth proved more resilient to the shocks of the Covid pandemic and energy crisis than anticipated in 2023, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said in November that it expected the UK economy to grow more slowly over the coming years. It is slightly more upbeat than the Bank, pencilling in growth of 0.7% for 2024 \u2013 still less than half the annual average growth rate between 1998 and the 2008 financial crisis. Rising unemployment Weak activity and higher borrowing costs are expected to weigh heavily on employers\u2019 hiring intentions in 2024, with forecasters anticipating a rise in unemployment over the course of the year. The UK\u2019s jobless rate has remained at historically low levels over recent months despite pressure on the economy, as employers struggle to fill near-record numbers of job vacancies. However, the number of job openings has fallen in recent months as hiring demand fades. The OBR forecasts unemployment will rise to a peak of 1.6 million people (4.6% of the labour force) by the second quarter of 2025, up from the current level of about 1.5 million (4.2%). With weaker hiring demand and cooling inflation, average annual pay growth is expected to fall to about 3.7% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, down from a peak of about 8% in 2023. Tax cuts? Taxes as a share of the economy are on track to reach the highest sustained levels since Clement Attlee\u2019s postwar Labour government 1945 to 1951 \u2013 even after the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, cut national insurance and offered tax relief on business investment at the autumn statement. Fuelled by a six-year \u201cstealth\u201d freeze on income tax thresholds, revenues for the exchequer are on course to reach almost 38% of GDP by 2028-29, significantly above the pre-pandemic level of about 33%. Hunt is expected to use his spring budget on 6 March to announce electioneering tax cuts before the general election. However, he is constrained by a commitment to reduce the UK\u2019s national debt as a share of the economy within five years. The OBR forecast at the autumn statement that Hunt would meet his target with about \u00a313bn to spare. But this was predicated on plans that included a sharp \u00a36bn rise in fuel duty this spring, which the chancellor is unlikely to apply, and a new austerity drive after the general election. Soaring housing costs The Bank of England\u2019s most aggressive cycle of interest rate rises in decades has fuelled an explosion in housing costs, triggering a timebomb in the mortgage market. Most home loans have a fixed rate \u2013 meaning higher costs come with a lag. About half of all mortgages have repriced since December 2021. A further 5m are expected to be hit by 2026. For the typical owner-occupier rolling off a fixed rate between the summer of this year and the end of 2026, the Bank expects monthly repayments to increase by about \u00a3240, a jump of about 39%. Many landlords have increased the rent they charge or sold properties to offset their own increasing borrowing costs, contributing to the sharpest increase in private sector rents on record."

            "content": "Britain\u2019s largest recruiters have warned the Bank of England that demand for permanent hiring among UK businesses has plunged at the second fastest rate since the pandemic, amid worsening headwinds for the UK economy. Ahead of the central bank\u2019s decision on interest rates on 14 December, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) trade body said lingering economic uncertainty and hesitancy to commit to new hires had weighed on activity in November. A monthly snapshot of the UK jobs market produced by the REC and the accountancy firm KPMG, tracked closely by Threadneedle Street, showed availability of new job candidates increased at the fastest rate since December 2020. Permanent staff appointments dropped at the second quickest rate since June 2020, when the first Covid-19 lockdown triggered an economic collapse. The bank\u2019s policymakers, including its governor, Andrew Bailey, are closely monitoring Britain\u2019s jobs market for evidence of inflation persistence after pausing a round of 14 consecutive interest rate increases in September. With the economy under growing pressure from higher borrowing costs, the bank is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the current level of 5.25%. Bailey has said that rates would need to remain high for a prolonged period to tackle stubbornly high inflation. However, the latest figures from the REC and KPMG showed few signs that the jobs market could add significantly to inflation in future. According to the latest figures, starting salary inflation dipped to a 32-month low, while job vacancies declined for the second time in three months. It comes before official figures on the state of the jobs market due on Tuesday from the Office for National Statistics Claire Warnes, skills and productivity partner at KPMG UK, said employers were reining in hiring and pushing ahead with redundancies in response to \u201csustained economic slowdown\u201d. She said: \u201cBusinesses want to plan for the year ahead, but the prospect of faltering UK economic growth means the certainty they need isn\u2019t there. This is now impacting starting salaries, as pay inflation isn\u2019t as sharp as in previous months. With the Bank of England looking like it will be keeping interest rates high for now, businesses will need to stay resilient to manage this period of flux.\u201d The survey from the REC and KPMG showed that employer confidence receded amid the current economic climate. This, in turn, led to hiring freezes and reductions in vacancies, with the sharpest declines in London. Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, said that 2023 had been a \u201ctesting year\u201d for recruiters, but that there was anecdotal evidence that employers might be holding back until the new year to resume their hiring plans. However, he said wage growth could strengthen next year if employers found it harder to recruit following the government\u2019s announcement of tougher migration rules this week. \u201cFor policymakers any return to growth will put strain on a labour market with embedded shortages \u2013 this week\u2019s pro-election rather than pro-economy decision on immigration will exacerbate that.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-21T12:36:46Z",
            "content": "Thousands of protesters have poured on to the streets of Buenos Aires after Argentina\u2019s new president announced a far-reaching emergency decree containing dozens of controversial economic measures \u2013 a move one prominent critic compared to the actions of an absolute monarchy. Javier Milei, a radical libertarian economist who was inaugurated less than a fortnight ago, won power promising a dramatic shake-up of Argentina\u2019s moribund economy amid rampant inflation and widespread poverty. On Wednesday night Milei appeared on television, flanked by 12 stony-faced ministers and top officials, to unveil a decree he claimed would haul the South American country out of \u201cthe economic hell we are now living through\u201d. Milei\u2019s decree paved the way for the privatisation of state-owned companies, stripped away workers\u2019 rights including maternity leave, ended limits on exports, and altered housing rental and land ownership laws to allow for foreign investment. Milei also tipped his hat to the rightwing billionaire Elon Musk, who endorsed his campaign, by announcing changes to Argentina\u2019s satellite internet market that would \u201callow the entry of companies such as Starlink\u201d. \u201cToday is a historic day for our country. After decades of failures, impoverishment, decadence and alienation we are today formally starting to take the path of reconstruction,\u201d Milei said as he outlined what is known as his shock-therapy \u201cchainsaw\u201d plan. Milei, who last week devalued Argentina\u2019s currency, the peso, by more than 50% and suspended all public works, said his country \u201crequired an urgent change of direction to avoid disaster\u201d and hyperinflation. \u201cThis change begins today.\u201d The policies delighted supporters of the wild-haired far-right populist, who is often compared to the former presidents of the US and Brazil, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro. \u201cOne of the happiest days of my life,\u201d tweeted ally Ramiro Marra. But they infuriated the opposition and many ordinary citizens, who took to their balconies immediately after the president\u2019s 9pm address to protest by banging pots and pans. Soon the dissent spread to the streets as people began blocking roads in different parts of the capital. By the early hours of Thursday thousands of protesters had congregated in the plaza outside congress, where Milei was sworn in on 10 December. \u201cMilei! You\u2019re garbage! You are the dictatorship!\u201d they chanted. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s a Roman emperor!\u201d fumed one protester, a 55-year-old historian called Carola G\u00f3mez. \u201cNot even the military dictatorship did this \u2026 This is worse than Thatcher!\u201d Myriam Bregman, a prominent leftist and former presidential candidate, called the edict a \u201cbattle plan against working people\u201d and urged an immediate nationwide strike. \u201cThere are so many illegalities here I don\u2019t know where to start,\u201d she tweeted, accusing Milei of using the emergency decree to bypass congress. Juan Grabois, a well-known social leader and politician, claimed Milei had decreed \u201cthe establishment of an absolute monarchy \u2026 bent on using heavy ammunition to attack the country\u2019s middle and lower classes\u201d. Earlier in the day, several hours before Milei\u2019s pronouncement, thousands of protesters had marched through Argentina\u2019s capital in what was the first major mobilisation against their new government. The demonstration was met with a massive show of force from police, who flooded the streets of Buenos Aires after Milei\u2019s administration vowed to stamp out piquete protests in which dissenters block roads. That initial anti-Milei march was underwhelming, with turnout lower than expected \u2013 something some observers attributed to government threats to cut benefit payments to anyone caught obstructing traffic. But the president\u2019s televised announcement triggered a more significant and spontaneous explosion of anger as protesters flocked to the Plaza del Congreso from across the city carrying kitchen utensils, whistles and Argentinian flags. G\u00f3mez brought a small pot and a spatula to the rally to thwack out her disgust. What would she do if the police caught her, given the new restrictions on protest? \u201cI will say I am making a cake,\u201d she said, laughing, before immediately turning serious. \u201cWe even have to justify why we carry pans \u2026 this is an undeclared state of siege,\u201d G\u00f3mez complained. Gabriel Solano, a 49-year-old leader from the leftwing party Partido Obrero, vowed to resist Milei\u2019s attempt to push through his economic policies without consulting congress and claimed Argentinians from the working and middle classes were already waking up to their mistake in electing the radical economist. \u201cI think people\u2019s mood has changed,\u201d Solano said. \u201cA lot of people are realising the situation is not what they thought it was going to be, that the austerity measures are enormous.\u201d Milei sought to diminish the late-night protest, telling local radio that participants seemed to \u201csuffer from Stockholm syndrome\u201d. \u201cThey are ... smitten with the [economic] model that impoverishes them - but they are not the majority of Argentines,\u201d the president claimed, announcing that more drastic action lay ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s more on its way. You\u2019ll find out soon,\u201d he said."

            "title": "Signals are flashing red for Rishi Sunak\u2019s economic growth pledge",
            "date": "2023-12-13T10:51:07Z",
            "content": "The UK economy is sinking. The question is for how long and whether the downward surprise in October is repeated in the coming months. Some analysts responded with a shrug to a 0.3% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) that followed September\u2019s 0.2% rise, saying it was a one-off decline before an expected rebound in November. Never mind the broad-based nature of the survey findings, with all three major sectors \u2013 manufacturing, services and construction \u2013 shrinking. They see the economy as holding up well. This is the argument of those who say that companies large and small have proved to be resilient in the face of high interest rates, political uncertainty and a deteriorating global situation. There will be bumps along the road but a recession is unlikely. Tuesday\u2019s labour market figures supported this view. While wages growth slowed and vacancies declined \u2013 revealing a weaker demand for workers \u2013 the overall picture was one of businesses feeling optimistic enough to hold back on making staff redundant. There is also much in the detail from the Office for National Statistics\u2019 GDP report to support the resilience argument. A lack of film and TV production, due in part to the US writers\u2019 and actors\u2019 strikes, played a significant role in dragging down the services sector. The strike is over and production is expected to increase over the coming months. Other sectors may improve in the festive period to offset a lacklustre performance in harder-hit industries. For instance, manufacturing has been in recession for more than a year but a recent message from the sector\u2019s trade body said companies were preparing for better times in 2024. This alone, though, cannot make up for a lack of demand from China, which is suffering a weighty slowdown, or a lack of direction in industrial strategy from the UK government. Rishi Sunak, who made economic growth one of his five pledges for 2023, must be worried that the signals are flashing red, not for a long period of stagnation in a pre-election year, which is bad enough, but a recession. Neither the Bank of England nor the National Institute of Economic and Social Research have forecast a recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. Yet the backwards step in October may be telling us that one is on the way. With the government willing to continue fighting the doctors\u2019 and train drivers\u2019 unions over pay, the fourth quarter could show a decline and set up the new year for a further period of contraction. The construction industry faces a disastrous 2024 if the cost of borrowing remains high, and the professions that depend on the property market are likewise going to be hard hit. The October GDP figures show legal services contracted amid a sharp slowdown in the sale of commercial and residential properties. No doubt the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee will view the monthly GDP drop as a foretaste of recession with some scepticism and will vote on Thursday to keep interest rates at 5.25%. Eradicating inflation is likely to be worth a shallow recession in the view of most MPC members. It means a shallow recession is what we might get."

            "date": "2023-12-04T00:01:28Z",
            "content": "For years the British government from the prime minister down has lacked a coherent economic strategy, according to a thinktank\u2019s health check of UK prospects. \u201cWe are not on course towards setting any such strategy \u2013 indeed, we are not serious about the task,\u201d says the report, titled \u201cEnding Stagnation \u2013 a new economic strategy for Britain\u201d. Funded by the independent Nuffield Foundation and pieced together from original research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank and the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, the report is forgiving of politicians who have faced a succession of global shocks, from Covid to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the authors document a series of failures that have left the UK as a laggard among G7 economies and ill-prepared for the task of providing a decent standard of living for most people in the years ahead. The economy Rather than creating an economy where the number of high-skilled jobs is on the rise, the report says workers will be \u00a3470 worse off by the end of the decade. This loss comes after 15 years of flatlined wages, costing the average worker \u00a310,700 a year in lost pay growth compared with the pre-financial crash trend. A loss of international trade is one reason cited for the lack of growth, which the report partly blames on Brexit. By 2023, UK trade as a share of annual national income was down 2.2 percentage points on pre-pandemic levels. This compares with a rise of 0.5 points across the rest of the G7. A loss of market share across EU and non-EU markets, including the US, Canada and Japan, is to blame, said the report. With a loss of trade comes a decline in high-skilled jobs, it adds. \u201cUK manufacturing will change rather than grow, as high-productivity sectors like chemicals and electronics shrink even as lower-productivity food manufacturing expands,\u201d says the report. \u201cWages in London, Wales and the north-east will be hardest hit by the resulting decline in productivity, which, across the country as a whole, means workers will be \u00a3470 worse off by the end of the decade.\u201d Cities Only a handful of cities have successfully made the transition to a services economy. All England\u2019s biggest cities bar London have productivity levels below the national average. \u201cA strategy to turn this around is what an industrial strategy in a service-dominated economy looks like,\u201d says the report. \u201cThis is not a strategy for the few; the UK may be a \u2018green and pleasant land\u2019, but 69% of the UK population live in cities or their hinterlands, compared with 56% in France and just 40% in Italy.\u201d Easing the pressure from sky-high interest rates could come from raising the Bank of England\u2019s inflation target to 3%. This would mean interest rates could begin to fall next year, easing pressure on mortgage holders and the Treasury, which has about a third of its loans with the central bank. A wealth tax would also ease the pressure on the government\u2019s finances and allow ministers to reward work rather than the hoarding of assets. Council tax should be reformed and the burden increased on higher-value homes, allowing stamp duty on property sales to be permanently cut on low- to mid-priced homes. Poverty The share of the public citing poverty and inequality as one of the most important issues facing the country has risen sharply, from 7% in 2010 to 19% immediately before the Covid pandemic. The report says a toxic combination of low growth and failure to shift the highest levels of inequality among any large European country has contributed to the lack of progress on living standards for lower-income households. Cuts to benefits under the post-2010 austerity drive of Conservative-led governments have also fuelled poverty. The report says benefit levels have failed to keep pace with prices in 10 of the past 15 years. Along with wider cuts since 2010, this has reduced the incomes of poorest fifth by just under \u00a33,000 a year. If the policy measures recommended by the report were adopted, relative poverty would be cut by 1.3 million people rather than increase by 1.1 million, as currently projected. Intergenerational Young adults have seen generational pay progress grind to a halt, according to the report, highlighting how those born in the early 1980s were almost half as likely as their parents\u2019 generation to own their own home by the age of 30. After 15 years of average wages after inflation remaining almost stagnant, it says almost 9 million younger Britons have never worked in an economy that has sustained rising average wages. Meanwhile, almost a third of young people in the UK are not receiving any education by the age of 18, compared with just one in five in France and Germany. As a result, the report says, improvements in household disposable income from generation to generation \u2013 something that was taken for granted throughout the second half of the 20th century \u2013 have slowed or ground to a halt. The average income for those born in the early 1980s is almost \u00a31,400 lower at 30 than those born 10 years earlier."

            "date": "2023-12-06T18:12:10Z",
            "content": "Ta-ta, Tui? Europe\u2019s largest tour operator, Tui, is contemplating delisting from the London stock market and flying solo in Germany instead. Is this another hammer-blow to the UK market \u2013 on top of BHP Billiton (gone to Australia), Arm Holdings (opted to list in the US), Ferguson (an escaper to the US) and all the rest? Well, it\u2019s obviously not terrific news for London that a FTSE 250 firm with a dual listing could choose to simplify trading in its shares elsewhere. But let\u2019s have a sense of perspective on this one. Outbound tourism from the UK may be Tui\u2019s most important market, but the firm itself has felt increasingly German, corporately speaking, for a while. The unescapable fact is that Tui has been headquartered in Germany since the grand merger of Tui Travel (which grew out of the old UK firm First Choice) and its German parent Tui AG almost a decade ago. When the Covid pandemic clobbered the travel market, it was the German state that propped up the company with emergency loans and state aid. It is thus no surprise to hear that three-quarters of the company\u2019s shares are now held or registered in Germany and that the weight of trading in the stock has shifted there. It is on that basis that Tui says \u201ccertain shareholders\u201d have asked it to study whether a dual-listing model is still \u201coptimal and advantageous\u201d. If the conclusion is suboptimal and disadvantageous, nobody should be surprised. Two listings means extra expense and hassle. You wouldn\u2019t create today\u2019s setup if starting from scratch. What\u2019s more, said Tui, a Germany-only listing might make it easier to meet European Union rules on airline ownership \u2013 but, since it is already able to do so, that\u2019s a secondary issue. The primary consideration is liquidity and existing ownership profile. A 75% majority of votes is needed to delist in London, so if UK patriots exist in sufficient numbers, they can organise themselves to resist if they wish. Their task would presumably be made marginally easier by virtue of the fact that the 11% holding of Russian tycoon Alexei Mordashov remains frozen under sanctions laws. None of which is to deny that the London stock market lacks fizz, freshness and the deep pools of liquidity of the US. Stamp duty of 0.5% on share purchases, versus zero in the US, doesn\u2019t help. Nor does the dire performance of so many recent arrivals. Nor do the efforts of the London Stock Exchange Group to rebrand itself as LSEG and talk in an American accent about data and AI, rather than share trading, which these days is just 3% of its revenues. But there\u2019s still no need to force-fit Tui into the gloomy script. In recent years, Shell, Unilever (after unnecessary huffing) and the data publisher Relx all unified in London. That\u2019s three top-10 FTSE 100 firms, so London is still capable of winning the dual-listing tussles that matter. Miner BHP, another biggie, chose a primary listing in Sydney, but it was always obviously an Australian company. Similarly, the exit of Tui would not be a disaster. The real problem is the dearth of interesting UK startups and UK money willing to back them. That puzzle, sadly, is harder to solve than the technical listing question at a package holiday operator."

            "content": "The department store chain Macy\u2019s is reportedly the target of a $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) offer that would result in one of the best-known names in US retail disappearing from the stock market. Two existing investors, Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital, banded together to offer $21 a share, the Wall Street Journal first reported. Macy\u2019s department stores are among the most high-profile in the US because of its sponsorship of a parade on Thanksgiving Day that has run since 1924, with giant floats and balloons featuring popular cartoon characters. The Macy\u2019s top outlet in New York\u2019s Herald Square is one of the world\u2019s biggest department stores. The company also owns Bloomingdale\u2019s, a more expensive department store brand, and the beauty chain Bluemercury. Despite its cultural prominence and its broad geographical reach, with 700 stores when counting those from other brands, Macy\u2019s has struggled to adapt to online retail. The chain in 2020 announced the closure of 125 stores, along with cutting 2,000 jobs at its headquarters in Cincinnati and offices in San Francisco. However, the company is still profitable, making $1.2bn in its last financial year. Some workers went on strike last month during the Black Friday sales period, arguing that Macy\u2019s was profiting while they were not paid a livable wage. The offer from Arkhouse and Brigade represented a 32% premium when it was reportedly made on 1 December. Macy\u2019s shares have risen in value significantly over the course of the last month, from a low below $11 a share in mid-November to $17.39 when stock markets closed on Friday evening. The share price rose 16% to just above $20.22 on Monday after Wall Street opened. However, even a $21-a-share bid would be lower than the $24 level in February, or the peak approaching $35 in 2021 as the global economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. The Wall Street Journal hs reported that the investor consortium believes that public markets have undervalued Macy\u2019s and may be willing to increase the offer further. An investment bank has reportedly offered a letter confirming the bidders have the funds to complete the buyout. The bidders could be interested in Macy\u2019s large property portfolio, which could be sold for a profit. Macy\u2019s was approached for comment."

            "date": "2023-12-26T12:37:39Z",
            "content": "In the old days, there were the FAANGs, the five big US tech stocks that dominated the investment landscape \u2013 Facebook (now Meta), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (now Alphabet). That picture is now out of date. Say hello instead to what is variously called the Super Seven or the Magnificent Seven \u2013 four of the above (the dropout being Netflix) plus Microsoft, Tesla and the chip-maker Nvidia. This group\u2019s domination is the stock market story of 2023. The chart below is \u201cone for the ages\u201d, says Duncan Lamont, the head of strategic research at the fund manager Schroders. It shows how, even if you invest via one of the broadest and most widely used \u201cglobal\u201d stock market indices, you will end up with a portfolio that is very American and very skewed towards US tech. The index is the MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI), which covers approximately 85% of \u201cthe global investable equity opportunity\u201d, as the compilers put it, by measuring almost 3,000 large and mid-sized companies in 23 developed markets and 24 emerging ones. The bigger a company becomes in value, the greater its weighting in the index. The seven are now so big that they account for 17.2% of the whole thing, while the combined representatives of Japan, the UK, China, France and Canada contribute 17.3%. Seven US companies equals five countries. \u201cThis is far from diversified exposure,\u201d says Lamont. Apple alone, with a market value of $3tn, is bigger than the entire UK stock market. The numbers have become so astonishing, in part, because of what is shown in the second chart. Up to last week, the group of seven has risen in value by 74% in 2023. The rest of the world\u2019s equities, within the same ACWI index, have managed 12%. If your portfolio did not include the Magnificent Seven in 2023, it was hard to keep up. Is this degree of concentration healthy? It\u2019s certainly unprecedented. Thanks to the whoosh from the seven during 2023, US stocks now account for 63% of the supposedly global ACWI. Even in the go-go days of the Japanese economic miracle, the country accounted for only 44% of the same index. \u201cThe US has far exceeded the level of concentration of Japan in the 1980s, which everyone thought was extreme at the time,\u201d says Lamont. Yet it would be hard to argue that the rise of the seven has been fuelled by the type of wild speculation that created the turn-of-the-century dotcom bubble. The 240% rise in Nvidia\u2019s stock price this year may or may not be overdone, but it\u2019s undeniable that the company\u2019s order book for computer chips is booming as the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution arrives. It would also be wrong to think of the seven as entirely alike. All have leading positions in growing markets and Amazon, Google and Microsoft have big cloud services divisions. But Amazon\u2019s retail division has little in common with Google\u2019s search business and Microsoft\u2019s core software business is different again. All may benefit from AI, which helps to explain the stock market\u2019s renewed love affair with technology in 2023 after a heavy \u201cdown\u201d year in 2022, but the degrees will differ. Tesla remains, primarily, a maker of electric vehicles. Instead, it\u2019s probably more sensible just to think through the implications of such extreme market concentration. In a broadly exposed investment portfolio a lot of risk \u2013 in both directions \u2013 is driven by just seven stocks. Lamont makes a couple of points. First, the statistically correct observation that the US stock market is now priced at nose-bleed levels, historically speaking, isn\u2019t telling the full story. Rather, it\u2019s reflecting the influence of the seven. \u201cUS exceptionalism is not all stocks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a small number crushing everything in the path.\u201d The average US stock is not expensive by traditional investment yardsticks. Second, there is scope for disappointment when stocks are priced for perfection. The Schroders research found that periods of high concentration in markets have tended to be followed by periods of poorer performance by the bigger stocks. \u201cThis time may be different, and we are in uncharted territory to an extent,\u201d concedes Lamont. You could say it suits Schroders, as an active management house, to suggest the pendulum is about to swing away from passive index-followers. But the basic point feels intuitively correct: the current concentration is extraordinary, out of whack with historical norms and the relative lack of diversification is possibly underappreciated by investors. Timing is always a mug\u2019s game \u2013 but a reversal looks the way to bet."

            "content": "Europe\u2019s biggest package holiday operator, Tui, is considering moving its stock exchange listing from the FTSE 250 to Frankfurt, in a further blow to London\u2019s status as a global finance centre. The travel company said it had been approached recently by shareholders asking whether the current listing was \u201coptimal and advantageous\u201d. It suggested the shift to Germany could lower costs and yield \u201cpotential benefits to European Union airline ownership and control requirements\u201d. It is the latest in a series of setbacks for the London Stock Exchange in recent years, with companies opting to either delist or choose to debut in other markets, most notably in New York. The building materials group CRH, one of the biggest companies on the FTSE 100, announced in March that it was moving its primary listing to the US, following the UK-based plumbing equipment supplier Ferguson, which did the same last year. Also in March, the Cambridge-based chip designer Arm, one of the UK\u2019s few bona fide global tech success stories, snubbed London in favour of floating on the Nasdaq in New York, in one of the biggest initial public offering in recent years. Tui said its decision to look at relocating its listing to Frankfurt follows \u201cnotable liquidity migration from UK to Germany\u201d since the merger of the British and German Tui businesses in 2014, and \u201cmore significantly\u201d in the past four years. As a result, shareholders are questioning whether Tui might be better served by simplifying its stock market listing structure by leaving London and becoming part of Frankfurt\u2019s Mdax, the index directly below Germany\u2019s flagship Dax. The board said it would put the proposal to shareholders to vote at its annual general meeting in February, with delisting in London possible only if 75% of the votes cast are in favour of the move. \u201cThe executive board\u2019s focus is to provide an attractive, long-term listing for TUI AG which aligns with its ownership and current liquidity and delivers benefits to all shareholders,\u201d the company said. \u201cPotential advantages of simplification of the listing structures and an inclusion in the MDAX are the centralisation of liquidity, providing a clearer investment profile under a single listing, potential benefits to European Union airline ownership and control requirements, potentially enhancing TUI AG\u2019s equity profile with an expected prominent position in the MDAX50 and creating efficiencies as well as reducing costs.\u201d The LSE has also faced a series of technical issues in recent months. On Tuesday, it had two outages that hit trading in hundreds of small-cap stocks that affected listed companies including the online retailer Asos, the drinks maker Fever-Tree and polling company YouGov. The exchange suffered a similar issue in mid-October which halted trading in the shares of small companies for more than an hour and forced it to close early. Tui also reported a bounceback in annual performance on Wednesday in its first full year unaffected by travel restrictions since pre-pandemic 2019. The company reported underlying profits of \u20ac977m (\u00a3836m) for the year to 30 September, more than double 2022\u2019s \u20ac409m. Full-year revenues also surged from \u20ac16.5bn to \u20ac20.6bn year-on-year. The company said it expected to see a strong year ahead with solid winter and summer bookings likely, prompting the company to forecast that revenues would grow by 10% year-on-year and underlying profits to rise by a quarter. \u201cOur guidance for 2024 is provided within the framework of the current macroeconomic as well as geopolitical uncertainties especially in the Middle East,\u201d the company said. \u201cIt is based on the current positive booking momentum across both seasons.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-22T14:00:03Z",
            "content": "Christmas is supposed to be the season of good cheer, but this year the rising cost of festive treats across Europe is taking the shine off celebrations. Whether it\u2019s food and drink or presents such as books, higher prices are making life tougher for European households. Here we examine the effect that inflation has had on various countries across the continent and on the items that make up a traditional Christmas in each one. Christmas dinner The festive feast has a different feel across Europe. While in the UK, Ireland, France and Germany poultry such as turkey, goose or duck is usually at the centre of the table, fish is popular in eastern Europe and pork takes pride of place in many Nordic countries. All these proteins have been affected by inflation in the past year, however, as the cost of grain, which features in most animal feeds, was pushed up by war in Ukraine alongside fuel for transport, energy for processing and higher labour costs. Problems with bird flu have added to the costs for poultry producers across Europe, while farmed salmon production has been affected by pests and diseases and wild fish stocks have been overstretched by higher demand and the climate crisis. The price of poultry in the UK is up by 5% on last year \u2013 and up 30% compared with 2020 \u2013 contributing to a more costly dinner for many families this year. It is a similar story in Ireland and France, although inflation there is lower than the UK, it remains significant, with poultry costing around a quarter more than three years ago. In Germany, the price has decreased slightly on last year, but it is 43% more expensive than it was in the run-up to the 2020 festive season. In Norway, where the most popular Christmas dinner is pork ribs or belly (although mutton or lamb are also a firm favourite), families will be paying 10% more for the pleasure this year and 34% more than in 2020. The Norwegians\u2019 neighbours in Denmark have not experienced the same price jump, with the cost of pork only rising by 12% since 2020. In parts of eastern Europe, carp is an extremely popular Christmas centrepiece (fun fact: many people keep their Christmas carp alive in the bath to keep it fresh before it is cooked). This year, that tradition will cost significantly more than it once did: the price of fish Hungary and Poland has risen by more than 60% compared with the same period in 2020 as a feed prices have combined with the loss of Ukrainian labour and the cut off of former export markets as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In the Czech Republic, fish prices have risen, albeit not as sharply, but are 16% more than three years ago. It is not much better news for vegetarians across Europe. Unseasonable or extreme weather across Europe, worsened by the climate crisis, has led to sodden fields in the UK and drought in southern countries such as Spain, both of which have hit production. As a result, the cost of vegetables is up by about 30% on average in the EU and in the UK since 2020, in Spain prices are up 13% since last year, linked to the extreme weather southern Europe has experienced. Chocolate It\u2019s another tough year for anyone with a sweet tooth, who will have to count out their chocolate pennies very carefully this year. On average, prices for the confectionery are up 22% in the EU since 2020. Cocoa prices have reached their highest level on the commodities markets since the 1970s after a series of poor harvests in Ghana and Cote D\u2019Ivoire, two important growing countries. This year, fears of flooding in Cote D\u2019Ivoire have added to longer term problems around land availability, disease and access to fertiliser. Chocolate prices have also been driven up by rising costs of sugar, also resulting from poor weather, as well as higher packaging and transport costs related to the oil price. Prices in Hungary have soared \u2013 by 56% since 2020 \u2013 a reflection of wider food price inflation in the country from a mix of economic woes that have affected exchange rates and local problems such as long-term energy contracts with Russia. In Sweden, the prices have increased by more than 18% since last year, maybe forcing the residents in the Scandinavian country to scale back on their julgodis this Christmas. There is little chance of a fall in retail prices for anyone in Europe any time soon as cocoa farmers face increasingly tough conditions as a result of the climate crisis. Books Giving the gift of reading has also got more expensive. The average price of a paperback is expected to reach \u00a312 in the UK next year \u2013 having broken through \u00a310 last year \u2013 as the country has one of the fastest pace of inflation on books in Europe. The rising cost of paper and transport, as well as higher printing costs in China have all added to inflation \u2013 meaning booksellers are expecting a shift away from more expensive hardbacks for presents this year. Prices have been kept high in many countries by tighter manufacturing capability post pandemic and higher demand, kicked off by the revival of reading as a hobby during the pandemic and the rise of BookTok, in which young people are sharing recommendations via the TikTok social media platform. There are also countries \u2013 Ireland and Denmark \u2013 in which the price of a book has fallen since 2020 as consumers reined in spending in reaction to high prices across the economy. Booze Whether it\u2019s snaps in Sweden, gl\u00fchwein in Germany or gin in Great Britain, alcohol has a big role to play in making Christmas merry for many across Europe. The rising cost of making glass for bottles has joined with difficulties in growing the crops required to make alcohol \u2013 from grain to grapes \u2013 to push up prices. Hungarians may be holding off the toasts with p\u00e1linka fruit brandy as they are suffering the worst inflation on alcohol with prices up 37% since 2020. Poland is not too far behind on 28%. Italy and Sweden have recorded a smaller impact with prices up about 10%, while the UK is in the middle of the pack with 16% price increases on 2020, despite fears about a hike in wine prices post-Brexit. Travel If you\u2019re driving home for Christmas (cue Chris Rea) you will experience yet another steep rise in your fuel costs this year. Travel costs have been on the rise and it seems unlikely there will be any let-up this Christmas. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine led to fuel prices skyrocketing in many countries, making a drive home a far more expensive choice than past Christmas with a second surge after the attacks in Israel and Gaza. Recent problems in the Red Sea restricting oil tanker traffic may keep prices high. Hungary, which has suffered from its heavier reliance on Russian oil, has experienced the biggest increase in fuel prices since 2020. In the UK, fuel price rises have been lower, partly because the government has frozen planned increases in tax, which make up a large part of prices at the pump, as well as scrutiny by the competition watchdog."

            "title": "Rail fare increase of 4.9% in England expected to exceed inflation ",
            "date": "2023-12-22T13:56:46Z",
            "content": "Rail fares in England will rise by 4.9% in March after the government capped the planned increase, although the cost of tickets is still expected to rise faster than inflation. The government on Friday said it had decided to cap the fare increase for regulated fares, rather than choosing to increase the numbers in line with July\u2019s retail prices index (RPI), as it has done in previous years. In August, the government said it would not use the RPI reading of 9%, which would have locked in steep fare increases even as inflation slows in the rest of the economy. It also delayed the fare increase to 3 March. But Labour called the increase in fares a \u201cbrutal bumper rise\u201d. It is the second consecutive year that the government has chosen to ignore the RPI figure, which hit 12.3% at the equivalent point in 2022, because of disruption from the coronavirus pandemic and low interest rates. Nevertheless, the March 2023 will represent a real-terms price increase if Bank of England forecasts of further declines in inflation prove correct. The most widely followed price measure, the consumer price index (CPI), showed inflation dropped to 3.9% in November. The above-inflation increase for rail commuters comes after two years during which cost of living pressures have become a potent political issue. It also contrasts with a freeze on fuel duty paid on petrol for cars that has lasted more than a decade. The government has argued that price rises are necessary to make up for reduced passenger numbers after the pandemic. Mark Harper, the transport secretary, said: \u201cHaving met our target of halving inflation across the economy, this is a significant intervention by the government to cap the increase in rail fares below last year\u2019s rise. \u201cChanged working patterns after the pandemic means that our railways are still losing money and require significant subsidies, so this rise strikes a balance to keep our railways running, while not overburdening passengers.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: \u201cThe Tories have just announced another brutal bumper rise in rail fares. With passengers facing record delays and cancellations and delays, this is an insult to millions.\u201d Scottish rail fares, which are set separately, will rise by 8.7% in April. The Scottish government argued that previous fare freezes were not sustainable. Welsh and Northern Irish fares are also set separately. The RPI measure is widely seen by economists as a deeply flawed measure, and it generally sets a higher reading of price increases because of problems in how it measures housing costs. However, the government has continued to use RPI in working out how much people pay, such as in rail fares and student loans calculations, while using the lower CPI when calculating how much people will receive, such as in pensions and benefits. That can benefit the government finances at the expense of individuals\u2019 incomes."

            "date": "2023-12-04T08:19:19Z",
            "content": "The BBC will receive a below-inflation increase to the licence fee, the culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, has in effect confirmed after Rishi Sunak said he welcomed cuts made by the corporation to its spending and services. The \u00a3159 annual fee has been frozen for two years, and if it were to increase in line with inflation it would go up by about \u00a315. During an interview round on Monday, Frazer said this was unlikely to happen. \u201cWe as a government have been really concerned about the cost of living for people across the country, and have taken a number of steps across the board to make sure that those costs are down,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cIt [the licence fee] is due to rise but we want to make sure that it rises by an appropriate amount that people can afford.\u201d Asked about the idea of a with-inflation rise, taking the annual total to \u00a3173, Frazer said: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that\u2019s a very high level and it\u2019s a decision that I\u2019m looking at at the moment. We will be making an announcement on this very shortly.\u201d Asked if she was, in effect, confirming a lower increase, Frazer said only: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about that level of rise.\u201d A below-inflation increase would require further cuts to staffing and programmes, such as last week\u2019s decision to halve the staffing levels on Newsnight, the BBC\u2019s flagship weekday current affairs programme, which involves getting rid of all its in-house reporting and moving the show to a discussion-only format. Asked by reporters about such cuts on his way to the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, Sunak said: \u201cFirst thing to say is, I think it is welcome that the BBC are looking at making savings and efficiencies in how they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that when things are difficult, everyone is doing what they can to ease the cost of living on families. That\u2019s certainly what I have done over the last year and made a bunch of decisions that haven\u2019t been easy. But that\u2019s helped to bring inflation down to ease the burden and the cost of living.\u201d Frazer, when asked in a subsequent interview on BBC One\u2019s Breakfast programme if she was considering whether a \u00a315 rise would be too great, responded: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She said the corporation must look to a post-licence fee future, one expected to be set out in the ongoing review of its charter. \u201cI want to make sure that the BBC remains sustainable and continues to provide the amazing service,\u201d she said. \u201cIn broader terms overall my department is looking at how we fund the BBC going forward. It is unsustainable because 400,000 people did not renew their licence fee over the course of the last year. The media landscape is changing. \u201cWe\u2019re not consuming the BBC like we used to consume it, so I\u2019m also looking at a broader review of how do we make the licence overall fairer to licence fee payers, and how do we maintain the amazing service that the BBC provides.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cThe government and BBC agreed a six-year licence fee settlement in January 2022, which froze the licence fee for two years with increases in line with inflation from 2024. \u201cAs is usual practice the government sets and confirms the cost of a licence each year and this remains unconfirmed for 2024/25. The BBC will continue to focus on what it does best: working to deliver world-class content and providing great value for all audiences.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-20T12:09:38Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s inflation rate fell to 3.9% in November \u2013 a larger drop than economists had anticipated. What does the inflation rate mean? The monthly inflation rates reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) capture the change in the cost of living in the UK. There are several different rates recorded by economists: CPI (the consumer prices index); the retail prices index (RPI); and CPIH (CPI including owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs). It is CPI that was recorded at 3.9% last month. CPIH was 4.2%, while RPI was at 5.3%. The indices measure changes in the cost of a huge number of goods and services \u2013 from shampoo to secondhand cars, and insurance and air travel. The rates are different because of the various goods and services included in the price tables, and also because of the way the figures are calculated. It is the annual CPI rate that influences Bank of England interest rate decisions. Does it mean items are cheaper? Broadly, no. Most of the items counted by the ONS are still pricier than a year ago, and some increases are still in double digits. These include basics such as breakfast cereal (up by 11.5%), yoghurt (up by 17.4%), and sugar (up by 40.4%). Olive oil, which you may or may not consider a basic, is up by an eye-watering 53.9%. Away from the supermarket shelves, children\u2019s footwear is up by 12.2% and car insurance by 46.4%. Some things do cost less, thankfully. Energy bills fell by 15.4% for electricity and 31% for gas, petrol and diesel have dropped in price, and \u2013 possibly driven by Black Friday offers \u2013 some appliances cost less this year than last. Washing machines, for example, are 5.6% cheaper. What does it mean for mortgages? The Bank of England is tasked with getting inflation to 2% and last week, when it announced it would hold the base rate at 5.25%, it suggested that more increases could be needed to achieve this. The fall today makes further rises look less likely. In fact, the money markets are now predicting a base rate cut as early as March. Some rate cuts are already priced into mortgages, but if inflation is falling faster than anticipated, there could be further reductions in the cost of borrowing. Some experts had suggested rates on five-year fixed-rate mortgages could dip below 4% in the new year. The latest inflation figure makes that more likely. What does it mean for savers? There is good news and bad. The good news is that many accounts on the market, including some easy access accounts, are now offering rates that beat inflation, so that money in savings is not losing value. The bad news is that expectations of interest rate cuts have been filtering into the fixed-rate savings market as much as into mortgages, and the best deals have already been pulled. As with mortgage deals, UK savers could see more cuts in interest rates as a result of this fall in inflation. How about pensioners? The government\u2019s decision to stick with the triple lock on pensions means that payouts will increase next April by 8.5%, a figure likely to be much higher than the rate of inflation at that time. It is worth noting that the headline rate does mask bigger increases in some goods \u2013 including some basics, as outlined above. Unless these fall in price, pensioners may not have as much room to spare as the headlines suggest."

            "date": "2023-12-14T05:00:07Z",
            "content": "Financial markets are betting the Bank of England will be forced to launch a deep round of interest rate cuts in 2024 amid the growing risk of a recession. Threadneedle Street is widely expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged on Thursday after warning that interest rates would need to remain high for a prolonged period to tackle stubbornly high inflation. However, City investors warned that the Bank\u2019s strategy was increasingly at risk of being abandoned next year amid a rapidly worsening outlook for the economy. Official figures showed UK gross domestic product shrank in October. Money markets moved to price in four quarter-point cuts to interest rates starting from the summer, anticipating the base rate would be slashed from 5.25% to as low as 4.25% by the end of 2024. The first cut is expected as early as May, to 5%, with further reductions pencilled in for the second half of the year. Rob Morgan, the chief investment analyst at the wealth manager Charles Stanley Direct, said: \u201cThe Bank will be conscious of mounting evidence the economy is under significant pressure, which means a holding pattern for interest rates for now but growing calls for cuts as inflation subsides and economy activity bumps along the bottom.\u201d With households and businesses under pressure from higher borrowing costs, the Office for National Statistics said GDP fell by a surprise 0.3% in October and that there had been contractions across all main sectors. City economists had forecast zero growth. Figures from the jobs market this week also showed pay growth was falling sharply and mortgage distress increasing, in further signs that higher interest rates are having an impact on the labour and housing markets in the UK. Meanwhile, there is growing expectations across advanced economies that a weaker economic backdrop will force the world\u2019s most powerful central banks to row back on their toughest cycle of interest rate hikes in decades. Inflation in the UK has come down rapidly in recent months, dropping to 4.6% in October, although still remains well above the Bank\u2019s 2% target. Policymakers have also warned that strength in the service sector and a resilient jobs market could embed persistently inflationary pressures. So far the Bank\u2019s most senior officials have pushed back against expectations in financial markets for a cut in interest rates. Andrew Bailey, its governor, said last month it was \u201cfar too early to be thinking about rate cuts\u201d and \u201cmuch too early to declare victory\u201d on inflation. However, analysts said there were growing signs of stress in the economy as households and businesses came under sustained pressure from higher borrowing costs after 14 consecutive interest rate increases since December 2021. Mike Riddell, a fund manager at Allianz Global Investors, said: \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about how much higher rates will go; we\u2019re almost certainly at the peak. It\u2019s now about how fast and how soon rates will go back down again. \u201cAs ever, the BoE will be keen to keep all options open, but markets are increasingly disbelieving that the BoE will consider hiking again.\u201d Meanwhile, a general election is expected next year, after Rishi Sunak made growing the economy one of his central priorities. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, said on Wednesday it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that economic growth would be subdued while interest rates were doing the job of bringing down inflation. \u201cBut the big reductions in business taxation announced in the autumn statement mean the economy is now well placed to start growing again,\u201d he added. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said the government was ending the year having failed to meet Sunak\u2019s promise to drive up growth. \u201cEconomic growth is going backwards, leaving working people worse off\u201d she said. \u201cAfter 13 years the Conservatives have failed on the economy and after the chaos of the past few weeks Rishi Sunak is clearly too weak to deliver for Britain.\u201d"

Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender said the price of an average UK property would fall by between 2% and 4% but it expected a part-recovery in the market as interest and mortgage rates eased next year. \u201cOverall, with the combination of cost of living pressures and interest rate levels that are still much higher than even two years ago, we will likely see continued mild downward pressure on house prices,\u201d said Kim Kinnaird, the director of Halifax Mortgages. A separate forecast by Nationwide was slightly more upbeat about prospects for 2024.

Business output growth edged up to a six-month high in December, led by a faster recovery in the service economy while factories continued to cut back production, according to the latest flash estimate from the S&amp;P Global / CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey. This means the UK probably avoided recession, at least for now, economists said, despite a 0.3% contraction in GDP in October, according to official figures. The eurozone is headed for recession, as the downturn in business activity deepened, according to a sister survey. Thames Water\u2019s parent company has been hit by a second downgrade to its credit rating in six months, with Moody\u2019s warning of \u201cmaterially\u201d increased risks that regulators will block the flow of dividends. An independent review has found no evidence that NatWest Group\u2019s private bank Coutts has been closing customer accounts due to their political views, but found it may have breached rules by failing to give due notice or explain why they were being shut. The energy watchdog has set out plans that would result in households paying an extra \u00a316 on top of their energy bills to help suppliers recover almost \u00a33bn in bad debts from customers struggling to pay bills. Almost 200 homes in London have been sold for \u00a310m in the past year as the super-rich\u2019s pandemic-inspired desire for a place in the country wanes compared to their wish for swish bolt-holes in the capital. Pearson\u2019s biggest shareholder has said it should be relisted in the US, arguing that leaving London would be better for shareholders as most of the education publisher\u2019s business and rivals are based in North America. Thank you for reading folks. We\u2019ll be back next week. \u2013 JK Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence said: The early PMI data indicate that the US economy picked up a little momentum in December, closing off the year with the fastest growth recorded since July. Looser financial conditions have helped boost demand, business activity and employment in the service sector, and have also helped lift future output expectations higher. However, the increased cost of living and cautious approach to spending by households and businesses means the overall rate of service sector growth remains far short of that witnessed during the travel and leisure revival back in the spring and summer. Manufacturing meanwhile remains a drag on the economy, with an increased rate of order book decline prompting factories to reduce production, cut back on headcounts and scale back their input buying. \u201cDespite the December upturn, the survey therefore signals only weak GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Business activity growth ticked up in December, rising at the fastest pace for five months. This was supported by the sharpest increase in new orders since July. However, rates of expansion remained historically subdued. Growth was driven by the service sector, while manufacturers suffered a further downturn in new orders and a renewed drop in production. Meanwhile, cost pressures gained momentum as input prices rose at the fastest pace since September. Although firms continued to pass higher costs on to customers, and at a strong rate, the overall pace of prices charged inflation softened from November. Flash US PMI Composite Output Index at 51.0 (November: 50.7). 5-month high Flash US Services Business Activity Index at 51.3 (November: 50.8). 5-month high Flash US Manufacturing Output Index(4) at 49.0 (November: 50.5). 4-month low Flash US Manufacturing PMI (3) at 48.2 (November: 49.4). 4-month low Also in the US, manufacturing output rebounded 0.3% in November but Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said this was, in reality, a disappointment, because it included a 7.1% rebound in motor vehicle output, after the UAW union ended its strike at the big three automakers. Excluding motor vehicles, output fell by 0.2% month on month. That 7.1% monthly rebound last month didn\u2019t quite fully reverse the 9.9% decline in October, so there is a bit more upside to come in December. The manufacturing sector has been in a slump for some time now, with output down by 0.8% over the past 12 months. Moreover, that decline would have been even bigger if not for the 2.4% increase in motor vehicle output, as the impact of earlier supply shortages eased. That weakness in the factory sector obviously hasn\u2019t held back the economy much, however, with real GDP growth of 3% over the same 12-month period. That\u2019s because the manufacturing weakness partly reflects a post-pandemic shift back to services spending and away from goods. Moreover, there are some bright spots in manufacturing, particularly the hi-tech sectors, where output increased by 1.7% month on month in November and is up by 14.4% year on year. Aside from manufacturing, utilities output fell by 0.4% month on month and mining output increased by 0.3%. It\u2019s remarkable that crude oil output is surging without any meaningful rise in drilling activity. Overall industrial production increased by 0.2% month on month. A top US Federal Reserve official has sought to dampen expectations of imminent interest rate cuts as \u201cpremature\u201d. John Williams, president of the Fed\u2019s New York branch and a member of the rate-setting federal open market committee, spoke a couple of days after the bank signalled strongly that the debate was shifting towards cutting rates, sparking a rally in US stocks and bonds that also boosted other markets. Williams said in an interview with CNBC: We aren\u2019t really talking about rate cuts right now. We\u2019re very focused on the question in front of us, which as chair [Jerome] Powell said... is, have we gotten monetary policy to sufficiently restrictive stance in order to ensure the inflation comes back down to 2%? That\u2019s the question in front of us. The Dow Jones Industrial average jumped to a record high and the 10-year Treasury bond yield fell below 4.3% after the Fed on Wednesday forecast three rate cuts next year, which traders interpreted as a sign that the central bank is changing its tough stance and will start cutting rates sooner than expected next year. More comments from Bank of England deputy governor Dave Ramsden, who is in charge of markets and banking. He told an event hosted by the accountancy firm Deloitte that Britain\u2019s banks should keep testing their failure procedures and never assume they are \u2018too big to fail\u2019, following the collapse of Credit Suisse and Silicon Valley Bank. After taxpayers had to bail out lenders during the 2007-9 global financial crisis, regulators introduced rules to \u201cresolve\u201d a failing lender without causing market mayhem. However, during the Swiss authorities\u2019 rescue takeover of Credit Suisse by bigger bank UBS public funds were used, raising doubts about the global resolution framework. The banking crisis in March also prompted the Bank of England and Treasury to engineer a takeover of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s UK subsidiary by HSBC. Ramsden said: We have done a lot to overcome the problem of \u2018too big to fail,\u2019 but it\u2019s really important to stress that this isn\u2019t a done-and-done thing. You need to keep testing that conclusion. That banking crisis showed the need to improve regulators\u2019 \u201ctoolkit\u201d for smaller bank failures, and to enhance the readiness to \u201cbail in\u201d banks using their own resources. The Bank will publish an update next summer on how it would close down a big UK bank without disruption to customers. In Scotland, ministers are facing a \u00a31.5bn black hole before next week\u2019s draft budget, as a combination of surging inflation and expensive public sector pay deals put extreme pressure on government spending. The independent Fraser of Allander Institute describes the situation facing the finance minister, Shona Robison, as \u201cone of the most challenging fiscal backdrops in the history of Scottish devolution\u201d in its annual budget report. But the institute, part of the University of Strathclyde, warns that plans to create a new higher band of income tax are \u201cnowhere near enough\u201d to balance the books. With severe cuts anticipated across the public sector to protect frontline areas such as health and social security, Robison, who is also deputy first minister, has already warned there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that staffing for public services will have to be reduced. Here\u2019s our full story on the NatWest review: An independent review has found no evidence that NatWest Group\u2019s private bank Coutts has been closing customer accounts due to their political views, but found it may have breached rules by failing to give due notice or explain why they were being shut. A report compiled by external lawyers, hired by NatWest after a dispute with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, said their team \u201cfound no evidence of discrimination in any of the exit cases, including no evidence of a customer\u2019s account being escalated for exit, or ultimately being exited, due to their political views or party-political affiliations, or any other protected characteristic\u201d. However, it said Coutts may have breached City regulations by failing to give 60 days\u2019 notice before closing accounts, and by failing to tell clients why they were being ousted. The law firm Travers Smith also urged the lender to create more formal rules and procedures for cases where accounts are closed for reasons other than financial crime. That includes commercial decisions, where maintaining an account is actually loss-making for the lender. The report is the last expected from the Travers Smith review. The review was launched in July after Farage started a campaign against Coutts \u2013 which caters to the very wealthy \u2013 for threatening to close his accounts without explanation. The scandal snowballed after Farage obtained internal documents showing that Coutts was concerned about his alleged \u201cxenophobic, chauvinistic and racist views\u201d. The report released on Friday said lawyers did identify two cases where NatWest closed the accounts of customers who it believed were unaligned with its \u201cpurpose\u201d \u2013 which includes promoting diversity and addressing the climate crisis. However, Travers Smith said there were other factors at play in those cases, including the fact that they were too costly to manage, or posed a reputational risk for the bank, and both were ultimately escalated to the bank\u2019s reputational risk committee. Thames Water\u2019s parent company has been hit by a second downgrade to its credit rating in six months, with Moody\u2019s warning of \u201cmaterially\u201d increased risks that regulators will block the flow of dividends. The watchdog Ofwat is considering whether to investigate Thames for a potential breach of its licence when it paid a \u00a337.5m dividend in October, as revealed by the Guardian last week. The cash was paid from the core operating company that serves 16 million customers across London and the Thames Valley to a holding company. The market price of a \u00a3400m bond issued by Thames Water (Kemble) Finance, one of the key financing entities that sits above the regulated water company, hit an all-time low of less than 50p in the pound after Moody\u2019s unpublicised downgrade on Wednesday. The dividend was part-used to service its debt obligations. The move comes in a week in which Thames appointed a new chief executive but its chair revealed he was speaking \u201ctwo or three times a week\u201d to shareholders to \u201cjolly them along\u201d before their crunch decision next year on whether to inject more equity to prop up a group with overall debts of \u00a316bn. The regulator introduced a new licence condition in May that places stricter restrictions on dividend payments if a company is failing customers or the environment, or if its financial resilience could be harmed. Thames is among the worst-performing major water companies and also one of the most indebted, with borrowings of almost 80% of the value of its assets versus a regulatory norm of 60%. Ofwat\u2019s demand for information from Thames on the dividend prompted the Moody\u2019s review, even though the Kemble company\u2019s rating was cut from B1 to B2 as recently as July. The new rating is B3, a lower level of junk. The agency wrote: \u201cBecause of the further tightened regulatory scrutiny of Thames Water\u2019s distributions, Moody\u2019s believes that the uncertainty around the operating company\u2019s ability to make necessary distributions has increased materially.\u201d Back to the UK PMI, which showed an improvement at UK service sector firms, while manufacturing remained in decline. The headline index, measuring activity across all businesses, improved to 51.7 this month from 50.7 in November. Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club forecasting group, said: December\u2019s balance was still well down on the long-run average of 53.6. There was a divergence in prospects at a sectoral level \u2013 while services activity continued to recover, manufacturing output fell more significantly than in November. The detail of the survey was equally patchy, with a modest improvement in orders in the services sector, but employment falling in both sectors. The scope for subsequent revisions is probably greater than normal this month. With the Christmas holidays fast approaching, S&amp;P Global/CIPS published the flash PMIs for December a week earlier than in most other months, with the survey period running for just six working days from December 6-13. In contrast, November\u2019s flash survey was open for nine working days. The strength of these results adds to the likelihood that this week\u2019s downside surprise for GDP in October will prove to be a blip in what is a very noisy series. Still, with more strikes likely to weigh on activity in December, it\u2019s hard to see GDP being much better than flat in Q4 as a whole. With fiscal policy settings tight and the lagged impact of monetary tightening continuing to emerge, the early part of 2024 will be equally challenging. But with the effects of inflation continuing to fade, and the Bank of England expected to start cutting interest rates before the middle of next year, the EY Item Club expects UK economic prospects to improve in the latter part of 2024. Pearson\u2019s biggest shareholder has said that it should re-list in the US, arguing that leaving London would be better for shareholders as most of the education publisher\u2019s business and rivals are based in North America. The founder of Cevian Capital, Europe\u2019s largest activist investor, said that joining the increasing number of London-listed companies moving out of the FTSE would be an \u201ceasy and effortless way\u201d to increase the value of Pearson which has seen its market value flatline this year. \u201cPearson is a US company with the majority of sales and executives there,\u201d said Christer Gardell, managing partner of the Stockholm-based investor, in an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cIt is only due to historical reasons it is still listed in the UK.\u201d Pearson makes almost two-thirds of its \u00a33.8bn annual revenues in North America. Cevian, which successfully helped pressure building materials group CRH, one of the biggest companies on the FTSE 100, to move its primary listing to the US, after the UK-based plumbing equipment supplier Ferguson did the same last year. Last week, Europe\u2019s biggest package holiday operator, Tui, said it was considering moving its stock exchange listing from the FTSE 250 to solely Frankfurt. Earlier this month, betting firm Flutter, formerly known as Paddy Power Betfair, said it is pursuing a secondary listing in the US, but will keep its premium listing in London. Sales at H&amp;M have fallen, reflecting a slowdown in consumer spending and the impact of store closures in Russia. Sales dropped 4% year-on-year between September and November, which was worse than expected. This piles pressure on the Swedish clothing retailer to ramp up discounts to clear stock, as it tackles the biggest buildup in unsold garments for more than seven years. Excluding Russia and Belarus, sales declined by 1%. Last year, sales were boosted by a temporary reopening in Russia before H&amp;M shut its shops there. In late September, it said sales were down 10% that month and blamed the steep decline on an unusually warm start to autumn in Europe, even though its arch rival Inditex, the owner of Zara, did much better. The Swedish company, which also owns the Weekday and Monki brands, and the more upmarket chains &amp; Other Stories and Arket, is the world\u2019s second largest fashion retailer with more than 4,000 stores, behind Spain\u2019s Inditex, which owns Bershka, Massimo Dutti and Pull&amp;Bear. Inditex has fared better. On Wednesday, it reported a 15% rise for the nine months through October, and a 14% rise for the following six weeks. Another tweet from economist Chris Williamson: Dave Ramsden, deputy governor for markets and banking at the Bank of England, has been talking about the banking system in a speech to the Deloitte Academy. The UK banking system is well capitalised and has high levels of liquidity. Those are key elements in maintaining financial stability. But the overall risk environment remains challenging. That doesn\u2019t mean I think a failure is imminent; the next real resolution weekend doesn\u2019t start here. But as and when we are faced with another resolution we must be humble and recognise it is impossible to predict how it will unfold in real time. No matter how much preparation is done, a resolution is always going to be complex to carry out and is almost certainly going to be messy to execute. In 2023 we have seen the successful application of key elements of the resolution toolkit including stabilisation and write-down powers, without using public funds. But given our experience this year we must continue to invest in our toolkit and in places enhance it to ensure we have the optionality we need so that the regime remains credible. In that way we can ensure that progress on overcoming too big to fail continues for the largest banks. While ensuring that smaller banks don\u2019t become a new source of systemic risk. This year has been a reminder that we may need to use our powers at any time. In future we may not even have an actual weekend to deliver the resolution. To safeguard feasibility we and the firms we supervise need to maintain a high degree of operational readiness and continue to ensure resolvability as a foundation of financial stability. He was referring to the banking collapses in the US such as Silicon Valley Bank, and the near-failure of Credit Suisse, which had to be rescued by its bigger Swiss rival USB. Here\u2019s our full story on Halifax\u2019s house price predictions: UK house will fall by up to 4% next year as high interest rates continue to affect mortgage affordability and sales completions, according to Halifax. Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender said the price of an average UK property will fall by between 2% and 4% but it expects a part recovery in the market as interest and mortgage rates ease next year. \u201cOverall, with the combination of cost of living pressures and interest rate levels that are still much higher than even two years ago, we will likely see continued mild downward pressure on house prices,\u201d said Kim Kinnaird, the director of Halifax Mortgages. An independent review has found \u201cno evidence\u201d that NatWest Group has been closing customer accounts due to their political views, but the lender has been urged to put in place more formal rules when it decides to end relationships for non-financial reasons, including when they do not align with its \u201cpurpose.\u201d The review, by the law firm Travers Smith, also said the bank may have breached rules by not explaining why those customer accounts were being closed. The law firm found previously that NatWest\u2019s decision to close Nigel Farage\u2019s accounts at its private bank Coutts earlier this year was lawful, but there were \u201cserious failings\u201d in its treatment of the former Ukip leader. Lawyers hired by NatWest determined that Coutts had a \u201ccontractual right\u201d to shut Farage\u2019s accounts, and had done so because the bank was losing money by keeping him as a client. While Coutts also considered that there was a reputational risk of keeping Farage as a customer, it had not discriminated against him, despite raising concerns that his views on issues including migration, race, gender or Brexit did not align with its own, the law firm said. Business growth in December was fuelled by a pick-up in the service sector. Firms talked of tentative signs of a revival in customer demand, especially for technology and financial services. However, cost of living pressures on household budgets remain, as well as subdued conditions in the construction sector. Manufacturing production declined for the tenth month running, and at a faster pace than in November. Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds Bank, said: Another rise in output in December is in line with the more optimistic outlook as we approach 2024. Recent industry data has shown an uptick in business confidence, including our latest Business Barometer, which showed services sector confidence at a two-year high, and that optimism among manufacturing firms is the highest it\u2019s been for five months. While these positive signs are good news for businesses when it comes to future activity, we\u2019re continuing to see business caution around the current economic climate given the delicate balancing act the Bank of England will have to consider with its interest rate decision-making next year. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Markit Intelligence, tweeted: The UK has fared better. Business output growth edged up to a six-month high in December, led by a faster recovery in the service economy while factories continued to cut back production, according to the latest flash estimate from the S&amp;P Global / CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) survey. It said: UK private sector output expanded for the second month running in December, which continued a modest recovery from the downturn seen during the three months to October. Higher levels of business activity were supported by a renewed improvement in order books, alongside efforts to work through post-pandemic backlogs. The main index rose to 51.7 in December, from 50.7 in November, the highest since June and pointing to a faster expansion. Flash UK PMI Composite Output Index at 51.7 (Nov: 50.7). 6-month high Flash UK Services PMI Business Activity Index at 52.7 (Nov: 50.9). 6-month high Flash UK Manufacturing Output Index at 45.9 (Nov: 49.2). 2-month low Flash UK Manufacturing PMI at 46.4 (Nov: 47.2). 2-month low Independent economist Julian Jessop tweeted: Ricardo Amaro, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said: Today\u2019s flash PMI results poured a bit of cold water into the mix of recent survey results, which had so far been pointing to a turning point in high-frequency data. Indeed, the eurozone headline index partly reversed last month\u2019s gain to stand at 47 in December, signalling another solid contraction in activity. Overall, the aggregate PMI results for Q4 are pointing to a contraction in GDP. However, we note that the Q4 average level is broadly unchanged from Q3, when the PMIs proved to be overly pessimistic. Thus, while acknowledging the downside risk, we stick to our forecast that the eurozone economy remained stagnated in Q4. But big picture, today\u2019s results pointed to weak momentum heading into 2024, confirming that the recovery we expect to develop through the year will start from a low base. The \u2018flash\u2019 PMI survey suggests the eurozone is heading for recession, economists say. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Markit Intelligence, tweeted: Nationwide building society has put out its predictions for next year, saying that a rebound in house prices is unlikely. It said they could show a low single-digit decline or remain broadly flat in 2024. The housing market was weak throughout this year, with the total number of transactions running at 15% below pre-pandemic levels over the past six months. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: Even though house prices are modestly lower and incomes have been rising strongly, at least in cash terms, this hasn\u2019t been enough to offset the impact of higher mortgage rates, which are still more than three times the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic. As a result, housing affordability is still stretched. A borrower earning the average UK income and buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 38% of take home pay \u2013 well above the long run average of 30%. At the same time, deposit requirements remain prohibitively high for many of those wanting to buy \u2013 a 20% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home equates to over 105% of average annual gross income \u2013 down from the all-time high of 116% recorded in 2022, but still close to the pre-financial crisis level of 108%. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: Once again, the figures paint a disheartening picture as the eurozone economy fails to display any distinct signs of recovery. On the contrary, it has contracted for six straight months. The likelihood of the eurozone being in a recession since the third quarter remains notably high. The service sector maintains a relatively more stable position compared to the manufacturing sector, contracting at a much slower rate. This is likely attributed to the concurrent reduction in consumer price inflation, coupled with an above-average surge in wages. These factors contribute to bolstering the purchasing power of private households, a crucial element for the more consumer-driven service sector. However, despite these elements, there are no indications of the service sector breaking free from its unsatisfactory trajectory. Quite the opposite, new business is diminishing at an accelerated pace, as is the backlog of work. Employment has teetered between marginal increases and decreases over the past five months, essentially holding steady. He is forecasting only modest economic growth in the eurozone, of 0.8% for 2024, following 0.5% growth this year. Business activity in the eurozone worsened in December, falling at a steeper rate and closing off a fourth quarter which has seen output fall at its fastest rate for 11 years, barring only the early 2020 pandemic months. The flash PMI reading shows the manufacturing and services sectors recorded further downturns, with both reporting steep falls in inflows of new business. Jobs were cut for a second month running. Input cost inflation cooled but selling price inflation picked up and remained high by historical standards.

Unchanged rate of decline Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said: If you are on the hunt for gifts right now, you will not strike gold in the latest PMI survey for Germany. What you will find instead is an increasing number of companies reporting a reduction in output in both the service and manufacturing sectors. This confirms our view of a second consecutive quarter of negative growth by the year\u2019s close, driven by the manufacturing sector. The less-than-encouraging development could be linked to the constitutional court ruling and the subsequent discord over the 2024 budget. This has injected a significant dose of uncertainty regarding potential new burdens for the economy. Turning to factories, he said: Despite a recent upturn in the manufacturing stocks of purchases index over the previous two months, December brought a setback. This does not necessarily spell doom for the inventory cycle\u2019s potential turnaround next year, but it does hint that the journey to recovery might be bumpier than previously thought. In manufacturing, new orders continue to contract rapidly, marking the 21st consecutive month of decline. However, the index is on an upward trajectory, fuelled in part by a reduced drag from export orders. Notably, after seven months of pessimism, companies have shifted into optimistic territory regarding future output. This aligns with our perspective that the manufacturing sector is poised for a growth recovery next year. The service sector has not fared much better. In the realm of services, the economic landscape is still dominated by the gloomy hues of stagflation. Output has contracted for the third consecutive month, while input prices are on the rise at a pace mirroring that of November. Interestingly, companies have managed to hike their selling prices even more rapidly than in previous periods. This outcome serves as a stark reminder of the lingering risks to the inflation outlook, despite a substantial overall reduction in official consumer price inflation in recent months. Germany\u2019s private sector economy ended 2023 in contraction territory, with declines in manufacturing and services worsening slightly. The December HCOB \u2018flash\u2019 PMI survey compiled by S&amp;P Global said weak underlying demand was signalled by sustained downturns in both inflows of new business and backlogs of work, although there was a softening in the rates of contraction. Inflationary pressures increased at the end of the fourth quarter, with firms reporting the steepest rise in output prices for seven months amid a more marked uptick in average costs. A combination of spare capacity and efforts to reduce overheads saw employment fall for the fourth month running, and at a quicker rate. This was despite a further recovery in business expectations from September\u2019s recent low.

The FTSE 100 index in London has edged 0.14% ahead, or 10 points, to 7,660, while Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.5%, France\u2019s CAC rose 0.2% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB was up 0.4%. The contraction in the French economy intensified in December, when activity fell at the fastest pace for over three years, according to a closely-watched survey. The French economy concluded 2023 with another month-on-month contraction in private sector business activity, the flash reading from the Hamburg Commercial Bank (HCOB) purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI), compiled by S&amp;P Global showed. This extended the period of decline that started at the midway point of the year. The decline in output accelerated for the first time since September and was the steepest since November 2020. New orders fell rapidly amid an increased drag from export markets, driving further cuts to employment. Businesses also expressed less optimism over the year ahead, with growth expectations at their joint-weakest in just over three years. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction; any reading above points to growth.

UK house prices dipped in 2023 for the first time in 10 years as the cost of borrowing soared and fewer people chose to move. By the end of 2023, we anticipate that house prices will have fallen by 2% in London and by 3% across the UK, suggesting a slowing down in the market rather than a notable correction. House price growth over the last decade has been driven by ultra-low interest rates that made mortgages \u2013 and therefore home ownership - more affordable. It is therefore no surprise that the market has cooled as a result of the 14 interest rate rises that the Bank of England implemented between December 2021 and August 2023, moving the base rate from 0.1% to 5.25%. Although the era of super-low interest rates is now behind us, with a degree of pain as some homeowners transition from the lower rates to the current rates, the Bank of England is now unlikely to raise interest rates further. It is even projecting small cuts in 2024 (to 5.1%) and 2025 (to 4.5%), which should allow the property market to recover as mortgage rates also start to fall. Beyond this, the drivers of house price growth are somewhat muted. Despite falling inflation, economic growth has stalled and is not expected to recover quickly over the next two years, and unemployment is slowly creeping up. In addition, a General Election being called at some point before the end of next year, creates added uncertainty, especially for the top end of the market, which is often affected by changes to tax rules. Reflecting the sluggish economic outlook, projections for house prices over the next two years are similarly subdued, although any interest rate cuts or tax incentives could quickly change this. Chestertons is forecasting a small dip of 0.3% in UK house prices next year, while London prices will show growth of 1.8% due to the higher number of cash buyers that are less affected by the higher interest rates. House prices in the UK are predicted to fall by between 2% and 4% next year, according to Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, the country\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. Pressure on household finances from inflation and higher interest rates has made a house purchase less affordable for many people, leading to fewer completions. Halifax expects a partial recovery in market confidence and transaction volumes in 2024, as interest rates ease and affordability improves. Property prices held up better than expected over the last year, falling by just 1.0% on an annual basis, to now sit at \u00a3283,615. This resilience \u2013 which owes more to the shortage of available properties for sale than strength of demand among buyers \u2013 means average house prices end the year just 3% down on August 2022\u2019s peak (\u00a3293,025) but \u00a344,000 above pre-pandemic levels. Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages, explained: To some extent this masks the fluctuations we\u2019ve seen in the housing market throughout 2023. As wider economic headwinds began to bite, house prices fell for six consecutive months between April and September, before rising again later in the year as prospects improved. And it\u2019s a mixed picture across the country too, with some areas still seeing annual growth, such as Northern Ireland at +2.3%, while in regions like the South East of England house prices continued to drop (-5.7%). Higher interest rates, and the resulting squeeze on affordability, gave many potential home buyers pause for thought when considering making a move over the last year. Mortgage approvals were down a quarter across the market, while overall housing transactions were a little under 20% down \u2013 both the lowest in at least a decade. As homeowners were hesitant to move, there was a natural reduction in the stock of available properties. Crucially, with unemployment levels only seeing a marginal increase, and many homeowners protected from the immediate impact of rising interest rates by fixed rate deals, there doesn\u2019t appear to have been a spike in the number of \u2018forced sales\u2019 \u2013 those who feel compelled to sell but would prefer not to, typically triggered by financial pressures. The president of the Cop28 climate summit will continue with his oil company\u2019s record investment in oil and gas production, despite coordinating a global deal to \u201ctransition away\u201d from fossil fuels, reports our environment editor Fiona Harvey in Dubai. Sultan Al Jaber, who is also the chief executive of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 national oil and gas company, Adnoc, told the Guardian the company had to satisfy demand for fossil fuels. \u201cMy approach is very simple: it is that we will continue to act as a responsible, reliable supplier of low-carbon energy, and the world will need the lowest-carbon barrels at the lowest cost,\u201d he said, arguing that Adnoc\u2019s hydrocarbons are lower carbon because they are extracted efficiently and with less leakage than other sources. \u201cAt the end of the day, remember, it is the demand that will decide and dictate what sort of energy source will help meet the growing global energy requirements,\u201d he added. He referred to the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the world will still need a small amount of fossil fuel in 2050, even when reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions, which is required to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. Almost 200 homes in London have been sold for \u00a310m in the past year as the super-rich\u2019s pandemic-inspired desire for a place in the country wanes compared to their wish for swish bolt-holes in the capital. A total of 175 homes were sold for \u00a310m-plus in the 12 months to November 2023, the highest number for eight-years, according to research by the estate agent Knight Frank. In 2014, when high-end sales leapt just before the introduction of higher rates of stamp duty for properties above \u00a31m, 225 \u00a310m-plus home were sold. More than \u00a33.4bn was spent on the properties, referred to as \u201csuper prime\u201d by estate agents. That\u2019s the highest combined figure since 2014 when \u00a34.2bn was spent. The figure for the full calendar year of 2023 is likely to be even higher as a number of extremely pricey sales have recently completed. This week Indian billionaire Adar Poonawalla, known as \u201cthe vaccine prince\u201d due to his family\u2019s vast vaccine factories, agreed to buy a mansion in Mayfair for \u00a3138m. Britain\u2019s energy regulator has launched a consultation on a plan proposing that households pay an extra \u00a316 on top of their energy bills to help protect suppliers from going bust due to rising bad debt. Ofgem said that the extra charge, which would be levied at \u00a31.33 a month on bills paid between April next year and March 2025, is to \u201cprotect the market and consumers\u201d after figures showed energy debt has hit a record \u00a33bn. The level of bad debt, which refers to the amount of money owed by customers that is unlikely to realistically be repaid, has soared due to increases in wholesale energy prices and the wider cost of living crisis putting pressure on household finances. Tim Jarvis, director general for markets at Ofgem, said: We know that cost of living pressure is hitting people hard and this is evident in the increase in energy debt reaching record levels. The record level of debt in the system means we must take action to make sure suppliers can recover their reasonable costs, so the market remains resilient, and suppliers are offering consumers support in managing their debts. Ofgem said this one-off move would be less costly to consumers than if energy suppliers were forced out of business. Any extra costs would not be passed onto customers who use prepayment meters under the regulator\u2019s proposals. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Consumer confidence in the UK edged higher this month, as people became more optimistic about the year ahead. GfK\u2019s consumer confidence index rose two points to -22. All five sub-measures showed modest improvement. The personal finance situation for the coming year ticked up 1 point to -2, while the outlook for the general economic situation also improved by 1 point, to -25. The major purchase index rose one point to -23. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said: Against the backdrop of flattening economic growth, interest rates at a 15-year high and price rises potentially eroding disposable income for years to come, the index shows a modest improvement this month. Although the headline figure of -22 means the nation\u2019s confidence is still firmly in negative territory, optimism for our personal finances for the next 12 months shows a notable recovery from the depressed -29 this time last year. China\u2019s economic recovery looks shaky amid weak demand and a lingering property crisis, putting more pressure on Beijing to come up with supportive policies. While industrial output and retail sales grew in November, both were flattered by comparisons with a year ago when Covid lockdowns held back activity. They weakened compared to more typical periods. Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie, said: Discounting the base effect, it\u2019s obvious that China\u2019s economy slowed further in November, especially in terms of retail sales and property. In Asia, shares have rallied, with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 1.9%. Sharp declines in the dollar and US bond yields underpinned a Federal Reserve-fuelled rally, after the Fed signalled on Wednesday that it is moving closer to cutting rates. However, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England pushed back on rate cut hopes, and the pound hit $1.276 against the US dollar, where it is still trading this morning, its highest level since late August. Even so, Goldman Sachs now expects the first rate cut from the Bank of England in June, rather than August, after the monetary policy committee voted 6-3 to keep borrowing costs at a 15-yer high of 5.25% yesterday. Economists led by Sven Jan Stehn at the US investment bank said negative surprises to the central bank\u2019s inflation forecasts will eventually prompt it to pivot towards rate cuts. We expect the MPC to cut at a 25 basis points per meeting pace until policy rates reach 3% in June 2025. European stock markets are set to open moderately higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explained: After getting off to a strong start yesterday, with both the Dax and Cac 40 trading up at new record highs, European markets lost momentum after firstly the Bank of England, and then the European Central Bank decided to play the Grinch in contrast to the Fed\u2019s Santa and push back on following a similar rate cut outlook, with the Dax finishing the session lower. The contrast between the ECB\u2019s tone and the Fed\u2019s tone could not have been starker, and yet when you look at the numbers the divergence becomes even more bizarre. Here we have a situation with the Fed announcing a dovish pivot with third-quarter GDP growth of 5% and headline CPI of 3.1%, while the ECB has maintained its hawkish stance when its two largest economies are showing a contraction in the third quarter, and its headline inflation rate is lower. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: The European Central Bank and the Bank of England refused to join the Federal Reserve-thrown pivot party. Both Christine Lagarde and Andrew Bailey declined to discuss cutting interest rates judging a policy loosening too early as the inflation threat looms. Bailey pointed at the possibility of another rate hike, as three MPC members favoured hiking rates, while the ECB announced to accelerate EXIT from the PEPP stimulus, and the Norges Bank popped up with a surprise rate hike.

            "date": "2023-12-22T14:37:04Z",
            "content": "Right, with London\u2019s stock market closed until the 27th December, it\u2019s time to wrap up for today. And what a day it has been, with Britain\u2019s economy sliding closer to the long-feared recession after growth fell slightly in the July-September quarter. Should the economy also contract in October-December, the UK will be in a technical recession. Here\u2019s the full story, and our analysis: Here\u2019s our news story on the latest fare rises which will hit passengers in England next March: And here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s stories: We\u2019ll be back after the festive break, next week. Have a lovely Christmas! Good luck if you\u2019re trying to get home. GW Over in New York, the S&amp;P 500 index of US stocks has opened a little higher, as investors welcome the drop in the US PCE inflation measure: The UK is perilously close to meeting the technical definition of a recession after GDP shrank in July-September, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes, adding: Whether or not a recession materialises, the bigger picture is that since growing by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2022 the economy has gone nowhere. In the second and fourth quarters of 2022 it grew by 0.1%; in the third quarter it fell by 0.1%. Growth of 0.3% in the first three months of 2023 has been followed by the weakness in the second and third quarters. The GDP figures are bad news for Rishi Sunak. At the start of 2023, one of the prime minister\u2019s five pledges was that he would have the economy growing by the end of the year. That pledge has not been met, and it will be of little comfort to the prime minister that other European countries are also recession candidates. More here. The dollar has slipped to a near five-month low against a basket of other currencies, after the US PCE inflation measure fell by more than expected today. That indicates traders believe softer inflation will pave the way for cuts in US interest rates next year. The pound is up 0.3% to $1.273. Workers at UK car dealership Lookers have just received some sickening pre-Christmas news. Lookers said today it may cut about 945 jobs, or 14.5% of its total workforce, as part of an ongoing strategic review following a deal to sell itself to Global Auto Holdings, Reuters reports. Lookers, which sells new and used cars and vans, in July agreed to a buyout offer of \u00a3504.2m from Global Auto, the entity related to privately owned Canadian car dealer Alpha Auto Group. The company said in a statement that: \u201c(Global Auto and Lookers) have to date identified areas that require restructuring and which will require a redundancy programme to be undertaken,\u201d Mark Raban will step down as CEO and Oliver Laird as CFO, Looker said. There\u2019s still time for more important economic data before we shut down for Christmas. And over in the US, the Federal Reserve\u2019s favourite inflation measure has just shown that price pressures are easing. The PCE price index measure rose by 2.6% in the year to November, down from 2.9% in October. On a monthly basis, prices fell by 0.1% during November. Core PCE (which excludes food and energy) slowed to an annual rate of 3.2%, down from 3.4% in October. That may cheer the Fed, as it looks for signs that it is winning the battle against inflation. Tina McKenzie, Policy Chair at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), says the 4.9% increase in English rail fares announced today is \u201cunfortunate\u201d \u2013 and that firms will want see the money used to improve the rail services. McKenzie explains; \u201cRail is essential for small businesses and the self-employed, providing transport for employees, suppliers and customers. For small business owners who are already shouldering numerous rising costs, any increase is unfortunate and is not the festive gift they were hoping for as we head towards Christmas. \u201cWhile the annual fare change is lower than using the normal formula linked to the previous summer\u2019s inflation rate, 4.9% is still significantly above the current level of inflation at 3.9% and so passengers and commuters will still feel the pinch. We would urge ministers to bear down on future rises so that staff, contractors and visitors to small businesses can viably continue to choose rail to move around the country. \u201cAfter the cancellation of HS2, and with small firms now set to take the strain of another fare rise in Spring, they will be looking to ministers to show that money raised from the price hikes makes tangible changes that significantly improves their journeys. \u201cWe want to see available and reliable services, as well as a joined-up system that works alongside other transportation, and a restructured and affordable ticketing system.\u201d London\u2019s stock market has closed for Christmas, although we didn\u2019t get much of a Santa Rally today. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed just 2.8% higher tonight at 7697, up 0.04%. Retail stocks dragged on the index, after Nike alarmed traders by revising down its sales forecast last night. JD Sports remained the top faller, down 5.1%. The more UK-focused FTSE 250 index of medium-sized stocks gained 60 points, or 0.3%, even though the UK economy is on the brink of recession. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, says: \u201cSanta might be coming to town, but investors aren\u2019t really feeling the festive spirit. \u201cGloomy UK data and one eye on core inflation numbers due out in the US later are sending stocks lower. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to see a whole host of retailer\u2019s shares tumbling this morning with JD Sports and Frasers group two of the biggest losers. \u201cBoth are also likely to be feeling the whiplash from Nike\u2019s dismal predictions and its plans to shave a whopping $2 billion of costs in a bid to shore up its finances. \u201cSales over the last quarter have looked rather subdued as retailers kept backroom stock levels low and the Chinese consumer turned to domestic competitors as relations between the US and China remained frosty. \u201cNike has an incredibly powerful brand but it has saturated the market, so cutting back on the number of products it makes would seem sensible and could create more hunger for its products from an uber savvy consumer.\u201d The TUC have accused the government of being \u201ctone deaf\u201d to ongoing cost of living crisis, by signing off a 4.9% rise in rail fares in England next year. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said: \u201cToday\u2019s excessive hike sums up everything that is wrong with our rail network. Ministers are tone deaf to the ongoing cost-of-living crisis that remains a real burden on working people right across the economy. UK passengers are already paying the highest fares in Europe in return for late-running, overcrowded and routinely cancelled trains.\u201d Watchdog London TravelWatch is calling for reforms to the UK rail fare system, following the news of a 4.9% price hike in England from March. A spokesman for London TravelWatch said: \u201cThese new rail fares will see already hard-pressed passengers hit with another unwelcome price hike. \u201cReform to rail fares and ticketing could not be more urgent now. \u201cGovernment needs to set out an alternative vision that makes public transport appealing \u2013 this includes affordable fares, rolling out contactless payment options, and improving train service punctuality so passengers are getting real value-for-money.\u201d The 4.9% increase announced today relates to regulated fares, which make up around 45% of rail fares. They include commuter fares such as season tickets and shorter distance peak singles and returns, and also longer-distance off peak singles and returns. Unregulated fares are set by train operators, although their decisions are heavily influenced by the Government due to contracts introduced following the coronavirus pandemic. More transport news: rail customers in England can expect many rail fares to rise by almost 5% next spring. The Department for Transport has announced that regulated rail fares in England will increase by up to 4.9% from March 3 next year. Rail passengers may question whether the service is 4.9% better (especially if they were caught up at the chaos at Euston yesterday). But the government points out that this is a smaller rise than a year earlier, when fares rose by 5.9%. They are calling today\u2019s announcement \u201ca significant intervention\u201d, as the increase is lower than last summer\u2019s inflation rate, which has been used to set rail fares in the past. Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: \u201cHaving met our target of halving inflation across the economy, this is a significant intervention by the Government to cap the increase in rail fares below last year\u2019s rise. \u201cChanged working patterns after the pandemic mean that our railways are still losing money and require significant subsidies, so this rise strikes a balance to keep our railways running, while not overburdening passengers. \u201cWe remain committed to supporting the rail sector reform outdated working practices to help put it on a sustainable financial footing.\u201d Regulated rail fare increases have traditionally been linked July\u2019s reading of the retail prices index inflation measure, which was 9.0%. The UK are also making changes to protect Britain\u2019s small mammals, by relaxing rules around where small wildlife warning signs can be put up. The DfT has also spruced up the small animal warning sign, adding white quills to the hedgehog\u2019s back to make it more noticable. Harper announced the move on a visit to Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital in Buckinghamshire\u2026. The broader picture for the UK economy is significantly bleaker than suggested by the 1.3% month-on-month rise in retail sales in November (see 7.10am post), says Cameron Misson, economist at the CEBR. Misson explains: \u201cNovember\u2019s rise in retail sales were markedly stronger than consensus expectations, which will be welcome news for the sector ahead of the all-important festive period. The contraction in output in Q3 2023 suggests that the economy is on the verge of a technical recession. Cebr previously forecasted a technical recession across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, however, today\u2019s downward revisions suggest that the contractionary period has started one quarter sooner than expected.\u201d At the risk of dampening the Christmas mood further, London Underground workers ae set to stage a series of strikes in the new year in a dispute over pay. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) have voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action over a 5% pay offer. Engineering and maintenance workers will be taking action over January 5/6, with no rest-day working or overtime until January 12. London Underground control centre and power/control members will be taking action over January 7/8, and fleet workers will walk out on January 8. Signallers and service controller members will take action on January 9 and 12 while all fleet, stations and trains grades will walk out on January 10. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said Tube workers who help bring \u201cvast amounts of value\u201d to the London economy were not going to put up with senior managers and commissioners \u201craking it in\u201d, while they were given \u201cmodest below-inflation offers\u201d. Similar planned strikes have been called off in recent months; in October, a walkout was cancelled after negotiations at Acas made progress. But if not, commuters and Londoners could face a tricky start to the new year. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says the -0.1% drop in UK GDP in the third quarter is a warning that we could yet see the widely anticipated UK recession in 2023. Mahony adds: A year ago, markets were looking towards the UK as a likely source of economic weakness, with both the IMF and Bank of England predicting the UK economy to shrink over the course of 2023. For the most part the UK has outperformed expectations, with the Germany instead looking at risk of a recession this year. Nonetheless, the third quarter -0.1% decline now sees the UK treading the same pathway as the German, French and wider eurozone economies. From a monetary policy standpoint, this does feed into the narrative that we will see a more dovish narrative from the ECB and Bank of England, with the current growth and inflation trajectory allowing for a pivot next year. Chinese Tesla rival BYD has said it will build a new vehicle factory in Hungary, in a sign of the carmaker\u2019s increasing focus on the European market, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes. The manufacturer, which is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of electric cars, said it would create thousands of jobs in the city of Szeged, southern Hungary, in a statement on its official WeChat account on Friday morning. BYD, which is backed by US investor Warren Buffett, is one of the companies leading the race to dominate the industry for electric vehicles as countries rapidly move away from fossil fuel cars. It has set its sights on being the biggest seller of electric cars in Europe. The manufacturer already produces a wide array of products in China, ranging from hybrid cars that combine a battery and an internal combustion engine, to buses and lorries powered by its batteries. It is also a key supplier of batteries to other car companies. However, its planned assault on the European car market has caught the attention of local rivals as well as European politicians who fear that jobs could be lost to China. The EU has launched an investigation into Chinese state subsidies for electric vehicles, a move that could eventually allow it to impose restrictions on imports. A factory within the EU could allow BYD to avoid some measures. BYD\u2019s talks with the Hungarian government were first reported by the Financial Times. BYD already has a bus factory in Hungary. Some analysts expect it to overtake Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of pure battery electric vehicles. It already makes more cars than Tesla when including hybrids. Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Rees points out just how poorly the UK economy has done this year: Fears that the UK has fallen into recession have been heightened after official figures were revised to show that the economy shrank slightly in the July to September period. The assessment that gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the third quarter \u2013 down from the previous estimate of no growth \u2013 will be a blow to Rishi Sunak, who has promised to get the economy growing as one of his fives pledges to voters before an expected general election next year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said a poorer than previously assessed performance by small companies, film production, engineering and design and telecommunication and the IT sector accounted for much of the revision. More here. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak has warned that the UK economy is in a \u201cdoom loop\u201d, after GDP shrank by 0.1% in July-September. Nowak says: \u201cThis year ends with another set of dismal growth figures and with the UK teetering on the brink of recession. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. Our economy is stuck in a doom loop and working people are paying the price as unemployment rises and living standards fall. \u201cThe Conservatives got us into this mess. They don\u2019t have a plan for getting us out of it. Economic warning lights are also flashing in Germany this morning. House prices in Europe\u2019s largest economy have fallen at the fastest rate in at least 23 years, plunging by 10.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2023. That\u2019s the fastest decline in residential property prices compared to a previous quarter since the time series began in 2000, following a 6.8% drop in Janary-March, and 9.6% in April-June. Statistics body Destatis has also reported that new orders in Germany\u2019s construction sector slumped by 6.3% in October, month-on-month. This was driven by a 14.9% drop in building construction, which more than countered a 2.4% rise in civil engineering orders. Over in the stock market, shares in UK retailers are sliding in early trading, after gloomy financial results from Nike last night. JD Sports is leading the FTSE 100 risers, down 5%, while Frasers (which owns Sports Direct) is down 1.3% and discount retailer B&amp;M has lost 1%. Last night, sportswear giant Nike cut its annual sales forecast blaming cautious consumer spending, a weaker online business and more promotions, and said it would cut costs by $2bn over the next three years. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u201cNike has cut its full-year sales forecast, sending shares sharply lower, down by nearly 12% after hours, wiping out its gains from the past month. It expects fiscal full-year revenue to increase by around 1%, below its previous guidance and analysts\u2019 estimates for around 3-4%. It reported quarterly net income of $1.6 billion, beating estimates but revenue hit $13.39 billion, just shy of estimates. The sportswear giant is aiming to achieve $2 billion in savings over the next three years and it is launching new styles to try to boost customer demand. Nike said there was a \u2018bifurcation\u2019 in performance with some periods of weakness and others of strength, particularly around key shopping events like Singles Day and Black Friday. Currently, the FTSE 100 share index is up just 2 points, or 0.03% \u2013 so not much sign of the traditional Santa rally\u2026. The UK economy is on both the naughty and nice list following this morning\u2019s data, says Investec economist Ellie Henderson. Henderson says this morning\u2019s national accounts (showing a fall in GDP), and November\u2019s retail sales figures (showing 1.3% month-on-month growth), are \u201ca tale of two halves\u201d, adding: The national accounts release indicated an economy which is progressing slower than was first reported, making a winter recession far more likely, but the retail sales report for November sprinkled a little bit of festive cheer, blasting past consensus. On the GDP side, growth in Q3 has been revised down, now reporting negative quarterly growth, at -0.1%. Although this means a winter recession is far more probable, this really is a matter of semantics: to two decimal places, the original release had in fact already shown GDP to have contracted by -0.03%. The story remains that economic growth has been subdued. Quarterly GDP growth for Q2 was also revised down, now reporting no growth on the quarter (prior: +0.2%). Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at the University of Liverpool, has spotted another worrying point in today\u2019s GDP report: Today\u2019s GDP revision, which indicates the potential start of a recession in the third quarter of 2023, will worry policymakers for an additional reason: the ONS has revised downwards 2023Q3 four-quarter GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points (from 0.6% to 0.3%, that is). Historically (from 1973 onwards, that is), the ONS has revised four-quarter GDP growth upwards by an annual average of 0.7 percentage points! Today\u2019s GDP reading goes against the historical \u201cnorm\u201d which adds extra uncertainty about the future outlook of the UK economy and, in my view, strengthens the voice of those, including myself, who believe that an interest rate cut will be on the cards by March 2024! The fall in UK GDP in July-September will reinforce expectations in the City of London that the Bank of England will cut interest rates several times in 2024. This morning, the money markets are predicting that UK interest rates will be cut by 1.4 percentage points in 2024. That implies that rates could be cut as low as 3.75% by December 2024, down from 5.25% today. Today\u2019s quarterly national accounts shows that GDP per head shrank by 0.3% in July-September, worse than the headline fall of 0.1% in GDP. In April-June, when the economy stagnated, GDP per capita fell by 0.1%. Today\u2019s updated GDP report shows that household spending fell in July-September. There was a fall of 0.5% in real household expenditure in Quarter 3 2023, revised down from a first estimate fall of 0.4%, the ONS says. This was driven by lower spending on miscellaneous goods and services, spending on restaurants and hotels, spending on food and non-alcoholic drink, and spending on furniture and household equipment. Several experts are warning that the UK is at real risk of a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d \u2013 defined as two quarters of falling GDP in a row. Here\u2019s Interactive Investor\u2019s Victoria Scholar: And Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway: However\u2026 definitions of a recession vary, with some analysts arguing that it means more than just a few months of contraction. In the US, the National Bureau of Economic Research gets to decide when the US economy is in recession \u2013 and can make this declaration long after the downturn has actually hit. The Financial Times now takes the same approach \u2013 here\u2019s the FT\u2019s Chris Giles. Today\u2019s GDP downgrades show that Britain has barely avoided a recession so far this year. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, warns that growth is moving in the wrong direction (given we also know GDP shrank in October). Carter says: \u201cONS data this morning reveals UK GDP fell by a surprise 0.1% in Q3 compared to the previous quarter, revised down from a first estimate of no growth, highlighting just how much of a strain there currently is on the UK economy. Q2 was also revised down and is now estimated to have shown no growth compared to the 0.2% increase previously estimated, meaning the UK has barely scraped by without a recession in 2023. \u201cGrowth is weakening and interest rates are really beginning to bite and while a recession has just been avoided to date, there is no guarantee one will be avoided in 2024. You just have to look at October\u2019s -0.3% reading to see that growth is trending further in the wrong direction. Inflation has eased more than anticipated and interest rate predictions are suggesting more easing than originally thought in 2024, but the damage may already have been done. Certainly, Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to grow the economy is now severely in doubt. The 0.1% fall in real GDP in Q3 may mean that the mildest of mild recessions started in Q3, says Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics. Webb adds: But whether or not there is a small recession, the big picture is that we expect real GDP growth to remain subdued throughout 2024. The news that Britain\u2019s GDP shrank in July-September means Rishi Sunak will end the year having failed to deliver on his pledge to grow the economy, Labour says. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says: \u201cRishi Sunak is a Prime Minister whose legacy is one of failure. He failed to beat Liz Truss, he failed to cut waiting lists, he failed to stop the boats and now he has failed to grow the economy. \u201cThirteen years of economic failure under the Conservatives have left working people worse off with higher bills, higher mortgages and higher prices in the shops. \u201cIt\u2019s time for change. The Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, has a long-term plan to grow the economy and make working people better off.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has claimed that the medium-term outlook for the UK economy is \u201cfar more optimistic\u201d than today\u2019s GDP data shows. Hunt adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen inflation fall again this week, and the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) expects the measures in the autumn statement, including the largest business tax cut in modern British history and tax cuts for 29 million working people, will deliver the largest boost to potential growth on record.\u201d ONS Director of Economic Statistics Darren Morgan says that Britain\u2019s TV and film industry had a worse time in July-September than first estimated. Explaining why GDP has been revised down this morning, Morgan says: \u201cThe latest data from both our regular monthly business survey and VAT returns show the economy performed slightly less well in the last two quarters than our initial estimates. The broader picture, though, remains one of an economy that has been little changed over the last year. \u201cThe latest VAT data, which takes a little time to receive and process means we now estimate the economy showed no growth in the second quarter, with weaker performances from smaller businesses, particularly those in both hospitality and IT than first shown. \u201cWe also now estimate the economy contracted slightly in the third quarter, when we previously reported no growth, with later returns from our business survey showing film production, engineering &amp; design and telecommunications all performing a little worse than we initially thought.\u201d We have been covering the struggles in the UK\u2019s film production sector in recent months, which has forced some workers to seek other jobs: The ONS has also reported that retail sales volumes across Great Britain rose by 1.3% in November 2023. That follows no growth in October (revised from a fall of 0.3%). Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: \u201cRetail sales grew strongly in November as heavy Black Friday discounting encouraged shoppers to spend. However, with the three-month trend continuing to fall and overall sales still below pre-pandemic levels, it\u2019s still a challenging time for retailers. \u201cIn the latest month, household goods retailers, clothing shops and department stores all reported robust sales, with computer stores, sports equipment, toy shops and cosmetics stores particularly benefitting from the impact of their Black Friday promotions. \u201cSupermarket sales ticked up a little, but it was specialist food and drink stores that had a really strong November due to customers stocking up early for Christmas and spending more than we have traditionally seen at this time of year.\u201d NEWSFLASH: The UK economy is on the brink of recession, after new data shows GDP shrank slightly in the third quarter of the year. The Office for National Statistics has revised down its estimate for the economy in July-September. It now estimates that UK GDP fell by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2023, down from the previous estimate of no growth. The downgrade is because the UK services sector is now estimated to have fallen by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2023, revised down from a first estimate fall of 0.1%. The ONS says: In output terms, there was a 0.2% fall in the services sector in the latest quarter, which offset a 0.4% increase in construction output and a 0.1% increase in the production sector. In another blow, GDP is now estimated to have shown no growth in Q2, revised down from the previous estimate of +0.2% growth. A technical recession is two quarters of contraction in a row, so if GDP falls in October-December, the UK will be in recession. We already know that the economy shrank in October, by 0.3%, The latest healthcheck on the UK property sector shows that sales and demand across the UK were almost a fifth higher in the final weeks of 2023 than a year earlier as sentiment improved. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: The property website Zoopla said new sales agreed were 17% higher in December than this time last year, when higher mortgage rates hit market activity. Demand is up 19%, measured by would-be buyers contacting agents to inquire about and arrange viewings for a specific property listed on Zoopla. An increase in the number of homes for sale is increasing choice and supporting sales, it said. Zoopla recorded an annual house price fall of 1.1% across the country this month, with a steeper drop in London, of 1.5%, to an average price of \u00a3536,800. In the capital, prices were up 0.3% in the City while Croydon, Bromley and Woking posted the biggest price declines, of 3.5%, 3.4% and 2.8% respectively. More here. In a boost to the UK economy, Britain\u2019s car industry has posted its best November output since 2020. UK car production grew by 14.8% in November with 91,923 cars leaving factory gates, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. Production was lifted by easing supply chain problems, and increased demand from abroad. The SMMT says: Production for both the home and overseas markets increased, up 13.4% and 15.2% respectively. 22,919 cars stayed in the UK though, as always, exports drove volumes. Export growth was driven mainly by the EU, China and Turkey, although Europe received by far the bulk (60.8%) of all shipments, reinforcing the need for tariff-free electrified vehicle trade across the Channel. Overnight, UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt applied a little pressure to the Bank of England to consider cutting interest rates in 2024. Speaking to the Financial Times yesterday, Hunt suggested that the BoE could start to reduce borrowing costs next year, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a reasonable chance that if we stick to the course we\u2019re on, we\u2019re able to bring down inflation, the Bank of England might decide they can start to reduce interest rates. That probably is the moment when people will begin to have more confidence about their own personal prospects and the prospects of their family.\u201d Hunt also hinted at tax cuts next year, telling Bloomberg that falling debt interest costs may give him the necessary headroom. 2024, of course, will almost certainly be an election year (unless Rishi Sunak hangs on until January 2025), so the government may hope that falling interest rates and cuts to the tax burden would revive their approval ratings. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It\u2019s the final day of stock market trading before Christmas, but there\u2019s still time for an important update on the health of the UK economy. At 7am, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) will publish its latest quarterly national accounts for the UK, giving detail into how the economy fared in July-September (Q3 2023). The first estimate of third-quarter GDP was released last month, showing the economy stagnated. Today\u2019s report will probably confirm that, City economists estimate. But it\u2019s not impossible that the headline figure will be revised up, or down \u2013 and a downgrade would mean the economy shrinking, putting Britain on the brink of recession. Dan Hanson, senior UK economist at Bloomberg Economics, warned earlier this week that there is a chance of a downgrade. \u201cThe ONS is likely to confirm that GDP stagnated in the third quarter, but we do think there is some risk output is revised lower. The first estimate showed GDP fell, just not by enough to tip the rounding, and since then the retail sales data has been revised down. The statistics wouldn\u2019t need to find much more weakness for GDP to register a 0.1% fall.\u201d The ONS will also release the latest retail sales figures at 7am, with economists predicting a 1.3% fall, year-on-year, in November, as households cut back amid the cost of living squeeze. Also coming up today Britain\u2019s transport network will be doing its best to get passengers home for Christmas, after yesterday\u2019s turmoil. The strike which suddenly halted Eurostar trains running between London and Paris was ended last night, as unions reached an agreement with management. Eurostar is promising to run six extra trains between Paris and London into the weekend \u2013 an extra two trains each on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Passengers hoping to travel from London Euston could continue to face disruption after services were cancelled on Thursday following damage to overhead electric wires.

            "date": "2023-12-22T10:47:46Z",
            "content": "Fittingly, a forgettable year for the economy ended on a downbeat note, with the last set of official data for 2023 showing the UK uneasily perched on the brink of recession. That should come as little real surprise. Higher interest rates from the Bank of England were meant to hurt \u2013 and they are. Borrowing costs were raised 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023 in successive jumps and there were fears back in the summer that they might go still higher. Consumers responded in predictable fashion. They tightened their belts by spending less and saving more. A breakdown of the growth (gross domestic product, or GDP) figures for the third quarter of 2023 shows consumer spending down by 0.5%, while the savings ratio (the percentage of household disposable income saved) rose from 9.5% to 10.1%. Business investment, which had been showing signs of recovery, also fell \u2013 by 3.2% \u2013 in the third quarter, although this may have had more to do with spending on new plant and machinery being brought forward to beat the April 2023 deadline for the end of the government\u2019s superdeduction tax break. The upshot is that the Office for National Statistics now estimates that the economy contracted by 0.1% in the three months to September rather than showing no growth. It also revised down growth in the second quarter from 0.2% to zero. Given that the fourth quarter started with a 0.3% decline in October, the warning signs are clearly there. A technical recession is where GDP falls for two consecutive quarters \u2013 and the UK is perilously close to meeting that definition. Whether or not a recession materialises, the bigger picture is that since growing by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2022 the economy has gone nowhere. In the second and fourth quarters of 2022 it grew by 0.1%; in the third quarter it fell by 0.1%. Growth of 0.3% in the first three months of 2023 has been followed by the weakness in the second and third quarters. The GDP figures are bad news for Rishi Sunak. At the start of 2023, one of the prime minister\u2019s five pledges was that he would have the economy growing by the end of the year. That pledge has not been met, and it will be of little comfort to the prime minister that other European countries are also recession candidates. There was some tiny crumb of comfort for the government to take from the 1.3% month-on-month retail sales growth in November, which suggests that falling inflation is boosting spending power and making consumers feel more confident. But governments like to see signs of a booming economy when a general election is looming, and the UK is not booming. Far from it."

            "title": "New pressure to cut interest rates as UK economy falters and US inflation dips",
            "date": "2023-12-22T07:38:26Z",
            "content": "Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have come under renewed pressure to cut interest rates early in the new year after official figures showed an increasing likelihood of a recession in the UK and a drop in inflation in the US. Analysts said the US Federal Reserve would struggle to resist calls for lower interest rates in the first half of 2024 after the central bank\u2019s preferred measure of inflation fell to 3.2% in November from 3.4% in the previous month. The Bank of England was also expected to face demands for lower borrowing costs after official figures released on Friday appeared to show a tightening of monetary policy this year had pushed the economy to the brink of a recession. An assessment that gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the third quarter \u2013 down from the previous estimate of no growth \u2013 will be a blow to Rishi Sunak, who has promised to get the economy growing as one of his fives pledges to voters before an expected general election next year. GDP for the second quarter was also revised down to zero growth, from a previous estimate of 0.2% expansion, while the latest assessment of the economy showed it shrank 0.3% in October and inflation fell to 3.9% in November. An economy is considered to be in a technical recession after two consecutive quarters of contraction in GDP, and a further contraction in the fourth quarter would push the UK into that category. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said a poorer than previously assessed performance by small companies, film production, engineering and design and telecommunication and the IT sector accounted for much of the revision. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said he believed the economy was poised to rebound: \u201cThe medium-term outlook for the UK economy is far more optimistic than these numbers suggest. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen inflation fall again this week, and the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] expects the measures in the autumn statement, including the largest business tax cut in modern British history and tax cuts for 29 million working people, will deliver the largest boost to potential growth on record.\u201d His Labour counterpart, Rachel Reeves, dismissed Hunt\u2019s analysis, saying the latest figures were an example of Sunak\u2019s record of failure as prime minister. \u201cHe failed to beat Liz Truss, he failed to cut waiting lists, he failed to stop the boats and now he has failed to grow the economy,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cThirteen years of economic failure under the Conservatives have left working people worse off, with higher bills, higher mortgages and higher prices in the shops.\u201d City analysts were agreed that an already weak performance by the UK economy this year had been found to be worse than previously thought, despite a larger rise in consumer spending than earlier estimates showed. They also expect Bank of England\u2019s 14 interest rate rises over the last two years, taking the cost of borrowing from 0.1% to 5.25%, to have taken a bigger toll on the corporate sector and household spending than previously thought. Separate figures for UK retail sales volumes in November provided a lift, beating City forecasts of a 1.3% fall to register a modest 0.1% increase year on year after a 0.3% increase since October. Black Friday sales proved to be better than City forecasts, and discounting on furniture, carpets and other household items drew shoppers back to the high street. However, the retail analyst Nick Bubb said he remained sceptical that the ONS had a strong grasp of trends in retail spending, which other surveys showed remained weak going into the festive period. The weaker GDP data came the day after Hunt told the Financial Times: \u201cIf we stick to the course we\u2019re on, we\u2019re able to bring down inflation, the Bank of England might decide they can start to reduce interest rates\u201d next year. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said GDP was dealt a big blow after an estimate of business investment in the third quarter was cut to 3.2% from 4.2%. He said the downturn was likely to influence the central bank and force it to cut rates early next year. \u201cThe Bank of England [is likely to] retreat from its hawkish rhetoric, meaning interest rates could be cut earlier and more significantly than many had been anticipating.\u201d With a reduction in interest rates next year expected to boost consumer spending, the economy could rebound in 2024. \u201cSo, a worse-than-expected performance this year should be balanced by a better outlook for 2024 and 2025,\u201d he said."

            "content": "The Guardian has been named news provider of the year for 2023 at the annual British Journalism Awards. The newspaper fended off competition from organisations including the Times, Financial Times and Sky News to win the coveted award at the ceremony in London on Thursday. The judges said: \u201cThis title has shone a light on under-reported parts of the world and campaigned for social justice and environmental change with its investigations this year. And it has even investigated difficult truths from its own past while delivering a mass audience and achieving financial sustainability.\u201d Exclusives from the Guardian have included the revelation that the Conservative peer Michelle Mone secretly received tens of millions of pounds from the profits of PPE Medpro, and the newspaper\u2019s investigation into sexual misconduct at the Confederation of British Industry. In March, the organisation launched Cotton Capital, a journalism series covering the Guardian\u2019s own history in the context of Britain\u2019s broader historical links with enslavement. Overall, the Guardian won five awards. Emily Dugan was the winner in the crime and legal journalism category for her reporting on the case of Andrew Malkinson, which the judges described as \u201cexemplary campaigning work\u201d. Malkinson, 57, was convicted of raping a stranger in 2003 in Greater Manchester, despite there being no DNA evidence. The court of appeal overturned his conviction in July after forensic testing linked another man to the crime. Rachael Healy took home the prize in the arts and entertainment journalism category. Healy reported last year that the Britain\u2019s Got Talent judge David Walliams made derogatory and sexually explicit remarks about contestants during the recording of an episode of the ITV show. Walliams later apologised for the comments. Anna Isaac, the Guardian\u2019s City editor, was the winner in the business, finance and economics journalism category for her investigation into the CBI, which the judges said \u201cwas a real scoop which has had wide-ranging impact\u201d. William Ralston took home the prize for sports journalism for his Guardian Long Read going inside the world of Premier League referees. The Guardian was also highly commended in the social affairs, diversity and inclusion category for Cotton Capital, with judges saying \u201cfew publications would be brave enough to subject themselves to such scrutiny\u201d. The Bruno and Dom project, continuing the work of the murdered journalist Dom Phillips and the environmental activist Bruno Pereira, was highly commended in the campaign of the year category. The judges said: \u201cThis was a mighty reporting effort in a noble cause, to ensure that killing a journalist did not kill the story of criminal environmental destruction they uncovered.\u201d Simon Hattenstone was highly commended in the feature writer of the year category for his \u201cfine writing\u201d, and Rachel Salvidge and Leana Hosea were highly commended in the energy and environment journalism category for their stories on \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in the UK, a Guardian collaboration with Watershed Investigations. Earlier, Dominic Ponsford, the chair of the judges and editor-in-chief of the Press Gazette, told the audience at the London Hilton Bankside: \u201cThese awards, like journalism itself, are not perfect. But they are our very best attempt to honestly and without favour recognise journalism which shows skill and rigour, tells us something we didn\u2019t already know and \u2026 serves the public interest.\u201d Gabriel Pogrund of the Sunday Times, described by the judges as \u201cprolific scoop getter\u201d, won the journalist of the year award and the investigation of the year prize went to Dan Neidle of Tax Policy Associates for his work on Nadhim Zahawi\u2019s tax affairs."

            "title": "How social media\u2019s biggest user protest rocked Reddit",
            "date": "2023-12-30T15:00:35Z",
            "content": "In June, thousands of Reddit communities plunged into darkness \u2013 making their pages inaccessible to the public in a mass protest of corporate policy changes. Users of a social network lambasting it is nothing new; but Reddit\u2019s moderators rebelled on a scale never seen before. Six months later, users and researchers say reforms sparked by the movement are still rippling through the social network, which bills itself as the \u201cfront page of the internet\u201d. The changes are a mixed bag, they say. The quality of the posts on the forum site has changed, some say, but the social network\u2019s corporate parent appears more attentive, making changes long requested by users and moderators alike. The conflict with the company left Reddit\u2019s denizens angry and skeptical, but many say they\u2019re sticking around to see how things go with Reddit\u2019s new normal. When asked for comment on the protest and the demands of participants, a spokesperson from Reddit highlighted a response from the company\u2019s CEO, Steve Huffman, who stated: \u201cWe are all responsible for ensuring Reddit provides an open, accessible place for people to find community and belonging. \u201cWe respect when you and your communities take action to highlight the things you need, including, at times, going private,\u201d he said. The protest began because of Reddit\u2019s mid-year decision to begin charging for access to its API, or application programming interface. The change hampered the ability of outside companies and users to work with data from the social network for their own products and services. It sparked outrage from Reddit\u2019s army of unpaid content moderators, many of whom relied on such tools to keep the site running. In response, more than 8,000 subreddits \u2013 forums within Reddit \u2013 with hundreds of millions of subscribers collectively went offline for days. Some of the site\u2019s largest destinations went dark or turned into absurd, unusable parodies featuring only photos of John Oliver. The scale of the response reflected the passionate user base of Reddit, which sought to defend a site with a strong platform ethos \u2013 a place that has been described as \u201cone of the last good social media sites\u201d, where the sharing and policing of content is democratized. RamsesThePigeon, who has been a user of Reddit for more than 12 years and a moderator for most of that time, said users\u2019 reasons for participating in the protest varied by user and subreddit but largely centered around content moderation. He is a volunteer moderator for several of Reddit\u2019s largest communities who prefers to be quoted by his username due to the anonymous nature of his occupation. For many, the unilateral decision from Reddit was a slap in the face to the volunteers who devote hours of unpaid labor to keep the site running. The protest, he said, made the average user more aware of that. \u201cModerators very often feel like they don\u2019t get nearly enough support, and almost no say whatsoever in the direction that Reddit the company has taken,\u201d he said. \u201cThis particular protest and the events that prompted it were a lot of folks\u2019 first exposure to the tension that exists beneath the surface \u2013 it shook a lot of users\u2019 faith in what they thought was a smoothly running system.\u201d Reddit executives reasoned that the changes were needed to prevent companies, especially artificial intelligence startups creating large language models, from using Reddit\u2019s data for free. With rumors of an imminent IPO swirling, the company is under pressure to make money \u2013 and CEO Huffman has acknowledged as much, stating at the time of the change: \u201cReddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use.\u201d But revoking access hollowed out some browsing services favored by users who say the Reddit app was lacking in navigability. Users with vision impairments and other accessibility needs relied on third-party apps, as well as by moderators using third-party tools to access and take action on posts more easily and systematically. Tim Rathschmidt, a Reddit spokesperson, said the API changes were meant to apply to large-scale commercial entities and that the platform\u2019s API was still open for non-commercial use under certain stipulations, including for research and academia by request. Regarding moderator complaints, Rathschmidt said the platform was \u201cgrateful for all the people who contribute to building community on Reddit, and mods most of all\u201d. He noted that several weeks ago the platform launched a central resource for mods and that Reddit had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d on mobile mod tools and plans to continue to introduce updates and new features. \u201cWe know what mods do is hard work, and we are working closely with them on a regular basis to ensure we are addressing their needs and hearing directly from them to help improve Reddit,\u201d he said. A handful of the top-used Reddit add-ons immediately folded after the changes. Apollo, with more than 1 million monthly users, condemned the company\u2019s actions in a post to Reddit: \u201cIf they wanted something that could work for everyone, they would have simply made an effort to listen, instead of being dishonest, callous, and punitive in pricing.\u201d Rathschmidt said Reddit had signed agreements with third-party browsers Luna, Dystopia and Redreader, and that \u201cconversations continue with others\u201d. After complaints that the folding of some third-party browsing platforms affected usability for vision-impaired users and other users with disabilities, Reddit conducted an accessibility audit with an external consultant. The company had been \u201cworking on improving accessibility on the site and in our apps\u201d, Rathschmidt said, and had created an accessibility feedback group. Reddit was on track to have full compliance with the World Wide Web Consortium\u2019s accessibility guidelines by the end of 2024, he said. Despite these concessions, dozens of Redditors promised to stop using the site altogether without access to their favorite browsing apps. But according to data from the website analytics firm Similarweb, traffic has largely remained consistent to the platform, aside from a pronounced dip during the blackout. Posts on Reddit get worse; research gets blocked The fight over Reddit\u2019s API usage was, on its face, a simple business decision. What followed, however, was a broader debate about online labor and community. Hanging in the balance was the future of a social network with a user base whose members had devoted millions of hours to their online home. While traffic has not changed substantially, many users report the quality of content and the kinds of posts that are surfaced on user homepages now seem different. RamsesThePigeon said the content on some of Reddit\u2019s most-followed pages, which he moderates, had \u201cgone sharply downhill\u201d. Stevie Chancellor, an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the University of Minnesota who has studied Reddit for years, echoed these sentiments. \u201cA lot of people who made Reddit a place where people wanted to be are not there any more, and a lot of high-quality content that I went to Reddit for is gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been a noticeable decline in the quality of content, both in terms of what is posted and what people talk about.\u201d In response to such critiques, Reddit spokesperson Rathschmidt said he did not \u201cknow of an industry benchmark for scoring content quality\u201d. Exactly how those changes are playing out is difficult to parse without access to the API \u2013 the issue at the heart of the protest to begin with, said Chancellor, who previously used Reddit\u2019s API to study the quality and safety of mental health content shared to the site. Reddit is not the only company with API transparency issues. In February, Twitter (now X) also eliminated access to its API while Meta and TikTok have long refused meaningful access. \u201cIt bothers me that social media companies are increasingly restricting our abilities as researchers who care deeply about these sites and who believe they can provide many benefits for people,\u201d Chancellor said. \u201cThe right to public scrutiny being increasingly damaged by corporate interests is a huge problem.\u201d Reddit wins? Reddit\u2019s corporate overlords were ultimately unmoved by the massive blackout, and most of the thousands of dark subreddits went back to normal after a few weeks. While many declared that Reddit won its fight against the moderator uprising \u2013 advertisers stayed, traffic and user numbers remained stable \u2013 the protest did inspire some meaningful changes, said Sarah Gilbert, a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University who studies Reddit and community moderation. \u201cIt\u2019s been a mix in the six months since the protests took place,\u201d she said. \u201cThere have been a lot of really positive developments, and it seems Reddit is working really hard to bridge some of those gaps \u2013 but the gaps were so huge that some moderators have been struggling in the meantime.\u201d Perhaps the most pronounced impact of the protest, and Reddit\u2019s response to it, has been cultural. Users who have long been dedicated to the site, some of whom have spent countless unpaid hours working to make it better, are exhausted and resentful \u2013 and many have simply left. \u201cBy the time you read this my account will have been deleted,\u201d one now-deleted account commented on a subreddit dedicated to the third-party app Apollo. \u201cBye, Reddit.\u201d Those who remain are feeling the impact. \u201cThe quality of my feed is noticeably down,\u201d one wrote. \u201cPeople complaining that \u2018if you don\u2019t like it why aren\u2019t you leaving?\u2019 are missing a vital point \u2013 people are leaving,\u201d one user wrote on a thread discussing changes to the site shortly after the protest. RamsesThePigeon, for his part, said he planned to stay on Reddit for the time being \u2013 even though he maintains that the site\u2019s quality has been on a decline for quite some time before the protests further accelerated it. Like many, he has long championed the ethos of Reddit. \u201cReddit could be the best site on the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be a place to share ideas, expertise, entertainment, information and perspectives from all over the world. A place where everyone could have a voice with the only requirement being that they think before using it. And unfortunately, Reddit has not done anything to encourage that.\u201d"

The move comes after developments in forensic DNA analysis, which led to the successful appeal of Andrew Malkinson, whose 2004 conviction for rape was overturned in July. Wang, who is serving a life sentence, says he is hopeful that new DNA evidence from the murder scene could point towards the people he claims are responsible for the killing. He also hopes that evidence of shoe prints at the scene, which are neither his nor Chappelow\u2019s, can back up his claim that a Chinese gang he had infiltrated with the knowledge of his MI6 handlers was responsible for the killing. It is understood that none of the DNA found at the murder scene is traceable to Wang or anyone on the existing DNA database. If the new evidence indicates that it belongs to someone else of Chinese origin this could back up Wang\u2019s claims. Forensic evidence, which the Guardian has seen, about how many different pairs of shoe prints were found at the crime scene concluded that \u201cthe safe answer is \u2026 there may be five\u201d. A CCRC spokesperson said: \u201cAn application has been received related to this case. It would be inappropriate for us to discuss the application or make any further comment at this stage.\u201d Chappelow, who was 86, was found dead in his crumbling home at Downshire Hill near Hampstead Heath in north London, after police had been alerted by his bank about suspicious transactions. He had been beaten and there was evidence of melted wax on his body. Use of his stolen credit cards was traced to Wang, who lived nearby. He was later arrested in Switzerland. In a recent letter to the Guardian, he claims that he never knew anyone had been murdered until the Swiss police told him. At his trial in 2008, the prosecution suggested that Wang could have been confronted by Chappelow when stealing mail and credit cards from his letterbox and could then have entered the house and killed him. At his trial the judge, in an unprecedented move in an English court, ordered that his evidence be heard behind closed doors in the interest of national security. No reporters were permitted to attend. In his first trial he was convicted of theft and fraud but the jury could not reach a decision on murder. At a second trial he was convicted of murder and jailed for a minimum of 20 years. He is currently in Highpoint prison in Suffolk. Now 61, Wang, a grandson of one of Mao Zedong\u2019s deputies and a graduate in computer technology, fled China via Hong Kong in 1992. He worked initially as a researcher at Imperial College and ran his own computer company, Quantum Electronics Corporation, from 1997 until it folded in 1999. From prison he contacted the Guardian claiming he was innocent. After the Guardian\u2019s re-examination of the case in 2014, new witnesses came forward. A close neighbour of Chappelow\u2019s later gave evidence in the court of appeal that, soon after the murder and with Wang already in custody, he heard a rustling noise at his front door and saw \u201ca glimpse of a knife\u201d. An intruder told him: \u201cDo not call the police or we will kill your wife and baby.\u201d He told officers about the incident but the information was never passed on to Wang\u2019s defence team. As a result, the CCRC referred the case to the court of appeal in 2014. Another witness also emerged who told the appeal court that Chappelow was a regular visitor to the \u201cspanking bench\u201d on Hampstead Heath and on occasions had left the bench with young men. In 2017 Wang\u2019s conviction was upheld by the court of appeal, despite the evidence against him being, in the words of the court \u201centirely circumstantial\u201d. Wang has also written to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which is responsible for examining complaints about the activities of the security and intelligence agencies. The tribunal neither confirms nor denies whether it is considering individual cases unless there have been open hearings. The CCRC faced criticism in the case of Malkinson, who was convicted of raping a stranger in 2003 in Greater Manchester and had always insisted upon his innocence. The court of appeal overturned his conviction in July after forensic testing linked another man to the crime. An inquiry is taking place into the handling of his conviction and appeals."

            "date": "2023-12-05T15:00:43Z",
            "content": "When Greta Thunberg posted a photo of herself holding a \u201cstand with Gaza\u201d sign on Instagram in October, the backlash in Israel and Germany came hard and fast. An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson initially told Politico that \u201cwhoever identifies with Greta in any way in the future, in my view, is a terror supporter,\u201d although later retracted his comments. The official X account of Israel said \u201cHamas doesn\u2019t use sustainable materials for their rockets\u201d and told Thunberg to speak up for its victims. The Israeli education ministry said it would strike any reference to the Swedish climate activist from its curriculum. In Germany, politicians and pundits across the political spectrum demanded that the national branch of Fridays for Future, the student protest movement that Thunberg started in 2018, distance itself from her views. The group put out a statement underlining its support for Israel\u2019s right to exist and, in the weeks that followed, explicitly distanced itself from social media posts made by the international group. Germany\u2019s leading news magazine Der Spiegel ran a lengthy article with personal comments on Thunberg\u2019s childhood character and appearance under the headline: \u201cHas Greta Thunberg betrayed the climate movement?\u201d The violence in Israel and Gaza since 7 October has become an unexpected flashpoint for climate activists in rich countries. As world leaders meet for the Cop28 summit in Dubai, the loose collection of movements, many of which have built their support around inclusivity and global justice, are divided on whether or how to take a stand on the conflict. Positions taken have led to splits within groups and between them. \u201cThe national debates are less about the conflict itself,\u201d said Stefan Aykut, director of the Center for Sustainable Society Research (CSS) at the University of Hamburg. \u201cInstead, they are immediately captured by the dominant cultural prism within each society.\u201d The legacy of the Holocaust carried out by the Nazis is central to Germany\u2019s postwar identity, and in recent years has been used to argue that Israel\u2019s security is fundamentally tied to the German state today. Environmental groups in Germany have expressed solidarity with Israel during the current conflict, as well as sympathy for Palestinian suffering, whereas in the UK and US activists have criticised Israel with stronger language \u2013 describing its bombing of Gaza as a \u201cgenocide\u201d, which Israel rejects \u2013 and pushed their governments to call for a permanent ceasefire. For environmental groups far from the fighting, the pressure to take a position has grown even stronger as racism against Jews and Muslims has soared across the US and Europe. It has also raised the stakes of striking the wrong tone. Part of the backlash generated by Thunberg\u2019s post came from a blue octopus toy visible in the corner of the picture. The toy is an emblem of neurodiversity, popular with people with autism as a way to express feelings, that also resembles a symbol used in racist propaganda to falsely claim Jews control the world. Thunberg, who has a form of autism, said she was unaware of the link, and replaced the photo with one that left out the toy. Thunberg was also criticised for her failure to condemn Hamas or support its victims in the same post in which she spoke out against Israel. Sharona Shnayder, a Nigerian-Israeli climate activist who lost friends in the Hamas terror attack at a music festival near Israel\u2019s border with Gaza, said: \u201cShe didn\u2019t even bother to mention it until people called her out. It hurt on a level that I don\u2019t think you can describe.\u201d Shnayder, who founded a litter picking movement called Tuesdays for Trash, and was herself inspired by Thunberg, said the lack of compassion towards Israeli victims of the war in global discourse has alienated local activists. \u201cI talk about trash a lot. I talk about waste management. In that moment, I really felt: \u2018Wow, maybe I have no value in this world.\u2019\u201d Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October and took more than 200 hostages, according to the Israeli government. Since then, Israel has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza, and starved more than 2 million Gazans of food, water, fuel and medical care. While Fridays for Future did not respond to a request for comment on this article, FFF Sweden including Thunberg wrote a piece in the Guardian on Tuesday clarifying their stance, saying: \u201cContrary to what many have claimed, Fridays for Future has not \u2018been radicalised\u2019 or \u2018become politica\u2019. We have always been political, because we have always been a movement for justice.\u201d The German branch has said it stands in solidarity with the victims of Hamas\u2019 violence and with Jews across the world, while also \u201cseeing\u201d the suffering of Gazans and being \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d by the rising anti-Muslim racism in Germany. \u201cNone of these are contradictions,\u201d it said. \u201cOur hearts are big enough to feel all of this at the same time.\u201d A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cThere is no room for compromise when it comes to the protection of Jewish lives and Israel\u2019s right to exist. We are horrified by the suffering experienced by innocent lives and stand in solidarity with civilians both in Israel and Gaza.\u201d Germany has become an outlier among rich democracies in the breadth of its political and media support for Israel\u2019s response. \u201cGermany is a special case when it comes to those politics,\u201d said Oscar Berglund, a climate activism researcher at the university of Bristol. Faced with a death toll that started high and has risen rapidly, other climate advocacy groups have condemned the killing of civilians on both sides without naming the actors involved. Namrata Chowdhary, head of public engagement at campaign group 350.org, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very deliberate about taking a slower, more cautious approach, and speaking where it seems appropriate for us to do so in solidarity.\u201d The group has called for a ceasefire and respect for international humanitarian law. \u201cWe recognise that there can be no climate justice without peace, and in calling for peace we\u2019re being very clear about peace on both sides.\u201d Greenpeace made similar demands: \u201cTargeting of civilians is a war crime, no matter who does it.\u201d The unfolding horrors \u2013 and how to respond to them as a movement \u2013 have been a focus at Cop28 this past week. While two large environmental justice coalitions, \u2013 the Palestinian Environmental NGOs network (Pengon) and La Via Campesina, an international movement representing millions of peasants, landless workers, farmers, Indigenous people, pastoralists, and migrant farmworkers \u2013 have boycotted the summit, others have used it as an opportunity to put a spotlight on the conflict. On Thursday, the first day of the summit, the UNFCCC, the United Nations body overseeing the conference, cut off a livestream to the event as Asad Rehman, director of the UK-based organisation War on Want and founder of the global campaign to demand climate justice, called for a permanent ceasefire. All protests have to be pre-approved by the UNFCCC and no countries or companies are allowed to be mentioned. \u201cThe Palestinian struggle is woven into every struggle for justice including climate justice,\u201d Rehman said. \u201cWe want a free Palestine.\u201d Tasneem Essop, an anti-apartheid campaigner from South Africa and director of the Climate Action Network, the world\u2019s largest coalition of 1,900 climate action groups, said: \u201cThe unfolding genocide in Gaza may not affect the negotiations directly, but will play into the growing divide and mistrust between the global south and the global north.\u201d Many climate justice groups in the UK have swung behind the Palestinian cause. Friends of the Earth UK became one of the earliest, explicitly stating it stood in solidarity with its Palestinian sister organisation \u201cin its longstanding opposition to the occupation\u201d of Palestinian lands. In a statement on its website, Extinction Rebellion described \u201cthe collective punishment being imposed on innocent civilians in Gaza\u201d as a \u201cwar crime\u201d. The organisation declined to comment for this article, but XR groups have taken autonomous actions. On 11 November, the date of a contentious Palestine solidarity march and counter-protest that coincided with the UK\u2019s Remembrance Day, XR Parents placed hundreds of children\u2019s shoes on the steps of Trafalgar Square in London and read out the names of the 4,100 Palestinian and 26 Israeli children who had already then been killed. Robin Wells, director of Fossil Free London, said her group had mobilised support for three of the big solidarity marches in London, as well as staging their own, smaller protests outside the energy companies BP and Ithaca for their roles in extracting gas from Israeli-controlled fields in the eastern Mediterranean contested by the Palestinians. But even beyond the moral question of what position to take, climate activists have also been divided on the strategic value of championing causes that go beyond fossil fuels. For some, the shift in focus has been an unwelcome distraction. At a recent protest in Amsterdam where Thunberg spoke alongside Afghan and Palestinian women, a man stood up on stage and snatched the microphone from her hands. \u201cI came for a climate protest, not a political point of view,\u201d he said. Some climate advocacy groups have chosen not to comment on the war, with one adding that they had not expressed a position on previous conflicts. Others have argued that climate and social justice are too tightly linked to ignore extreme violence. A spokesperson for Greenpeace said: \u201cWe see a strategic benefit and a moral imperative. Environmental issues are hardly ever \u2018just\u2019 environmental issues. Many of the crises we face are interconnected, whether it\u2019s social inequalities fuelling the climate crisis or climate impacts driving up food prices and propelling social injustices.\u201d Berglund said an issue that some environment movements have faced is their lack of explicit political values or goals. \u201cIt was never tenable in the long run to have a depoliticised climate movement,\u201d he said. Activists are also having to reckon with the risk of striking the wrong tone and losing support from the people and politicians they are trying to reach. At the CSS in Hamburg, Aykut said that even though the climate movement is global, its impact was \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d in the countries with the greatest power over emissions. \u201cIt is not only about rallying minorities, but also about persuading the wider public,\u201d said Aykut. \u201cIntersectionality is obviously crucial for the climate movement but it is not a simple maths problem where you can add more and more different groups until you get a majority. Every time you include a new faction and address their concerns, there is the risk of alienating another part of the movement.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-08T16:57:57Z",
            "content": "Six US senators have introduced a new \u201cFans First Act\u201d to address flaws in the live event ticketing system by increasing transparency in ticket sales, protecting consumers from fake or overpriced tickets, and building accountability measures for bad actors. The bipartisan bill, brought to Congress by three Republicans (John Cornyn of Texas, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Roger Wicker of Mississippi) and three Democrats (Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Peter Welch of Vermont and Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico), is the latest effort by Congress to combat high and exploitative ticket pricing for concerts and other live events. The heated situation with online ticket sellers \u2013 predominantly by Ticketmaster, by far the largest of retailers \u2013 reached a boiling point in 2022, when demand for tickets to see Taylor Swift\u2019s and Bruce Springsteen\u2019s tours, respectively, crashed the site and sent prices soaring. Several Swift fans went on to sue Ticketmaster for \u201cfraud, price-fixing and antitrust violations\u201d, alleging that \u201cintentional deception\u201d allowed scalpers to buy the majority of tickets, to be resold at a mark-up; within hours of the Eras tour sale, tickets were being resold on secondary seller sites for as much as $22,000 (\u00a318,000). \u201cBecause no other venue can hold half as many people as the stadiums and venues working through Ticketmaster, Taylor Swift and other popular musicians have no choice but to work through Ticketmaster,\u201d the suit alleged. The controversy led to congressional hearings with Ticketmaster executives. Though started before the Swift debacle, the US justice department launched an antitrust investigation into Ticketmaster\u2019s parent company, Live Nation, over whether it abused its power in the multibillion-dollar live entertainment industry. According to an announcement signed by the six senators, the Fans First Act seeks to improve pricing transparency by requiring all live event ticket sellers and resellers to disclose the total cost of the ticket, including fees, when the fan initially selects a ticket for purchase; a breakdown of the ticket cost; clear terms and conditions of purchase; which seat or section they are selling in order to avoid ticket misrepresentation; and whether or not they are the original seller. The act would also strengthen the Better Online Ticket Sales (Bots) Act, signed into law in 2016, to further prohibit the use of bots to purchase tickets online, and would impose civil penalties on resellers engaging in illegal ticket sale practices. The bill would create a reporting website for fans to file complaints, to be enforced and monitored by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and state attorneys general. And it seeks to stop bad actors by prohibiting the sale of \u201cspec\u201d tickets which resellers do not yet possess, prevents the use of deceptive websites and bad actors masquerading as legitimate sellers, and requires reporting of Bots Act violations from ticketing companies to the FTC. \u201cThe current ticketing system is riddled with problems and doesn\u2019t serve the needs of fans, teams, artists or venues,\u201d said Cornyn in the announcement. \u201cThis legislation would rebuild trust in the ticketing system by cracking down on bots and others who take advantage of consumers through price gouging and other predatory practices and increase price transparency for ticket purchasers.\u201d Live Nation, the owner of Ticketmaster, applauded the new bill: \u201cWe support the Fans First Act and welcome legislation that brings positive reform to live event ticketing. We believe it\u2019s critical Congress acts to protect fans and artists from predatory resale practices, and have long supported a federal all-in pricing mandate, banning speculative ticketing and deceptive websites, as well as other measures. We look forward to our continued work with policymakers to advocate for even stronger reforms and enforcement.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-17T07:00:20Z",
            "content": "Allies of Nigel Farage believe he will be unable to resist taking a prominent role for Reform UK\u2019s imminent attempts to make the next election a referendum on \u201cmass migration\u201d. The former Brexit party leader did not rule out a return to frontline politics after he completed his appearance on I\u2019m a Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here! earlier this month, though he dismissed the idea of rejoining the Conservatives under Rishi Sunak. However, figures close to him are increasingly confident that he will want to seize the opportunity to shape the next election with Reform UK. It is understood that the party is planning a press conference at the start of January to kick off its campaign to create an \u201cimmigration election\u201d when voters go to the polls next year. It follows Tory infighting over Sunak\u2019s plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer puts Reform UK on 9% support. However, it also reveals that 37% of current Conservative voters would be more favourable towards Reform with Farage as leader. The poll also shows a fifth of Reform voters would vote Conservative if their party was not on the ballot paper. While that suggests it is already holding down Tory support, the polling numbers involved were too small to draw firm conclusions. It seems unlikely that Farage \u2013 who has lost on each of the seven occasions he has stood to be an MP \u2013 will run for a Westminster seat, preferring a role that allows him to roam the country and attract the cameras, rather than be tied to a constituency. However, Farage\u2019s allies believe Sunak\u2019s decision to put his Rwanda plan at the heart of his programme for government has given him the chance to \u201cshape politics\u201d once again with a prominent campaign role. \u201cHe\u2019s going to work out how and in what shape and style he puts his shoulder behind the wheel,\u201d said an ally. \u201cThe idea that he would sit back and watch an election on his home turf \u2013 an immigration election \u2013 come and go is for the birds. He has talked about immigration for 15 to 20 years. Many of his predictions have now come true. He can have another significant influence in the debate and potentially demolish the Tories. \u201cWhether the mainstream parties like it or not, we will turn this into an immigration election. The last one was a Brexit election. This will be an immigration election \u2013 both legal and illegal. Reform will pose a very simple question: who voted for mass immigration?\u201d The party\u2019s latest tactic has been to broaden its attack on immigration away from just the \u201csmall boats\u201d crossing the Channel that Sunak has pledged to eliminate, to a wider criticism on the overall numbers coming to the UK. Net migration to the UK hit a record 745,000 in 2022. Reform\u2019s leader Richard Tice has already made clear there will be no deals with the Tories before the next election as there was in 2019. He has also said he would reject a peerage or any other attempt to induce his party to stand aside. While Reform\u2019s national poll rating remains low, many Tories are already concerned about its possible impact on their party\u2019s performance. Meanwhile, continued Tory wrangling over the Rwanda bill also presents Farage with an opportunity to appeal to voters from the right.While No 10 was delighted that no Conservatives voted against the Rwanda bill, winning a 44-vote majority, there will be attempts to amend the proposals in the new year. Tory MPs also suspect that the left and right of the party have been given contradictory guarantees about the changes the government would accept. Any greater involvement by Farage in the new year would cause further anxiety among many Tories on the right, who believe the Rwanda issue was completely mismanaged by Downing Street. Other senior Tories were baffled that Sunak has spent so much time on a divisive issue within his own party. According to Opinium, reducing illegal immigration to the UK is the fourth highest priority for the public. Some 36% selected it as a priority before the next general election, up from 33% in mid-November. While 49% of voters think the Conservatives under Sunak generally prefer lower immigration, only 16% think they have a plan to achieve it. Just 26% think Labour under Keir Starmer generally prefers higher levels of immigration, with 34% believing he prefers lower levels."

            "date": "2023-12-21T13:11:15Z",
            "content": "Calls for reform of Liberia\u2019s notorious prison system have intensified after more than 200 inmates held a protest at a facility in the northern Nimba county earlier this month over what they described as the government\u2019s failure to provide them with adequate food and medication. Complaints about the west African country\u2019s prisons are longstanding. Prisons are routinely severely overcrowded and inmates suffer from a lack of access to basic medical facilities, sanitary items and uniforms. Last year, a prison in the capital, Monrovia, ran out of food, and two of the country\u2019s other 15 prisons briefly stopped taking inmates due to food shortages. The Rev Sainleseh Kwaidah, Liberia\u2019s national director of prisons, blamed the shortages on a number of factors including overcrowding, inadequate infrastructure and challenges with budget allocation and disbursement. \u201cBudgetary allocations are pushed towards operation and little or nothing is left to enact reform,\u201d Kwaidah said. Only six of the 16 prisons had clinical facilities, he said, meaning that in the other 10 medical staff and services were rotated. The budgetary constraints were reflected in a 2021 report by the General Auditing Commission that showed a consistent decrease in government funding from $1.8m (\u00a31.42m) in 2013 to $311,208 (\u00a3246,000) in 2020. In December 2022, Monrovia central prison, the largest in the country, refused to take in new inmates because of overcrowding. The same year, a US state department human rights report found that the prison was holding 1,426 inmates despite being built to hold just 374. According to the report, there were times when prisoners were required to sleep in shifts due to overcrowding. A large percentage of inmates are pre-trial detainees who have not been sentenced in court. A UN report found that as of November 2022, 73% of the nationwide prison population of 3,256 were pre-trial detainees. To address the constant shortage of food, prisons around the country have had to accept donations of food and sanitary materials from private organisations. The Liberian Bar Association (LBA) is also implementing legal aid clinics for pre-trial detainees who have been incarcerated beyond the statutory period in an attempt to cut their numbers. Jamal C Detho, a professor of law who is the vice-president of the LBA, called for more plea bargaining and the institutionalisation of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism for lesser offences to bring inmate numbers down. \u201cCapacity building is also critical for probation officers and an effective probation system where individuals can perform community service instead of spending time in jail for lesser offences is also needed,\u201d he said. Liberia\u2019s president-elect, Joseph Boakai, will be inaugurated in the new year after he won an extremely tight presidential runoff against the incumbent, George Weah, last month. Weah, a former professional footballer, was propelled to office buoyed by a wave of hope in 2017, but many Liberians have since grown disillusioned with a lack of progress on problems including corruption, poverty and unemployment. Last year, the government promised to build a new prison to help ease overcrowding, but construction has yet to begin. In the meantime some prisons have been renovated and the government has supported projects for inmates to produce their own food at two prisons. \u201cThere is a strategic plan that runs up to 2027 that has a lot of prison reform,\u201d Kwaidah said. \u201cWe need all hands on deck, and hopefully, we will see more implementation of this plan.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-24T11:55:39Z",
            "content": "The leader of Reform UK has given \u201ccast-iron guarantees\u201d to senior members of his rightwing populist party that it will not step aside for the Conservatives at the forthcoming general election. The Tories won a majority in 2019 after Reform\u2019s previous incarnation, the Brexit party, did not field any candidates against them in the 317 seats which the Conservatives won in 2017, in return for Boris Johnson\u2019s commitment to leave the EU by 2020 before pursuing a Canada-style trade deal. However, Richard Tice has assured senior members in writing that there will be no rerun of that deal. Former MEPs from the Brexit party \u2013 including the businessman Ben Habib and Ann Widdecombe \u2013 were among those who returned to Reform this year. The written assurance is understood to have been made at the behest of Habib, now Reform\u2019s deputy leader, while other former Brexit party MEPs who rejoined at the same time this year backed his request. Habib said on X on Saturday night that he had joined Reform \u201cto obliterate\u201d the Conservative parliamentary party. \u201cFailure has for too long been rewarded by incumbency. We will change politics for good,\u201d he added. Tice has long publicly insisted that the party would put up a candidate against every Conservative in the next general election but, as the Sunday Times reported, the existence of written assurances appears to be an attempt to ease any internal tensions over where a deal with the Tories would be done. There is some contrast between the language used by Tice and that of Farage, who \u2013 while lacerating the Tories under Rishi Sunak \u2013 has appeared less committed to the notion that the Conservative party should be destroyed. Tice\u2019s assurance comes as an Opinium poll last Sunday put Reform on 9% support. The party is also competitive with Labour for the working-class voters who backed Boris Johnson\u2019s Tories in 2019. But its potential to split the vote on the right in many constituencies poses a particular problem for the Tories, who could lose as many as 35 seats in the north and Midlands, according to analysis by More in Common. The same Opinium poll last weekend also revealed that 37% of current Conservative voters would be more favourable towards Reform were Farage, now Reform\u2019s honorary president, to return as leader. Farage has been particularly close to the Conservatives, amid speculation that he could rejoin them, a scenario welcomed by some on the right of Sunak\u2019s party. Reform is understood to be planning a press conference at the start of January to set the scene of an \u201cimmigration election\u201d that would take advantage of Tory infighting over Sunak\u2019s plans to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda."

From the boreal forest that stretches around northern Europe, Siberia and Canada, to the Amazon, Earth\u2019s forests are some of the most biodiverse places on the planet, home to species found nowhere else. Yet all too often, forests are worth more money dead than alive \u2013 despite promises from global leaders to halt deforestation. Their exploitation has pushed many plants, animals and fungi to the brink of extinction, while slowly degrading their ability to generate rainfall, sequester carbon and cool the planet. In the race to create incentives to preserve forests rather than cut them down, the carbon-offsetting market has taken centre stage. Forest-offsetting schemes often sell credits on the basis that they will fund conservation schemes, protecting sections of forest that would otherwise be cut down \u2013 thereby preventing carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Scientific research and journalistic investigations, however, indicate that many of these schemes are essentially \u201chot air\u201d and failing to protect forests as promised. As some major firms reassess their use of forest credits, it raises questions about how we pay for and incentivise the protection of these crucial ecosystems. Here are five ways that experts have suggested we could tip the balance in favour of keeping forest ecosystems alive: 1. Pay countries to look after forests At Cop28 in Dubai, the Brazilian government put forward proposals for a multibillion-dollar global fund that would reward countries for conserving forests and penalise them for deforestation. Tasso Azevedo, a forest expert and adviser to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said countries could be paid $30 a year for every hectare of forest they kept intact, while being penalised for every hectare lost. \u201cImagine you have a country that has 1,000 hectares of forest. If you maintain the forest, you will get $30,000, but if you clear cut 10 hectares, you get nothing,\u201d he told a side event at the summit. In order to qualify for the Tropical Forests Forever fund, countries would have to meet three conditions: keep deforestation below 0.5% a year; have forest loss trending downwards or keep it below 0.1%; and give the majority of funds to the people looking after the trees. The fund could be could be financed by putting a charge on fossil fuel sales, Azevedo said. 2. Ban goods that harm forests Coffee, beef, rubber, soy and palm oil have driven the destruction of huge areas of forest \u2013 releasing vast carbon emissions along the way \u2013 and are often consumed in countries thousands of miles away from the Amazon or the Congo basin where they are produced. To make sure European consumers are not driving further demand for forest loss, the EU has introduced strict regulations on high-risk products. From 2024, firms working in deforestation hotspots must certify that their goods have not harmed forests after a cutoff date of 31 December 2020. If countries like China and the US also introduced restrictions on deforestation-linked commodities, economic demand would probably fall sharply, lessening the incentive to further clear forests. However, this does not solve the problem of finding alternative livelihoods. 3. Introduce a global tax Barbados\u2019s prime minister, Mia Mottley, has been a strong advocate for an international tax that follows the \u201cthe polluter pays\u201d principle to generate climate finance. This could also include funding nature-based solutions, such as forest protection, say experts. By taxing oil and gas profits or the global financial system, Mottley argues that the huge sums required for the global energy transition and future climate resilience could be raised. Proponents say that money should also go to protecting climate-critical ecosystems, without which global heating cannot be limited to 1.5C. \u201cIf we took 5% of oil and gas profits last year \u2013 oil and gas profits were $4tn \u2013 that would give us $200bn,\u201d Mottley said at the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai in December, as she discussed the need for climate change mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage. 4. Swap a developing country\u2019s debt for spending on nature Many of the world\u2019s most nature-rich countries are also the most indebted, meaning that they struggle to pay for conservation. By refinancing debt at a lower interest rate in exchange for commitments on conservation, debt-for-nature swaps are growing in popularity and could be used to finance forest protection. Earlier this year, Ecuador struck the largest deal of its kind, refinancing $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Gabon has entered into a similar deal to unlock money for marine conservation. At Cop28, Colombia \u2013 the host of next year\u2019s UN biodiversity summit, Cop16 \u2013 was a leading voice on calling for more action on debt relief in exchange for climate and nature finance. The country\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, has said that biodiversity will be the basis of the country\u2019s economic wealth after it transitions away from fossil fuels, but his environment minister, Susana Muhamad, warned that debt was hindering the transformation. \u201cFor developing countries, the situation is critical, because many of our economies are highly indebted, especially after Covid. We require fiscal space capacity for climate action to start making the real commitments,\u201d she said. 5. Reform the carbon and biodiversity markets Despite deep flaws in the current system, world leaders and international institutions such as the World Bank have thrown their weight behind carbon markets as a tool for funding forest conservation globally. Supporters of carbon markets say that by purchasing high-quality credits, countries and companies could transfer some of the billions needed to keep forests standing as part of their efforts to offset their emissions. Cop28 negotiations on how to make this work ended in failure, however. The sector is wrestling with human rights concerns, scientific evidence that many carbon credits are largely worthless, and lack of clarity about financial flows, but there are those who say it can still work. Among them is Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and chief scientist at Conservation International, which manages a number of carbon-offsetting projects. \u201cOn the one hand, the voluntary carbon markets on nature are not working, and there\u2019s reason to be deeply concerned about how they are misused as offsetting mechanisms for companies that are not following the scientific pathway on fossil fuel phase-out,\u201d said Rockstr\u00f6m \u201cOn the other hand, we need nature-based solutions more than ever. We need finance more than ever, and we don\u2019t have another mechanism,\u201d he told the Guardian.

Despite Peter Dutton last week making fun of the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, during an interview on 2GB for travelling to the United Nations-led international climate change conference and \u201cincurring all those emissions\u201d, a significant delegation of Coalition MPs will also attend the summit and associated events. The travel is being facilitated by the Coalition for Conservation and Environmental Leadership Australia. As well as McKenzie and Fletcher, the group includes Liberal senators Andrew Bragg, Maria Kovacic and Dean Smith as well as New South Wales Liberals Matt Kean and Kellie Sloane and Queenslanders Sam O\u2019Connor and Steve Minnikin. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Australia has backed a pledge at Cop28 to triple global renewable energy capacity and double the annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. But Australia did not sign up to a commitment by 22 countries, including the US, Canada, Japan and Britain, to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050. McKenzie, a former agriculture minister and currently the shadow infrastructure minister, will attend nuclear events associated with Cop28 and also speak at a forum designed to mobilise global support for climate responsive agriculture. She told Guardian Australia: \u201cIf we are serious about climate change then we need to be serious about the solutions to ensure energy security in a low emission future. \u201cLogically, until alternatives are found, this surely includes nuclear.\u201d Fletcher, the shadow science minister, told Guardian Australia he looked forward to learning \u201cmore about the wide array of technologies being developed and deployed, including nuclear and renewable technologies, as well as key transition fuels like natural gas\u201d. \u201cAs we transition towards net zero, the role of science and technology is critical,\u201d Fletcher said. He pointed to the work of Australian companies doing \u201camazing work\u201d to develop those technologies such as SunDrive in southern Sydney, Newcastle\u2019s Minerals Carbon International and Jupiter Ionics at Monash University in Melbourne, and said he hoped to learn about others at Cop28. Coalition for Conservation is supportive of nuclear energy. Environmental Leadership Australia is technology agnostic. Anna Rose, the chief executive of Environmental Leadership Australia, said on Monday the group was \u201cfocused on building bipartisan support for climate solutions\u201d. \u201cOver the past four years we have established strong, constructive relationships with Liberal and National party politicians at both federal and state levels [and] we\u2019re thrilled to be taking political leaders to Cop28 in Dubai where they will discuss with global counterparts how other nations are reducing carbon pollution and developing the new industries and jobs of a future, zero-emissions economy,\u201d she said. Bowen will fly to Dubai for the event\u2019s final week, when ministers will attempt to wrangle a consensus position on how to lift action to tackle the climate crisis in the face of rising geopolitical tensions. Australia was represented at the opening plenary by its climate change ambassador, Kristin Tilley. The shadow climate minister, Ted O\u2019Brien \u2013 who has led the Coalition\u2019s push to embrace nuclear energy in opposition \u2013 will also attend the summit. In the Senate on Monday, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, was asked by the shadow climate minister, Simon Birmingham, whether she agreed with the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, and the US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, that nuclear energy was an essential component of reaching net zero emissions. Wong said some of Australia\u2019s allies had \u201cchosen to go down the nuclear path, but that is not the approach Australia has taken\u201d. Asked why Australia had not signed the nuclear pledge at Cop28, Wong said most of the signatories were countries with nuclear industries although \u201ca number of countries that have nuclear energy industries did not sign the pledge and Australia joined 117 other countries to sign a pledge to triple global renewable energy capacity, which reflects \u2026 the priorities of the government\u201d. Wong noted the opposition was \u201cvery, very, very committed to the nuclear path\u201d. \u201cI understand Mr O\u2019Brien has said he would be happy to have [a reactor] in his electorate,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter for him \u2026 but we will focus on the form of energy which is the cheapest form of new energy, which is renewable energy, rather than what is frankly an ideological agenda from those opposite.\u201d Nuclear electricity is banned in Australia. The Australian Energy Market Operator\u2019s blueprint for an optimum grid, the integrated system plan, found it could overwhelmingly run on solar and wind, with firming support from batteries, pumped hydro, virtual power plants and some fast-start gas generators that would be turned on only when needed."

            "date": "2023-12-30T19:00:42Z",
            "content": "Morning is a construct in the Antarctic summer. It\u2019s 7.30am and Nerilie Abram, a climate science professor at the Australian National University, is having breakfast at Casey station when she takes the Guardian\u2019s call in late November. The sun barely kissed the horizon the night before, and won\u2019t fall below it for weeks. Constant daylight can be famously discombobulating for first-time visitors to Antarctica, but for experienced researchers such as Abram it is just the backdrop to life at the end of the Earth. This year, though, something else is deeply strange. When Abram was here a decade ago there was a mass of ice floating off the coast. It\u2019s a vastly altered scene when she looks out the window now. \u201cThere\u2019s no sea ice at all,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a magnificent landscape. To think about what we\u2019re doing to it and the changes that are happening here, it\u2019s a punch in the guts.\u201d That punch has winded scientists and policymakers across the planet this year. As the hottest year on record crawls to its finish line, they have been asking: is 2023 the year humanity put its stamp on Antarctica in ways that will be felt for centuries to come? The southern continent has suffered dramatic shifts that raise serious concerns about its immediate health. They have coincided with evidence that longer-term transformations linked to the climate crisis have started much sooner than it was assumed was likely. The changes have ramifications for local wildlife, but also for people across the globe in ways that are often less well understood. A catalogue of concern Antarctic sea ice cover crashed for six months straight, to a level so far below anything else on the satellite record that scientists struggled for adjectives to describe what they were witnessing. While the full effect is yet to be documented, a peer-reviewed paper in August gave some insight into what it might mean. Examining satellite images, researchers from the British Antarctic Survey found that the then record drop in sea ice in late 2022 \u2013 before this year\u2019s larger slump \u2013 could have killed thousands of emperor penguin chicks. The usually stable sea ice that colonies rely on to rear their young in the Bellingshausen Sea just wasn\u2019t there, likely causing a \u201ccatastrophic breeding failure\u201d. That event in the west of the continent followed parts of the east \u2013 the coldest place on Earth \u2013 last year recording what scientists think is the biggest heatwave ever recorded, with temperatures peaking at 39C above normal. Looking ahead, a study published in Nature in March found meltwater from the continent\u2019s ice sheets could dramatically slow down the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, a deep ocean current, by 2050 if greenhouse gas emissions continued at their current level. Two months later, a paper by some of the same researchers estimated the circulation, which influences global weather patterns and ocean temperatures and nutrient levels, had already slowed by about 30% since the 1990s. Separate research by a different team of scientists suggested that accelerated melting of ice shelves extended over the Amundsen Sea in west Antarctica is locked in and beyond human control for the rest of this century even if emissions are significantly reduced. The new element here is the pace of melting \u2013 a tripling compared to last century. Previous studies have already found the full west Antarctic ice sheet, which is protected by the ice shelves and would push up global sea levels by five metres if entirely lost, could be doomed to collapse in the much longer term. Late in the year bird flu reached the sub-Antarctic region for the first time, prompting concerns about a potential ecological disaster if it spread further south. It was reported as a meeting of 26 national governments in Hobart failed to agree on new Antarctic marine conservation areas despite hearing evidence of the range of crises at play. The director of the Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science, Matt King, says the changes in the ice and ocean had made it a year in which \u201ceven the scientists have been sobered\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not often in my career when scientists have really been gobsmacked by what they\u2019re seeing, but people have really been alarmed. It caught them on the hop,\u201d he says. \u201cWe knew that substantial change was coming down the pipeline, but we have seen processes that we thought might play out in the middle of the century playing out much sooner.\u201d Link appears broken The drop in floating ice was particularly abrupt. In the middle of winter, the frozen part of the Southern Ocean was about 2.5m square kilometres less than the 40-year average. That is an area a little larger than western Europe. Scientists are cautious by nature, and have stressed it remains open to debate whether this change is mainly attributable to global heating caused by burning fossil fuels and deforestation. But it is clear that the air is warming and most of the heat trapped by increased greenhouse gases is absorbed by oceans. A study by Australian researchers in September found hemispheric wind patterns this year and last would usually have been associated with above-average sea ice cover. They concluded that link appears to have been broken, probably due to ocean warming between 100 and 200 metres below the surface. Experts have different ways of describing the sea ice decline. Tony Press, a former head of the Australian Antarctic Division, says it is \u201cstatistically not predictable\u201d. What does that mean? \u201cThere\u2019s a chance that it could come back again, but there\u2019s also a very, very high chance that sea ice in Antarctica has moved into a new state,\u201d Press says. \u201cYou would not be an alarmist if you said you were really worried about that.\u201d Researchers say a permanent fall in sea ice is likely to accelerate ocean warming, as dark water absorbs more heat than ice and amplify the rate of global sea level rise by removing a buffer protecting the continent\u2019s ice shelves. It will also have an immediate impact on species that rely on it for food, breeding and refuge \u2013 not just penguins but krill, fish and seals. Press, now an adjunct professor at the University of Tasmania, says along with other changes it should be seen as the \u201cwaking of a sleeping giant\u201d that will reverberate globally. He describes the evidence of a slowdown and potential collapse of the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, in particular, as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. The overturning circulation originates in the cold and dense waters more than 4,000 metres down off the Antarctic continental shelf. It spreads to ocean basins globally, bringing oxygen to the depths and nutrients to the surface. Australian scientists found freshwater from melting Antarctic glacial ice was already reducing the water density and slowing the circulation. Matt England, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales and co-author on the two overturning circulation studies, says the slowdown could play out over centuries, affecting heat, oxygen, nutrients and carbon stores, but he was most concerned about the next few decades. \u2018Incredible geopolitical consequences\u2019 Press says the potential ramifications are far reaching. Take fish populations. \u201cThe world relies on fisheries for protein and sustenance. If fisheries move north and south away from the equator, where nearly all the people in the world live, there are incredible geopolitical consequences,\u201d he says. Many scientists emphasise the need for leaders to grasp the global effect of what is happening and the scale of the work and funding that will be needed to understand it. Kaitlin Naughten, a British Antarctic Survey ocean modeller who led the research on the inevitable increased melting of west Antarctic ice shelves, says that \u201cjust because Antarctica is far away and uninhabited doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t affect you\u201d. She stresses she does not want to \u201cfeed the doom narrative\u201d. Reducing fossil fuels may not save the west Antarctic ice sheet, but other climate impacts can be avoided through decisive action. \u201cEast Antarctica has about 10 times the volume of ice as west Antarctica, and we think it\u2019s generally stable and likely to remain that way as long as emissions don\u2019t rise much further,\u201d she says. This is what Abram is spending the summer examining. In November, she was preparing to travel about 500km to drill a core of ice from Denman glacier. The goal is to see how the climate of the past 1,000 years compares with today\u2019s. Denman glacier is part of the massive east Antarctic ice sheet, which until a few years ago scientists had thought was largely immune from global heating. As Naughten says, it is still considered likely to mostly hold steady if the world can get fossil fuels under control. But on Denman glacier, at least, there are \u201cworrying signs\u201d. \u201cThe elevation of the ice sheet is reducing,\u201d Abram says. \u201cThere are signs it\u2019s losing ice and contributing to sea level rise.\u201d If this sounds exhausting \u2013 one more thing in Antarctica to worry about \u2013 Matt England can relate. \u201cYou look at the results and it is truly confronting,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me, 2023, I hope, is the year when all questions of the urgency of this problem are gone.\u201d"

That may be in the next couple of hours, or may be tomorrow: a spokesperson for the presidency has just issued this statement: \u201cOvernight and throughout today, the COP28 President and his team have been engaging in extensive consultations with a wide representation of negotiating groups and Parties. This is to ensure everyone is heard, and all views are considered. He is determined to deliver a version of the text that has the support of all Parties. Consultations will continue until 03:00AM GST.\u201d In the meantime these were the main events today: Politicians and delegates from the UK reacted with fury as it emerged that climate change minister Graham Stuart had flown home from the summit, ostensibly to shore up the government\u2019s vote on Rwanda. The government said that Richard Benyon had come out to cover him, and that he would be returning. If the summit does end tomorrow as the presidency hopes, of course, that will be a long wasted journey. Our data team calculated that Stuart will have emitted between 467 and 499 kg of CO2 \u2013 assuming that he flew on a passenger plane and that his plane was totally full. That\u2019s approximately the average annual carbon emissions of a citizen of Mali or Kenya or Tanzania. There were worries that Cop was going to collapse and political economist Michael Jacobs argued this might be a good thing: \u201cSo if nothing really significant would be lost by a breakdown of the Cop, would anything be gained? Yes. It would be a much bigger global media story than a fudge. Front-page news. The story: that climate change is now a battle between a fossil future and a non-fossil one.\u201d And more details emerged of country positions on phase out See you tomorrow! Or sooner\u2026 As the day ends in Dubai, Cop28 is in limbo. Will the revised decision text expected early on Tuesday finally deliver the clear call on fossil fuels that many countries believe is essential to taming the climate crisis? Analysis indicates that 127 countries back some kind of phase out, up from 80 countries last year. The pause is leaving time for some reflection. Others wonder if the lack of funds from rich countries to enable low and middle income nations to transition to green energy is the real problem. The Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice has an uncompromising message for delegates as they work towards the summit\u2019s finale: \u201cCop28 is running into overtime, but your time is up to deliver climate justice.\u201d \u201cThere is now only time for acting\u2014urgently, fairly, and justly. The words \u201cfossil fuels\u201d in a text are meaningless if the rest of those pages are riddled with loopholes that not only enable but exacerbate the era of fossil fuels. Climate action is weakened if those who are most responsible are not held to account to lead by example. A phaseout is useless without the tools needed to actually achieve it. Climate action is pointless if it condemns billions to death and destruction.\u201d Bhavreen Kandhari, the co-founder of Warrior Moms in India, has a different but equally important message, reflecting on the slogans displayed across the Cop28 site, such as \u201cThink without limits\u201d. \u201cMothers bring a heartfelt message to Cop, using the power of love to secure a safe future for our children worldwide. Despite the resonance of our shared sentiments being printed on every wall, flag, and message at Cop28, the pressing question remains: why aren\u2019t these messages translating into action? Why isn\u2019t there a prioritisation of our children\u2019s health and future?\u201d Fear of stranded assets and destabilisation behind Saudi Arabia\u2019s resistance to phase-out Saudi Arabia and its allies have emerged as a key obstacle for the super-majority of countries calling for a phase out of fossil fuels by 2050 at the COP28 talks. The world\u2019s biggest oil producing nation is understood to be opposed to toughening the draft conclusions which currently propose only voluntary reductions in fossil fuel production and consumption. But it\u2019s hardly the first time Saudi Arabia has opposed the energy transition. Dan Marks, a research fellow in energy security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said major oil producing nations have always been wary of policies which aim to squeeze the supply of fossil fuels because \u201cthey have interests they need to protect\u201d. For Saudi Arabia these interests include almost 300 billion barrels of oil in their vast reserves. The kingdom represents almost a fifth of the world\u2019s oil reserves, and is the de facto leader of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries which together represent almost 80% of the world\u2019s oil. The fundamental premise of a fossil fuel phase out would destabilise these petrostates by setting in motion a series of policy changes among global regulators, heightening investor concerns over so-called \u2018stranded assets\u2019, Marks told the Guardian. \u201cThis is why the world\u2019s most important oil producing countries have always said \u2018you tackle demand, you don\u2019t tackle supply\u2019,\u201d he said. Others have noted that Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Opec oil cartel have also begun to take aim at any signal to the global market which suggests that demand could be phased out too. Opec has also consistently underestimated the roll out of electric vehicles in its official forecasts, which are used by governments to inform their policies. Its forecasts for the number of electric vehicles on the roads by 2022 were too low by an average of almost 60% over the period 2015-2021, according to a recent report by Zero Carbon Analytics. In 2021, the cartel\u2019s forecasts for the global electric vehicles fleet just one year ahead were wrong by 49%, the report found. Amy Kong, the author of the report, said the forecasts were \u201cwildly wrong year after year\u201d in what appears to be an \u201cunderhand attempt by oil producers to persuade investors and governments that fossil fuels have a future\u201d. Earlier this year Opec branded forecasts from the International Energy Agency that demand for fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas would peak before 2030 as \u201cextremely risky,\u201d \u201cimpractical\u201d and \u201cideologically driven\u201d. It accused the IEA of setting the global energy system up to \u201cfail spectacularly\u201d and bring \u201cenergy chaos on a potentially unprecedented scale\u201d with \u201cdire consequences for economies\u201d. After a day of speculation over when the draft or final text will land, there\u2019s a sense now that, most likely, it will arrive in the morning. Journalists and delegates are slowly heading out of the summit centre, and towards their hotels, with phones switched onto loud. My colleague Fiona Harvey says: '\u201cNobody is expecting it any time soon and are expecting to reconvene tomorrow morning, which would be normal practice when it gets quite late at Cops on the first night after the deadline.\u201d Blocking fossil fuel phase out \u2018a massive own-goal\u2019 for Saudi Arabia\u2019s 2034 World Cup Saudi Arabia\u2019s blocking of a call to phase out fossil fuels is a \u201cmassive own-goal\u201d for the football World Cup it will host in 2034, according to climate scientists. Extreme heat and air pollution will make it unbearable for the players and supporters, they said. The oil-rich kingdom is a key opponent of widespread calls for a fossil fuel phase out, which scientists say is necessary to keep the 1.5C limit for global heating within reach. Saudi Arabia\u2019s football clubs spent almost $1bn on players this summer, significantly more than the $700m pledged by all countries at Cop28 for the loss and damage fund, to help vulnerable countries recover from climate disasters. Saudi Arabia made no contribution. \u201cThe health and well-being of billions of people around the world is already under threat from the burning of fossil fuels,\u201d said Dr Friederike Otto, co-founder of the World Weather Attribution group. \u201cWhen we look ahead to major cultural milestones such as the 2034 World Cup, extreme heat and toxic air will make it unbearable for the athletes, but also for the millions of people who have always come together to celebrate moments like this.\u201d \u201cBlocking a fossil phaseout [at Cop28] will be a massive own-goal from Saudi Arabia, as it would demonstrate a disregard for the health and welfare of footballers and the majority of the world\u2019s population,\u201d she said. Prof Richard Betts, at the University of Exeter, UK, said: \u201cClimate hazards such as extreme heat and humidity, drought, heavy rainfall and sea-level rise are increasingly seen across many parts of the world and in areas like the Middle-East, Africa, and Asia will be more widespread and more severe in the coming decades.\u201d \u201cEven in wealthier nations with better infrastructure such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, rising temperatures will have a major impact on their own populations and people visiting,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, the Fifa World Cup in Saudi Arabia, if played in the summer of 2034, would see temperatures of around 50C which will significantly increase the risk of heat stress for players, families and supporters, and ruling out some people from going.\u201d Maria Neira, director of public health and environment at the World Health Organization, said: \u201cClimate change has been identified as potentially the greatest health challenge of the 21st century. We urgently need all leaders at Cop28 to call for a phase out of fossil fuels and safeguard the health of global populations from the climate crisis.\u201d Armenians are deeply concerned about the decision to hold the Cop29 climate talks in Azerbaijan just months after what has been referred to as an \u201cethnical cleansing\u201d of tens of thousands of Armenians from a breakaway province in the country. In September an estimated 120,000 Armenians fled Nagorno-Karabakh \u2013 known to Armenians as Artsakh \u2013 after Azerbaijan\u2019s military launched an \u201canti-terrorist\u201d campaign on the region, which had been run by a local ethnic Armenian government. Armenia\u2019s prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, has alleged the Armenian exodus amounted to \u201ca direct act of an ethnic cleansing and depriving people of their motherland\u201d. Azerbaijan has since pledged to respect the rights of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. But Armenians said the decision to hold the next UN climate talks in the country has effectively barred them from attending. Arshak Makichyan, a Russian Armenian climate activist, who now lives in exile in Germany because of his opposition to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, told the Guardian the decision to hold Cop29 in Azerbaijan was a legitimisation of ethnic cleansing. \u201cFor me, as an ethnic Armenian, this means that I will not be able to go to this conference. Moreover, hatred towards Armenians has been cultivated in Azerbaijan for decades. To go there would be dangerous and scary for any Armenian. \u201cIt is so strange that not even a few months have passed since everyone forgot about the horrors of the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh and another mass deportation of Armenians \u2026 Laura Cwiertnia, a German Armenian climate journalist working for Die Zeit, wrote on X/Twitter: \u201cAs a climate journalist, I can\u2019t relax and travel to the next world climate conference. Because the dictator of the host country Azerbaijan says about Armenian people like me: \u2018We will hunt them like dogs\u2019. \u201cAnd before someone tells me that nothing will happen to me: that\u2019s not the point. (I probably wouldn\u2019t even be allowed into the country because I was doing my job as a critical journalist.)\u201c The long term finance text has been published. This is not the main text, but one of the supporting work threads that has been going on, looking at how climate finance can be scaled up, and how to mobilise the cash that developing countries will need. So far reaction has been slow to come through on the new text. My colleague Fiona Harvey has taken a look and says it appears to be delaying most of the main decisions, and is hearing that some countries feel the text is pretty weak. It may be accepted, nevertheless. We\u2019ll keep our ears out for more reaction. We asked our data team to try to work out the emissions of the flight back from Cop28 that the UK\u2019s climate change minister Graham Stuart took earlier, when he headed back from the crucial climate talks in Dubai to take part in the vote on Rwanda. Our colleague Michael Goodier cracked the numbers and has concluded that Stuart will have emitted between 467 and 499 kg of CO2 \u2013 assuming that he flew on a passenger plane and that his plane was totally full. That\u2019s approximately the average annual carbon emissions of a citizen of Mali or Kenya or Tanzania. Both British Airways and Emirates offer flights from Dubai International to London. A flight on the British Airways Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner \u2013 which seats 256 \u2013 emits roughly 119,600kg of CO2, while a flight on the Emirates Airbus A380-861 (seats 519) emits around 258,800kg, according to data from Eurocontrol. Assuming he flies back to the summit after voting, Mr Stuart will have in total emitted between 1,868 and 1,996 kg CO2 on his four Cop28 flights. That\u2019s around a third of the total annual emissions of the average UK citizen \u2013 and there are 48 countries worldwide where the average person emits less CO2 than Mr Stuart\u2019s flights. Previous research has found that just 1% of English residents were responsible for nearly a fifth of all flights abroad. Meanwhile, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cThis government is not anti-flying. We don\u2019t lecture the public to that regard. The most important thing is the outcomes of Cop, which minister Stuart is obviously leading for the UK on.\u201d Still waiting for the next text to arrive, with press conferences being cancelled all over the place. Delegates are trying to get a bit more comfortable\u2026 and a few snoozes are being had around the peripheries of the talks. A cat has somehow got into the talks. Packing up. A bit of fresh air. And my colleague Patrick Greenfield has found some nice big comfy chairs. My colleague Jonathan Watts looks back at previous Cops, and wonders if it might be time to abandon this system? Since the first Conference of the Parties in Berlin in 1995, every subsequent COP has had a character and a mood of its own. The high point was Paris in 2015, when euphoric delegates celebrated an ambitious agreement to cut emissions and limit global heating to between 1.5C and 2C. The low point was Copenhagen in 2009, when world leaders scuttled home after rancorous talks that came perilously close to collapse. Where will Cop28 sit on this sliding scale? Negotiations are still ongoing, but with nations deeply divided and entrenched after the official closing point and the UK delegation\u2019s leader going home early, many veteran COP watchers are asking whether Dubai could set such a new low that it might prompt change. As we have reported earlier in this blog, the former US vice president Al Gore tweeted yesterday that the conference is \u201con the verge of complete failure\u201d. while the longtime COP observer Michael Jacobs, a political economist at the University of Sheffield, suggested that a breakdown of talks could be preferable to the current deal on offer. In a social media thread, Jacobs says \u201cIt seems more or less impossible now to get a wording that clearly calls for the \u2018phase out\u2019 goal, as demanded by the small islands and the EU. The OPEC states won\u2019t agree to it, and the UAE (a member of OPEC) won\u2019t insist on it from the chair.\u201d Rather than a fudged compromise that effectively abandons the Paris Agreement targets, he feels a collapse of the talks would at least galvanise the global debate about the climate, which has slipped off the front pages. \u201cCOP28 has become a shameless exercise in the fight against climate change. But can we afford to walk out?\u201d asks an opinion article in the Los Angeles Times today by scientist Michael Mann and Susan Joy Hassol, the director of Climate Communication. Their answer is no. The COP summit process, they say, has been \u201cco-opted by the fossil fuel industry and become rife with conflicts, corruption and corporate greenwashing,\u201d but, \u201cdeeply flawed as COP is, it\u2019s the only existing framework for global climate negotiations.\u201d So what to do when the only climate game in town has been co-opted by the fossil-fuel industry? Mann and Hassol argue for reform: majority voting rather than consensus, sanctions for countries that thwart the phase out of fossil fuels and a bar on oil executives and petrostates running and hosting the summits. Guardian columnist George Monbiot had earlier proposed a similarly radical shake-up. As he noted, only two out of the 27 climate summits to date could be called even a half-success (Paris and Kyoto in 1997). \u201cIf any other process had a 3.7% success rate, it would be abandoned in favour of something better,\u2019 he argues. As well as banning oil and beef industry lobbyists and changing the voting system, he calls for the COP system to be bypassed by a series of binding treaties on fossil fuels and deforestation that are supported by a new International Climate Agency, modelled on the International Atomic Energy Agency. Many other ideas for reform are out there. Almost all would involve a degree of trauma in the all-too-cosy United Nations system. Hard-fought gains on loss-and-damage, adaptation, and climate finance for developing nations would need to be protected. But the need for change is evident from that fact that global heating emissions continue to rise almost three decades after the process to stop them began - although some analysts believe they will finally have peaked this year - or next year at worst. In the northern hemisphere, this summer was the hottest on record and July was probably the warmest month in 120,000 years. Even so, with temperatures set to rise for decades, probably beyond 3C, this will probably be one of the coolest years in the rest of our lives. The urgency could not be greater. Does that justify a walkout? Let\u2019s see what the delegates in Dubai come up with in the coming hours and days. A sense of crisis can sometimes prove a negotiating tactic and the prelude to a better deal. Right now, however, this COP is looking a lot more like Copenhagen than Paris. More than 1,000 scientists have now signed a letter stating: \u201cFor all intents and purposes, moving towards the phase-out of fossil fuel combustion is necessary to keep the 1.5C goal of the Paris agreement within reach.\u201d The letter was drawn up after the Guardian revelation that the Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, had said shortly before the summit that: \u201cThere is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what\u2019s going to achieve 1.5C.\u201d A separate letter, from 1000 scientific experts on ice caps and glaciers, says: \u201cThis has been a year of climate disasters and ice loss. Our message is that this insanity cannot and must not continue. We must prevent even worse impacts from a collapsing cryosphere. We need a [decision] with clear guidelines to make 1.5C a reality; a path to phase out fossil fuels; and financial mechanisms to support climate action, adaptation, and loss and damage. \u201cOtherwise, world leaders are de facto deciding to burden humanity for centuries to millennia by displacing hundreds of millions of people from flooding coastal settlements; depriving societies of life-giving freshwater resources, and disrupting delicately-balanced polar ocean and mountain ecosystems. The melting point of ice pays no attention to rhetoric, only to our actions.\u201d My colleague Nina Lakhani currently out in Dubai, has been digging into the critical issue of implementation, which has become a real big sticking point in the talks. She explains: If there is one thing that developing countries are united in at Cop28, it\u2019s the demand for developed countries to honour their legally binding obligations under the Paris agreement on providing developing countries with the means of implementation. It was the key theme that was raised again and again on Monday night in response to the global stocktake draft text. South Africa\u2019s environment minister, Barbara Creecy, speaking about her country\u2019s experience with implementing a just energy transition framework, said, \u201cToday we have received less than 10% of the support of what we need between now and 2030 for the implementation plan. For many developing countries, particularly in the African continent, the gap is not in ambition; it is in the question of means of implementation.\u201d Brazil\u2019s delegate said: \u201cIt is very difficult to do something without the necessary means. Let\u2019s talk about the means first. And it is on the basis of those means we will take up our ambition for climate justice. We have managed to reduce emissions by saving forests. We cannot act alone. We need everyone to act. The means of implementation has to be aligned with our decisions and ambition.\u201d So what does means of implementation actually mean \u2013 and why is it so crucial? The architecture of the Paris agreement requires each country to create and implement a nationally determined contribution (NDC) that include mitigation, adaptation and the means \u2013 finance, technology transfer, and capacity building \u2013 by which this would be implemented. The current NDCs (2021 to 2030) include country-specific climate targets and plans that are both unconditional and conditional or dependent on international processes. How developed countries are obliged to help Chad or Nepal or Barbados meet their NDC targets is dealt with under articles 9, 10 and 11 of the Paris agreement. Article 9 states that developed countries shall provide and mobilise finance, while other countries can voluntarily do so. Article 10 states that support, including financial support, shall be provided to developing countries for technology development and transfer in order to improve resilience to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Article 11 deals with enhancing capacity-building of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, such as small island nations. So when you hear blocs such as the G77 plus China (135 countries) and the like-minded developing countries (LMDC, 20 nations) bang on about implementation of the Paris agreement, they are often referring to the above obligations which have mostly not been met. As it stands, developing countries need $5tn to $11tn to implement the current NDCs, which expire in 2030, according to the UNFCCC \u2013 which said that this huge funding gap only covered 30% of the actual costs. So that\u2019s partly why developing countries simply cannot accept a fossil fuel phase-out \u2013 or any new target \u2013 without means of implementation, as they\u2019re already unable to even fund their current mitigation and adaptation plans (all while loss and damage costs are spiralling). Now to the global stocktake (GST), which is the five-yearly required assessment of the collective progress on Paris commitments. The outcome of this is so important because it will guide the next round of NDCs, which have to be submitted by 2025. This is getting wonky but bear with me for just one more article \u2013 9.5 \u2013 which requires developed countries to provide upfront information on what public resources will be available \u2013 to help inform poorer countries\u2019 NDCs. But this just hasn\u2019t happened. And remember the $100bn a year for climate action to be mobilised by 2020, which the US came up with in Copenhagen but has never been delivered. Well, this number was more or less pulled out of thin air, so next year countries must agree on a bigger, needs-based annual financing sum New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG). Developed countries say all meaningful talk of finance should be postponed until then, while developing countries say they need details on finance and means of implementation in the GST, global goal on adaptation, and just transition programme, otherwise they are simply being set up to fail. As Meena Raman from the Third World Network in Malaysia \u2013 who was incredibly helpful in helping me to understand this topic \u2013 says: \u201cWithout means of implementation, it\u2019s all just words.\u201d A government spokesperson has told us that Stuart \u201cwill continue to be the lead UK minister for negotiations and remains in constant contact with the UK lead climate negotiator and Lord Benyon, with any final decisions agreed with him.\u201d The way it\u2019s going to work, apparently, is that: The UK lead climate negotiator, Alison Campbell, will continue to lead negotiations for the UK at Cop28. Stuart will be responsible for the final decision on key issues and retains responsibility for UK negotiations overall. Lord Benyon, representing the UK, is meeting key representatives from other countries, including the US climate envoy, John Kerry, the Tuvalu minister for finance, the Norwegian foreign minister and the UAE climate change under-secretary. He will also attend formal set-piece meetings with Campbell and can represent the UK at the closing plenary. Benyon, meanwhile, has posted a tweet about being hard at work in Dubai \u2013 but eagle-eyed Leo Hickman of Carbon Brief has pointed out that while Benyon sits alone with his text, Teresa Ribera of the EU and John Kerry of the US are deep in conversation behind him. \u201cAll this picture \u2018says\u2019 is that the UK is isolated from the key players,\u201d argues Hickman. As delegates in Dubai await a revised text, following the much-criticised draft issued on Monday, here is a summary of what countries said at a closed-door meeting last night, spelling out their concerns: Those clearly opposing tougher language on fossil fuels: Saudi Arabia (on behalf of the 22 Arab Group countries): The draft text is a good base to work from. Science does not predict or project any necessity to completely phase out fossil fuelsby 2050, in a world of 1.5C (this row dominated week one of Cop28). There is a clear indication from the science for a deep, rapid and sustained reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Qatar: The draft text impacts on the sovereign right for sustainable development. The need is to reduce emissions and not eliminate the sources of emissions, ie fossil fuels. Bolivia (speaking for Like Minded Developing Countries, which includes oil producers like Saudi Arabia): There are huge issues with the text on reducing fossil fuels - it cannot prescribe the actions of countries, as the Paris agreement is based on voluntary, bottom-up action. Iran also made this point. Those clearly backing tougher language on fossil fuels: European Union: This text, or anything close to it, is unacceptable. Picking and choosing between options to cut emissions from fossil fuels is not good enough. Germany was among the countries saying that the statement in the text that global emissions must fall by 43% by 2030, 60% by 2035, and be net zero by 2050 is contradicted by the weak statements saying only that countries \u201ccould\u201d choose to reduce fossil fuel use. Samoa (on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States): The text on only \u201creducing\u201d fossil fuels, not phasing them out, is utterly insufficient and falls way below keeping 1.5C alive. Tuvalu also spoke: it\u2019s a matter of survival. The Dominican Republic said Cop28 could be the Cop where 1.5C dies. Colombia (on behalf of Latin America and the Caribbean group AILAC): The text recognises the urgency of the climate crisis, but falls short on action, particularly on action by 2030, the first milestone that cannot be missed to keep under 1.5C of global heating. It was also very worried about the lack of finance for adaptation. Bangladesh (on behalf of the 46 Least Developed Countries): Keeping under 1.5C was called the \u201cnorth star\u201d of the talks [by Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber] but is missing from the text, which is weak and contradictory. Australia (on behalf of the Umbrella group, which includes the US, UK and Norway): The group represents some of the largest fossil fuel consumers and producers but it is time to transition away. The text has energy options that \u201ccould\u201d be taken: we came here to agree on what we \u201cshould\u201d do. The draft text does not send the clear signal to the world we need. US: The text does not meet the test of keeping below 1.5C degrees. Many countries have called for the world to largely phase out fossil fuels by 2050, with a critical reduction in this decade. If we don\u2019t do what we need to do by 2030, there\u2019s no net zero by 2050, then no 1.5C. Norway: Despite being a major exporter of oil and gas, Norway backs a \u201cphase out\u201d of fossil fuels. Carbon capture and storage has been used in Norway for almost 30 years but we can also testify it is not the solution to everything. It should be reserved for hard-to-abate sectors (like cement and steel). The others: Cuba (speaking on behalf of G77+ China group, which has 135 member nations): The text fails to recognise fully that rich nations must act on climate first, and help poorer nations to act. Brazil also made these points. China: It took developed countries more than 150 years to peak, therefore there should not be a reference to global carbon emissions peaking in 2025 in the text. India: The most crucial element missing in the text is historical cumulative emissions. Pakistan: The provision of climate finance is pivotal for achieving anything. The transition to cleaner energy sources has been ready for many years - it needs billions of dollars. It is now being reported that Graham Stuart \u2013 the UK\u2019s minister for climate change \u2013 will be flying back to Dubai again after the Rwanda vote to rejoin the talks. That will be, according to Sam Coates of Sky, a 6,813-mile round trip. In the meantime, Richard Benyon, the minister of state for climate, environment and energy, is holding the fort. Apparently there was only a gap of a few hours between Stuart and Benyon, and the talks were not \u201cleft uncovered in order to try to win the Rwanda vote\u201d. Handily Benyon is in the Lords and so his absence won\u2019t affect the Rwanda vote at all. Presumably that is just a fortunate coincidence. When we asked the UK government to comment on Stuart\u2019s return earlier, they told us: \u201cMinister Stuart has returned to the UK to attend parliament in his role as an MP. There will continue to be full official representation on the ground at the summit and Minister Stuart will continue to be the lead UK minister for negotiations with any final decisions agreed with him.\u201d As delegates and journalists brace themselves for another long night, spare a thought for the wonderful workers at Cop28, who have been working extremely long hours over the last fortnight. The security staff, who come from a range of countries in Africa and Asia, are on their feet all day and mostly live in company accommodation. One young Ugandan man said: \u201cOf course I would rather be at home, but we have economic needs.\u201d Many of the cafe staff who\u2019ve been sustaining us with coffee and sandwiches usually work - and live - at the World Trade Centre in the north of the city, and so have been spending a couple of hours each day traveling to the Expo site. One cafe worker, originally from the Philippines, has been leaving home at 3.30am and getting back after 9pm; another guy from Pakistan said door-to-door he was putting in 16 hours each day. They are all exhausted, but today is the last day for those working in the media center at least. If the talks overrun, which looks inevitable, journalists will have to get their caffeine elsewhere. Emissions from Canadian wildfires in 2023 were the highest ever recorded anywhere in the world, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service revealed, in a reminder of what is at stake at Cop28 as global temperatures continue to rise. The Canadian fires started in Alberta and Saskatchewan in early May and continued into October, engulfing 18m hectares and discharging the equivalent of 1,761m tonnes of carbon dioxide - almost five times the average of the past 20 years. The smoke was transported over a huge region, bringing hazy skies to New York, the British Isles and southern Europe. In its annual report, Copernicus said this unprecedented hot year also saw the Europe Union\u2019s largest-ever forest fire in northern Greece, deadly fires in Hawaii and Chile, and fires in the Siberian region of Russia, from which smoke reached the North Pole for the first time in history. Bolivia also saw a dramatic spike in fires as it became one of the fastest deforesting regions in the world. At last night\u2019s negotiations, the Bolivian delegates strongly resisted attempts to aim for zero deforestation by 2030, which Brazil has promised to achieve. All of this is occurring at global temperatures that are 1.3C above pre-industrial levels, according to the UK Met Office. As things stand in the current Cop28 negotiations, scientists predict the world will heat up by more than 3C, which would bring far more severe fire activity. Ed Miliband has been attending Cops for well over a decade now, including as Gordon Brown\u2019s climate change minister at Copenhagen in 2009. He is pretty damning about the decision by the UK climate change minister, Graham Stuart, to potter off home before the talks have come to any kind of conclusion. \u201cGraham Stuart flying home in the middle of critical negotiations tells you everything you need to know about this Conservative government,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are weak, divided and chaotic and can\u2019t stand up and fight for lower energy bills for the British people, can\u2019t stand up and fight for investment into our country, and they can\u2019t stand up and fight to provide climate leadership. \u201cThe sad truth is that, thanks to Rishi Sunak tanking Britain\u2019s reputation on the world stage, many countries simply won\u2019t even notice that his minister has disappeared.\u201d Hallo, this is Bibi van der Zee taking over the blog from my colleague Ajit. We\u2019re still waiting for the latest iteration of the text to appear, and meanwhile there is increasing worry about how on earth all the outstanding issues are going to be resolved. We\u2019ll be bringing you all the developments as they unfold; email me with comments and suggestions on bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com\u2026 Thanks for following the liveblog today, I\u2019m passing it over to my colleague Bibi \u2013 you can get in touch with her at bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com with your thoughts, tips and questions. Here are the big events from this morning: More countries expressed anger at the draft text for its lack of ambition. The UK\u2019s climate minister left the climate conference. Campaigners warned that the historic loss and damage agreement from the first day of the summit is still lacking. Indigenous and global south activists called out rich country \u2018hypocrisy\u2019 in pushing to phase out fossil fuels globally while increasing production at home. Our tireless reporters on the ground are eagerly awaiting the next version of the text to drop. Climate campaigners and politicians have reacted with fury to the news that the UK climate change minister, Graham Stuart, has returned to London from Cop28, my colleagues Fiona Harvey, Patrick Greenfield and Helena Horton tell me. Rebecca Newsom, of Greenpeace, told the Guardian: \u201cThis is an outrageous dereliction of leadership at the most critical point during this conference. This is the moment when we need to see bold political commitments to unlock the gridlock on the text. \u201cInstead of fleeing Dubai, Stuart should be here to broker the compromises really needed to act upon developing countries\u2019 urgent demands for more public finance to deliver a full fossil fuel phase-out. And he should be making clear that the UK, as a rich historically polluting country, is prepared to lead the way on delivering the renewable transition way from fossil fuels. The world is watching, and the Conservative government\u2019s failure to lead at Cop28 is becoming increasingly obvious.\u201d Chris Skidmore, the Tory MP who wrote a review of the government\u2019s net zero policies, said: \u201cThe decisions taken at this Cop are far more important and vital for the future of all nations than the outcome of a vote tonight that will have little or no impact in the long term. Politics is about priorities and our priorities should be demonstrating clear UK leadership on climate action, but you have to actually be in the room to lead.\u201d The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cThe government\u2019s last shred of moral authority in tackling the climate emergency has been obliterated by this scandalous decision to leave Cop28 negotiations at the most critical moment. Adding insult to injury, if true that the minister is leaving the summit in order to vote in favour of the utterly immoral Rwanda deal, it shows that Rishi Sunak prioritises saving his own skin over saving the planet.\u201d Francesca Rhodes, of Care International UK, said: \u201cIf the reports are accurate, it is staggering that the UK government has no ministers attending the final critical days of Cop28. These negotiations will decide the fate of millions of people facing floods, fires and famine due to the climate crisis. The UK has played a productive role in the talks so far but leaving early is simply shameful. Time and again, wealthy countries have let down low-income countries. The latest text was deeply disappointing and does not keep 1.5C alive. When the UK should be standing up for marginalised communities, including women and girls, Rishi Sunak\u2019s government has gone awol.\u201d The UK\u2019s climate change minister has left Dubai and returned to London, the Guardian has learned, leaving civil servants to finish the fraught negotiations in his absence. Graham Stuart, the minister of state for climate change, left Dubai on Tuesday morning to return to his duties as an MP, the government confirmed, even as the climate talks reached crisis point. A government spokesperson told the Guardian: \u201cMinister Stuart has returned to the UK to attend parliament in his role as an MP. There will continue to be full official representation on the ground at the summit and Minister Stuart will continue to be the lead UK minister for negotiations with any final decisions agreed with him.\u201d The spokesperson would not confirm whether Stuart had returned in order to take part in the vote on Rishi Sunak\u2019s controversial policy on Rwanda. The departure by a head of delegation for a leading developed country was met with shock and disbelief from campaigners and other delegations at the talks. One told the Guardian the UK had already raised eyebrows at the talks with its seeming lack of commitment. The fortnight-long talks have reached a crisis, after a draft deal by the host country, United Arab Emirates, was rejected by scores of developed and developing country governments, including the UK. Although the text called for a reduction in the production and consumption of fossil fuels, it contained no obligation for countries to make such cuts, instead framing it as one of a list of options that countries \u201ccould\u201d undertake. \u201cThat one word \u2018could\u2019 just kills everything,\u201d said Eamon Ryan, Ireland\u2019s environment minister, adding that the EU could walk out of the talks if the text did not improve. No end to negotiations is yet in sight, as countries are locked in disagreement over whether to phase out or phase down fossil fuels. The UK strongly rejected the text that was tabled by the presidency on Monday evening in Dubai, with Stuart visiting the UAE presidency to demand a toughening up of the text. The UK says it wants a full phase-out of fossil fuels to be agreed at these talks. However, critics have pointed out that the UK is also planning a new round of oil and gas licences in the North Sea. Rishi Sunak attended the talks briefly in their opening days, but was criticised for staying for less time talking to other leaders than he spent on the private jet that carried him to and from the conference. Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, also attended for a few days at the beginning of the talks, but left before the crunch negotiations began, leaving Stuart in charge of the UK\u2019s delegation. Most other countries are represented at Cop28 by their equivalent of cabinet minister rank, so the UK was already unusual in having its delegation headed by a junior minister. Will the Cop28 talks break down if countries fail to come to an agreement? If so, it would be a first in the history of UN climate summits. Michael Jacobs, a political economist at the University of Sheffield and longtime Cop observer, argues that this might even be the best result. \u201cIf the global stocktake text is lost it would be a shame, but it won\u2019t mean any country will now not do something it would otherwise have done,\u201d Jacobs said in a post on X. \u201cFinance is not determined by this text. Nor are mitigation and adaptation plans in the next set of national commitments in 2025.\u201d He added: \u201cSo if nothing really significant would be lost by a breakdown of the Cop, would anything be gained? Yes. It would be a much bigger global media story than a fudge. Front-page news. The story: that climate change is now a battle between a fossil future and a non-fossil one.\u201d While the global stocktake is the most important text that governments are dealing with at Cop28, several other issues are being dealt with. As Carbon Brief\u2019s Simon Evans points out, we are in overtime at Cop28 and there is still a lot to do. One of the issues being discussed is the complicated rules that underpin global carbon markets, which observers privately warn are descending into farce. The supervisory body for the rules on carbon removals, which is made up of country negotiators, spent over a year drawing up the rules before the Cop28 summit. Now they are marking their own homework as negotiators with their respective countries, but they cannot agree on the rules that they wrote in the supervisory body. Frustrations are growing. Gilles Dufrasne, a policy expert at Carbon Market Watch, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good for negotiators to take a second look at their work. Some of what\u2019s on the table is sufficient, but it\u2019s important to also recognise what is not yet ready. There is certainly room for improvement in the recommendations that have been sent, and we hope countries will not blindly adopt rules that will not deliver the necessary level of integrity for the market.\u201d Andy Katz, of Sierra Club, said: \u201cIf they make up the rules as they go, we may never see accountability for reversals or social safeguards. More clarity is needed before the requirements for removal activities can be adopted.\u201d Injy Johnstone, of Oxford Net-Zero, said: \u201cThere is a significant gap between the carbon removal we need, and where we are now. Article 6 could play a role in scaling removal investment, but only if the sufficient guidance and guardrails are put in place.\u201d As climate talks reach a crisis point, the UK minister in charge of its delegation has left the conference. Full story coming soon\u2026 For all the flaws of UN climate summits, they are one of the few spaces in which voices from the small island states on the frontlines of climate change are heard. A new Guardian series explores a painful contradiction that many of them must navigate: their economies depend on tourists who wreck the environment but their existence is imperilled by sea levels that are rising fast as a result of carbon pollution. There is rarely good news on the climate crisis, but Colombia was lauded on Monday evening by NGOs for its leadership at Cop28, not least by becoming the biggest fossil fuel producer to date to renounce drilling and join the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance. \u201cColombia has been a consistent shining light,\u201d said the Climate Action Network (CAN). \u201cThey truly were the clear eyes and big hearts on the fossil fuel phase-out. President Gustavo Petro\u2019s speech choosing life and endorsing the fossil fuel treaty was complemented by environment minister Susanna Muhamad\u2019s ongoing interventions, driving the conversations the world desperately needs at this critical time towards the end of the fossil fuel age.\u201d Alejandro Alem\u00e1n, the coordinator of Climate Action Network Latin America, said: \u201cThe Ray of the Year award is a recognition of Colombia\u2019s performance in favour of climate justice and the genuine interests of the people of Latin America, especially Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and local communities. \u201cIn 15 years of monitoring the UN negotiations, I have rarely seen such forceful proposals in favour of respect for human rights, genuine protection of the environment \u2013 not greenwashing \u2013 and the protection of wellbeing for people. Colombia\u2019s position in the UNFCCC is a watershed, since it breaks with a mindset and puts on the negotiating table the possibilities of creating a new development paradigm, rethinking the future based on a more just and sustainable society.\u201d CAN also awarded an award to the US. \u201cSince the dawn of time the US has been opposing language on the differentiation of fossil fuels [ie naming oil and gas, not just coal] and has outrageously been pushing through language on fossil fuel emissions. Therefore, as the world\u2019s largest historical emitter and oil producer, blocking negotiations in the final hours of Cop28, the award for the biggest and baddest fossil, The Colossal Fossil, goes to the US,\u201d it said The Fossil of the Day award went to Saudi Arabia for its \u201cshameful resistance [to a fossil fuel phase-out], driven by profit rather than what\u2019s best for people and planet\u201d. The awards have been presented at the UN climate talks since 1999. Experts from global south and Indigenous communities have described the global stocktake and the state of the negotiations as a \u201cdark day\u201d, at this year\u2019s last press briefing by the Global Campaign for Climate Justice. \u201cI come from the belly of the beast. Every year we are faced with major wildfires because the United States fails to reduce emissions at source, they fail to keep [fossil fuels] in the ground when the science is clear,\u201d said Thomas Joseph, from a village in the Six Rivers national forest of northern California, which has been heavily affected by the fossil fuel industry. \u201cWe have lost control of our government because of the influence of the fossil fuel industry. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here today with Cop28 \u2026 there is no clear pathway forward that\u2019s going to reduce emissions at source and keep us below 1.5C and we continue to implement false solutions, dangerous distractions that put our communities, primarily Indigenous people, at risk.\u201d Meena Raman, a climate policy expert at her 16th Cop with the Third World Network, said: \u201cThe global stocktake has been full of dishonesty and hypocrisy from the global north, especially the US and \u2018umbrella\u2019 group of countries, who are suddenly claiming to be climate champions talking about the 1.5C north star while refusing to talk about their historical emissions and historical responsibility. This is a super red line for the United States. They don\u2019t want to talk about equity and insist that the text refers to all parties without any differentiation. \u201cFor people like me who have been following these Cops, their words really ring hollow \u2026 because they are setting up the developing countries for failure so they can blame [them] and show themselves as climate champions even as they are expanding fossil fuel production and consumption \u2026 this is hypocrisy, it\u2019s climate colonialism, and climate injustice.\u201d Lidy Nacpil, the director of the Asian Peoples\u2019 Movement on Debt and Development, said: \u201cSo much of the global south already has extreme energy poverty and the situation will get worse if we\u2019re talking about fossil fuels without talking about finance. It makes us sick when we hear them, because it is so hypocritical that they\u2019re actually expanding their fossil fuel production and consumption and it\u2019s so shameless. That they\u2019re calling for ambition without talking about the delivery of their obligations to provide their fair share of the finance, which is their obligation. We\u2019re not asking for help.\u201d She added: \u201cThey are throwing us some peanuts in the just transition package but without discussion of climate finance this is just going to be all rhetoric. The only climate finance \u2018flowing\u2019 is mostly in the form of loans which is going to end up just impoverishing us in the south even more. For us this is a dark day.\u201d Money has been at the heart of Cop28, both in the negotiations and the announcements that governments and businesses have made on the sidelines. As the summit enters its final hours, here are some key financial takeaways from analysts and campaigners. \u201cThis Cop has set several finance records,\u201d said Joe Thwaites, of the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cNew pledges to the Green Climate Fund have taken its replenishment to $12.8bn. The newly minted fund to address loss and damages has raised $655.9m, the fastest a UN climate fund has ever been capitalised. But there are concerns that adaptation finance is being ignored and overall commitments at Cop have been disappointing. Rich countries must step up and contribute more if they want to dispel the notion that climate finance commitments are merely moving existing pots of money around.\u201d Emily Wilkinson, of the thinktank ODI, said: \u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s good the loss and damage fund got off the ground at Cop28, given the opposition from some nations to the idea of compensating countries for historic emissions. However, we need the fund to go further, faster. In the last 22 years extreme weather events have cost small island states alone $105bn, of which $38.4bn can be attributed to climate change. By comparison, there is now around $700m pledged to the fund \u2013 just a small fraction of the losses developing countries face as a result of climate change every year \u2013 even as anticipated costs are ramping up.\u201d Fadhel Kaboub, of Power Shift Africa, said: \u201cClimate finance is actually a debt owed by the historic polluters of the global north to countries on the frontlines of climate change. The global north is in default and is refusing to pay its debt. At the end of Cop28 we are nowhere near reaching the trillions global south countries need in transformative grant-based investment and transfer of technology for climate by 2030.\u201d Sandra Guzman, of the Climate Finance Group for Latin America and the Caribbean (GFLAC), said: \u201cThe pledges made at Cop28 for the loss and damage Fund, the Green Climate Fund and other commitments are a positive signal, but this signal won\u2019t be transformative if there is not a predictable plan to transfer them, in an adequate, transparent and equitable way, avoiding debt and making them accessible for the most vulnerable countries.\u201d The Kenyan climate activist and podcast host Abigael Kima said: \u201cWe are on the frontlines of the climate emergency. As the negotiations wrap up here in Dubai, our crops are failing, flash flooding is devastating communities, and conflicts are raging with climate change as an underlying cause. We need world leaders to make strong finance commitments now to help developing countries adapt and transform their economies and societies for a warming future.\u201d With little sign of agreement on the final scheduled day of Cop28, the pressure is intense on the Cop president, Sultan Al Jaber, to bring the 198 countries to an ambitious final deal. One of the few people who has been in the same position is Alok Sharma, who was president of Cop26 in Glasgow, and he spoke to BBC Radio 4 today. He said he would still be trying to get the phrase \u201cphase-out of fossil fuel\u201d back into the final text, after it was removed in the draft released on Monday. (There\u2019s more on why \u201cphase-out\u201d matters so much here). \u201cThere is still an opportunity to get a historic outcome, the presidency and other countries should not give up. We are literally fighting for the future of our children\u2019s lives,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThe science tells us we need strong and clear language on fossil fuel phase out. At Cop26, we had a great deal to deal with in the final few hours, but still managed to broker a deal at the last minute. We managed for the first time to get language on fossil fuels, on the phase down of coal. \u201cThe UAE itself has faced questions going into the Cop [over its own oil and gas expansion plans and more] but actually they had a good first week. But, let\u2019s not kid ourselves that there hasn\u2019t been a big pushback from some vested interests against a fossil fuel phase-out \u2013 we saw that in the letter from Opec. This is the point of the negotiations where the rubber absolutely hits the road and is an opportunity for the presidency to bring countries together and broker an ambitious outcome. \u201cI would say to all the countries who are opposing [a phase-out]: please think about what is at stake. 2023 was the hottest year on record and we\u2019re seeing more frequent and ferocious climate events around the world. Genuinely I believe that we\u2019re in the last-chance saloon to save our children\u2019s futures. \u201cThese countries need to remind themselves that climate change does not recognise borders. What happens in one country happens ultimately everywhere else, including in the fossil fuel-producing countries.\u201d Zambia\u2019s environment minister, Collins Nzovu, speaking on behalf of the African group at Cop28, has called for more fairness in cutting emissions. \u201cAfrica is in support of limiting warming to 1.5C. However, this should be based on differentiated pathways where African countries close the supply gap, rather than developed countries continuing to issue exploration licenses.\u201d He said an outcome on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) was the group\u2019s key demand. \u201cWe will not agree on anything here unless Africa\u2019s top priorities are met, which to us is a GGA framework. If we are serious about saving lives, livelihoods and protecting ecosystems then the GGA framework must have ambitious, time-bound targets with clear means of support for implementation.\u201d Nzovu added that the agreement should recognise \u201cthe full right\u201d for Africa to exploit its natural resources sustainably. \u201cAfrica\u2019s cumulative historical emissions are a paltry 3% of the global total; current emissions from [its] energy and industrialised sector are also an inconsequential 3% for a continent of over 50 countries and 1.5 billion people.\u201d While Cop28 waits for new text, the summit director general, Majid Al Suwaidi, has given a press conference to defend the United Arab Emirates\u2019 presidency. His argument in short: this is the way things were always expected to go, and it\u2019s now up to the nearly 200 countries at the summit to come up with an ambitious agreement, not us. \u201cWe\u2019re facing the most demanding Cop agenda of all time, and what we are seeing right now is everybody working through that agenda. All Cops are challenging, but in this Cop we\u2019re trying to do something that has never been done before. Something historic. We are trying to agree on a comprehensive plan to close the gaps between where the world is and where it needs to be to keep 1.5 degrees within reach.\u201d Al Suwaidi conceded many issues remained open and that \u201clots of parties\u201d felt the text \u201cdidn\u2019t fully address their concerns\u201d. \u201cWe expected that. In fact, we wanted the text to spark conversations. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened. What we have seen since is that the parties have deeply held and deeply split views, especially on the language around fossil fuels. It\u2019s important to be clear on something: the text we released was the starting point for discussions. Again, this is entirely normal for a consensus-based process. \u201cWhen we released it, we knew opinions were polarised. But what we didn\u2019t know was where each country\u2019s red lines were. By releasing our first draft of the text, we got parties to come to us quickly with those red lines. We spent last night talking, taking in that feedback. And that has put us in a position to draft a new text. The text includes all the elements we need for a comprehensive plan to 2030 \u2026 but this is a process of the parties \u2026 and while the presidency can guide, direct and encourage, the level of ambition is for the parties to agree.\u201d The question of fairness is at the heart of the impasse at Cop28, said Mohamed Adow, of the climate thinktank Power Shift Africa. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that Congo &amp; Canada must phase out fossil fuels at the same rate. If we want agreement here we should agree to this,\u201d he posted on X. Adow said rich historic polluters should go first, then middle-income nations such as those in the Gulf, followed by poorer countries. \u201cDeveloped countries want to treat all countries as if they are the same, failing to acknowledge historic responsibility &amp; different capacities as well as the need for proper funding &amp; technology transfer needed to facilitate the transition.\u201d He criticised parts of the text and praised others. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of a historic outcome in Dubai. But only if we see the potential oasis from the Dubai desert.\u201d Governments must start to distinguish between the good subsidies they need to fight the climate crisis and the bad ones that are increasing greenhouse gas emissions, the director general of the World Trade Organization has said. Subsidies and other incentives to burn fossil fuels and encourage poor agricultural practices, amounting to about $1.7tn a year, are distorting world trade and hampering the fight against climate breakdown, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the Guardian. \u201cCan you imagine if we said we are going to repurpose those subsidies into other friendly subsidies, like for research and innovation?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind that kind of subsidy.\u201d She gave the example of clean cooking stoves in the developing world. Instead of subsidising fossil fuels, governments could subsidise clean stoves that use solar power or electricity instead of burning wood. \u201cThese kinds of subsidies, no one would be against,\u201d she said. Developed countries devote more money to fossil fuel subsidies than the poor world, so if they reduced those emissions-increasing subsidies, they could free up cash for the poor world, to pay into climate finance such as the loss and damage fund for poor and vulnerable countries, she said. She also urged countries to bring their trade policy in line with the goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. \u201cCountries need to review the import tariff regimes to make sure they\u2019re not charging less for polluting items and charging more for the green items,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the WTO, we\u2019ve noticed that import tariffs in many countries on renewables are on average higher than tariffs for fossil fuel goods.\u201d For instance, she said, in many countries the tariffs on imports of secondhand petrol or diesel cars are lower than those on hybrid or electric vehicles. \u201cSo you\u2019re disincentivising the very thing that will help you get to net zero,\u201d she said. \u201cTrade is an important and positive force the for the net zero transition,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not being paid attention to as a positive force.\u201d Read the full story: The UK has added its voice to those of countries criticising the draft text released yesterday. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis draft is disappointing and does not go far enough. The UK position is clear \u2013 there must be a phase-out of unabated fossil fuels to meet our climate goals.\u201d The UK, the fourth biggest historical carbon polluter, is among several rich countries continuing to build infrastructure to dig up more oil and gas while it pushes for a phase-out of fossil fuels at climate summits. The International Energy Agency warned in 2021 that there should be no new oil and gas fields in its roadmap to reaching net zero emissions by 2050 \u2013 a key target to prevent the planet from heating by 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures by the end of the century. The spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is working with all parties and will continue to push for an ambitious outcome at Cop28 that keeps 1.5C in reach.\u201d Tuesday morning at Cop28 and we\u2019re back in a waiting game. Heads of delegation met until the early hours, mostly expressing their deep unhappiness with the draft text produced by the summit presidency late Monday afternoon. The scheduled end of the two-week conference has come and gone \u2013 that was 11am local \u2013 and as yet there is no new text to replace the document from yesterday. Anybody who says they know when this will end is guessing. The text released by the Cop president, Sultan Al Jaber, drew ire from multiple directions. Much of the focus has been on paragraph 39, which covers energy and the future of fossil fuels. The good: it references the need to reduce their consumption and production. The bad: what sits around that. The section is basically a dot-point list of things countries \u201ccould\u201d do. Proposed language to phase fossil fuels out or down \u2013 the argument at the heart of so much of the talks \u2013 is gone even as an option. There is instead a repeat of previous year\u2019s wording to rapidly phase down \u201cunabated\u201d coal \u2013 a word choice that leaves open the option of continuing with \u201cabated\u201d coal. Abatement is referenced frequently, but not defined. Oil and gas are not explicitly mentioned at all. Many countries speaking at a session overnight argued the section lacks the urgency and ambition needed to deliver on what the president has called his \u201cnorth star\u201d \u2013 keeping 1.5C of heating within reach. For example, the mention of the consumption and production of fossil fuels says they could be reduced \u201cin a just, orderly and equitable manner so as to achieve net zero by, before, or around 2050 in keeping with the science\u201d. This suggests that fossil fuels could still be being used after 2050 and justified by an unlimited amount of problematic offsets \u2013 which definitely isn\u2019t what the science demands. The section also leans on the inclusion of \u201ccarbon capture, utilisation and storage\u201d \u2013 an underperforming technology that has failed to deliver on a commercial scale despite receiving billions in support. The celebrated goal of tripling global renewable energy and doubling energy efficiency is included, but there is no reference to the financial support needed to help developing countries get there. And this is just the paragraph of the text that has received the most attention. Climate adaptation is the other major challenge \u2013 there is still no clear view on how it will be financed. There are also a range of technical issues that remain unresolved, notably a fraught debate over the regulation of carbon markets, where the US has been accused of trying to force through an agreement with weak rules and lacking in transparency. To state the obvious: there is a long way to go as we drift into overtime. The Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate has said the climate crisis is not some vague, distant threat but something that is already killing people and taking away hope from communities. \u201cA lot has been said about the text,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I will say is that what is happening here is unacceptable. What is happening is unjust. What is happening is unfair, especially for the communities on the front line. If we do not address the root cause of the climate crisis, everything else is pointless.\u201d While many countries are speaking out about yesterday\u2019s draft text, some are saying silent. Saudi Arabia is among those who have not commented publicly so far. The Guardian visited the kingdom\u2019s offices on Tuesday morning, which are spread across two buildings at Cop28. Nobody was available to speak to the media and it is understood that the Saudi delegation was up late, like many others. We will keep trying to get their reaction today. India, too, seems not yet to have commented. Once upon a time, 12 long days ago, we were celebrating the establishment of the loss and damage fund \u2013 a historic agreement that has so far generated almost $800m in pledges. But experts warned that the job was far from done, and that key issues needed to be addressed in the global stocktake to facilitate the fund\u2019s future success. Alas, the draft text failed to deliver on a number of fronts, according to loss and damage followers, including: Scale: there is no mention of how much money is required to cover the costs of irreversible loss and damage, which already stand at about $400bn a year \u2013 developing countries pushed for a floor of $100bn a year but didn\u2019t even get that. Siloed: Loss and damage is missing from the preamble, finance, cross-cutting and way forward sections; the specific agenda item is also gone. Instead, loss and damage is relegated to its own silo or section, with no recognition of the links between mitigation, adaptation, finance more broadly and loss and damage. Responsibility: Developed countries should be funding loss and damage but the language is wishy-washy and only \u201curges\u201d them to provide support Missing data: A loss and damage gap report is vital so that there is broad and agreed understanding of what funding is required \u2013 but that\u2019s been watered down to a synthesis report based on national assessments. Julie-Anne Richards, of the Loss and Damage Collaboration, said: \u201cThe presidency and developed countries clearly think they have ticked the loss and damage box at this Cop \u2026 but initial pledges are very, very low compared to need, with no clear way forward. It is vital to ensure that loss and damage is well reflected in the final global stocktake \u2026 to provide an assessment of how loss and damage is impacting communities and countries on the frontline, reflect the scale of needs and set a clear expectation that the fund will be capitalised and replenished to meet this need.\u201d Yamide Dagnet, director of climate justice at Open Society Foundation, said: \u201cLoss and damage should be in the GST preamble, and linked to 1.5C, adaptation, and finance, but this interconnectedness is currently missing. Developing countries pushed for a floor but developed countries didn\u2019t want it, and there is no reference to scale which is worrying. Access for frontline communities and countries is very important and should also be clearer.\u201d Climate campaigners are among the first to speak at Cop28 this morning. Outside the plenary where talks are being held, they have been carrying signs telling governments to \u201chold the line\u201d. Harjeet Singh, Climate Action Network International\u2019s (CAN) head of global political strategy, has been giving his thoughts already this morning. Romain Ioualalen, Oil Change International policy campaigner, a must follow on Twitter, said: \u201cThe draft that we saw does not reflect science, it does not reflect the demands from the climate movement for a fully funded phase-out of fossil fuels, it doesn\u2019t even reflect the vast majority of parties in this process. The success of this Cop will be judged on the fully funded phase-out of fossil fuels. That\u2019s the test if we want to maintain a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C.\u201d Rachel Cleetus, the lead economist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said to applause: \u201cThe good news is that we all agree this text is shit.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix it. We know what the science says. The era of fossil fuels has to end, starting now. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that we are running out of time at this Cop. It\u2019s worth going into overtime to get this done. It\u2019s really critical that we secure a fast, fair, funded phase-out of fossil fuels. You have to have words that live up to the science.\u201d Joseph Sikulu, of Pacific Climate Warriors, broke down in tears as he spoke. \u201cWe saw the disappointment that came out last night. The minister from the Marshall Islands said it best: we didn\u2019t come here to sign our death sentence. In its current state, it does just that. \u201cThe system is broken but we continue to come because there is no other process to us that allows us to fight for our futures. At Paris, we fought for our lives for 1.5C, only to slowly see it falling from our grasp.\u201d It is sometimes easy to forget that the words over which delegates are fighting lead to real-life damages. Dr Jeni Miller, the executive director of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said the most recent draft of the Cop28 text would be \u201cdisastrous for people\u2019s health\u201d and represents a major step backwards at a time when we urgently need to be accelerating action. \u201cSmall islands states have rightly called this text a death sentence,\u201d she said. \u201cThe lack of any actual commitment to phase out fossil fuels leaves us on a trajectory to spiralling climate impacts on health that will exceed the limits of our health systems\u2019 and communities\u2019 abilities to adapt. And it will continue to expose people all over the world to the myriad health impacts of fossil fuels even beyond their role in climate change, such as the over 5 million deaths per year from air pollution alone.\u201d Some countries were slower than others to give their reaction to the draft text last night. Pacific Island states were quick to voice their opposition while others waited for a few hours. Late in the evening, Brazil and Canada joined those giving it a thumbs down. Marina Silva, Brazil\u2019s environment minister, told the media that the language on fossil fuels was not sufficient, but said they were happy with the wording on forests. \u201cFor us, it is completely unsatisfactory with regard to the issue of fossil fuels. The language is not appropriate. There are many things that are insufficient. One of these is the lack of effort towards phasing out, elimination. Not just reducing emissions. We need better clarity with regard to this balance between developed and developed countries. There is a lack of clarity \u2026 We need a path so our economies are no longer reliant on fossil fuels,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a text that says it has the ambition to align with 1.5C but we don\u2019t have the clarity and the equivalence with regard to the issue of energy. It is important that both things are adequately aligned. We will work within the limits and deadlines that are not easy. Our chief negotiator is here ready to have a lot of coffee so we can advance in talks,\u201d said Silva. Canada\u2019s environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, also said it was not enough. Yesterday, they released a joint declaration with the US on climate change. Officially, Cop28 wraps up at 11am local time, which is in half an hour. There is no chance of that happening. Expo City is a ghost town this morning. The long queues, packed metro carriages and lengthy security checks are over. The venue will soon start closing up after hosting the largest climate summit in history. A few people are wandering around the site in the morning haze, but most delegates are likely still in bed, exhausted after negotiations went on into the early hours. What should we expect today? Once ministers and their teams are out of bed, attention will turn to another draft of the text that the UAE presidency is preparing right now, although we might be waiting until the afternoon for it. Once published, we will see the same burst of reaction from delegates to the draft, and negotiations are likely to become increasingly fraught. Yesterday saw strong opposition from the Pacific states, the EU and many others over the failure of the text to include language on phasing out of fossil fuels, something that is crucial for keeping 1.5C alive. Cedric Schuster, of Samoa, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: \u201cWe will not sign our death certificate. We cannot sign on to text that does not have strong commitments on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d There are fears that countries like Saudi Arabia and other petrostates could seek to weaken the language further on fossil fuels. If you want to catch up on where we are, yesterday\u2019s wrap with my colleagues Fiona Harvey, Nina Lakhani, Adam Morton and Damian Carrington is a good place to start. So what happened yesterday? A quick summary: The new draft text released by Cop28 presidency omits reference to a \u201cphase-out\u201d of fossil fuels. Small island states have complained their voices are not being heard. Most civil society groups have condemned the text as inadequate. Azerbaijan and Brazil have formally been approved as hosts of Cop29 and Cop30. Saudi Arabia has been accused of holding the talks hostage. The UN secretary general has urged delegates to \u201dend the fossil fuel age\u201d. One of the attenders got on stage during one event with a sign to protest against fossil fuels. Good morning! This is Ajit Niranjan, on the eleventh day (if we don\u2019t count Thursday\u2019s rest day) of the 28th Conference of the Parties climate change summit, or Cop28. The Guardian will be liveblogging the negotiations throughout, as always, and we look forward to your contributions: please email me on ajit.niranjan@theguardian.com with thoughts and suggestions. Bibi van der Zee (bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com) will be taking over later on. Yesterday involved a lot of waiting around, but the draft text finally landed in the afternoon and there has been heated debate and reaction to it. Today will be the last day \u2013 in theory. In reality, most Cops overrun and it will be no surprise if this one does too. Stay with us for all the updates."

            "title": "Changing climate casts a shadow over the future of the Panama Canal \u2013 and global trade",
            "date": "2023-12-22T01:01:41Z",
            "content": "From his office perched on the edge of the Pacific Ocean, Steven Paton looks over the entrance to the Panama Canal; the high rises of the country\u2019s capital resting upon the horizon behind him, and an increasingly long queue of tankers lining up in the bay. For 33 years his job with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute monitoring the region\u2019s climate has given him a front-row seat to how the weather\u2019s familiar patterns have changed, upending axioms of old and calling into question the future viability of one of the most important trade routes in the world. Over the last year, as the region has suffered through what Paton calls a \u201crainfall deficit\u201d, passage through the Panama Canal has slowed and the queue of tankers waiting in the bay to pass through it has grown. Now, with warnings that the situation is set to get much worse, experts say that the effects of a restricted Panama Canal could be felt all over the world. Connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, the canal revolutionised global shipping when it opened in 1914, eliminating the need to travel around the dangerous southern tip of South America, shortening the trip by more than 13,000km. In 2022, more than 14,000 ships traversed the canal, transporting fuel, grain, minerals and goods from the factories of east Asia to the consumers of New York and beyond. More than 40% of consumer goods traded between north-east Asia and the US east coast are transported through the canal. To make the journey, ships \u2013 some up to 350 metres long \u2013 enter through a narrow waterway and rise more than 26 metres above sea level into the man-made Lake Gatun through a series of locks. On the other side of the canal, the process is reversed and the ships descend to sea level through another series of locks before exiting the canal on the other side of the continent. The locking system relies on fresh water from Lake Gatun and another nearby reservoir to function. Every ship that passes through the canal uses 200m litres of water most of which then flows out into the sea. The same sources also provide water for more than half of Panama\u2019s 4.3 million inhabitants, forcing administrators to balance the demands of international shipping with the needs of the locals. For decades, this has rarely been a problem. Panama is one of the wettest countries in the world and the canal and its surrounding lakes have been blessed with an abundance of water. However, in 2023 a rainfall deficit, exacerbated by the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, led to the water levels in Lake Gatun dropping. The twin demands of the canal and the local population have left the lake facing a water deficit of 3bn litres a day. Lake Gatun\u2019s water level is now close to the lowest point ever recorded during a rainy season, forcing the Panama Canal authority who manages the waterway to restrict the number of vessels passing through. *** In normal times, the Panama Canal has capacity to handle 36 ships a day. But as water has grown scarcer, the canal authority has reduced that number to 22. By February, it will be just 18. The impact on shipping has never been \u201cso severe\u201d, says Nitin Chopra, a former tanker captain who is now senior marine risk consultant at Allianz Commercial Asia. Those who rely on the route are left with no good options; they can wait up to weeks at a time to be allowed through the canal, pay up to $4m to jump ahead in the queue \u2013 or do what many shipping companies have been forced to and avoid the route entirely, adding days or weeks to their journey. Every one of these choices comes at a serious financial cost to traders and some operators have warned that due to the delay, some goods that are transported from China may not be available to Christmas shoppers on the US east coast. With attacks on the world\u2019s busiest trade route in the Red Sea leading many companies to avoid the Suez Canal altogether, restrictions at the Panama Canal will only pile more pressure on global supply chains \u2013 just as governments around the world attempt to tame inflation. \u201cIn the long run we\u2019re looking at a big increase in the cost of commodities \u2013 it will be passed on to the consumer,\u201d says Chopra. And the risks to traders are not just financial. As the number of vessels waiting at the entrances to the canal grows, shipping experts are warning that the danger of a serious accident occurring is growing. \u201cSome boats will wait for up to two weeks, anchored at sea on both sides of the canal and they\u2019re running out of space,\u201d says Chopra. \u201cIt\u2019s causing problems with vessels not being able to find a safe spot for anchoring.\u201d A tanker captain who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said that the anchorage at the entrances to the canal has been too crowded and that he had seen \u201ca lot of near misses\u201d. Another captain of a tanker carrying natural gas said that as the traffic has increased, some ships have been forced to wait at anchor for up to 25 days, in conditions that leave them in close proximity to other vessels. \u201cVessels are colliding,\u201d says Chopra. \u201cIf we experience any extreme weather, there could be a lot of consequential effects.\u201d *** As bad as the situation is at the Panama Canal, experts say the conditions are likely to only get worse next year. \u201cThe expectation is that March to April next year could be the lowest level for Lake Gatun \u2026 on record\u201d, says Steven Paton. \u201cPanama\u2019s dry season usually begins earlier than normal during major El Ni\u00f1o events so we\u2019ll get the double whammy. We\u2019ll come in with a deficit and then lose the rainfall earlier.\u201d The Panama Canal authority has said this prediction matches up with its own forecasts and that it might consider further restrictions on vessels. Despite falling in the middle of its rainy season, October this year was the driest since 1950, with 41% less rainfall than usual, according to the authority. \u201cThe Canal and the country face the challenge of the upcoming dry season with a minimum water reserve that must guarantee supply for more than 50% of the population and, at the same time, maintain the [canal] operations,\u201d the authority said in October. The question for the canal\u2019s authority, global traders and the millions who rely on Lake Gatun\u2019s reserves is whether the current water shortage is a one-off blip caused by El Ni\u00f1o, or a harbinger of the worst of what the changing climate could portend. Armed with over a century of rainfall data, it\u2019s a question that Paton is almost uniquely equipped to answer. \u201cI certainly am beginning to believe that the patterns we\u2019ve come to know in the last 30 years are no longer a useful guide in helping us predict the future,\u201d he says. \u201cHistorically there has been a [rainfall] shortage on average once every 20 years due to major El Ni\u00f1o events. In the last 26 years this is the third major rainfall deficit. So it seems that something is changing our rainfall patterns.\u201d But Paton cautions against ascribing the changing patterns completely to the climate crisis. \u201cThe increase in frequency is consistent with climate change models,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the climate change models have not come out saying for sure.\u201d However, statistically what is going on now \u201chas no analogue in the previous 100 years of data,\u201d he adds. *** Paton says that if the trend of \u201cbig rainfall deficits continues, it will become increasingly more difficult for the canal to operate at its usual capacity\u201d. The canal authority says it is \u201cimplementing operational and planning procedures, innovative technologies, and long-term investments to mitigate [the] impact and safeguard [the canal\u2019s] operation\u201d. It says that the current situation is unprecedented and it \u201ccould not have predicted exactly when the water shortage would occur to the degree that we are experiencing now\u201d. But while the authority says it could not have predicted the crisis, others did. For years, experts have warned that the changing climate will have far-reaching effects on global supply chains and the systems that govern them. Structures like the Panama Canal are miracles of the modern world \u2013 solid totems of engineering wonder that were responsible for accelerating the economic boom of the 20th century, pulling up living standards across the globe and ushering in a revolution in technology, healthcare and consumer culture. The tacit implication was that the natural world had been tamed. But as the seas rise and temperatures soar, those assumptions are falling like dominoes."

            "date": "2023-12-05T15:00:43Z",
            "content": "When Greta Thunberg posted a photo of herself holding a \u201cstand with Gaza\u201d sign on Instagram in October, the backlash in Israel and Germany came hard and fast. An Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson initially told Politico that \u201cwhoever identifies with Greta in any way in the future, in my view, is a terror supporter,\u201d although later retracted his comments. The official X account of Israel said \u201cHamas doesn\u2019t use sustainable materials for their rockets\u201d and told Thunberg to speak up for its victims. The Israeli education ministry said it would strike any reference to the Swedish climate activist from its curriculum. In Germany, politicians and pundits across the political spectrum demanded that the national branch of Fridays for Future, the student protest movement that Thunberg started in 2018, distance itself from her views. The group put out a statement underlining its support for Israel\u2019s right to exist and, in the weeks that followed, explicitly distanced itself from social media posts made by the international group. Germany\u2019s leading news magazine Der Spiegel ran a lengthy article with personal comments on Thunberg\u2019s childhood character and appearance under the headline: \u201cHas Greta Thunberg betrayed the climate movement?\u201d The violence in Israel and Gaza since 7 October has become an unexpected flashpoint for climate activists in rich countries. As world leaders meet for the Cop28 summit in Dubai, the loose collection of movements, many of which have built their support around inclusivity and global justice, are divided on whether or how to take a stand on the conflict. Positions taken have led to splits within groups and between them. \u201cThe national debates are less about the conflict itself,\u201d said Stefan Aykut, director of the Center for Sustainable Society Research (CSS) at the University of Hamburg. \u201cInstead, they are immediately captured by the dominant cultural prism within each society.\u201d The legacy of the Holocaust carried out by the Nazis is central to Germany\u2019s postwar identity, and in recent years has been used to argue that Israel\u2019s security is fundamentally tied to the German state today. Environmental groups in Germany have expressed solidarity with Israel during the current conflict, as well as sympathy for Palestinian suffering, whereas in the UK and US activists have criticised Israel with stronger language \u2013 describing its bombing of Gaza as a \u201cgenocide\u201d, which Israel rejects \u2013 and pushed their governments to call for a permanent ceasefire. For environmental groups far from the fighting, the pressure to take a position has grown even stronger as racism against Jews and Muslims has soared across the US and Europe. It has also raised the stakes of striking the wrong tone. Part of the backlash generated by Thunberg\u2019s post came from a blue octopus toy visible in the corner of the picture. The toy is an emblem of neurodiversity, popular with people with autism as a way to express feelings, that also resembles a symbol used in racist propaganda to falsely claim Jews control the world. Thunberg, who has a form of autism, said she was unaware of the link, and replaced the photo with one that left out the toy. Thunberg was also criticised for her failure to condemn Hamas or support its victims in the same post in which she spoke out against Israel. Sharona Shnayder, a Nigerian-Israeli climate activist who lost friends in the Hamas terror attack at a music festival near Israel\u2019s border with Gaza, said: \u201cShe didn\u2019t even bother to mention it until people called her out. It hurt on a level that I don\u2019t think you can describe.\u201d Shnayder, who founded a litter picking movement called Tuesdays for Trash, and was herself inspired by Thunberg, said the lack of compassion towards Israeli victims of the war in global discourse has alienated local activists. \u201cI talk about trash a lot. I talk about waste management. In that moment, I really felt: \u2018Wow, maybe I have no value in this world.\u2019\u201d Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October and took more than 200 hostages, according to the Israeli government. Since then, Israel has killed more than 15,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza, and starved more than 2 million Gazans of food, water, fuel and medical care. While Fridays for Future did not respond to a request for comment on this article, FFF Sweden including Thunberg wrote a piece in the Guardian on Tuesday clarifying their stance, saying: \u201cContrary to what many have claimed, Fridays for Future has not \u2018been radicalised\u2019 or \u2018become politica\u2019. We have always been political, because we have always been a movement for justice.\u201d The German branch has said it stands in solidarity with the victims of Hamas\u2019 violence and with Jews across the world, while also \u201cseeing\u201d the suffering of Gazans and being \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d by the rising anti-Muslim racism in Germany. \u201cNone of these are contradictions,\u201d it said. \u201cOur hearts are big enough to feel all of this at the same time.\u201d A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cThere is no room for compromise when it comes to the protection of Jewish lives and Israel\u2019s right to exist. We are horrified by the suffering experienced by innocent lives and stand in solidarity with civilians both in Israel and Gaza.\u201d Germany has become an outlier among rich democracies in the breadth of its political and media support for Israel\u2019s response. \u201cGermany is a special case when it comes to those politics,\u201d said Oscar Berglund, a climate activism researcher at the university of Bristol. Faced with a death toll that started high and has risen rapidly, other climate advocacy groups have condemned the killing of civilians on both sides without naming the actors involved. Namrata Chowdhary, head of public engagement at campaign group 350.org, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very deliberate about taking a slower, more cautious approach, and speaking where it seems appropriate for us to do so in solidarity.\u201d The group has called for a ceasefire and respect for international humanitarian law. \u201cWe recognise that there can be no climate justice without peace, and in calling for peace we\u2019re being very clear about peace on both sides.\u201d Greenpeace made similar demands: \u201cTargeting of civilians is a war crime, no matter who does it.\u201d The unfolding horrors \u2013 and how to respond to them as a movement \u2013 have been a focus at Cop28 this past week. While two large environmental justice coalitions, \u2013 the Palestinian Environmental NGOs network (Pengon) and La Via Campesina, an international movement representing millions of peasants, landless workers, farmers, Indigenous people, pastoralists, and migrant farmworkers \u2013 have boycotted the summit, others have used it as an opportunity to put a spotlight on the conflict. On Thursday, the first day of the summit, the UNFCCC, the United Nations body overseeing the conference, cut off a livestream to the event as Asad Rehman, director of the UK-based organisation War on Want and founder of the global campaign to demand climate justice, called for a permanent ceasefire. All protests have to be pre-approved by the UNFCCC and no countries or companies are allowed to be mentioned. \u201cThe Palestinian struggle is woven into every struggle for justice including climate justice,\u201d Rehman said. \u201cWe want a free Palestine.\u201d Tasneem Essop, an anti-apartheid campaigner from South Africa and director of the Climate Action Network, the world\u2019s largest coalition of 1,900 climate action groups, said: \u201cThe unfolding genocide in Gaza may not affect the negotiations directly, but will play into the growing divide and mistrust between the global south and the global north.\u201d Many climate justice groups in the UK have swung behind the Palestinian cause. Friends of the Earth UK became one of the earliest, explicitly stating it stood in solidarity with its Palestinian sister organisation \u201cin its longstanding opposition to the occupation\u201d of Palestinian lands. In a statement on its website, Extinction Rebellion described \u201cthe collective punishment being imposed on innocent civilians in Gaza\u201d as a \u201cwar crime\u201d. The organisation declined to comment for this article, but XR groups have taken autonomous actions. On 11 November, the date of a contentious Palestine solidarity march and counter-protest that coincided with the UK\u2019s Remembrance Day, XR Parents placed hundreds of children\u2019s shoes on the steps of Trafalgar Square in London and read out the names of the 4,100 Palestinian and 26 Israeli children who had already then been killed. Robin Wells, director of Fossil Free London, said her group had mobilised support for three of the big solidarity marches in London, as well as staging their own, smaller protests outside the energy companies BP and Ithaca for their roles in extracting gas from Israeli-controlled fields in the eastern Mediterranean contested by the Palestinians. But even beyond the moral question of what position to take, climate activists have also been divided on the strategic value of championing causes that go beyond fossil fuels. For some, the shift in focus has been an unwelcome distraction. At a recent protest in Amsterdam where Thunberg spoke alongside Afghan and Palestinian women, a man stood up on stage and snatched the microphone from her hands. \u201cI came for a climate protest, not a political point of view,\u201d he said. Some climate advocacy groups have chosen not to comment on the war, with one adding that they had not expressed a position on previous conflicts. Others have argued that climate and social justice are too tightly linked to ignore extreme violence. A spokesperson for Greenpeace said: \u201cWe see a strategic benefit and a moral imperative. Environmental issues are hardly ever \u2018just\u2019 environmental issues. Many of the crises we face are interconnected, whether it\u2019s social inequalities fuelling the climate crisis or climate impacts driving up food prices and propelling social injustices.\u201d Berglund said an issue that some environment movements have faced is their lack of explicit political values or goals. \u201cIt was never tenable in the long run to have a depoliticised climate movement,\u201d he said. Activists are also having to reckon with the risk of striking the wrong tone and losing support from the people and politicians they are trying to reach. At the CSS in Hamburg, Aykut said that even though the climate movement is global, its impact was \u201cfirst and foremost\u201d in the countries with the greatest power over emissions. \u201cIt is not only about rallying minorities, but also about persuading the wider public,\u201d said Aykut. \u201cIntersectionality is obviously crucial for the climate movement but it is not a simple maths problem where you can add more and more different groups until you get a majority. Every time you include a new faction and address their concerns, there is the risk of alienating another part of the movement.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-05T05:00:35Z",
            "content": "Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels reached record levels again in 2023, as experts warned that the projected rate of warming had not improved over the past two years. The world is on track to have burned more coal, oil and gas in 2023 than it did in 2022, according to a report by the Global Carbon Project, pumping 1.1% more planet-heating carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at a time when emissions must plummet to stop extreme weather from growing more violent. The finding comes as world leaders meet in Dubai for the fraught Cop28 climate summit. In a separate report published on Tuesday, Climate Action Tracker (CAT) raised its projections slightly for future warming above the estimates it made at a conference in Glasgow two years ago. \u201cTwo years after Glasgow, our report is virtually the same,\u201d said Claire Stockwell, an analyst at Climate Analytics and lead author of the CAT report. \u201cYou would think the extreme events around the world would be sparking action but governments appear oblivious, somehow thinking treading water will deal with the flood of impacts.\u201d As carbon clogs the atmosphere, trapping sunlight and baking the planet, the climate is growing more hostile to human life. The growth in CO2 emissions had slowed substantially over the past decade, the Global Carbon Project found, but the amount emitted each year had continued to rise. It projected that total CO2 emissions in 2023 would reach a record high of 40.9 gigatons. If the world continued to emit CO2 at that rate, the international team of more than 120 scientists found, it would burn through the remaining carbon budget for a half-chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures in just seven years. In 15 years, the scientists estimated, the budget for 1.7C would be gone too. The researchers reported big regional differences in emissions. They expected fossil fuel emissions to have risen this year in India and China, the biggest and third-biggest polluters, and to have fallen in the US and the EU, the two biggest historical polluters. The average of the rest of the world\u2019s emissions was expected to have fallen slightly too. Emissions from deforestation and other land-use changes were also projected to have fallen slightly, though not by enough for current levels of tree-planting to make up for it, the researchers found. For the first time, the scientists also teased out the growth in emissions from flights and ships abroad. The two together were expected to have grown 11.9%, driven by soaring emissions from aviation. Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter\u2019s Global Systems Institute and lead author of the study, said: \u201cThe impacts of climate change are evident all around us but action to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels remains painfully slow. \u201cIt now looks inevitable that we will overshoot the 1.5C target of the Paris agreement, and leaders meeting at Cop28 will have to agree rapid cuts in fossil fuel emissions even to keep the 2C target alive.\u201d On Saturday, more than 117 governments at the summit in Dubai agreed to triple the world\u2019s renewable energy capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. Some leaders have also backed efforts to phase out fossil fuels, though only a handful have expressed support for a non-proliferation treaty. Governments were happy to promote clean energy but had done little to penalise fossil fuels, said Glen Peters, a research director at the climate research institute Cicero, who co-wrote the report. \u201cIt is simply not enough to support clean energy. Policies are also needed to drive fossil fuels out of the energy system,\u201d he added. The report also found that technology to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere would have done almost nothing to stop global heating this year. Current levels of technology-based removal \u2013 which does not include carbon absorbed by trees \u2013 are more than 1m times smaller than current fossil CO2 emissions, the researchers found. Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, a research professor at the University of East Anglia\u2019s School of Environmental Sciences, said: \u201cAll countries need to decarbonise their economies faster than they are at present to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.\u201d"

            "title": "Do electric cars really produce fewer carbon emissions than petrol or diesel vehicles?",
            "date": "2023-12-23T10:00:22Z",
            "content": "There is a spectre haunting electric cars: the question of greenwashing. What if, for all the green hopes attached to zero-emissions cars, the truth is that they fail to achieve their main goal of cutting world-heating carbon emissions? Our EV mythbusters series has looked at some of the most persistent criticisms of electric cars, ranging from car fires to battery mining, range anxiety to cost concerns. This article asks: do electric cars really produce fewer carbon emissions than petrol or diesel? The claim In the US, the Florida senator Rick Scott said there was \u201cample evidence to suggest that EVs are not as clean as people are being led to believe and folks deserve to know the truth\u201d. He and other Republican colleagues introduced the (suggestively named) \u201cDirecting Independent Research To Yield Carbon Assessment Regarding Electric Vehicles (DIRT Y CAR EV) Act\u201d, which tried to call for analysis of the carbon footprint of vehicles. A recent article in the UK\u2019s Daily Mail reported that \u201cthe environmental benefit of electric cars may never be felt\u201d because many electric vehicles \u201cwill never hit their mileage target as owners upgrade to newer models, leaving swathes of used electric cars sitting unwanted on garage forecourts\u201d. But it is not only the rightwing press. In June, the Guardian published an article by the actor Rowan Atkinson in which he said he felt \u201cduped\u201d by EVs\u2019 carbon claims and that the reality was \u201cvery different\u201d, citing Volvo research suggesting greenhouse gas emissions during production of an electric car are almost 70% higher than when manufacturing a petrol one. \u201cIt seems a perverse choice of hardware with which to lead the automobile\u2019s fight against the climate crisis,\u201d Atkinson wrote. The science Any assessment of carbon emissions associated with a product needs to look at its whole life cycle, from manufacture to scrapping (and, hopefully, recycling). Many claims about electric cars\u2019 supposedly worse environmental toll focus on manufacturing and ignore the actual use of the cars. The grain of truth in the criticism is that EVs do indeed take significantly more energy to manufacture. Battery production requires large amounts of electricity to heat ovens to bake electrode materials, and to charge and discharge the battery to prepare it for use. While electricity can be produced with zero emissions, most countries still burn carbon-heavy fossil fuels to turn generators. Analysis by the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, cited by the US Environmental Protection Agency, suggests that manufacturing battery cars produces about 60% more carbon emissions than their fossil fuel cousins. That means that electric cars start with a big carbon disadvantage, sometimes described as a \u201ccarbon debt\u201d. However, Eoin Devane, a senior analyst for surface transport at the Climate Change Committee, the UK government\u2019s climate science adviser, said: \u201cIf you look at the data, that \u2018carbon debt\u2019 is paid off within about two years of driving the vehicle.\u201d The vast majority of fossil fuel cars\u2019 carbon footprint comes in use, when exhaust pipes constantly spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E), a campaign group, calculates that a new petrol car will produce about 27 tonnes if driven for 100,000 kilometres (62,000 miles), and 49 tonnes over 200,000km. Electric cars, by contrast, use less energy and can charge from zero-carbon sources. Just how much greener electric cars can be in operation depends on how much renewable electricity is used in local grids. Transport &amp; Environment has a handy online calculator that allows you to play with the grid, choosing between different countries\u2019 energy mixes and whether the battery was made in carbon-heavy China or greener Sweden. Where the lines cross indicates how many miles are needed for a battery car to win on carbon emissions. Lucien Mathieu, T&amp;E\u2019s cars director, said that even if you choose a worst-case scenario \u2013 vehicles made and driven with electricity largely from coal \u2013 the electric car will win out after about 70,000km (about six years of driving). \u201cThe more you drive an electric car, the better it gets,\u201d he said. The picture for electric cars will improve as power from the wind and the sun replaces gas and oil, reducing carbon emissions from generating electricity. Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: \u201cEven if you have a really dirty grid, EVs are still better for the environment. That will keep going as the grid gets cleaner and cleaner.\u201d We also need to take into account the future of the technologies. Auke Hoekstra, an energy transition researcher at the Eindhoven University of Technology, said emissions from fossil fuel cars cannot fall much further, meaning they are not a viable technology for a zero-emissions world. Yet battery development is still in relative infancy, and is likely to tip the balance further in favour of electric cars. Batteries are \u201ca good endgame solution\u201d for the transition to net zero, Hoekstra said. \u201cThe gasoline engine is basically going nowhere.\u201d Any caveats? Batteries are not the only way to get cars to net zero. You can fill them with \u201ce-fuels\u201d \u2013 petrol made with carbon from the air, hydrogen from water, and green electricity. That technology works and will probably be used to power classic cars long into the future. Other people advocate using the hydrogen in fuel cells to run a motor. However, in either case the energy efficiency is drastically lower than using that electricity directly, and the fuel is likely to be needed for planes, which are much harder to decarbonise. And there was an important point in Atkinson\u2019s Guardian article: replacing an old, little-used car with a brand new electric car may not make sense because of the \u201ccarbon debt\u201d. \u201cIf the vehicle is not being regularly used there is certainly a case to wait until the point you\u2019re going to replace it anyway,\u201d said the CCC\u2019s Devane. However, he and others cautioned that any calculation of relative carbon savings for individuals would be complicated. And, Hoekstra added, \u201cnot having an electric car is better for the environment\u201d if you can rely on public transport instead. The verdict The scientific consensus is overwhelming: on any realistic like-for-like comparison a battery car will be cleaner than its petrol or diesel equivalent. Burning fossil fuels to make and drive electric cars will still cause emissions, but at a lower level than inefficient fossil fuel engines. That is true of today\u2019s grid (in richer economies, at least) but in tomorrow\u2019s grid the benefits will grow as long as countries continue to shift away from coal and gas to generate electricity. Putting batteries in cars so far appears to be the only practical way to shift the tens of millions of light vehicles sold every year towards net zero emissions."

            "content": "We will wrap up the blog here this Friday evening. Here\u2019s what made the news today: Steven Miles has announced there will be five new \u201cyounger\u201d, \u201cenergetic\u201d ministers in his first cabinet, ahead of his swearing in as Queensland premier. The new Queensland premier has announced announced a more ambitious emission reduction target of 75% by 2035. Barry Humphries has been remembered as an \u201cinterstellar\u201d talent by everyone from royalty to giants of the entertainment industry at a state memorial service at the Sydney Opera House. After a seven-year search fighting answers about the cause of his daughter\u2019s death in Mozambique, Elly Warren\u2019s father says he feels \u201clet down\u201d after a Victorian coroner was unable to conclude that she was murdered. The New South Wales police watchdog is investigating after a senior officer was charged with allegedly crashing a work car while drunk in the NorthConnex tunnel earlier this year. Two abuse survivors have won the first major challenge to the Catholic church\u2019s use of permanent stays since a high court decision in October. The immigration minister, Andrew Giles, has quietly lifted the ankle bracelet and curfew conditions from at least two of the three people released from detention who are challenging tough new visa rules in the high court. Thanks very much for your company today. Stick with us for updates this evening and we\u2019ll be back with the live blog tomorrow too. Andrew Forrest welcomes Queensland\u2019s new emissions reduction targets The founder and chairman of Fortescue, Andrew Forrest, has welcomed the Queensland government\u2019s more ambitious emission reduction target of 75% by 2035. Here\u2019s a statement Forest sent to Guardian Australia: We congratulate Premier Miles on his appointment, and for taking such a strong step forward for Queensland today. A green energy future will spur on economic growth and create thousands of new jobs and opportunities for Queenslanders, many more than the fossil fuel sector. It will also help to create energy security for Queensland and, over time, help to lower power prices. We stand ready to deliver projects for Queenslanders, helping build Queensland in the process of turning it greener. Australia urged to act on \u2018shadow\u2019 China online network Australia is being urged to declassify information where it can about social-media influence operations, in response to a \u201cshadow\u201d network using artificial intelligence to push pro-China content, AAP reports. A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has found a coordinated influence campaign, which began on YouTube, is seeking to impact how English-speaking people view the roles of China and the US in international relations, the global economy and technology competition. The campaign, dubbed \u201cshadow play\u201d, uses AI to generate voiceovers as a tactic to grow its reach. It involves a network of at least 30 YouTube channels that have produced more than 4,500 videos, garnering almost 120m views and 730,000 subscribers since last year. Firies \u2018mop up\u2019 in Hunter ahead of forecast hot weather NSW fire crews have been working to reduce the threat of a Hunter region bushfire that endangered residents, before the forecast return of severe conditions in the area, AAP reports. The 754-hectare Cessnock Rd Fire burning at Abermain, Kurri Kurri, South Weston and Pelaw was at advice level on Friday afternoon after being downgraded from emergency level on Thursday. The fire, which formed when three separate blazes combined, has destroyed at least two houses and one business in the area, the ABC reports. A NSW Rural Fire Service spokesperson was not able to confirm the report. The spokesperon said crews had worked on Friday to contain several fires around the state, including the Cessnock Road blaze where backburning continued: That\u2019s just to try to burn that out ahead of tomorrow. Minns says anti-protest laws aimed at \u2018protecting people\u2019 and suggests police \u2018can work with\u2019 parts of law that were not struck down NSW premier Chris Minns says his government is reviewing the supreme court\u2019s ruling that parts of the state\u2019s anti-protest laws are invalid because they infringe on the implied freedom of political communication. The initial advice I\u2019ve got is that police can work with the existing provisions that were not struck down by the supreme court. Minns said the changes to the law were aimed at protecting people: People were doing frankly stupid things, putting themselves in extreme danger to make what they termed political protests, hanging from cranes that were located on top of railway lines, chaining themselves to roads with heavy vehicles operating in the vicinity. It would only take a split second for a worker not to see a protester lying on the ground, for example, to see a tragedy take place. \u2018Real, growing risk\u2019 of power generation falling short Urgent investment is needed to support new sources of affordable electricity in the coming decade, when 90% of coal-fired generation will cease, AAP reports. The latest modelling, released by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) on Friday, shows coal power plants are closing earlier than planned and people are electrifying their homes at a faster rate. Upgraded power systems will be capable of running at times entirely on renewable energy, according to system planning that also relies on an ongoing role for gas. But businesses and industry are expected to need more energy, not less, as they double their grid electricity consumption. The possibility that replacement generation is not available when coal plants retire is \u201creal and growing, and a risk that must be avoided,\u201d the Aemo report said. US ambassador: \u2018We have no closer or more important ally than Australia\u2019 The US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy, has issued a statement after the congress passed legislation allowing the country to sell Virginia class submarines to Australia under the Aukus security pact: Yesterday, the United States reaffirmed that we have no closer or more important ally than Australia. In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the US Congress approved the unprecedented transfer of our most advanced submarines and defence capabilities to Australia\u2014 and I know President Biden looks forward to signing the bill into law. From the Aukus announcement in March, the climate compact in May, and the state visit in October, this has been a historic year for the US/Australia alliance, and I can\u2019t think of a better way to top it off. Kaurna ancestors formally laid to rest after remaining in a SA museum for nearly a century Kaurna ancestors \u2013 whose remains were at the South Australian museum for almost a century after their suburban burial sites were disturbed - were reburied this week. It was the third ceremony of its kind at Wangayarta, a Kaura memorial park. Kaurna Yerta Aboriginal Corporation\u2019s chair, Tim Agius, said: Prior to today, our ancestors have been resting in shelves in the museum for almost 100 years. In that time, ancestors were also sent overseas for scientific research \u2013 this was unacceptable. These reburials have been a very significant event in the history of Kaurna. It signals a time for reflection and a watershed moment in Kaurna history to discuss what happens in the future to our ancestors with the state government and industry. You can read more about the reburial project here: Marine Conservation Society says new Queensland emissions reduction target a \u2018significant commitment to tackling climate change\u2019 The Australian Marine Conservation Society has also welcomed the Queensland government\u2019s more ambitious emission reduction target of 75% by 2035, as outlined by Steven Miles in his first press conference as premier. Here\u2019s a statement from the society\u2019s reef campaign manager, Lissa Schindler: New Queensland premier Steven Miles has made a significant commitment to tackling climate change and protecting the Great Barrier Reef. This is a big step towards limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C especially for a heavily industrial state such as Queensland. NSW Greens urge premier to repeal anti-protest laws after supreme court ruling The NSW Greens are urging the premier, Chris Minns, to repeal anti-protest laws after a supreme court judgment found parts of the laws were unconstitutional. In a letter to Minns, the NSW Greens climate change and environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the ruling, handed down Wednesday, \u201cprovides a window of opportunity for you to turn this around, to reverse the trend of crushing dissent and instead protect the right to protest and our democracy\u201d. The court found that parts of the NSW laws, introduced by the Perrottet government and backed by the then Labor opposition in 2022, were invalid because they infringed on the implied freedom of political communication. The NSW government has said it is carefully considering the judgment and seeking advice on appeal options or options for legislative reform to \u201censure that protest activity is appropriately regulated and balances the rights and freedoms of the people of NSW\u201d. Higginson\u2019s letter urges the government not to appeal. It instead calls for the government to \u201cbring an amendment in the first week of parliament in 2024 that will repeal the unnecessary and draconian anti-protest laws and protect protest and democracy in NSW\u201d. World Wildlife Fund welcomes new Queensland emissions reduction targets The World Wildlife Fund for Nature has welcomed the Queensland government\u2019s more ambitious 2035 emission reduction target of 75% below 2005 levels. Here\u2019s a statement from Rachel Lowry, the acting chief executive of WWF-Australia: In one of his first acts, [new premier] Steven Miles has moved Queensland from the outhouse to the penthouse on its emissions reduction target. Increasing temperatures will challenge Queensland\u2019s way of life and threaten the existence of our amazing natural wonders like the Great Barrier Reef. But a strong emissions target will help protect our natural treasures and way of life, lower climate-related costs, and give a fighting chance to efforts to regenerate nature by 2030. It is major progress for Queensland and a step towards helping Australia fulfill our legal obligations to hold warming to 1.5 degrees under the Paris agreement and the world heritage convention. Parts of NSW under thunderstorm warning Many regions of NSW have been told to prepare for \u201cvery dangerous thunderstorms\u201d with \u201cgiant hail\u201d and \u201cdestructive winds\u201d. Here\u2019s more information from the Bureau of Meteorology: Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds, heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding and large hailstones over the next several hours in parts of the Northern Rivers, Mid North Coast, Northern Tablelands and Hunter districts. Locations which may be affected include Grafton, Kempsey, Casino, Tabulam, Dorrigo and Gloucester. The newly sworn-in Queensland premier, Steven Miles, has just outlined a much more ambitious climate change agenda. Queensland\u2019s current target is set at a 30% emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2030 \u2013 a weaker target than those set by the federal, New South Wales and Victorian governments. In his first press conference as premier, Miles has announced the state\u2019s target will increase to 75% by 2035. Here\u2019s Miles: Today, I can announce we will lift Queensland\u2019s ambition on climate action to strengthen our economy and create jobs. We will reduce Queensland\u2019s emissions by 75% by 2035. We will create certainty for industry and for jobs by legislating this target. We are making a very clear statement to the world that Queensland is the place to do business if you\u2019re looking to use clean energy to create prosperity. Earlier this year, the Queensland Greens prepared legislation to legislate a 75% emissions reduction target by 2030 and net zero by 2035. Environmental advocates including the Queensland Conservation Council had criticised the state governments prior commitment \u201cinadequate\u201d Steven Miles is fronting the media again, this time after being officially sworn in as the premier of Queensland. He\u2019s started with a long history of his suburban upbringing, but has also brought some news to his first presser as premier: During Covid, everybody had an interest in health and I listened to all of their views. I assure Queenslanders that that will not change. That is why today, I\u2019m announcing I will create a new Queensland leaders\u2019 forum to bring together business, industry, community and unions in the one room to work together for Queensland\u2019s future. That is what we did during the Covid response. It worked well. I am bringing it back. We can bring more details on that forum when they\u2019re revealed. Thousands of clubs and pubs sign up for NSW cashless pokies trial More pubs and clubs than expected have embraced a NSW cashless pokies trial set up in a bid to stamp out money-laundering and gambling harm, AAP reports. The 12-month trial is due to go ahead with 4,485 machines, substantially more than the 500 proposed by the state\u2019s premier, Chris Minns, earlier this year. Eight hotels and 20 clubs, including seven regional venues, will take part, providing information back from the first quarter of next year onwards. The independent panel on gaming reform, which backed the involvement of a range of different venues, will oversee the trial. Paluszcuk to resign on last day of 2023 Queensland\u2019s former premier, Annastacia Paluszcuk, will resign from state parliament on the last day of 2023. The member for Inala\u2019s resignation letter - which she submitted to the speaker of the house, Curtis Pitt, on Wednesday - was tabled on Friday. Ironically, Pitt is the only other MP still in Queensland parliament who was there when Paluszczuk was originally elected leader in 2012. The leadership ballot took place just days after the party suffered one of its worst-ever defeats, losing all but seven seats. Pitt briefly staged a challenge against Paluszczuk, but withdrew and she was elected unopposed. She later went on to defeat then premier Campbell Newman after just one term, in one of the most shocking upsets in Queensland political history. Here\u2019s part of the letter: I write to resign as the member for Inala effective at 5pm, Sunday, 31 December 2023. It has been a great honour to serve the Inala electorate community since 9 September 2006 and I take this opportunity wish them and all Queenslanders the very best for the future. There will be a byelection in her ultra-safe seat of Inala early in 2024. Driver in fatal beer garden car crash released on bail A driver accused of killing five people by crashing into a pub beer garden after allegedly ignoring alerts about his low glucose levels has been freed on bail with a $250,000 surety and a condition he not drive, AAP reports. William Swale, 66, was charged with culpable driving causing death, negligently causing serious injury and reckless conduct endangering lives over the 5 November crash. Swale\u2019s SUV mounted the kerb and hit several patrons seated on the front lawn of the Royal Daylesford Hotel just after 6pm. Pratibha Sharma, 44, her daughter Anvi, 9, and partner Jatin Kumar, 30, and their friend Vivek Bhatia, 38, and his son Vihaan, 11, all died. Swale, who was diagnosed with diabetes in 1994, was wearing a blood glucose monitoring device which sends an alert to his phone when his glucose levels are outside the normal range. Albanese praises Peta Murphy\u2019s \u2018tenacious\u2019 breast cancer advocacy The prime minister Anthony Albanese has spoken at the funeral of the Labor MP Peta Murphy in Melbourne today. Albanese spoke at length about Murphy\u2019s intellect, determination and empathy, which was on display when she chaired a parliamentary inquiry into online gambling harm. Here\u2019s part of the prime minister\u2019s speech: Every tribute made to her has, quite rightly, spoken of how hard she worked and how much she achieved in such a short period of time, or how much better her community and our nation were for her contributions. And yet a profound part of the grief that we feel today is not just what we have been deprived of \u2013 someone someone we deeply loved it \u2013 it is that Australia has been denied more of what Peta had to give it. It is so true to Peta\u2019s character that she channelled her personal battle with breast cancer into public policy, never thinking of herself, always tenaciously advocating for others. The PM joined the Labor caucus and Murphy\u2019s friends and family at the service held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The Greens senator, David Shoebridge, says it will be difficult for Australia to reject a request from the US to send a warship to the Red Sea amid ongoing attacks on commercial shipping from Iran-backed militia. Yesterday, the defence minister, Richard Marles, said the request was being examined, but stressed the government\u2019s overwhelming focus was on the Indo-Pacific region and not the Middle East. Here\u2019s what Shoebridge told the ABC a few moments ago: It would be very hard for the defence minister to say no to that, despite it creating, I think, very real security concerns for Australian personnel and seeing us involved in a conflict that I think most Australians see as deeply, deeply problematic. It is likely that Defence Minister Marles will agree to that because he needs to play nice with the US to keep the Aukus deal alive. People in [the US] congress are looking at this asking, \u2018is Australia going to follow us lock-stock into conflict, and if not, why would we give them our their precious nuclear submarines when we have so few of them?\u2019. I\u2019ll now hand over to my colleague Henry Belot who\u2019ll be with you until this evening. Thank you for following along. Victoria\u2019s net debt prediction has jumped by more than $6bn in six months and is now expected to reach $177.8bn by 2027, AAP reports. The state government attributes that to infrastructure investment, particularly extra funding for the North East Link, which has blown out from $10bn to $26.1bn, and associated freeway upgrades. A 2023-24 budget update released on Friday by treasurer Tim Pallas reveals net debt is expected to reach $135.5bn by June next year. It\u2019s then set to climb to $177.8bn by June 2027, which is $6.4bn higher than the estimate in the May state budget, representing 25.1% of gross state product. Tax revenue is expected to increase by $900m this financial year and by $1.1bn next year, compared with what was predicted in May, mostly due to increases to payroll and land taxes. Queensland governor swears in new premier Steven Miles Steven Miles has been officially sworn in as Queensland\u2019s 40th premier after Annastacia Palaszczuk stepped down from the position earlier this week. As we reported earlier, Miles announced he will appoint 10 new ministers and assistant ministers after he is sworn in. Nikki Boyd, Bart Mellish, Lance McCallum, Michael Healy and Charis Mullen will enter the cabinet as full ministers. Ali King, Shane King, Jimmy Sullivan, Jen Howard and Corrine McMillan have been elected assistant ministers Proton Mail founder vows to fight Australia\u2019s eSafety regulator in court rather than spy on users The founder of encrypted email service Proton says the company will fight the Australian online safety regulator in court if it is forced to weaken encryption under proposed standards. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, says cloud and messaging service providers should detect and remove known child abuse material and pro-terror material \u201cwhere technically feasible\u201d \u2013 and disrupt and deter new material of that nature. The eSafety regulator has stressed in an associated discussion paper it \u201cdoes not advocate building in weaknesses or back doors to undermine privacy and security on end-to-end encrypted services\u201d. But privacy and security groups argue the draft standards, as written, could allow the eSafety commissioner to force companies to compromise encryption to comply. More on this story here: Supermarket workers\u2019 union calling on consumers to boycott Coles and Woolworths The union for supermarket workers is calling on a consumer boycott of Coles and Woolworths next week as workers prepare to strike during one of the peak profit periods for the supermarket duopoly. The Retail and Fast Food Workers Union wants to avoid the big two starting from Monday as a show of support for its members who plan to go on strike, with workers at some stores downing tools from 19 December. The workers are seeking a minimum wage of $29 per hour, the abolition of junior rates, job security and safer workplaces. The boycott call was accompanied by an open letter that pointed to the retailers\u2019 high profit margins. The supermarket chains have consistently denied price-gouging allegations, saying supply chain inflation had contributed to price rises, and crediting increased productivity for profit margins. RAFFWU president Dani Barley says in a statement: Community support is essential at a time when workers are on strike, and when these corporate giants are expecting to add to their record profits this Christmas. Not only are these companies exploiting their workers, they are exploiting us all. A Coles spokesperson says the company is \u201cworking hard to keep prices affordable for Australian households\u201d. Being profitable ensures we can continue to employ more than 120,000 Australians, partner with more than 8,000 suppliers and farmers, support local communities and continue to invest in value for the millions of customers who visit our stores every week. A Woolworths\u2019 spokesperson says: We have been bargaining for the new supermarket enterprise agreement with 10 bargaining meetings occurring including four with RAFFWU. We look forward to continuing discussions about a new agreement for our team in the new year. The new Queensland premier-to-be Steven Miles has announced the creation of a new consultation body called the Queensland Leaders\u2019 Forum. The body will bring together business, industry, community and unions, similar to the approach taken during the pandemic. The new premier will outline the new body as his first major speech in the job this afternoon. He says: I\u2019ll be outlining this afternoon how I want to bring back that kind of consultative forum where we bring together all of the voices - including unions, they have a very justifiable role - but also business, industry, community leaders, first nations leaders. I want them all to have a seat at the table and that\u2019s what the Queensland leaders forum will do. At a press conference at Queensland parliament, his first since being elected by Labor MPs to the role, he said listening has always been part of his brand.: What I\u2019ve always done in all of my portfolios is listened to everybody. When I was the environment minister, I didn\u2019t just listen to the environment groups, I spent time with the cane growers. In fact, my first meeting as environment minister was with the cane growers. In health, I listened to the doctors and the nurses and the experts. But also when Covid hit you\u2019ll remember, health was a concern for everybody. And we put in place those systems to make sure that leaders from the entirety of Queensland had a say in how we were responding to Covid and had a say in developing the economic plan that the treasurer has delivered. Opponents shoot down duck hunting report as a \u2018failure\u2019 Duck hunters have been given the green light to keep shooting birds in South Australia, despite claims it is inhumane, threatens endangered species and goes against community expectations, AAP reports. The RSPCA has slammed a report by a South Australian parliamentary committee into the hunting of native birds, tabled on Thursday. Its findings \u201cfail animal welfare, fail conservation and fail to meet our community\u2019s expectations for the protection of vulnerable wildlife,\u201d RSPCA SA animal welfare advocate Dr Rebekah Eyers said. Eyers added: We estimate up to 10,000 of the approximately 45,000 ducks shot in SA each year will be wounded and left to suffer. Seeing a hunter swing a wounded duck around by the neck and then dump it on a pile of shot ducks whilst still alive is a horror that I will never forget. The latest Eastern Australian Waterbird Survey found several native bird species were experiencing significant long-term decline, despite recent wetter La Nina conditions. The report recommended a series of measures to limit the impacts of hunting on the environment, including requiring hunters to wear visible tags, increasing penalties for bad actors and banning the use of lead shot. But Eyers said assumptions authorities can effectively regulate the practice are misguided, after a recent Victorian inquiry found compliance monitoring a \u201cnear impossible task\u201d. Qld\u2019s Miles won\u2019t hold Olympics portfolio, will focus on \u2018bread and butter\u2019 issues The new Queensland ministers will replace Craig Crawford, Mark Bailey and Stirling Hinchliffe, who have been sacked or resigned from cabinet. Annastacia Palaszczuk will also leave cabinet, before she retires from politics entirely in the new year. Miles paid particular tribute to Crawford, the former minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships, who shepherded through parliament legislation setting the state on the pathway to treaty with Aboriginal Queenslanders. He was later appointed child safety minister. Here\u2019s what Miles told reporters: He can be rightly incredibly proud of the work that he did, towards treaty. And that\u2019s a legacy that can never be taken away. It\u2019s something that he helped shape and deliver. And he should be very, very proud. The three men who have stepped aside from the cabinet have done the government and ultimately the state a service by doing so because we wanted to have fresh faces, new faces in our team. To do that some people needed to stand aside. The cabinet is growing by one member. The new premier said that will be his only title, and he won\u2019t take responsibility for the Olympics and Paralympics like his predecessor did: I want to send a signal to Queenslanders that my approach as premier, my focus as premier, is 100% on being the premier, 100% on delivering for them and the things that they need. Bread and butter issues, their day-to-day concerns, and that\u2019s why my title will be Queensland premier. Incoming Qld premier Miles to reshuffle cabinet Steven Miles will appoint 10 new ministers and assistant ministers after he is sworn in as Queensland premier today. Nikki Boyd, Bart Mellish, Lance McCallum, Michael Healy and Charis Mullen will enter the cabinet as full ministers. Ali King, Shane King, Jimmy Sullivan, Jen Howard and Corrine McMillan have been elected assistant ministers The new faces were elevated at a Labor caucus meeting at Queensland parliament today. Miles and incoming deputy premier Cameron Dick were also elected to be the new leader and deputy leader of the party. Miles said the cabinet reshuffle was a way to refresh the government, which is in its ninth year in office: That\u2019s the most number of new ministers Queensland has seen since we were first elected in 2015. They are younger, they are energetic, they are ready to deliver a fresh approach for Queenslanders. Miles and Dick will now travel to Government House where Governor Jeannette Young will swear them in as premier and deputy premier. Sydney Opera House sails to be lit in tribute to Barry Humphries The MC at Barry Humphries\u2019 memorial service, Richard Wilkins, has announced the sails of Sydney Opera House will be lit in a tribute to the comedian from 830pm tonight. Luminaries from the arts and entertainment circles, along with politicians and business people, are at the service to \u2018farewell\u2019 the man they say was as funny off stage as he was on stage. For those who couldn\u2019t attend in person, such as Elton John, there were \u2018pretenders\u2019 on hand to fill the gap. If you missed it earlier, here\u2019s more from my colleague Benita Kolovos on the $10bn cost blowout for Victoria\u2019s largest road project: Rupert Murdoch: \u2018political correctness\u2019 never \u2018strangled\u2019 Humphries Rupert Murdoch has paid tribute to Barry Humphies in a video message that referenced political correctness. Murdoch said that \u201cin a linear world\u201d, Humphries was a rare example of \u201cthe lateral\u201d: It takes courage to strut on stage. To be judged by an audience night after night. You confess that you suffer severely from stage fright, and yet you tread the boards with a confidence that brings the crowd with you. I\u2019m struck by your self awareness, in understanding the nature of laughter. As you say, when people laugh at me, they are not laughing in the way they normally would be for a comedian. They are laughing with relief because the truth has been spoken, and political correctness has not strangled this particular [star]. Barry, you will never be strangled, you will never be silenced, your voice still echoes, your wisdom still enlightens, and your friendship still recites deeply in my heart. The NSW premier,Chris Minns, has also spoken at the memorial service: The Sydney Opera House is a fitting place to say our goodbyes to Barry, not just because of its sails or its dramatic exterior... but because of what\u2019s inside: the stage. It was on that stage, before an audience, where he was most at home. Barry Humphries was \u2018one of the funniest people in the world\u2019, Elton John tells memorial A series of comedians and the superstar Elton John have also recorded video messages to be played at Barry Humphries\u2019 memorial service. Here\u2019s a collection of them. The British comedian, Jimmy Carr, said: He was so generous with time and with his talent. I was blown away by him and so incredibly thrilled to have got to know him. He leaves the world a happier place. He was a genius. Comedian David Walliams: Later in life, I got to befriend Barry and spend time with him. It was one of the greatest pleasures of my life. He was as funny off stage, as he was on stage, and that can\u2019t be said about many comedians. He has left an incredible legacy that will make us laugh forever. And Elton John: Barry Humphries was one of the funniest people in the world, we all know that. He was also one of the kindest and most generous people to me. It is sad that we won\u2019t be seeing him again, but we have so many memories of him. His books, his TV appearances, and the wonderful jokes and wonderful kindness that he showed to me and everyone. I hope you all have the most wonderful day there and celebrate with laughter, because that was what Barry was all about. Bless you. Power should be back on for 80% of far north Qld homes by Saturday night Ergon Energy will aim to restore power to 80% of the 15,000 homes and businesses facing outages in far north Queensland by Saturday night, and complete the remaining 20% by next Tuesday. It comes after power to 25,000 had been restored after nearly 40,000 homes lost power on Wednesday as ex-tropical cyclone Jasper crossed the coastline. Ergon\u2019s chief operating officer Paul Jordon said the restoration plan might be hampered by rain forecast to continue to lash the region, and by additional damage to the network. A major flood warning for the Daintree and the Barwon river remains in place. There are also moderate to minor flood warnings for the Mossman, Barron, Mulgrave, Russell, Tully and Murray rivers. The heaviest rainfall has been recorded at Cairns, Port Douglas and the Daintree, with the latter receiving almost 800mm in the past 48 hours. Incoming Queensland premier Steven Miles: \u2018we\u2019ll make history today\u2019 Queensland premier-to-be Steven Miles declared \u201cwe\u2019ll make history today\u201d as he arrived at a party caucus meeting this morning. Miles and treasurer Cameron Dick will be endorsed as premier and deputy premier by Labor MPs at parliament house today. They arrived to rapturous applause. Miles joked that he didn\u2019t have time to hug all of the 51 MPs at the meeting. They will be sworn in by Governor Jeannette Young later today. The caucus will also elect several new members of cabinet, in advance of a reshuffle, which is expected to be announced Monday. Miles replaces Annastacia Palaszczuk, who served as premier for nine years and won three elections. She took the party back into government after a wipeout election which reduced the party to seven MPs, defeating Campbell Newman. Humphries memorial: Barry always had the final word, says Albanese The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has also addressed the memorial service for Barry Humphries. Here\u2019s part of Albanese\u2019s video message that was played to the audience at Sydney Opera House: No matter how unruly his creations became, it was Barry who had the final word. And what a word it was. Barry had the ultimate power, a power he exercised with the glee that never knew any bounds. Just like this place, he brought people from every state and territory together. And in the process, this genius, this comedic giant brought such joy to every part of Australia. Then, like a never ending bunch of gladiolus, he showered it upon the world. The minister for arts, Tony Burke, is now reading a statement on behalf of King Charles III. He starts with a joke that says it seems like a television drama plot to say \u201cI have a message from the king\u201d. Here\u2019s the statement in full: I suspect that all those who appeared on stage or on TV with Barry\u2019s Dame Edna, or who found her appearing at the back of the Royal Box, will have shared that unique sensation where fear and fun combined. Those who tried to stand on their dignity soon lost their footing. Those who wondered whether Australia\u2019s housewife superstar might this time just go too far were always proved right. No one was safe. Barry Humphries, through his creations, poked and prodded us, exposed to tensions, punctured pomposity, surfaced insecurities, but most of all made us laugh at ourselves. This cultured and erudite man, with his love of literature and the visual arts, and passion for Weimar cabaret, could not have been more different from his various stage incarnations. Like so many, I have been deeply saddened by his passing. Life really won\u2019t be the same without him. May our gladiolus bloom in celebration of his memory. King Charles, Elton John to salute Barry Humphries at state memorial The state memorial service for Barry Humphries has just begun at the Sydney Opera House. Television host Richard Wilkins is hosting the event, which is expected to include tributes from King Charles and Elton John. Wilkins is delivering an opening address to the service: Barry found fame - extraordinary fame - in so many parts of the world. The UK, the US, Europe, Scandinavia, New Zealand and many other countries. In fact, he put Australia on the cultural map, as only he could. And not everyone approved of the way he did it, of course. He spent much time overseas, but he never forgot in his heart that he was Australian, through and through. Lisa Wilkinson returns to the witness box Lisa Wilkinson is back today for her second day in the witness box, defending a defamation claim against her and Network Ten. You can catch the live updates from my colleague Amanda Meade as this unfolds here: Disability car stolen Victoria police are appealing for information on a car burglary after a black 2021 Kia Carnival wagon which had been modified to help the victim who has a disability was stolen in the Mornington Peninsula. The thieves broke into the Mount Eliza home of a 61- and 60-year-old couple at 3am on Tuesday and stole the wagon and a grey Hyundai i20. The Hyundai was later found dumped at Nardoo Court in Mornington on Tuesday afternoon. Steven Miles to be elected Queensland premier unopposed Queensland\u2019s Labor caucus meets at 10am local time (11am AEDT) today to decide on a new premier after Annastactia Palaszczuk\u2019s sudden resignation on Sunday. Former deputy premier Steven Miles will be elected unopposed, with treasurer Cameron Dick named his deputy. It\u2019s been 11 years, eight months and seven days since the Labor caucus last met to elect a new leader. There were just six MPs in that meeting \u2013 Paluszczuk reminded reporters this week they could have fitted in a Tarago \u2013 after the Anna Bligh government\u2019s drubbing at the 2012 election. (The party won seven seats but Bligh didn\u2019t attend the caucus meeting.) This time, 51 MPs will decide the future of the party. Again, the outgoing premier is expected not to attend. Paluszczuk tendered her resignation from the post last night, after winning three straight elections. She will retire from politics early in the new year, sparking a by-election in her south Brisbane seat of Inala. Miles has just 316 days to convince Queenslanders to retain him as premier before an election in October 2024. He will have to contend with a resurgent opposition led by David Crisafulli, who has spent months attacking the government\u2019s health, housing and youth crime policies. After the caucus meeting this morning, Miles will head to Government House in Paddington, where he will be sworn in by governor Jeannette Young. He will make his first speech as premier at the executive building this afternoon, in which he is expected to lay out his government\u2019s priorities. Cost blowout breakdown Here\u2019s a breakdown on the Melbourne\u2019s North East Link cost blowout to more than $10bn: The longer tunnel and extra open space is costing $2bn more than planned, alongside upgrades to the neighbouring freeways. The M80 and Eastern Freeway is costing $9.5bn. There will be improved operation and community outcomes, including noise standards, better technology and interchange design is costing $600m. The dedicated busway will cost $750m. There is also $400m in extra costs to extend a rail tunnel, $70m to set up a park and ride in Bulleen and $100m for sporting facilities. In addition, the document says there\u2019s been $3.88bn in \u201cadditional cost pressures\u201d. This includes $3.1bn due to the \u201cescalation rates of critical construction supplies such as concrete, asphalt and steel and broader inflationary pressures\u201d and $780m to comply with the environment effects statement. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has admitted the cost of building the North East Link has blown out by more than $10bn. Announcing two new contracts \u2013 to connect the project to existing roads \u2013 today, Allan said the project was expected to now cost a total of $26bn. The project was first estimated to cost $10bn in 2016 but this was revised to $15.8bn when the final design was locked in. Allan said the new estimate, which is included in the mid-year budget update, was due to several factors including a longer tunnel, better noise standards, more open space and the addition of a dedicated busway for the road: There are many components that have been added to this project as a result of listening to the market and also listening to the advice of experts as well about how we can best make this project work not just for the local communities ... but for all of us, all of us who are wanting to navigate around the northern and eastern suburbs. Albanese has also said backing calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict was the \u201cright call to do\u201d after being asked about some of the \u201cunhappy\u201d reactions to the decision: We joined with almost almost every country in the world to say that our position, which I outlined very much in detail with the prime ministers of Canada and New Zealand, is to seek to have all of the hostages released which should occur. We need to plan as well for what occurs after the conflict. Hamas can have no role in the future governance of of Gaza, and we need to work towards a political solution. We respect Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, [and] that the range of the numbers of casualties just quite, quite, quite terrible there in Gaza, and every innocent life counts, whether it be Israeli or Palestinian. Aukus approval an \u2018extraordinary achievement\u2019 Anthony Albanese hailed the passing of the bill in US Congress overnight that will allow the sale of Aukus nuclear submarines to Australia an \u201cextraordinary achievement\u201d during his interview on 2GB: That means that Aukus can go ahead, means that Australia will have access to those Virginia-class submarines which are nuclear-propelled and that will be so important for Australia\u2019s national security. Earlier defence minister Richard Marles said on ABC News Breakfast the $4bn contribution from Australia to boost shipyard production in the US as part of the deal will be \u201cworked through in the coming years\u201d. \u2018It will be a very difficult day,\u2019 PM says of Peta Murphy funeral Anthony Albanese will be in Melbourne today to attend the funeral of Labor MP for Dunkley Peta Murphy, who died from breast cancer. Speaking on 2GB, Albanese said: It will be a very difficult day. She was really courageous \u2026 she chose not to hide the treatment that she was getting, appearing there in Parliament and around public with the impact of chemotherapy [which] meant that she lost her hair, but she wanted to signify that cancer can affect anyone, members of parliament, whatever job you have. And she was just a strong advocate, a courageous brilliant young woman who passed far too soon. NSW\u2019s cashless gambling trial expands to include nearly 4,500 poker machines Almost 4,500 poker machines across 24 local government areas will be included in the New South Wales government\u2019s cashless gambling trial to begin early next year. The expanded trial will take place across 28 clubs of varying sizes, with advocates hoping it leads to universal cashless gaming in NSW, after both major parties put forward gambling reform plans at the March election. In July the government announced that Michael Foggo, a former liquor, gaming and racing commissioner, would lead a panel of 16 industry representatives and reform advocates, who would then report back to the government in November 2024. Foggo said there had been a \u201clarge number\u201d of clubs applying to take part in the trial. More on this story here: Bank customers miss out on higher savings rates Banks use strategic pricing for deposit accounts, creating complexity for customers who are missing out on earning higher interest on their savings, according to the competition regulator. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a report today that savers were worse off due to ongoing barriers to searching for, and switching between, deposit products. It recommends that banks be required to tell customers when they change their interest rates, with prompts for them to consider switching to a better rate. The report found that introductory and bonus interest rates, and a range of fees and charges, make it difficult for consumers to compare products. In the first six months of 2023, more than two-thirds of bonus interest accounts did not receive bonus interest in any given month, with customers failing to meet conditions imposed by the banks, the ACCC found. ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said: While high headline interest rates may seem attractive to customers, they can come attached with conditions that are hard for customers to meet and keep track of. Consumers can find the complexity of the pricing of retail deposit products overwhelming. The report was produced in response to a federal government directive this year to investigate retail deposit products, amid allegations rate hikes did not necessarily flow through to savers. The Australian Banking Association was contacted for comment. Christmas appeal as millions struggle to make ends meet Millions of Australians are cutting back expenses and many will go without entirely as Christmas places pressure on already stretched household budgets, AAP reports. More than 5.3 million people will not be able to afford a Christmas meal this year and 30% of parents are worried their children will go without presents, research by the Salvation Army showed. The survey of more than 2,000 people found that almost 60% felt more stressed this holiday season compared with 31.6% at the same time last year. Almost one in seven parents worried their children would go without a traditional Christmas Day meal and more than 70% of people surveyed are more mindful about how much they are spending. Nearly one in 10 people will rely on charitable support to get by this Christmas and of those, 48.9% will be reaching out for the first time. Salvation Army Major Brendan Nottle urged people who are in need to reach out to Salvos, and also called on people who can afford it to donate to the Christmas appeal. As of 9am, there are 66 fires burning across the state, with 14 not yet contained. All fires are burning at an advice level, with more than 500 firefighters and incident management personnel working across NSW. Power restored to 25,000 Queensland homes and businesses Power has been restored to 25,000 homes and businesses in far north Queensland after nearly 40,000 experienced power outages in the wake of ex-tropical cyclone Jasper. Ergon Energy said its crews were now being supported by additional staff from across Queensland to speed up restoring power for the remaining 15,000 facing outages. The region is facing a number of flood warnings, with the deluge forecast to continue. A major flood risk has been flagged for the Daintree, a moderate flood warning for the Mulgrave and Russell rivers, and minor warnings for the Barron and Tully rivers. Singer Jimmy Barnes is doing well after being moved to an intensive care unit following open-heart surgery. The 66-year-old underwent the procedure on Wednesday after a bacterial infection spread to his heart. His wife Jane Barnes wrote on social media: Good progress today in ICU. Some massive tubes have come out and first physio visit. Clearing lungs and deep breathing, we know he\u2019s good at that! Our family thanks each and everyone for your well wishes, every single one counts so please keep them coming. Barnes has cancelled upcoming shows because of the health emergency \u2013 a development he described as \u201chugely frustrating\u201d. Vodafone will shut off its 3G network today, becoming the first company in Australia to shut down the first network that enabled smartphone use. Telstra won\u2019t shut down its network until June and Optus won\u2019t shut down until September. They\u2019re being shut down because the spectrum licences are expiring, and the spectrum will be reused for 5G. A spokesperson for Vodafone said the company had a year\u2019s lead time since announcing the shutdown to prepare for it, and now only abouit 1% of the network traffic is 3G, with 85% 4G and 13% for 5G. The spokesperson said the switch-off would impact a \u201csmall number of customers who have 3G-only devices\u201d but the company had been in contact with customers well in advance: We have been proactively contacting our customers through regular SMS and email campaigns to let them know about the 3G closure, and to help them upgrade their phones or device settings. So far, we have sent more than two million messages to our customers to keep them updated about the 3G network closure and have put on extra staff in our retail stores and contact centres to help customers with this transition. Aukus vote hailed Defence minister Richard Marles was doing the rounds on breakfast TV this morning to speak about the US Congress passing overnight the bill that will allow the sale of Aukus nuclear submarines to Australia. He said the $4bn contribution from Australia to boost shipyard production in the US as part of the deal will be \u201cworked through in the coming years\u201d: That is really important from an American point of view in terms of making sure that they have their own capabilities maintained, that we get Virginia-class submarines out of service and into operation in the US. T his was always the challenge when we were talking about America providing Virginia-class submarines to Australia and it is why we were so pleased to reach that arrangement back in March this year. Aemo warns coal-fired power plants could drop off before replacements are ready Australia\u2019s main power grid faces the \u201creal\u201d possibility ageing coal-fired power plants will drop out before sufficient generation capacity and transmission lines are in place, the Australian Energy Market Operator has said. The comments, contained in a draft report on Aemo\u2019s main blueprint for the national electricity market, come a day after New South Wales faced its first grid strains of the summer. Authorities called on consumers to reduce non-essential power use as temperatures hovered in the high 30s across much of Sydney. Aemo\u2019s report, known as the Integrated System Plan, noted that 10 big coal-fired power plants had shut in the national electricity market since 2012. The remaining coal fleet may shut as much as three times faster than companies have flagged in their public announcements. Aemo said in the mostly likely scenario about 90% of the current 21 gigawatts of coal capacity would retire by 2034-35 and all by 2038. Even in its \u201cprogressive change\u201d path, only 4GW of coal generation would remain in 2034-35. More on this story here: The federal opposition has called on the government to be upfront about its reasons should it reject a US request to send a warship to the Middle East to protect Israel from a rebel-enforced blockage. Speaking on Seven\u2019s Sunrise this morning, acting opposition leader Sussan Ley said: This is a serious request from our closest ally. I genuinely want to know if the government is not going to accept this request, then why not? Defence minister Richard Marles was asked about the request a little earlier on ABC News Breakfast and said the government is going through the \u201cnormal course of assessing the request\u201d: There are Australians who are embedded in that headquarters right now and in the past, we have sent navy vessels to participate in the activities of the [combined maritime force]. I need to say our focus has been, in terms of our naval effort, on our immediate region. A couple of days ago I welcomed back HMAS Toowoomba who had been involved in a regional presence deployment in the East China Sea and in our part of the world and we have two boats coming back from activities in that part of the world as well. That is our focus. We will consider this in the normal course and work through with the Americans about how we can best contribute. Focus on mental health The government will be injecting $456m into digital mental health services \u2013 including Lifeline and Beyond Blue \u2013 to give people to with anxiety and depression better access to mental health services. Speaking on RN Breakfast a short time ago, the health minister, Mark Butler, said: Some people go through situational distress through a relationship breakdown or a job loss or bereavement, and they need relatively short periods of support. They might not have a diagnosable mental illness, but they\u2019re certainly distressed and they need support and that really is what the digital investment we\u2019re looking at today is particularly targeted that there are people who go through periods of anxiety and depression and better access. Butler said over the course of the next year the government would be working on more supports for people with complex health needs: There\u2019s definitely a gap there for people with more complex needs, but better access which is the scheme that provides Medicare rebates for psychological therapy, the one that we\u2019re talking about, that is not designed to pick up those people and really we need to find alternative systems of support for them. That is really the concerning growing area of need in the country, not just here in Australia and other countries as well. Asked by Patricia Karvelas about the exorbitant costs of a psychology session and the capacity for people to meet gap fees for a session, Butler agreed gap fees have \u201cclimbed dramatically\u201d: They\u2019re now close to $100 a session on average, but there\u2019s many that are higher than that as you indicate. So affordability is a driver of inequity as well and so we\u2019re looking at ways in which we can put out different systems for people who just don\u2019t have the capacity to pay those sorts of gap fees. \u2018We\u2019re a lot better prepared as a country than we were heading into black summer\u2019 Murray Watt reiterated the government\u2019s plan to create a response to disasters that\u2019s alternative to the Australian defence force, saying he hopes to begin outlining a plan in the first half of next year, while adding it \u201cwill take a number of years\u201d: We\u2019ve made clear that we will always make the ADF available to states and territories when it\u2019s needed. But we do need to have some other options in place. Watt said \u201cwe\u2019re prepared as we possible could be\u201d for the risk of further extreme weather events this summer: We\u2019re a lot better prepared as a country than we were heading into black summer four years ago. At the federal level, things have significantly changed. We\u2019ve now got one coordinated Emergency Management Agency rather than responsibilities being split between different agencies. We\u2019ve started building a national emergency management stockpile for the very first time, we\u2019ve got the largest fleet of firefighting aircraft that Australia\u2019s ever seen. There\u2019s always going to be surprising events or events that are more intense than what you expect them to be, but I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re aware as well prepared as we possibly can be. The minister for emergency management, Murray Watt, has just appeared on ABC RN from Cairns to speak about the heavy rain and threat of flooding in far north Queensland in the wake of ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper. Watt said the good news was there hasn\u2019t been as much damage as people initially feared but he said the floods could be \u201cquite serious\u201d and people need to take \u201cserious precautions\u201d: This is monsoonal rain for a tropical part of our country, but it is early in the season to be getting this amount of rain. Conditions had been very dry in far north Queensland in the lead-up to this so the soil has been able to absorb this rain pretty well. But just the sheer volume of rain that we\u2019ve seen in some parts of far north Queensland will be difficult for anywhere to cope with and that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing those flood warnings in place. Some lighter news this morning for you from my colleague Daisy Dumas on the Sydney man dubbed the \u201cAnnihilator\u201d who won the Excel world championship. Transport costs accelerate by more than $900 a year Transport costs have soared by more than $1,000 a year in some Australian cities, with expenses topping $24,000 on average and putting added pressure on household budgets, AAP reports. The figures, released by the Australian Automobile Association this week, showed transport costs rose by 4% over the past three months, or more than triple the consumer price index. Households in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane continued to pay the most for transport, at an average of more than $27,000 a year. But the AAA revealed costs in some regional areas had risen by more than $800 a year and weekly costs in some towns had passed $400 a week for the first time. The results came amid record high petrol prices of more than $2 a litre and after the consumer price index climbed to 5.4% in the year to 30 Septembe. On average, the report found, households in capital cities would spend $24,262 on transport each year or $466 a week, while households in regional areas spent $20,404 a year or $392 a week. Thank you Martin Farrer for kicking things off this morning, and happy Friday blog readers! I\u2019m Jordyn Beazley and I\u2019ll be bringing you our rolling news coverage today. As always, if there\u2019s anything you\u2019d like to draw my attention to, you can reach me at jordyn.beazley@theguardian.com. The life of acclaimed Australian entertainer Barry Humphries will be celebrated in a state memorial at the Sydney Opera House today. The comedy legend, best known for his alter egos Dame Edna Everage and Sir Les Patterson, died in Sydney on 22 April 22 at the age of 89. Humphries\u2019 extraordinary international career, spanning seven decades, will be remembered on Friday by dignitaries, family, friends and fans. The televised service will feature tributes and performances from the renowned actor, poet, musician and artist\u2019s family and friends, as well as stars from across the entertainment and arts worlds. The two-hour memorial event is being co-hosted by the Australian and NSW governments and begins at 11am. Jasper weather warnings The cyclone danger may have passed but far north Queensland has been warned it is still under threat with flooding set to test locals, AAP reports. Ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper weakened after crossing the coast north of Cairns on Wednesday night and is expected to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria by the weekend. While Jasper has been reduced to a tropical low, people left in its destructive path are bracing for heavy rainfall and damaging winds of up to 90km/h. Queensland treasurer Cameron Dick warned: This event is not over. There are severe weather warnings for large parts of the north tropical coast and tablelands as well as the peninsula and gulf country. Rains of 150mm to 200mm are expected in the region, with isolated falls of up to 400mm. There are major flooding warnings for the Daintree, Barron and Mossman rivers. People have been told to avoid flood waters and stay inside as emergency services clean up, with crocodiles and snakes expected to be on the move. More than 500 energy crews have travelled north to assist with more than 40,000 homes and businesses who were at one stage without power. Cairns locals are advised to conserve drinking water as authorities work to remove debris from a treatment plant. Airlines say today will be busiest day in four years Jetsetters eager to escape the cities for Christmas are being advised to get to airports early as airlines predict their busiest day in four years, Australian Associated Press reports. After years of disruption, the air travel industry is almost back to pre-pandemic levels, and the last two Fridays before Christmas are traditionally the busiest days of the period as travellers make a hasty getaway after schools and businesses wind down for the year. Friday will be the Qantas and Jetstar\u2019s single busiest day of the holiday period, with more than 150,000 customers set to take to the skies. The Qantas group has brought forward maintenance on its aircraft, placed extra planes on standby and brought on more staff, while Virgin is offering additional services on popular domestic and short-haul international routes. Newly arrived Sydney airport boss Scott Charlton said staff were prepared for the airport\u2019s biggest holiday period in four years: This is the first Christmas holiday since 2019 that the border with mainland China is open and demand is strong, with seat capacity back to pre-COVID levels as we head into 2024. While Sydney airport does not anticipate any more delays than usual, extra staff are being brought on to help ease passengers through the gates. It advised customers to turn up early and pre-book parking. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019m going to bring you up to speed with our top stories before today\u2019s regular blogger, Jordyn Beazley, takes the controls. Our top story today is another twist in the immigration detention story with our reporter Paul Karp discovering that the immigration minister, Andrew Giles, has quietly lifted the ankle bracelet and curfew conditions from at least two of the three people released from detention who are challenging tough new visa rules in the high court. Guardian Australia understands that Giles has exempted a Chinese asylum seeker known as S151 and an Afghan refugee known as AUK15 from the conditions. A criminal syndicate was tipped off to a covert operation after federal law enforcement staff shared photos of an intercepted shipping container with more than 400 public servants across multiple agencies. The blunder prompted a multi-agency corruption investigation. Steven Miles will be sworn in today as Queensland\u2019s 40th premier after Annastacia Palaszczuk tenders her resignation to the state governor, Jeannette Young, in Brisbane. Miles is expected to announce, among a number of \u201cday one\u201d initiatives, that the state will lift its lagging emissions reductions targets. The US Congress has passed legislation overnight allowing the country to sell Virginia-class submarines to Australia under the Aukus security pact. The development will be warmly welcomed by the Australian government, which had hoped to secure the legislative tick before the US entered the politically charged environment of a presidential election year. Also coming up today: Barry Humphries\u2019 state memorial at the Sydney Opera House, the ex-Cyclone Jasper washup continue, and, if you\u2019ve got a flight today, get to the airport early \u2013 it\u2019s said to be the busiest day for airlines in four years."

            "title": "Critical or concerning? Cop28 debates role of carbon markets in climate crisis",
            "date": "2023-12-13T06:00:05Z",
            "content": "Government officials, conservation organisations and industry groups have sought to revive confidence in the unregulated voluntary carbon market at Cop28 amid concerns it does little to mitigate the climate crisis or the destruction of nature. Supporters of carbon markets say that through buying high-quality credits, countries and companies can transfer some of the billions of dollars required to fund nature-based solutions, support Indigenous communities, phase out coal power, and pay for new renewables in developing countries. Initiatives are under way to certify successful carbon projects and curb greenwashing claims from companies that buy credits, although there is disagreement about the appropriate role of offsets in a company\u2019s sustainability efforts. The sector is wrestling with human rights concerns, evidence that many carbon credits are largely worthless, and a lack of clarity about financial flows. Demand for carbon offsets has collapsed in recent months after peaking at $2bn in 2021. Many speculators could lose billions following the slump as major companies drop \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d claims using offsets. At the climate summit in Dubai, the US climate envoy, John Kerry, the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the former UK prime minister Tony Blair were among those throwing their weight behind efforts to revive the market as a way of funding environmental action. While acknowledging flaws, Kerry told a Cop28 event that it could become \u201cthe largest marketplace the world will have ever known\u201d. The World Bank president, Ajay Banga, told an event with von der Leyen that there was no other way for scaleable resources to reach developing countries. Blair spoke at an event with the Guyanese president, Irfaan Ali, in support of selling carbon credits derived from protecting Guyana\u2019s forests. Guyana is one of the few Amazon countries to have kept the vast majority of its forest intact, and it has signed a $750m carbon credit deal with the US petroleum company Hess Corporation, although questions have been raised about the environmental benefits the credits represent. Concerns have also been voiced about the role of carbon markets in formal climate talks. Ahead of Cop28, an EU memo raised concerns that the US was pushing voluntary carbon market initiatives for formal inclusion in the Paris agreement\u2019s carbon market which, it warned, could undermine the ambition of efforts to limit global heating. Judith Simon, the president and interim CEO of the leading carbon credit certifier Verra, which was the subject of a Guardian investigation into poor quality carbon credits from their rainforest protection scheme, said the market was at an inflection point. \u201cOne big story of this climate conference is the agreement among standards organisations, international bodies, civil society, governments, and corporations \u2013 that an effective carbon market is an irreplaceable and critical component of addressing the climate challenge. The carbon market is at an inflection point, and it deserves a scientifically robust assessment to support its continuous improvement and ultimate success,\u201d said Simon. The Washington based non-profit is teaming up with the Climate Crisis Advisory Group, a group of researchers including Sir David King, Johan Rockstr\u00f6m and Mariana Mazzucato, to use the latest science to build trust in the market for climate and biodiversity impact. They are also transitioning to new rules on approving rainforest carbon credits. Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and chief scientist at Conservation International, which manages a number of carbon offsetting projects, said carbon markets could be reformed. \u201cIt\u2019s an important and difficult question because it doesn\u2019t have a simple answer. On the one hand, the voluntary carbon markets on nature are not working and there\u2019s reason to be deeply concerned about how they are misused as offsetting mechanisms for companies that are not following the scientific pathway on fossil fuel phase-out. On the other hand, we need nature-based solutions more than ever. We need finance more than ever and we don\u2019t have another mechanism. It\u2019s almost a contraction in terms. Many of us in this field feel like we have one foot in each camp,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can no longer just allow yourself to plant trees as a way of hiding your inability to follow the scientifically based fossil fuel phase out plans,\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m added. Leading conservation NGOs and industry groups have said that companies that buy carbon credits are largely doing so alongside emissions cuts and are not using offsets as a reason to keep polluting. The industry watchdog Carbon Market Watch found that there was little evidence of a causal link between corporate purchases and their decarbonisation rate. It comes amid a renewed push for an expanded role for offsets in corporate climate claims through the UK government-backed Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI), which certifies corporate claims. Before the summit in Dubai, it said it was trialling a certificate on using credits for scope 3 - or indirect - emissions, prompting concern from some in the sector that it would allow companies to use offsets instead of cutting emissions. The New Climate Institute warned it could turn the clock back on corporate climate change action. Margaret Kim, the CEO of Gold Standard, which also certifies carbon credits, said emission cuts from businesses had to come first. \u201dThe voluntary carbon market (VCM) can drive genuine change, catalyse investment in the global south, enhance people\u2019s lives and drive real emission reductions. But we must use credits as a complement to corporate decarbonisation, rather than a substitute, including for scope 3 emissions. Business must do the hard work of reducing emissions throughout their value chain in line with science-based targets, transforming business practices where needed, while simultaneously taking responsibility for those [emissions] they cannot yet eliminate,\u201d she said."

            "date": "2023-12-08T12:33:32Z",
            "content": "Cop28 organisers granted attendance to at least 475 lobbyists working on carbon capture and storage (CCS), unproven technologies that climate scientists say will not curtail global heating, the Guardian can reveal. The figure was calculated by the Centre for Environmental Law (Ciel) and shared exclusively with the Guardian, and is the first attempt to monitor the growing influence of the CCS subset of the fossil fuel industry within the UN climate talks. CCS, or CCUS (which includes \u201cutilisation\u201d) is being pushed hard at the summit by fossil fuel and other high-pollution industries, as well as by the biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries. CCS backers say the technologies will enable polluters to trap carbon dioxide emissions and bury them under the ground or the seabed, or use the CO2 in the production of fuels or fertilisers. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other climate scientists agree that phasing out oil, gas and coal is the only path to curtailing global heating to somewhere near 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and that CCUS and other unproven niche technologies are a delaying tactic and a distraction that could, at best, contribute to a very limited extent. Lili Fuhr, the director of Ciel\u2019s fossil economy programme, said: \u201cThe force with which the fossil fuel industry and their allies are coming to Dubai to sell the idea that we can \u2018capture\u2019 or \u2018manage\u2019 their carbon pollution is a sign of their desperation. CCS is the fossil fuel industry\u2019s lifeline and it is also their latest excuse and delay tactic. \u201cWe must not let an army of carbon capture lobbyists blow a gigantic loophole into the energy package here at Cop28.\u201d The scale of oil and gas influence is unprecedented at Cop28, which is being run by the president of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 national oil company, with 2,456 industry-affiliated lobbyists \u2013 almost four times higher than the number registered for Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh. The carbon capture bloc is one of the largest \u2013 outnumbering official Indigenous representatives by 50%, as well as several of the most climate-affected countries, including Somalia (366), Niger (135), Guinea-Bissau (43), Tonga (79), Eritrea (7), Liberia (197), and Solomon Islands (56). Fossil fuel phase-out is the core issue at stake in the negotiations over the global stocktake \u2013 the reckoning on progress so far \u2013 at Cop28. Major fossil fuel producers, such as the US, Canada, Norway, the EU and Saudi Arabia, are being accused of trying to block an unequivocal agreement on a phase-out by pushing for the stocktake to refer to \u201cabated\u201d fossil fuels. \u201cUnabated\u201d burning of oil, gas and coal results in CO2 or other greenhouse gases being released directly into the atmosphere. There is no agreement on what \u201cabated\u201d means, but in general it refers to burning fossil fuels combined with the capture and permanent storage of an undefined proportion of the greenhouse gases emitted. CCUS has been promoted at Cop28 in high-level meetings and dozens of side events. On Tuesday, the \u201ccarbon management challenge\u201d was launched by several countries, including the UAE, Australia, Canada, Egypt, the EU, US, Japan and Denmark, announcing government support for CCUS and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies. But while the technologies may help address emissions in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement and steel, even capturing 1.2 gigatonnes of CO2 \u2013 the target initially proposed by the challenge, though not formalised \u2013 represents only 3% of the 2022 global emissions. The Guardian approached the Global CCS Institute and the CCS Association for comment. For years, CCUS projects have over-promised and under-delivered. Chevron\u2019s Gorgon gas facility in Western Australia is the site of the world\u2019s largest industrial CCUS project, which, during its first five years, missed its carbon capture targets by about 50%. Earlier this year the Guardian reported that emissions at the gas facility have risen by 50%. Critics say CCUS and other abatement technologies would fail to tackle the 5 million annual deaths linked to air pollution caused by extracting and burning fossil fuels. Internal industry documents released by the US House oversight committee\u2019s investigation into climate disinformation in 2021 suggest that oil executives are aware of CCUS\u2019s limitations \u2013 and its potential as a lifeline for fossil fuels. Earlier this year, the chief executive of the US oil company Occidental, Vicki Hollub, who is registered as a Cop28 delegate, told an industry conference that direct air capture \u201cgives our industry a licence to continue to operate for the 60, 70, 80 years that I think it\u2019s going to be very much needed\u201d. Occidental said the CO2 captured in Texas would be stored underground and used as a sort of carbon credit system for other companies to buy. It touts itself as an example of \u201cnet zero oil\u201d, whereby removed CO2 is injected into rock formations to dislodge gas and oil for further extraction. Rachel Cleetus, the climate and energy policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: \u201cFossil fuel and narrow political interests are choosing to obfuscate and water down the text being negotiated for the final Cop28 agreement, despite the clarity science brings to the necessity of a phase-out. \u201cThe reality is that CCS/CCUS cannot contribute meaningfully to emission reductions in this critical decade \u2026 The core, unavoidable task remains making deep, direct cuts in fossil fuel use. There are no escape hatches.\u201d The 475 CCS lobbyists were identified from the UN\u2019s provisional list of about 84,000 participants at Cop28, and include representatives of companies that have partnered in carbon capture and utilisation or storage projects, according to an International Energy Agency database, as well as other companies and organisations that have a public record of advocating for these technologies. Blessed Chidhoni, from the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice, and who lost family members during floods in Zimbabwe, said: \u201cThousands of fossil fuel lobbyists are roaming these halls alongside their peers, advancing dangerous distractions like carbon capture and storage, trying to block a fast, fair, forever fossil fuel phase-out \u2013 while communities enduring the greatest impacts from the climate crisis are having our voices silenced and our lives treated as a worthy sacrifice for profit.\u201d A spokesperson for the Carbon Capture and Storage Association said: \u201cCarbon capture technology will be a significant part of the mix alongside reducing energy use and the rolling out of renewable electricity as we all work together to reach net zero.\u201d"

            "content": "Cybersecurity vulnerabilities at the UK\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site must be urgently addressed and explanations given for any shortcomings, a cabinet minister has demanded. Claire Coutinho, secretary of state for energy security and net zero, wrote to the chief executive of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), David Peattie, saying allegations by the Guardian about failings in cybersecurity at Sellafield in Cumbria needed \u201curgent attention\u201d. The intervention follows the revelation that the vast nuclear waste and decommissioning dump has been hacked by groups linked to China and Russia, and its potential effects covered up by senior staff. It emerged as part of Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into problems spanning cyber hacking, radioactive contamination, and toxic workplace culture at Sellafield. Coutinho said: \u201cThe allegations are a worrying reminder of the longstanding nature of some of these issues, specifically cybersecurity at Sellafield, which I understand has been under enhanced regulatory scrutiny since 2014.\u201d The energy secretary added that, while Sellafield has said it had no evidence of having been a victim of a successful cyber-attack on its systems by state-sponsored hackers, she asked for \u201cfurther reassurance on this matter\u201d from Sellafield, its regulator the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre. \u201cI would like to see the NDA provide further assurance that cybersecurity threats are treated with the highest level of priority and that threats that do emerge are properly recorded and acted upon,\u201d her letter states. The government has also formally requested an update on a range of activities at the site, including work on cleaning up leaking silos of radioactive sludge and liquid after a report by the Guardian on growing safety concerns. Coutinho\u2019s opposite number, Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband, had called for government action after the Guardian\u2019s reporting. He said the revelations were \u201cvery concerning\u201d and involved allegations of the utmost seriousness. \u201cThe government has a responsibility to say when it first knew of these allegations, what action it and the regulator took, and to provide assurances about the protection of our national security,\u201d Miliband said. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson also warned on Tuesday of the risks posed by hostile states to the UK\u2019s most sensitive infrastructure. \u201cThe National Cyber Security Centre has warned of the cyber threat to our critical national infrastructure for some time,\u201d they said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve worked closely with UK business organisations to improve cybersecurity and resilience across a range of sectors.\u201d They added that \u201cregulators have reassured the government that public safety is not compromised at Sellafield and the public should be reassured of that. I can\u2019t get into more detail on that particular intelligence or details of the specific incident.\u201d Politicians from other opposition parties also expressed concerns. Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green party, which opposes nuclear power, said: \u201cThis toxic legacy of nuclear weapons and nuclear power poses a serious risk to life and public health as well as poisoning relations with other countries, especially Norway, that would be devastated by a radioactive plume if ever there was a major incident at Sellafield. \u201cThis is Europe\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site, so the government must put in place the investment needed to make it as safe as possible.\u201d A spokesperson for Sellafield said in response to the Guardian\u2019s reporting: \u201cWe take cybersecurity extremely seriously at Sellafield,\u201d and that it was working on improving its capabilities, adding that the site was \u201cproud\u201d of its safety record. \u201cThe nature of our site means that, until we complete our mission, our highest hazard facilities will always pose a risk,\u201d the spokesperson said. Sellafield is understood to argue that the leaking silo poses \u201cno additional risk\u201d to staff and the public."

            "content": "Ministers are under pressure to explain the actions of the government and regulators over cybersecurity at Europe\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site after a Guardian investigation revealed disturbing vulnerabilities in its networks. The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, called on the government to urgently \u201cprovide assurances\u201d about Sellafield, after the Guardian revealed it had been hacked by groups linked to Russia and China. The investigation also disclosed how Sellafield is in effect in \u201cspecial measures\u201d because of concerns about cybersecurity and its regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, put the site into \u201csignificantly enhanced attention\u201d for cybersecurity. The hack and its potential effects have been consistently covered up by senior staff at Sellafield, and have emerged in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into the vast nuclear waste and decommissioning site. The investigation also found that external contractors had been able to plug memory sticks into the system while unsupervised. The problem of insecure servers at Sellafield was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain, according to a government official familiar with the ONR investigation. The disclosures have triggered concerns in Westminster over the government\u2019s handling of the site, which has the largest store of plutonium on the planet and absorbs about \u00a32.5bn a year of the energy department\u2019s budget. Miliband said: \u201cThis is a very concerning report about one of our most sensitive pieces of energy infrastructure. It raises allegations that must be treated with the utmost seriousness by government. \u201cThe government has a responsibility to say when it first knew of these allegations, what action it and the regulator took and to provide assurances about the protection of our national security. Miliband said Labour would \u201cmake cybersecurity a top priority, protecting our institutions and public services\u201d. Angus MacNeil, an independent MP and chair of the energy security committee, said: \u201cThis is concerning news for me, not just as chair of the energy security committee but also as a member of the joint committee on the national security strategy where cyber-attacks have been the subject of our investigations. \u201cThe most concerning part is that Sellafield seems not to have been open with the regulatory authorities about the security breaches, trying to improve matters themselves without perhaps the best of help which also lays them open to charges of \u2018cover-up\u2019. From now on that culture has to change at Sellafield.\u201d A National Cyber Security Centre spokesperson said to the media: \u201cThe NCSC has warned of the enduring and significant cyber threat to the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure for some time, including in our latest annual review. \u201cWe work closely with all areas of the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure and engage with organisations to highlight the threat landscape and mitigation activities as part of our routine operations.\u201d A spokesperson from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cMany of the issues raised are historical and the regulator has for some time been working with Sellafield to ensure necessary improvements are implemented. We are expecting regular updates on how this progresses.\u201d The ONR said Sellafield was \u201ccurrently not meeting the high standards that we require in cybersecurity\u201d and that some \u201cspecific matters are subject to ongoing investigations\u201d. A Sellafield spokesperson said: \u201cWe take cybersecurity extremely seriously at Sellafield. All of our systems and servers have multiple layers of protection. \u201cCritical networks that enable us to operate safely are isolated from our general IT network, meaning an attack on our IT system would not penetrate these. \u201cOver the past 10 years we have evolved to meet the challenges of the modern world, including a greater focus on cybersecurity.\u201d The spokesperson added Sellafield is \u201cworking closely with our regulator\u201d and has an \u201cagreed route to step down from \u2018significantly enhanced\u2019 regulation\u201d. Before publication of news of the hack, Sellafield and the ONR declined to answer a number of specific questions or say if Sellafield networks had been compromised by groups linked to Russia and China. After publication, they said they had no records to suggest Sellafield\u2019s networks had been successfully attacked by state actors in the way the Guardian described."

            "date": "2023-12-19T06:00:17Z",
            "content": "The GMB trade union has called on the government and nuclear authorities to take \u201curgent action\u201d to address concerns over safety at Sellafield. The union has written to the energy minister, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and Sellafield\u2019s chief executive to demand greater investment into keeping the 11,000 employees at the vast nuclear rubbish dump in Cumbria safe. Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed a catalogue of concerns over safety at the sprawling 6 sq km (2 sq mile) site in north-west England. Sources familiar with risk reports at the site have said they showed that more than 100 safety problems are a matter of serious regulatory concern. They include fire safety deficiencies such as a lack of functioning alarms in parts of the site that contain radioactive material. There have been work stoppages due to a lack of suitably qualified staff trained in nuclear safety and increasing numbers of contamination and radiation protection incidents The issues emerged in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into problems spanning cyber hacking and toxic workplace culture at Sellafield, which also revealed the site has a worsening leak from a huge silo of radioactive waste. GMB, which represents tens of thousands of workers across the energy industry, said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the reports of leaks and cybersecurity failings at the site. GMB national secretary Andy Prendergast said that its members at Sellafield had been raising concerns over a string of problems for years. These included a \u201clack of training and competence among staff, inadequate safety procedures and a culture of fear and intimidation\u201d. \u201cGMB has repeatedly raised concerns over safety and staffing levels, which are mainly due to turnover and the age and demographic of the workforce,\u201d Prendergast wrote. A senior industry source has said that a hardcore of longstanding Sellafield employees who are resistant to change have been nicknamed \u201cWe Bees\u201d \u2013 short for \u201cwe be here when you be gone\u201d. Several sources have cited the area\u2019s insular community and reliance on Sellafield for well-paid employment as a barrier to change. In his letter to Claire Coutinho, secretary of state for energy security and net zero, which was also sent to Sellafield\u2019s chief executive, Euan Hutton, and the NDA chief, David Peattie, Prendergast called for the trio to take \u201curgent action to address these concerns\u201d. In response to the Guardian\u2019s reports, Coutinho wrote to Peattie this month saying allegations about failings in cybersecurity, site safety and workplace culture at Sellafield were \u201cserious and concerning\u201d and needed \u201curgent attention\u201d. Her intervention followed the revelation that Sellafield was hacked by groups linked to China and Russia and that the industry regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, had put the site into \u201csignificantly enhanced attention\u201d for cybersecurity. In his response, Peattie told Coutinho: \u201cI can assure you that there is no compromise to public safety, and no complacency when it comes to addressing requisite improvements to cyber security and site safety and ensuring a zero-tolerance approach toward bullying and harassment of staff.\u201d He said Sellafield had \u201cno record or evidence of any such cyber-attack which resulted in malware on Sellafield systems\u201d. Peattie said Sellafield would have a new head of cybersecurity in place from January. A Sellafield spokesperson said: \u201cSafety is our overriding priority at Sellafield. We are proud of our safety record and we are always striving to improve. \u201cOur chief executive officer Euan Hutton has worked closely and collaboratively with our site-based trades unions, including GMB, throughout his tenure. \u201cNone of the issues detailed in this letter have been raised during this engagement in the terms described. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to note that our independent regulator has confirmed historic cultural issues have not led to unsafe activities at Sellafield.\u201d The spokesperson said the number of \u201csafety professionals\u201d on site had grown in recent years. They disputed statistics included in the GMB\u2019s letter, and said Sellafield had an \u201copen door policy\u201d with its trade unions, GMB, Prospect and Unite. It has previously said employees are \u201cempowered to raise issues and challenge when things aren\u2019t right\u201d. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cThe energy security secretary wrote to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and spoke with both their CEO and the regulator, who provided assurances there have been no successful cyber-attacks at Sellafield. She has also requested regular updates on work to improve cyber-security and tackle workplace culture concerns.\u201d"

            "content": "The UK\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site, Sellafield, has been hacked into by cyber groups closely linked to Russia and China, the Guardian can reveal. The astonishing disclosure and its potential effects have been consistently covered up by senior staff at the vast nuclear waste and decommissioning site, the investigation has found. The Guardian has discovered that the authorities do not know exactly when the IT systems were first compromised. But sources said breaches were first detected as far back as 2015, when experts realised sleeper malware \u2013 software that can lurk and be used to spy or attack systems \u2013 had been embedded in Sellafield\u2019s computer networks. It is still not known if the malware has been eradicated. It may mean some of Sellafield\u2019s most sensitive activities, such as moving radioactive waste, monitoring for leaks of dangerous material and checking for fires, have been compromised. Sources suggest it is likely foreign hackers have accessed the highest echelons of confidential material at the site, which sprawls across 6 sq km (2 sq miles) on the Cumbrian coast and is one of the most hazardous in the world. The full extent of any data loss and any ongoing risks to systems was made harder to quantify by Sellafield\u2019s failure to alert nuclear regulators for several years, sources said. The revelations have emerged in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and toxic workplace culture at Sellafield. The site has the largest store of plutonium on the planet and is a sprawling rubbish dump for nuclear waste from weapons programmes and decades of atomic power generation. Guarded by armed police, it also holds emergency planning documents to be used should the UK come under foreign attack or face disaster. Built more than 70 years ago and formerly known as Windscale, it made plutonium for nuclear weapons during the cold war and has taken in radioactive waste from other countries, including Italy and Sweden. The Guardian can also disclose that Sellafield, which has more than 11,000 staff, was last year placed into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d for consistent failings on cybersecurity, according to sources at the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the security services. The watchdog is also believed to be preparing to prosecute individuals there for cyber failings. The ONR confirmed Sellafield is failing to meet its cyber standards but declined to comment on the breaches, or claims of a \u201ccover up\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cSome specific matters are subject to ongoing investigations, so we are unable to comment further at this time.\u201d In a statement, Sellafield also declined to comment about its failure to tell regulators, instead focusing on the improvements it says it has made in recent years. Labour\u2019s shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Ed Miliband, said it was a \u201cvery concerning report about one of our most sensitive pieces of energy infrastructure\u201d. \u201cIt raises allegations that must be treated with the utmost seriousness by government,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has a responsibility to say when it first knew of these allegations, what action it and the regulator took and to provide assurances about the protection of our national security.\u201d The problem of insecure servers at Sellafield was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain, according to a government official familiar with the ONR investigation and IT failings at the site, because it was so sensitive and dangerous. It involved highly sensitive data that could be exploited by Britain\u2019s enemies. Sellafield\u2019s server network was characterised by the official as \u201cfundamentally insecure\u201d. The scale of the problem was only revealed when staff at an external site found that they could access Sellafield\u2019s servers and reported it to the ONR, according to an insider at the watchdog. Other concerns include external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into the system while unsupervised. In one highly embarrassing incident last July, login details and passwords for secure IT systems were inadvertently broadcast on national TV by the BBC One nature series Countryfile, after crews were invited into the secure site for a piece on rural communities and the nuclear industry. The ONR has prepared a notice of prosecution for Sellafield on cybersecurity \u2013 a form of enforcement action it can only take if it believes there is \u201csufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction\u201d. Cyber problems have been known by senior figures at the nuclear site for at least a decade, according to a report dated from 2012, seen by the Guardian, which warned there were \u201ccritical security vulnerabilities\u201d that needed to be addressed urgently. It found that security resources at the time were \u201cnot adequate to police the internal threat [from staff] \u2026 let alone react to a significant increase in external threat\u201d. More than a decade later, staff at Sellafield, regulators and sources within the intelligence community believe systems at the vast nuclear waste dump are still not fit for purpose. They also believe that there was a deliberate effort by senior leaders to conceal the scale of the problems posed by cybersecurity problems at the site from security officials tasked with testing the UK\u2019s vulnerability to attack in recent years. This is the subject of potential prosecution. Security officials are also concerned that the ONR has been slow to share its intelligence on cyber failings at Sellafield because they indicate that its own scrutiny has been ineffective for more than a decade. The latest annual report from the ONR stated that \u201cimprovements are required\u201d from Sellafield and other sites in order to address cybersecurity risks. It also confirmed that the site was in \u201csignificantly enhanced attention\u201d for this activity. The ONR said it had found cybersecurity \u201cshortfalls\u201d during its inspections and noted that it had taken \u201cenforcement action\u201d as a result. Such is the scale of cybersecurity concern, some officials believe entire new systems should be urgently built at Sellafield\u2019s nearby emergency control centre \u2013 a separate secure facility. Among the highly sensitive documents stored at Sellafield are disaster manuals, plans that guide people through emergency nuclear protocols and what to do during a foreign attack on the UK. These documents include some of the learnings from a variety of sensitive operations, including Exercise Reassure in 2005 \u2013 and the regular Oscar exercises \u2013 which were aimed at testing the UK\u2019s ability to handle a nuclear disaster in Cumbria. The ONR was so concerned by the fact that external sites could access Sellafield\u2019s servers, and an apparent cover-up by staff, that it interviewed teams under caution. The Sellafield board held an inquiry into the problem in 2013 and the ONR warned that it would require more transparency on IT security. Cyber-attack and cyber espionage by Russia and China are among the biggest threats to the UK, according to security officials. The most recent National Risk Register, an official document that outlines the key hazards the UK could face, includes a cyber-attack on civil nuclear infrastructure. Attackers from hostile states have targeted allies in the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence sharing community in recent years. The US has been attacked, with its government agencies, including its energy department, targeted via file-transfer software in June this year. The UK\u2019s cyber wing of GCHQ, which has offices in central London and is part of the domestic intelligence network with headquarters in Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, has warned of a heightened risk of cyber-attack on critical national infrastructure from Russia and China. Growing government concern over Chinese involvement in UK critical national infrastructure has resulted in the Chinese state-owned energy company CGN being removed from the Sizewell C nuclear project in Suffolk and Huawei products being stripped from the heart of the telecommunications network in recent years. That has reversed a spell of close Anglo-Sino relations, which culminated in the then prime minister, David Cameron, hailing a \u201cgolden era\u201d between the countries and drinking beer with the Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, in a Buckinghamshire pub in 2015. Rishi Sunak\u2019s government has championed expanding the country\u2019s nuclear industry after the energy crisis, picking up where his predecessor Boris Johnson left off. Earlier this year, the then energy secretary, Grant Shapps, launched Great British Nuclear, a body designed to provide new nuclear power plants. A generation of new nuclear projects will ultimately require an expansion of Britain\u2019s decommissioning activities. Nuclear decommissioning, a large share of which is done at Sellafield, is one of the biggest drains on the UK government\u2019s annual business department budget. The site costs about \u00a32.5bn a year to operate. Decommissioning is such a huge, long-term bill that it was examined as a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d to the UK\u2019s economic health by the spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility. It is estimated it could cost as much as \u00a3263bn to manage the legacy of the UK\u2019s nuclear energy and weaponry industries. This figure shifts wildly depending on how future cashflow is calculated, and the OBR has warned that the long-term costs of Sellafield could vary by as much as minus 50% to plus 300%. A Sellafield spokesperson said: \u201cWe take cybersecurity extremely seriously at Sellafield. All of our systems and servers have multiple layers of protection. \u201cCritical networks that enable us to operate safely are isolated from our general IT network, meaning an attack on our IT system would not penetrate these. \u201cOver the past 10 years we have evolved to meet the challenges of the modern world, including a greater focus on cybersecurity. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with our regulator. As a result of the progress we\u2019ve made, we have an agreed route to step down from \u2018significantly enhanced\u2019 regulation.\u201d An ONR spokesperson said: \u201cSellafield Ltd is currently not meeting the high standards that we require in cybersecurity, which is why we have placed them under significantly enhanced attention. \u201cSome specific matters are subject to ongoing investigations, so we are unable to comment further at this time.\u201d Prior to publication, Sellafield and the ONR declined to answer a number of specific questions or say if Sellafield networks had been compromised by groups linked to Russia and China. Following publication, they said they had no records to suggest Sellafield\u2019s networks had been successfully attacked by state actors in the way the Guardian described. A spokesperson from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cWe expect the highest standards of safety and security as former nuclear sites are dismantled, and the regulator is clear that public safety is not compromised at Sellafield. \u2028\u201cMany of the issues raised are historical and the regulator has for some time been working with Sellafield to ensure necessary improvements are implemented. We are expecting regular updates on how this progresses.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-06T17:34:15Z",
            "content": "Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation, has uncovered problems with cyber hacking, radioactive leaks and toxic workplace culture at Sellafield, the UK\u2019s most hazardous nuclear site. It has also revealed how a small corner of the UK has an outsized influence on its special relationship with the US, with the countries bound by the shared history of nuclear weapons development. Britain\u2019s neighbours in Europe, particularly Norway and Ireland, also keep a sharp eye on the site, from where previous pollution incidents and radioactivity as a result of a fire have made it to their shores. What is Sellafield? The taxpayer-funded site in Cumbria, in the remote north-west coast of England, has the largest store of plutonium on the planet and is a huge nuclear decommissioning and waste dump, handling the remains of decades of atomic power generation and nuclear weapons programmes. It also takes in nuclear waste from countries including Italy, Japan and Germany \u2013 which is then processed, packaged and sent back. Originally named Windscale, the industrial complex dates back to the cold war arms race, and was the original site for the development of nuclear weapons in the UK in 1947, manufacturing plutonium, as Britain raced to build an atomic bomb. It was the scene of one of Europe\u2019s worst nuclear disasters, the Windscale reactor fire in 1957, which carried a plume of toxic smoke across to the continent. It was also home to the world\u2019s first full-scale commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall, which was opened in 1956 and ceased generating electricity in 2003. The site, which has almost 1,000 buildings, has a workforce of 11,000, with its own railway, road network, laundry services for normal and potentially radioactive garments, and its own police force with more than 80 dogs. Great Britain still has a group of nuclear power plants, majority owned by France\u2019s EDF, which generate about 16% of the electricity for the power network. The UK is also building new nuclear power stations, including Hinkley Point C in Somerset, although their waste will eventually be buried in a new geological disposal facility. What are the cybersecurity concerns? A Guardian investigation found that Sellafield has been hacked into by cyber groups closely linked to Russia and China and that its potential effects have been consistently covered up by senior staff. The hack was one of a series of cyber issues at the site, and was covered up by senior managers. Other concerns included external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into the system while unsupervised and staff at remote sites being able to access its computer servers. The UK\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), put the site into a form of \u201cspecial measures\u201d for consistent failings on cybersecurity. Sources said cyber breaches were first detected as far back as 2015, when experts realised sleeper malware \u2013 software that can lurk and be used to spy on or attack systems \u2013 had been embedded in Sellafield\u2019s computer networks. It is still not known if the malware has been eradicated. It may mean some of Sellafield\u2019s most sensitive data on activities, such as moving radioactive waste, monitoring for leaks of dangerous material and checking for fires, have been compromised. What is leaking? The investigation revealed a worsening leak of radioactive liquid from one of the \u201chighest nuclear hazards in the UK\u201d \u2013 a decaying silo from which radioactive material is leaking into the ground. The leak is likely to continue to 2050. The Guardian also revealed concerns about B30, a pond containing nuclear sludge from corroded nuclear fuel rods, whose concrete and asphalt skin is ribboned with cracks. These cracks have worsened in recent months, according to sources. Why are Norway, Ireland and the US so worried and how bad could it get? Concerns over safety at Sellafield have caused diplomatic tensions with countries including the US, Norway and Ireland. Norwegian officials are concerned that an accident at the site could lead to a plume of radioactive particles being carried by prevailing south-westerly winds across the North Sea, with potentially devastating consequences for Norway\u2019s food production and wildlife. Radioactive contamination from the 1957 Windscale fire reached Norway\u2019s shores. In 2006, the Irish government tried to take action against Sellafield by referring it to a UN tribunal over concerns about Sellafield\u2019s impact on the environment. An EU report in 2001 warned an accident at Sellafield could be worse than Chornobyl, the site of the 1986 disaster in Ukraine that exposed five million Europeans to radiation. The report warned that events that could trigger an atmospheric release of radioactive waste at the plant included explosions and air crashes. Fire safety is a key area of concern. The Guardian investigation revealed an internal document in November 2022 warned of a \u201ccumulative risk\u201d posed by failings in a range of areas, from nuclear safety to managing risks from fire and asbestos. \u201cThey can\u2019t handle fire or asbestos on site, let alone the crumbling of nuclear containment materials,\u201d one senior Sellafield employee told the Guardian. On the hack, sources have said the full extent of any data loss and any ongoing risks to systems was made harder to quantify by Sellafield\u2019s failure to alert nuclear regulators for several years. On the leaking silo, a report in June from the ONR said the risk from the leak was deemed by Sellafield to be \u201cas low as reasonably practicable\u201d. But scientists who have spoken to the Guardian are increasingly concerned that the full scale of the leak, and the rate at which it may pollute the groundwater, is unclear. What has the UK government said? Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, wrote to the chief executive of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, David Peattie, saying revelations by the Guardian about failings in cybersecurity needed \u201curgent attention\u201d. She said: \u201cThe allegations are a worrying reminder of the longstanding nature of some of these issues, specifically cybersecurity at Sellafield.\u201d On the toxic ponds, she said she has also asked Sellafield to \u201cinform me of what efforts have been taken to increase the pace of this work\u201d. The UK government\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre said: \u201cThe NCSC has warned of the enduring and significant cyber threat to the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure for some time, including in our latest annual review. \u201cWe work closely with all areas of the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure and engage with organisations to highlight the threat landscape and mitigation activities as part of our routine operations.\u201d What has Sellafield said? Sellafield has said it is \u201cworking closely with our regulator\u201d on cybersecurity. \u201cAs a result of the progress we\u2019ve made, we have an agreed route to step down from \u2018significantly enhanced\u2019 regulation,\u201d a spokesperson said. Prior to publication, Sellafield and the ONR declined to answer a number of specific questions about cybersecurity or say if Sellafield networks had been compromised by groups linked to Russia and China. After publication, they said they had no records to suggest Sellafield\u2019s networks had been successfully attacked by state actors in the way the Guardian described. After publication, Sellafield also said that it had a \u201chigh degree of confidence that no such malware exists on our system\u201d. On the silo leak, Sellafield is understood to argue that it poses \u201cno additional risk\u201d to staff and the public. A Sellafield spokesperson said: \u201cWe are proud of our safety record at Sellafield and we are always striving to improve. \u201cThe nature of our site means that until we complete our mission, our highest hazard facilities will always pose a risk. \u201cWe continuously measure and report on nuclear, radiological, and conventional safety.\u201d"

            "content": "The US workforce added 199,000 jobs last month, a robust reading as the world\u2019s largest economy continues to grapple with higher interest rates. Employment growth has been fading this year after the Federal Reserve launched an aggressive campaign to pull back inflation from its highest levels in a generation. Official data has bolstered hopes that the central bank will manage to guide the US economy to a so-called \u201csoft landing\u201d, where price growth normalises and recession is avoided. Economists had expected non-farm payrolls to increase by about 180,000 jobs in November, up from a reading of 150,000 in October. Friday\u2019s report still amounts to a deceleration from earlier in the year, and is short of the average reading for 2023. The headline unemployment rate stood at 3.7%, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, down from 3.9% the previous month. It comes as policymakers plot the next steps of their campaign, with inflation slipping back towards the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Some investors have expressed hope that the central bank will start cutting rates as soon as next year. Jerome Powell, chairman of the Fed, stressed last month that it was \u201ccommitted to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2% over time, and to keeping policy restrictive until we are confident that inflation is on a path to that objective\u201d. Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said November\u2019s jobs data was boosted by the end of two large strikes, the United Auto Workers six-week strike and the months-long actions by US writers and actors. \u201cPayroll gains were inflated by returning strikers in November, but the underlying pace of job growth has slowed in recent months,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s encouraging for the Fed, which has likely ruled out further rate increases. However, the details in the rest of the report were robust enough in our view to keep rate cuts off the table for several more months.\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe trend in the unemployment rate is still upwards, consistent with people\u2019s reported nervousness about the labor market, and we have to expect a rebound to new highs over the next few months.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-22T07:38:26Z",
            "content": "Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have come under renewed pressure to cut interest rates early in the new year after official figures showed an increasing likelihood of a recession in the UK and a drop in inflation in the US. Analysts said the US Federal Reserve would struggle to resist calls for lower interest rates in the first half of 2024 after the central bank\u2019s preferred measure of inflation fell to 3.2% in November from 3.4% in the previous month. The Bank of England was also expected to face demands for lower borrowing costs after official figures released on Friday appeared to show a tightening of monetary policy this year had pushed the economy to the brink of a recession. An assessment that gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the third quarter \u2013 down from the previous estimate of no growth \u2013 will be a blow to Rishi Sunak, who has promised to get the economy growing as one of his fives pledges to voters before an expected general election next year. GDP for the second quarter was also revised down to zero growth, from a previous estimate of 0.2% expansion, while the latest assessment of the economy showed it shrank 0.3% in October and inflation fell to 3.9% in November. An economy is considered to be in a technical recession after two consecutive quarters of contraction in GDP, and a further contraction in the fourth quarter would push the UK into that category. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said a poorer than previously assessed performance by small companies, film production, engineering and design and telecommunication and the IT sector accounted for much of the revision. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said he believed the economy was poised to rebound: \u201cThe medium-term outlook for the UK economy is far more optimistic than these numbers suggest. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen inflation fall again this week, and the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] expects the measures in the autumn statement, including the largest business tax cut in modern British history and tax cuts for 29 million working people, will deliver the largest boost to potential growth on record.\u201d His Labour counterpart, Rachel Reeves, dismissed Hunt\u2019s analysis, saying the latest figures were an example of Sunak\u2019s record of failure as prime minister. \u201cHe failed to beat Liz Truss, he failed to cut waiting lists, he failed to stop the boats and now he has failed to grow the economy,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cThirteen years of economic failure under the Conservatives have left working people worse off, with higher bills, higher mortgages and higher prices in the shops.\u201d City analysts were agreed that an already weak performance by the UK economy this year had been found to be worse than previously thought, despite a larger rise in consumer spending than earlier estimates showed. They also expect Bank of England\u2019s 14 interest rate rises over the last two years, taking the cost of borrowing from 0.1% to 5.25%, to have taken a bigger toll on the corporate sector and household spending than previously thought. Separate figures for UK retail sales volumes in November provided a lift, beating City forecasts of a 1.3% fall to register a modest 0.1% increase year on year after a 0.3% increase since October. Black Friday sales proved to be better than City forecasts, and discounting on furniture, carpets and other household items drew shoppers back to the high street. However, the retail analyst Nick Bubb said he remained sceptical that the ONS had a strong grasp of trends in retail spending, which other surveys showed remained weak going into the festive period. The weaker GDP data came the day after Hunt told the Financial Times: \u201cIf we stick to the course we\u2019re on, we\u2019re able to bring down inflation, the Bank of England might decide they can start to reduce interest rates\u201d next year. Martin Beck, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said GDP was dealt a big blow after an estimate of business investment in the third quarter was cut to 3.2% from 4.2%. He said the downturn was likely to influence the central bank and force it to cut rates early next year. \u201cThe Bank of England [is likely to] retreat from its hawkish rhetoric, meaning interest rates could be cut earlier and more significantly than many had been anticipating.\u201d With a reduction in interest rates next year expected to boost consumer spending, the economy could rebound in 2024. \u201cSo, a worse-than-expected performance this year should be balanced by a better outlook for 2024 and 2025,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Right, with London\u2019s stock market closed until the 27th December, it\u2019s time to wrap up for today. And what a day it has been, with Britain\u2019s economy sliding closer to the long-feared recession after growth fell slightly in the July-September quarter. Should the economy also contract in October-December, the UK will be in a technical recession. Here\u2019s the full story, and our analysis: Here\u2019s our news story on the latest fare rises which will hit passengers in England next March: And here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s stories: We\u2019ll be back after the festive break, next week. Have a lovely Christmas! Good luck if you\u2019re trying to get home. GW Over in New York, the S&amp;P 500 index of US stocks has opened a little higher, as investors welcome the drop in the US PCE inflation measure: The UK is perilously close to meeting the technical definition of a recession after GDP shrank in July-September, our economics editor Larry Elliott writes, adding: Whether or not a recession materialises, the bigger picture is that since growing by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2022 the economy has gone nowhere. In the second and fourth quarters of 2022 it grew by 0.1%; in the third quarter it fell by 0.1%. Growth of 0.3% in the first three months of 2023 has been followed by the weakness in the second and third quarters. The GDP figures are bad news for Rishi Sunak. At the start of 2023, one of the prime minister\u2019s five pledges was that he would have the economy growing by the end of the year. That pledge has not been met, and it will be of little comfort to the prime minister that other European countries are also recession candidates. More here. The dollar has slipped to a near five-month low against a basket of other currencies, after the US PCE inflation measure fell by more than expected today. That indicates traders believe softer inflation will pave the way for cuts in US interest rates next year. The pound is up 0.3% to $1.273. Workers at UK car dealership Lookers have just received some sickening pre-Christmas news. Lookers said today it may cut about 945 jobs, or 14.5% of its total workforce, as part of an ongoing strategic review following a deal to sell itself to Global Auto Holdings, Reuters reports. Lookers, which sells new and used cars and vans, in July agreed to a buyout offer of \u00a3504.2m from Global Auto, the entity related to privately owned Canadian car dealer Alpha Auto Group. The company said in a statement that: \u201c(Global Auto and Lookers) have to date identified areas that require restructuring and which will require a redundancy programme to be undertaken,\u201d Mark Raban will step down as CEO and Oliver Laird as CFO, Looker said. There\u2019s still time for more important economic data before we shut down for Christmas. And over in the US, the Federal Reserve\u2019s favourite inflation measure has just shown that price pressures are easing. The PCE price index measure rose by 2.6% in the year to November, down from 2.9% in October. On a monthly basis, prices fell by 0.1% during November. Core PCE (which excludes food and energy) slowed to an annual rate of 3.2%, down from 3.4% in October. That may cheer the Fed, as it looks for signs that it is winning the battle against inflation. Tina McKenzie, Policy Chair at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), says the 4.9% increase in English rail fares announced today is \u201cunfortunate\u201d \u2013 and that firms will want see the money used to improve the rail services. McKenzie explains; \u201cRail is essential for small businesses and the self-employed, providing transport for employees, suppliers and customers. For small business owners who are already shouldering numerous rising costs, any increase is unfortunate and is not the festive gift they were hoping for as we head towards Christmas. \u201cWhile the annual fare change is lower than using the normal formula linked to the previous summer\u2019s inflation rate, 4.9% is still significantly above the current level of inflation at 3.9% and so passengers and commuters will still feel the pinch. We would urge ministers to bear down on future rises so that staff, contractors and visitors to small businesses can viably continue to choose rail to move around the country. \u201cAfter the cancellation of HS2, and with small firms now set to take the strain of another fare rise in Spring, they will be looking to ministers to show that money raised from the price hikes makes tangible changes that significantly improves their journeys. \u201cWe want to see available and reliable services, as well as a joined-up system that works alongside other transportation, and a restructured and affordable ticketing system.\u201d London\u2019s stock market has closed for Christmas, although we didn\u2019t get much of a Santa Rally today. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed just 2.8% higher tonight at 7697, up 0.04%. Retail stocks dragged on the index, after Nike alarmed traders by revising down its sales forecast last night. JD Sports remained the top faller, down 5.1%. The more UK-focused FTSE 250 index of medium-sized stocks gained 60 points, or 0.3%, even though the UK economy is on the brink of recession. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, says: \u201cSanta might be coming to town, but investors aren\u2019t really feeling the festive spirit. \u201cGloomy UK data and one eye on core inflation numbers due out in the US later are sending stocks lower. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise to see a whole host of retailer\u2019s shares tumbling this morning with JD Sports and Frasers group two of the biggest losers. \u201cBoth are also likely to be feeling the whiplash from Nike\u2019s dismal predictions and its plans to shave a whopping $2 billion of costs in a bid to shore up its finances. \u201cSales over the last quarter have looked rather subdued as retailers kept backroom stock levels low and the Chinese consumer turned to domestic competitors as relations between the US and China remained frosty. \u201cNike has an incredibly powerful brand but it has saturated the market, so cutting back on the number of products it makes would seem sensible and could create more hunger for its products from an uber savvy consumer.\u201d The TUC have accused the government of being \u201ctone deaf\u201d to ongoing cost of living crisis, by signing off a 4.9% rise in rail fares in England next year. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak said: \u201cToday\u2019s excessive hike sums up everything that is wrong with our rail network. Ministers are tone deaf to the ongoing cost-of-living crisis that remains a real burden on working people right across the economy. UK passengers are already paying the highest fares in Europe in return for late-running, overcrowded and routinely cancelled trains.\u201d Watchdog London TravelWatch is calling for reforms to the UK rail fare system, following the news of a 4.9% price hike in England from March. A spokesman for London TravelWatch said: \u201cThese new rail fares will see already hard-pressed passengers hit with another unwelcome price hike. \u201cReform to rail fares and ticketing could not be more urgent now. \u201cGovernment needs to set out an alternative vision that makes public transport appealing \u2013 this includes affordable fares, rolling out contactless payment options, and improving train service punctuality so passengers are getting real value-for-money.\u201d The 4.9% increase announced today relates to regulated fares, which make up around 45% of rail fares. They include commuter fares such as season tickets and shorter distance peak singles and returns, and also longer-distance off peak singles and returns. Unregulated fares are set by train operators, although their decisions are heavily influenced by the Government due to contracts introduced following the coronavirus pandemic. More transport news: rail customers in England can expect many rail fares to rise by almost 5% next spring. The Department for Transport has announced that regulated rail fares in England will increase by up to 4.9% from March 3 next year. Rail passengers may question whether the service is 4.9% better (especially if they were caught up at the chaos at Euston yesterday). But the government points out that this is a smaller rise than a year earlier, when fares rose by 5.9%. They are calling today\u2019s announcement \u201ca significant intervention\u201d, as the increase is lower than last summer\u2019s inflation rate, which has been used to set rail fares in the past. Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: \u201cHaving met our target of halving inflation across the economy, this is a significant intervention by the Government to cap the increase in rail fares below last year\u2019s rise. \u201cChanged working patterns after the pandemic mean that our railways are still losing money and require significant subsidies, so this rise strikes a balance to keep our railways running, while not overburdening passengers. \u201cWe remain committed to supporting the rail sector reform outdated working practices to help put it on a sustainable financial footing.\u201d Regulated rail fare increases have traditionally been linked July\u2019s reading of the retail prices index inflation measure, which was 9.0%. The UK are also making changes to protect Britain\u2019s small mammals, by relaxing rules around where small wildlife warning signs can be put up. The DfT has also spruced up the small animal warning sign, adding white quills to the hedgehog\u2019s back to make it more noticable. Harper announced the move on a visit to Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital in Buckinghamshire\u2026. The broader picture for the UK economy is significantly bleaker than suggested by the 1.3% month-on-month rise in retail sales in November (see 7.10am post), says Cameron Misson, economist at the CEBR. Misson explains: \u201cNovember\u2019s rise in retail sales were markedly stronger than consensus expectations, which will be welcome news for the sector ahead of the all-important festive period. The contraction in output in Q3 2023 suggests that the economy is on the verge of a technical recession. Cebr previously forecasted a technical recession across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, however, today\u2019s downward revisions suggest that the contractionary period has started one quarter sooner than expected.\u201d At the risk of dampening the Christmas mood further, London Underground workers ae set to stage a series of strikes in the new year in a dispute over pay. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) have voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action over a 5% pay offer. Engineering and maintenance workers will be taking action over January 5/6, with no rest-day working or overtime until January 12. London Underground control centre and power/control members will be taking action over January 7/8, and fleet workers will walk out on January 8. Signallers and service controller members will take action on January 9 and 12 while all fleet, stations and trains grades will walk out on January 10. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said Tube workers who help bring \u201cvast amounts of value\u201d to the London economy were not going to put up with senior managers and commissioners \u201craking it in\u201d, while they were given \u201cmodest below-inflation offers\u201d. Similar planned strikes have been called off in recent months; in October, a walkout was cancelled after negotiations at Acas made progress. But if not, commuters and Londoners could face a tricky start to the new year. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, says the -0.1% drop in UK GDP in the third quarter is a warning that we could yet see the widely anticipated UK recession in 2023. Mahony adds: A year ago, markets were looking towards the UK as a likely source of economic weakness, with both the IMF and Bank of England predicting the UK economy to shrink over the course of 2023. For the most part the UK has outperformed expectations, with the Germany instead looking at risk of a recession this year. Nonetheless, the third quarter -0.1% decline now sees the UK treading the same pathway as the German, French and wider eurozone economies. From a monetary policy standpoint, this does feed into the narrative that we will see a more dovish narrative from the ECB and Bank of England, with the current growth and inflation trajectory allowing for a pivot next year. Chinese Tesla rival BYD has said it will build a new vehicle factory in Hungary, in a sign of the carmaker\u2019s increasing focus on the European market, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes. The manufacturer, which is the world\u2019s second-largest producer of electric cars, said it would create thousands of jobs in the city of Szeged, southern Hungary, in a statement on its official WeChat account on Friday morning. BYD, which is backed by US investor Warren Buffett, is one of the companies leading the race to dominate the industry for electric vehicles as countries rapidly move away from fossil fuel cars. It has set its sights on being the biggest seller of electric cars in Europe. The manufacturer already produces a wide array of products in China, ranging from hybrid cars that combine a battery and an internal combustion engine, to buses and lorries powered by its batteries. It is also a key supplier of batteries to other car companies. However, its planned assault on the European car market has caught the attention of local rivals as well as European politicians who fear that jobs could be lost to China. The EU has launched an investigation into Chinese state subsidies for electric vehicles, a move that could eventually allow it to impose restrictions on imports. A factory within the EU could allow BYD to avoid some measures. BYD\u2019s talks with the Hungarian government were first reported by the Financial Times. BYD already has a bus factory in Hungary. Some analysts expect it to overtake Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of pure battery electric vehicles. It already makes more cars than Tesla when including hybrids. Bloomberg\u2019s Tom Rees points out just how poorly the UK economy has done this year: Fears that the UK has fallen into recession have been heightened after official figures were revised to show that the economy shrank slightly in the July to September period. The assessment that gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 0.1% in the third quarter \u2013 down from the previous estimate of no growth \u2013 will be a blow to Rishi Sunak, who has promised to get the economy growing as one of his fives pledges to voters before an expected general election next year. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said a poorer than previously assessed performance by small companies, film production, engineering and design and telecommunication and the IT sector accounted for much of the revision. More here. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak has warned that the UK economy is in a \u201cdoom loop\u201d, after GDP shrank by 0.1% in July-September. Nowak says: \u201cThis year ends with another set of dismal growth figures and with the UK teetering on the brink of recession. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. Our economy is stuck in a doom loop and working people are paying the price as unemployment rises and living standards fall. \u201cThe Conservatives got us into this mess. They don\u2019t have a plan for getting us out of it. Economic warning lights are also flashing in Germany this morning. House prices in Europe\u2019s largest economy have fallen at the fastest rate in at least 23 years, plunging by 10.2% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2023. That\u2019s the fastest decline in residential property prices compared to a previous quarter since the time series began in 2000, following a 6.8% drop in Janary-March, and 9.6% in April-June. Statistics body Destatis has also reported that new orders in Germany\u2019s construction sector slumped by 6.3% in October, month-on-month. This was driven by a 14.9% drop in building construction, which more than countered a 2.4% rise in civil engineering orders. Over in the stock market, shares in UK retailers are sliding in early trading, after gloomy financial results from Nike last night. JD Sports is leading the FTSE 100 risers, down 5%, while Frasers (which owns Sports Direct) is down 1.3% and discount retailer B&amp;M has lost 1%. Last night, sportswear giant Nike cut its annual sales forecast blaming cautious consumer spending, a weaker online business and more promotions, and said it would cut costs by $2bn over the next three years. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains: \u201cNike has cut its full-year sales forecast, sending shares sharply lower, down by nearly 12% after hours, wiping out its gains from the past month. It expects fiscal full-year revenue to increase by around 1%, below its previous guidance and analysts\u2019 estimates for around 3-4%. It reported quarterly net income of $1.6 billion, beating estimates but revenue hit $13.39 billion, just shy of estimates. The sportswear giant is aiming to achieve $2 billion in savings over the next three years and it is launching new styles to try to boost customer demand. Nike said there was a \u2018bifurcation\u2019 in performance with some periods of weakness and others of strength, particularly around key shopping events like Singles Day and Black Friday. Currently, the FTSE 100 share index is up just 2 points, or 0.03% \u2013 so not much sign of the traditional Santa rally\u2026. The UK economy is on both the naughty and nice list following this morning\u2019s data, says Investec economist Ellie Henderson. Henderson says this morning\u2019s national accounts (showing a fall in GDP), and November\u2019s retail sales figures (showing 1.3% month-on-month growth), are \u201ca tale of two halves\u201d, adding: The national accounts release indicated an economy which is progressing slower than was first reported, making a winter recession far more likely, but the retail sales report for November sprinkled a little bit of festive cheer, blasting past consensus. On the GDP side, growth in Q3 has been revised down, now reporting negative quarterly growth, at -0.1%. Although this means a winter recession is far more probable, this really is a matter of semantics: to two decimal places, the original release had in fact already shown GDP to have contracted by -0.03%. The story remains that economic growth has been subdued. Quarterly GDP growth for Q2 was also revised down, now reporting no growth on the quarter (prior: +0.2%). Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at the University of Liverpool, has spotted another worrying point in today\u2019s GDP report: Today\u2019s GDP revision, which indicates the potential start of a recession in the third quarter of 2023, will worry policymakers for an additional reason: the ONS has revised downwards 2023Q3 four-quarter GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points (from 0.6% to 0.3%, that is). Historically (from 1973 onwards, that is), the ONS has revised four-quarter GDP growth upwards by an annual average of 0.7 percentage points! Today\u2019s GDP reading goes against the historical \u201cnorm\u201d which adds extra uncertainty about the future outlook of the UK economy and, in my view, strengthens the voice of those, including myself, who believe that an interest rate cut will be on the cards by March 2024! The fall in UK GDP in July-September will reinforce expectations in the City of London that the Bank of England will cut interest rates several times in 2024. This morning, the money markets are predicting that UK interest rates will be cut by 1.4 percentage points in 2024. That implies that rates could be cut as low as 3.75% by December 2024, down from 5.25% today. Today\u2019s quarterly national accounts shows that GDP per head shrank by 0.3% in July-September, worse than the headline fall of 0.1% in GDP. In April-June, when the economy stagnated, GDP per capita fell by 0.1%. Today\u2019s updated GDP report shows that household spending fell in July-September. There was a fall of 0.5% in real household expenditure in Quarter 3 2023, revised down from a first estimate fall of 0.4%, the ONS says. This was driven by lower spending on miscellaneous goods and services, spending on restaurants and hotels, spending on food and non-alcoholic drink, and spending on furniture and household equipment. Several experts are warning that the UK is at real risk of a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d \u2013 defined as two quarters of falling GDP in a row. Here\u2019s Interactive Investor\u2019s Victoria Scholar: And Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway: However\u2026 definitions of a recession vary, with some analysts arguing that it means more than just a few months of contraction. In the US, the National Bureau of Economic Research gets to decide when the US economy is in recession \u2013 and can make this declaration long after the downturn has actually hit. The Financial Times now takes the same approach \u2013 here\u2019s the FT\u2019s Chris Giles. Today\u2019s GDP downgrades show that Britain has barely avoided a recession so far this year. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot, warns that growth is moving in the wrong direction (given we also know GDP shrank in October). Carter says: \u201cONS data this morning reveals UK GDP fell by a surprise 0.1% in Q3 compared to the previous quarter, revised down from a first estimate of no growth, highlighting just how much of a strain there currently is on the UK economy. Q2 was also revised down and is now estimated to have shown no growth compared to the 0.2% increase previously estimated, meaning the UK has barely scraped by without a recession in 2023. \u201cGrowth is weakening and interest rates are really beginning to bite and while a recession has just been avoided to date, there is no guarantee one will be avoided in 2024. You just have to look at October\u2019s -0.3% reading to see that growth is trending further in the wrong direction. Inflation has eased more than anticipated and interest rate predictions are suggesting more easing than originally thought in 2024, but the damage may already have been done. Certainly, Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to grow the economy is now severely in doubt. The 0.1% fall in real GDP in Q3 may mean that the mildest of mild recessions started in Q3, says Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics. Webb adds: But whether or not there is a small recession, the big picture is that we expect real GDP growth to remain subdued throughout 2024. The news that Britain\u2019s GDP shrank in July-September means Rishi Sunak will end the year having failed to deliver on his pledge to grow the economy, Labour says. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says: \u201cRishi Sunak is a Prime Minister whose legacy is one of failure. He failed to beat Liz Truss, he failed to cut waiting lists, he failed to stop the boats and now he has failed to grow the economy. \u201cThirteen years of economic failure under the Conservatives have left working people worse off with higher bills, higher mortgages and higher prices in the shops. \u201cIt\u2019s time for change. The Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, has a long-term plan to grow the economy and make working people better off.\u201d Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has claimed that the medium-term outlook for the UK economy is \u201cfar more optimistic\u201d than today\u2019s GDP data shows. Hunt adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen inflation fall again this week, and the OBR (Office for Budget Responsibility) expects the measures in the autumn statement, including the largest business tax cut in modern British history and tax cuts for 29 million working people, will deliver the largest boost to potential growth on record.\u201d ONS Director of Economic Statistics Darren Morgan says that Britain\u2019s TV and film industry had a worse time in July-September than first estimated. Explaining why GDP has been revised down this morning, Morgan says: \u201cThe latest data from both our regular monthly business survey and VAT returns show the economy performed slightly less well in the last two quarters than our initial estimates. The broader picture, though, remains one of an economy that has been little changed over the last year. \u201cThe latest VAT data, which takes a little time to receive and process means we now estimate the economy showed no growth in the second quarter, with weaker performances from smaller businesses, particularly those in both hospitality and IT than first shown. \u201cWe also now estimate the economy contracted slightly in the third quarter, when we previously reported no growth, with later returns from our business survey showing film production, engineering &amp; design and telecommunications all performing a little worse than we initially thought.\u201d We have been covering the struggles in the UK\u2019s film production sector in recent months, which has forced some workers to seek other jobs: The ONS has also reported that retail sales volumes across Great Britain rose by 1.3% in November 2023. That follows no growth in October (revised from a fall of 0.3%). Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: \u201cRetail sales grew strongly in November as heavy Black Friday discounting encouraged shoppers to spend. However, with the three-month trend continuing to fall and overall sales still below pre-pandemic levels, it\u2019s still a challenging time for retailers. \u201cIn the latest month, household goods retailers, clothing shops and department stores all reported robust sales, with computer stores, sports equipment, toy shops and cosmetics stores particularly benefitting from the impact of their Black Friday promotions. \u201cSupermarket sales ticked up a little, but it was specialist food and drink stores that had a really strong November due to customers stocking up early for Christmas and spending more than we have traditionally seen at this time of year.\u201d NEWSFLASH: The UK economy is on the brink of recession, after new data shows GDP shrank slightly in the third quarter of the year. The Office for National Statistics has revised down its estimate for the economy in July-September. It now estimates that UK GDP fell by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2023, down from the previous estimate of no growth. The downgrade is because the UK services sector is now estimated to have fallen by 0.2% in the third quarter of 2023, revised down from a first estimate fall of 0.1%. The ONS says: In output terms, there was a 0.2% fall in the services sector in the latest quarter, which offset a 0.4% increase in construction output and a 0.1% increase in the production sector. In another blow, GDP is now estimated to have shown no growth in Q2, revised down from the previous estimate of +0.2% growth. A technical recession is two quarters of contraction in a row, so if GDP falls in October-December, the UK will be in recession. We already know that the economy shrank in October, by 0.3%, The latest healthcheck on the UK property sector shows that sales and demand across the UK were almost a fifth higher in the final weeks of 2023 than a year earlier as sentiment improved. My colleague Julia Kollewe reports: The property website Zoopla said new sales agreed were 17% higher in December than this time last year, when higher mortgage rates hit market activity. Demand is up 19%, measured by would-be buyers contacting agents to inquire about and arrange viewings for a specific property listed on Zoopla. An increase in the number of homes for sale is increasing choice and supporting sales, it said. Zoopla recorded an annual house price fall of 1.1% across the country this month, with a steeper drop in London, of 1.5%, to an average price of \u00a3536,800. In the capital, prices were up 0.3% in the City while Croydon, Bromley and Woking posted the biggest price declines, of 3.5%, 3.4% and 2.8% respectively. More here. In a boost to the UK economy, Britain\u2019s car industry has posted its best November output since 2020. UK car production grew by 14.8% in November with 91,923 cars leaving factory gates, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders reports. Production was lifted by easing supply chain problems, and increased demand from abroad. The SMMT says: Production for both the home and overseas markets increased, up 13.4% and 15.2% respectively. 22,919 cars stayed in the UK though, as always, exports drove volumes. Export growth was driven mainly by the EU, China and Turkey, although Europe received by far the bulk (60.8%) of all shipments, reinforcing the need for tariff-free electrified vehicle trade across the Channel. Overnight, UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt applied a little pressure to the Bank of England to consider cutting interest rates in 2024. Speaking to the Financial Times yesterday, Hunt suggested that the BoE could start to reduce borrowing costs next year, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a reasonable chance that if we stick to the course we\u2019re on, we\u2019re able to bring down inflation, the Bank of England might decide they can start to reduce interest rates. That probably is the moment when people will begin to have more confidence about their own personal prospects and the prospects of their family.\u201d Hunt also hinted at tax cuts next year, telling Bloomberg that falling debt interest costs may give him the necessary headroom. 2024, of course, will almost certainly be an election year (unless Rishi Sunak hangs on until January 2025), so the government may hope that falling interest rates and cuts to the tax burden would revive their approval ratings. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. It\u2019s the final day of stock market trading before Christmas, but there\u2019s still time for an important update on the health of the UK economy. At 7am, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) will publish its latest quarterly national accounts for the UK, giving detail into how the economy fared in July-September (Q3 2023). The first estimate of third-quarter GDP was released last month, showing the economy stagnated. Today\u2019s report will probably confirm that, City economists estimate. But it\u2019s not impossible that the headline figure will be revised up, or down \u2013 and a downgrade would mean the economy shrinking, putting Britain on the brink of recession. Dan Hanson, senior UK economist at Bloomberg Economics, warned earlier this week that there is a chance of a downgrade. \u201cThe ONS is likely to confirm that GDP stagnated in the third quarter, but we do think there is some risk output is revised lower. The first estimate showed GDP fell, just not by enough to tip the rounding, and since then the retail sales data has been revised down. The statistics wouldn\u2019t need to find much more weakness for GDP to register a 0.1% fall.\u201d The ONS will also release the latest retail sales figures at 7am, with economists predicting a 1.3% fall, year-on-year, in November, as households cut back amid the cost of living squeeze. Also coming up today Britain\u2019s transport network will be doing its best to get passengers home for Christmas, after yesterday\u2019s turmoil. The strike which suddenly halted Eurostar trains running between London and Paris was ended last night, as unions reached an agreement with management. Eurostar is promising to run six extra trains between Paris and London into the weekend \u2013 an extra two trains each on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Passengers hoping to travel from London Euston could continue to face disruption after services were cancelled on Thursday following damage to overhead electric wires.

            "content": "Britain\u2019s economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.3% in October as households and businesses came under growing pressure amid the cost of living crisis, raising the chances of a recession. The Office for National Statistics said that gross domestic product (GDP) fell on the month, after growth of 0.2% in September, with contractions across all main sectors of the economy. City economists had forecast zero growth. The UK\u2019s dominant services sector was the biggest driver of the fall in output, with declines in IT, legal firms and film production. These were compounded by widespread falls in manufacturing and construction after poor weather led to a drop in activity. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the figure \u201csuggests that the economy may go nowhere again in the fourth quarter, or perhaps is in the mildest of mild recessions\u201d. The figures come as the Bank of England prepares to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday for a third consecutive time against a backdrop of stubbornly high inflation and growing concerns over the impact of 14 previous increases on households and businesses. While inflation has fallen back in recent months, officials at Threadneedle Street, including the Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, have warned that borrowing costs will need to remain high for a prolonged period to ensure it falls back to the 2% target set by the government. Inflation fell back from 6.7% in September to 4.6% in October. Official figures for November are due to be released on Wednesday next week. The decline in the headline rate does not mean prices are going down, only that they are rising less rapidly. With Rishi Sunak having met his primary target to halve inflation this year, the government has focused attention in recent months on his other pledge of rebooting economic growth from among the weakest periods for national output in decades. With a general election looming, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announced \u00a320bn of tax cuts for workers and businesses targeted at growing the economy. However, economists said the prime minister was in danger of his growth target failing to be met. The Bank has also warned that Britain\u2019s economy faces a 50-50 chance of a recession next year as higher living costs and elevated interest rates weigh heavily on households and businesses. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cRishi Sunak ends the year having failed to deliver on his own promise to grow the economy. Economic growth is going backwards, leaving working people worse off. \u201cAfter 13 years the Conservatives have failed on the economy and after the chaos of the past few weeks Rishi Sunak is clearly too weak to deliver for Britain.\u201d The latest snapshot from the ONS showed output over the three months to the end of October flatlined, with zero growth compared with the three months to July. Alongside a 0.2% decline in service sector activity in October, output in production \u2013 which includes manufacturing and energy generation \u2013 fell by 0.8%, while activity in construction shrank by 0.5%. Five of the six industries in the IT sector fell, with the largest contributions coming from computer programming and consultancy, as well as films, video and TV production. Legal activities recorded a sharp 2.8% decline, in a slump partly offset by gains in administrative and support activities. Suren Thiru, the economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said the figures suggested the economy was unravelling even before the full force of interest rate increases from the Bank of England fed through to households and businesses. \u201cOctober\u2019s negative outturn puts the prime minister\u2019s target to get the economy growing in jeopardy, with high inflation and borrowing costs likely to suppress economic activity in November and December.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-12-05T12:51:16Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s ability to repay its government borrowing has been downgraded by the credit rating agency Moody\u2019s, which said the ripple effects from a crisis in the property sector would undermine efforts to revive its flagging economy. Moody\u2019s warned that Beijing would need to bail out local and regional governments and state-owned enterprises that were struggling with rising debts, hampering efforts to boost investment and growth. The rating agency downgraded its outlook for Chinese sovereign bonds from stable to negative on Tuesday, sending a signal to potential lenders that the risk of a default by Beijing has increased over the past year. China\u2019s finance ministry said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Moody\u2019s decision when the economy was on the mend. It said the agency\u2019s concerns were \u201cunnecessary\u201d when the recovery \u201chas been advancing steadily\u201d. The world\u2019s second-biggest economy had been slowing before a 2020 crackdown on excessive borrowing that followed a series of debt defaults by dozens of property developers. Without the revenues from rising real estate values and property transactions, local government finances have come under pressure. State enterprises that need loans to fund expansion have struggled to access credit from lenders affected by growing property defaults. On Monday, the property developer Evergrande was granted an extension until late January to try to restructure its debts and avoid liquidation. Once the largest developer in China, the company reportedly owes more than $300bn (\u00a3237bn), much of it to individuals whose properties were never built. Moody\u2019s said the need for government intervention to support banks and local governments poses \u201cbroad downside risks to China\u2019s fiscal, economic and institutional strength. The outlook change also reflects the increased risks related to structurally and persistently lower medium-term economic growth.\u201d The changes in the property sector represent \u201ca major structural shift in China\u2019s growth drivers\u201d, and could be a more significant drag to overall economic growth rate than expected, it said. Factors such as \u201cweaker demographics\u201d, as the population ages, will probably drive a decline in potential growth to about 3.5% by 2030, Moody\u2019s said. China\u2019s bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic has faltered this year after an initial burst of activity \u2013 in part from bumper exports of coal to replace banned Russian gas \u2013 faded faster than expected. The credit rating agency said it expects China\u2019s economy to grow at a 4% annual pace in 2024 and 2025, well below the 6% to 7% average in the 10 years before the pandemic. Moody\u2019s move underscores deepening global concerns about the level of debt in the world\u2019s second-largest economy. It maintained China\u2019s credit rating at A1, which is its fifth-highest rating \u2013 the top \u201cupper medium grade\u201d \u2013 meaning China comfortably held on to its \u201cinvestment grade\u201d score. But lowering the outlook is a sign that the credit rating could be cut in future. Shares retreated in China on Tuesday, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index dropping 1.9% and the Shanghai Composite down 1.7%."

            "content": "A climate protest group backed by a cadre of Hollywood film-makers is preparing to take action against \u201ccowards\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d of all political stripes as the 2024 election approaches. Climate Defiance, which disrupted events featuring a string of Biden administration officials this year, and targeted Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil, in December, will consider protesting at events staged by both Democrats and Republicans on the campaign trail after concluding that its \u201cvery disruptive\u201d action was bearing fruit. In an interview, Michael Greenberg, the group\u2019s co-founder, told the Guardian it will also focus \u201cmore and more\u201d on state-level demonstrations designed to deter policymakers from approving fossil fuel projects. Since demonstrating outside the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner in the spring, its activists have staged protests at events featuring a string of senior federal officials, including the transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, and the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm. Climate Defiance has also interrupted two separate public appearances by the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. It is now recruiting for an organizing director to help coordinate \u201cdisruptive, nonviolent direct action to resist fossil fuel extraction\u201d, according to a job advertisement. \u201cIf we were a new group asking nicely, we\u2019d be a random no-name group and the White House could just have conversations with groups a hundred times our size who did the same thing,\u201d said Greenberg, 30. \u201cWhy would they talk to us?\u201d Instead, the group claims its demonstrations at high-profile events have got it a seat at the table. Ali Zaidi, the national climate adviser, has been on the phone. It also targeted David Turk, the deputy energy secretary, who invited Greenberg to a meeting days later. \u201cThe reason they\u2019re willing to meet with us is they know we are really intense and really strident,\u201d said Greenberg. He said the fundamental goal of his group was to build the climate crisis into a top US political issue, \u201calong with racial justice and kitchen table economic issues\u201d. The administration is taking note \u2013 and Climate Defiance is increasingly confident this interest can be traced all the way to the Oval Office. \u201cCongressman Ro Khanna said that the president is talking about us,\u201d Greenberg added. A Department of Energy spokesperson said: \u201cTo solve the climate crisis, we must engage with a diverse variety of stakeholders. Candid, substantive and constructive discussions among states, local leaders and climate organizations can create paths to work together to address this existential crisis threatening humanity, create economic opportunity for our nations and save our planet.\u201d The Climate Emergency Fund, which has backed disruptive climate groups including Extinction Rebellion, has provided Climate Defiance with about $225,000 in funding. The group has received \u201croughly\u201d the same amount from other donors, Greenberg said. The fund\u2019s directors include the film-makers Rory Kennedy, daughter of former US attorney general and senator Bobby Kennedy, and Adam McKay, director of The Big Short, Vice and Don\u2019t Look Up. Jeremy Strong, the Succession actor, joined the board in December. As the presidential election campaign intensifies, Climate Defiance plans to deploy its playbook on the trail in an effort to drive the climate crisis up the agenda. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to make climate change a top three issue in this election cycle,\u201d said Greenberg. The group has targeted Democrats in the Biden administration because \u201cthey\u2019re the administration in power\u201d, he said. Will it turn its attention to Republican events at polling day draws closer? \u201cWe just might,\u201d Greenberg replied, with a laugh. \u201cI will not comment on that.\u201d The Federal Reserve and Powell, a Trump appointee, will also remain in the group\u2019s sights. Climate Defiance wants the central bank to crack down on the lenders financing fossil fuel projects, but the Fed has so far insisted such moves would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d. \u201cThe banks are getting a free pass to torch the planet, and the Fed is doing nothing about it,\u201d said Greenberg. Powell, in his view, is \u201ceither asleep at the wheel or in bed with the fossil fuel CEOs\u201d. While a spokesperson for the Fed declined to comment, Powell\u2019s personal frustration over the protests has been evident. \u201cJust closing the fucking door,\u201d he could be heard saying on a hot mic while he was ushered offstage in November. Reappearing a few minutes later, Powell did not directly address the protest. \u201cOK, where was I?\u201d he said."

But as 2023 draws to a close it leaves a legacy in print, in books about the US political scene that help explain the crises that engulf us. February brought The Lincoln Miracle, Edward Achorn\u2019s in-depth examination of the 16th president\u2019s quest for the Republican nomination in 1860. Beautifully written, Achorn\u2019s book reminds us that outcomes are not preordained and that elections bring consequences. Achorn also shows that the battle between red and blue America is now more than 160 years old. The party of Lincoln, however, is no more. Jonathan Karl, chief Washington correspondent for ABC News, had two books on Trump behind him before Tired of Winning. Well-paced, meticulously sourced and amply footnoted, Karl\u2019s latest shines another light on how the Republican party has been recast by a man now under multiple felony indictments. Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s brain and muse, a leading voice of the far right, talked on the record. He stressed that as long as Trump lives, the party belongs to him. Confronted by a grandee who suggested Trump play less of a role in the run-up to the 2022 midterms, Bannon unloaded: \u201cHave you lost your fucking mind?\u201d If Trump defeats Biden, Bannon may well return to the West Wing. Loyalty to Trump has emerged as a cardinal tenet of Republican life. In Enough, Cassidy Hutchinson, the White House aide who became the lead January 6 witness, offers a persuasive, dispiriting tale of political degradation. Hutchinson \u201cisn\u2019t crazy\u201d, a Trump White House veteran confided before her first public appearance in front of the January 6 committee. But she is a \u201ctime bomb\u201d. True on both counts. McKay Coppins\u2019s Romney: A Reckoning is a must-read for anyone interested in how the Republican party became a Trumpian mess. Picking up where he left off in The Wilderness, his earlier look at the GOP, Coppins, a veteran Romney-watcher now at the Atlantic, offers an engaging read, the product of 30 interviews with the 2012 presidential nominee, access to aides and friends and also the senator\u2019s emails and diaries. Coppins offers a scorching critique, capturing Romney strafing Trump and Newt Gingrich, Ted Cruz and Mike Pence. Adam Kinzinger represented a Republican Illinois district in the US House for six terms. He voted to impeach Trump for the January 6 insurrection, and with Liz Cheney was one of two Republicans on the investigating committee. Like Cheney, from Wyoming, Kinzinger earned the ire of Trump and the GOP base. Both are no longer in Congress. Renegade, Kinzinger\u2019s memoir, written with Michael D\u2019Antonio, biographer of Pence, is a steady, well-crafted read. In the year of the Republican shadow primary, before voting begins next month, presidential aspirants past and present gave their spin too. Mike Pompeo, ex-congressman, CIA director and secretary of state, wrote Never Give an Inch. Tart and tight, filled with barbs, bile and little regret, it was an unexpectedly interesting read. Pompeo did give an inch to reality, though, accepting there was no point mounting a run. On the other side of the aisle, with The Last Politician, Franklin Foer provides a well-sourced look at Biden. A staff writer at the Atlantic and former New Republic editor, Foer captures successes and cock-ups. The 46th president is caught wondering why John F Kennedy was not so tightly handled by his aides \u2013 or \u201cbabied\u201d. Less than a year from election day, Biden trails Trump at the polls. Chris Whipple\u2019s The Fight of His Life is a flattering portrait of Biden. Ron Klain, his first chief of staff, hails \u201cthe most successful first year of any president ever\u201d, adding: \u201cWe passed more legislation than any president in his first year.\u201d Many remain unimpressed. Inflation scars remain visible. The retribution impeachment looms. Hunter Biden is under felony indictment. With Filthy Rich Politicians, Matt Lewis skewers both sides of the aisle. A senior columnist at the Daily Beast, Lewis performs a valued public service, shining a searing light on the gap between the elites of both parties and the citizenry in whose name they claim to govern. The book is breezy and readable. The Bidens and Clintons, the Trumps and Kushners, right and left \u2013 all are savaged. Michael Waldman ran the speechwriting shop in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House and now heads the Brennan Center at NYU. The Supermajority, his book about the conservative bloc that dominates the supreme court, is written with great verve. He takes the Citizens United decision to task for allowing unlimited political spending. He also argues that the court has become a serious threat to American democracy. *** Religion in politics garnered its share of attention this year, particularly evangelical Protestants. Sunday attendance is down but the movement retains political clout. In Losing Our Religion, the Rev Russell Moore, conservative but a Trump critic, laments the growing interchangeability between cross and flag, and the paganization of Christianity. \u201cThe step before replacing Jesus with Thor is to turn Jesus into Thor,\u201d he writes. Like the caesars of old, Trump is deified by his minions. In The Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, Tim Alberta poignantly and painfully captures the metamorphosis of US evangelism. A writer at the Atlantic and the son of a Presbyterian minister, Alberta lays bare his hurt over how Christianity has grown ever more synonymous with those who fervently wave the stars and stripes. He takes us back to summer 2019. The Rev Richard Alberta died suddenly. At his funeral, a church elder delivered to Alberta a one-page screed expressing his disapproval of the author for not embracing Trump. Alberta also delivers a deep-dive on the disgraced Jerry Falwell Jr and Liberty University. The media and the Murdochs remained in the spotlight too. In Network of Lies, Brian Stelter, the former CNN host, captured the Murdochs\u2019 struggle to make money, keep their audience happy and avoid liability. It wasn\u2019t easy: Fox News coverage of the 2020 election led to a $787.5m settlement of a defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems. Other litigations remain. Stelter had competition. In The Fall, Michael Wolff gave the Murdochs and Fox the treatment he gave Trump, memorably with Fire and Fury and two sequels. Wolff says he may be \u201cthe journalist not in his employ who knows [Murdoch] best\u201d. Quotation marks abound \u2013 whether the author was an actual witness is another matter. But The Fall is full of digestible dish. Elsewhere in the media, Marty Baron led the Washington Post as executive editor for eight years, retiring in 2021. Newsrooms he led won 17 Pulitzer prizes, 10 at the Post. Baron has stories to tell. The actor Liev Schreiber even played him in Spotlight, winner of the best picture Oscar in 2016. Collision of Power, Baron\u2019s first book, carried a tantalizing subtitle: \u201cTrump, Bezos, and the Washington Post\u201d. \u201cTrump and his team would go after the Post and everyone else in the media who didn\u2019t bend to his wishes,\u201d Baron writes. From the beginning, as Baron saw close up, Trump \u201chad the makings of an autocrat\u201d. In finance, with Going Infinite, Michael Lewis, author of Moneyball, The Big Short and other bestsellers, wrote about Sam Bankman-Fried, crypto and the scandal that saw the one-time billionaire convicted on seven counts of fraud. To politicians, as well as to profilers, Bankman-Fried had allure. Exactly why he continues to puzzle. Money doesn\u2019t explain everything, but it does shed light on plenty. Foreign policy impinged on domestic politics too, of course. Last spring, Israel marked its 75th anniversary, roiled by internal divisions. On 7 October, Hamas mounted a barbaric binge of rape, murder, plunder and hostage-taking. Israel\u2019s response continues. In May, Isabel Kershner of the New York Times painted a masterly and poignant portrait with The Land of Hope and Fear: Israel\u2019s Battle for Its Inner Soul. Attempting to make sense of a \u201cnational unraveling\u201d, she spoke with members of competing and clashing tribes. Wisely, she offered no sense of immediate resolution. None is on the horizon. *** Back home, Trump stands ready to plunge a knife into US democracy. A year ago, he called for terminating the constitution. More recently, he said he would be a dictator \u201con day one\u201d of a second term. He is the \u201cmost dangerous man ever to inhabit the Oval Office\u201d, Liz Cheney writes in Oath and Honor, her own memoir. The former congresswoman, a member of the Republican establishment, adds: \u201cThis is the story of when American democracy began to unravel. It is the story of the men and women who fought to save it, and of the enablers and collaborators whose actions ensured the threat would grow and metastasize.\u201d The book is well-timed. Iowa and New Hampshire vote next month. \u201cWe cannot survive a president willing to terminate our constitution,\u201d Cheney adds. Promoting her book, she warned that the US was \u201csleepwalking into dictatorship\u201d. In 11 months, we will find out how fast."

            "content": "Our rules-based world is the triumph of peace over war. At least, that\u2019s how the story has been told for the past eight decades. The promise of \u201cnever again\u201d has been the raison d\u2019etre for global institutions such as the United Nations and the international criminal court (ICC), which all like to trace their history to the moment when nations emerged from the ruins of the second world war and forged a lasting peace. Rising freedom and prosperity was understood to be the byproduct. Yet increasing numbers of people around the world no longer believe in that story. Its promise has been broken with the return of full-scale aggression by Russia, along with deteriorating violence and instability around the world. We are witnessing the horrors that this system was supposed to have long ago eliminated. International institutions now too often seem powerless, at best, to deal with the most serious challenges of our time. At worst, they are complicit in enabling them. With confidence rapidly fading, the entire system risks collapse. That would mean the return to an age of empires in which \u201cmight makes right\u201d, and everyone suffers. I now hear people around the world ask, with ever-increasing urgency, about how we can save our rules-based international system. I also hear frustrations that not everyone seems to be equally invested in saving it. But we cannot merely hope to save the existing rules-based international system from the crises that this system led us to, nor expect everyone to be passionate about something they do not feel is working for them. If it can fail once, it will fail again. It needs fundamental change. Russia\u2019s ongoing and barbaric war of aggression against Ukraine did not just break the system. It exploited some of its many flaws to degrade its apparently unenforceable norms and values. If that continues, we will all eventually lose interest in saving the system. In saving a rules-based system, we have to admit how, across Africa and parts of Europe, victims of imperial conquest feel disengaged from it. Similarly, during the second world war the smaller nations of eastern Europe found themselves forced into \u201cspheres of influence\u201d and had horrific aggression unleashed on them. As someone who grew up under that Soviet occupation, I understand how it feels to be shut off from the world and shut out from decisions affecting your own life and those around you. Our rules-based world is really a continuing story about how we free ourselves from big-power politics and the misery and devastation that it brings to everyone. That\u2019s a story we can all believe in. We can end big-power politics for good by ensuring everyone has the freedom to contribute to international decision-making. Individuals, communities, even entire nations and regions currently just don\u2019t have a proper say in the decisions that affect them. We need to forge an international system far more resilient to aggressors, but also far better equipped to deal with poverty, disease, and the climate crisis. That\u2019s why Estonia is calling for a new global conversation about how to make the world fit for freedom. First, we must strengthen the international rules-based order by admitting its flaws and ensuring it better reflects the realities of the 21st century. That includes reform of the UN. The security council needs additional permanent members to better reflect our modern world. It must also be reminded that it has primary, not exclusive, responsibility for international peace and security. We must protect the world from abusive veto-users. We can do that by supporting the French-Mexican initiative on veto restraint and the code of conduct by the accountability, coherence and transparency group on not voting against resolutions aimed at ending mass atrocities. But we need to be even more creative and ambitious. That\u2019s why, to get started, we propose forming a core group to analyse the course of action to be taken by the general assembly when a permanent member of the security council tramples on the UN charter. Just as seriously, the ICC has been left without jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, even though it was established as the supreme crime of international law at the Nuremberg trials of the Nazis, and finally defined by all nations in 2010. This is the most striking example of a broken international system that allows the open violation of its most basic of international principles with impunity. The Rome statute of the ICC needs to be reviewed to ensure accountability for this crime without legal restrictions. In the case of Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine, we need to urgently address this weakness now. The general assembly must take a lead. It has already repeatedly condemned Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine and agreed there must be accountability for international crimes. To enforce this, it must create a special tribunal now to deal with the crime of aggression. Second, we need to recognise that the countries that most seriously violate international commitments to other countries are also more likely to have already violated their own domestic commitments to their citizenry. The promotion of human rights and basic freedoms needs to become a natural part of global security policy. Human rights violations cannot simply be ignored in one country when, in reality, they disrupt global inclusion and present dangers to the stability of the wider global system. Fundamentally, it is about ensuring all people are protected from violence. This is essential for those more likely to face risks of harm as a result of their work, such as human rights defenders and journalists. It\u2019s also essential for marginal and vulnerable groups such as women and children, ethnic and religious minorities, refugees, migrants and those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. It is also about safeguarding freedom of speech, which includes both the freedom of the media and the freedom of the internet. Third, we must expand the inclusivity of international policymaking to make a world fit for freedom. That includes enabling the world\u2019s small states and civil society to have a greater say in international matters that are traditionally decided by big states and blocs. We are at a pivotal moment in world history. The only certainty is that the existing international system cannot survive unchanged much longer. However challenging the world becomes, remember that it was during the very darkest days of the second world war that the rules-based world was developed in its current iteration. In the spring of 1941, almost all of Europe had fallen to the totalitarian powers. While victory for the allies was far from certain, representatives of occupied and allied nations met in bombed-out London to \u2013 in their words \u2013 \u201cdefine some purpose more creative than military victory\u201d. The conversation they started gathered momentum globally and led to the creation of the UN, whose charter they began drafting even prior to D-day, as well as the Nuremberg trials, which laid the foundation for modern international law and the ICC. That conversation should never have been considered finished. We must not wait for a repeat of the devastation that they endured. We can and must continue the momentum that they started and inspire a new global conversation on making the world fit for freedom. Margus Tsahkna is Estonia\u2019s minister of foreign affairs"

            "content": "This has been a year of ghosts. At home, history returned to haunt British politics, with David Cameron recalled to government (why hello, ghost of Christmas past) and the Covid inquiry summoning Boris Johnson\u2019s period of rule (more like ghosts of Christmas parties). Abroad, the threat of a Trump comeback hangs over the US, while in Israel and Gaza an age-old conflict has been tragically revived. It\u2019s a fitting year, then, for writers using history to make sense of the present and none do so more movingly than the journalist and Conservative peer Danny Finkelstein in Hitler, Stalin, Mum and Dad (William Collins), an immigrant family\u2019s story of love and war, but above all, a passionate defence of moderate liberal values as a bulwark against violent extremes. His mother was a German Jew who miraculously survived a Nazi concentration camp; his father a Jew from Lvov in Poland (now Lviv in Ukraine), shipped off by the invading Russians to one of Stalin\u2019s gulags. The deliberately ordinary suburban life they eventually forged in Britain, after meeting and marrying, was an extraordinary victory over the odds, a reminder never to make assumptions about what lies behind unassuming front doors or underestimate the privilege of a quiet life. The three children of this marriage were understandably raised to believe in the importance of politics, which had meant literally life and death to their parents, but also to stand \u201cfor moderation against extremism. For reason over irrationality. For optimism and resilience, tempered by the memory of dictatorship and oppression but never overwhelmed by it,\u201d Finkelstein writes. They are values the former Tory minister-turned-podcaster Rory Stewart doubtless shares, but in Politics on the Edge (Jonathan Cape) he offers a more disillusioned if equally beautifully written take on putting them into practice, reflecting with \u201ca sense of shame\u201d on a frustrating Westminster career. Defiantly burning bridges as he goes \u2013 Michael Gove, George Osborne, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss all come off memorably badly \u2013 Stewart lists everything he thinks ails conventional politics: over-mighty party members, the prizing of simplicity over complexity, the way ministers are never in a job long enough to master either the brief or their civil servants. The Foreign Office deems him naive, and arguably has a point: Stewart comes across as an incurable 19th-century romantic, adrift in a world of soundbites and grubby compromises. Yet when he describes his time as a reforming prisons minister, under the thoughtful David Gauke, you glimpse how transformative government could be - at least until Stewart blows up his career for one last doomed stand against hard Brexit. (For the bigger picture on how that battle has shaped modern Britain, the Telegraph journalist Ben Riley-Smith\u2019s The Right to Rule (John Murray) \u2013 a majestic digested read of the last 13 years of Tory leadership, drawing together the threads of four premierships each defined by Brexit \u2013 will keep any politics junkie busy through Boxing Day). Heading into a general election year with change in the air, there are still surprisingly few authors looking ahead to a potential Labour future, pending the former journalist Tom Baldwin\u2019s hotly anticipated biography of Keir Starmer in February. But there are three early contenders for shadow cabinet bedside tables. The first is Sadiq Khan\u2019s Breathe (Cornerstone), in which London\u2019s mayor draws lessons learned from a sometimes controversial crusade against air pollution for climate policy more broadly. It\u2019s surprisingly funny, endearingly human, and honest about the pitfalls without making things sound hopeless. The second is former Labour minister Denis MacShane\u2019s Labour Takes Power (Biteback). This diary of the first Blair parliament is very much of its rather boozy, blokey time, and the author (for much of this time a junior Foreign Office bag-carrier) rarely underestimates his own importance. But it\u2019s an essential reminder of just how difficult governing is, even after a landslide: within months Blair had suffered a scandal over tobacco sponsorship, a backbench rebellion over benefit cuts, and an early foreign policy dilemma over Iraq, while by the end of the parliament MacShane notes rising tensions over eastern European immigration and what would prove a fatal reluctance to make the pro\u2011European case. Wes Streeting\u2019s memoir One Boy, Two Bills and a Fry Up (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) meanwhile rattles cheerfully through the extraordinary life story of the shadow health secretary, growing up in poverty in the East End as the grandson of a convicted bank robber \u2013 though it offers only rather guarded clues into his thinking as an adult. My favourite Labour book of the year, however, was the documentary-maker Linda McDougall\u2019s Marcia Williams: The Life and Times of Baroness Falkender (Biteback), a long-overdue revisiting of Harold Wilson\u2019s all-powerful political secretary and \u201coffice wife\u201d. (Widely thought to have been lovers in the 1950s, by the time Wilson became prime minister in 1964, McDougall argues, the pair had settled into a formidable political partnership.) The extraordinary story of how Williams carved an unprecedented role for herself inside a male-dominated world, while managing secretly to have two children by a married Daily Mail journalist and conceal the pregnancies from her colleagues, is one begging to be told by another woman, and McDougall brings nuance to it. She doesn\u2019t deny Williams could be bullying, melodramatic and difficult. But she asks the right questions about why a single mother in a highly pressured job, terrified of her secret emerging and reliant on a cocktail of amphetamines and Valium to get through the day, might seem emotionally volatile. A terrific read for anyone interested in how working women\u2019s lives have changed since the 1970s, in or out of politics. Talking of which, it\u2019s been a bumper year for books by or about female prime ministers. Harry Cole and James Heale\u2019s Out of the Blue (HarperCollins) is an irresistibly juicy account of Liz Truss\u2019s rapid rise and even more rapid downfall, doubling as a record of just how bad things got should anyone seek to rewrite history at the next Tory leadership contest. See also John Crace\u2019s Depraved New World (Guardian Faber), a collection of sketches of the last year of madness without which no Christmas stocking is complete. Theresa May\u2019s The Abuse of Power (Headline), meanwhile, isn\u2019t a conventional memoir but a serious-minded study of scandals in which vulnerable people were failed by those in authority, from the Grenfell fire to Hillsborough to the Rotherham grooming gangs. Though she gives herself too easy a ride over the Windrush catastrophe, it\u2019s an unusual look at power in its broadest sense aimed squarely at other women incensed by people not doing their jobs properly. I suspect May would approve of Cassidy Hutchinson, the 25-year-old White House aide who helped expose Donald Trump\u2019s role in whipping up a post-election mob to storm Capitol Hill. Raised a staunch Republican, in her book Enough (Simon &amp; Schuster), Hutchinson describes the dawning horror of realising what she\u2019s enabling by working for Trump, and her eventual decision that it\u2019s her democratic duty to testify against him. The brilliance is in the sleazy details: Trump refusing to wear a Covid mask because it smudged his makeup, or the chief of staff\u2019s wife complaining that his suits smelled of smoke from all the documents burned in the administration\u2019s last days. To read Hutchinson\u2019s descriptions of being stopped in the street by well-wishers, convinced her testimony had helped save America from something dangerous, is to feel faintly embarrassed that we\u2019re not more protective of Britain\u2019s own fragile democracy. Now there\u2019s a New Year\u2019s resolution. \u2022 To browse all politics books included in the Guardian and Observer\u2019s best books of 2023 visit guardianbookshop.com.

            "title": "Nikki Haley as first female US president? Unlikely but not impossible",
            "date": "2023-12-23T14:00:26Z",
            "content": "Could Nikki Haley become the first female president? Donald Trump is ending 2023 on quite the low. On Tuesday a Colorado supreme court ruling barred the former president from the state\u2019s presidential ballot, which drove him predictably bonkers. Then, to add insult to injury, he got some bad news from New Hampshire: Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and the woman Trump appointed to be his ambassador to the United Nations, is catching up to him in the polls. A new Saint Anselm College survey shows Haley with 30% support among likely Republican primary voters in the state, 14 points less than Trump. To be fair, Trump probably isn\u2019t quaking in his boots: he still has a sizable lead. But he can\u2019t be enjoying Haley\u2019s momentum. Business heavyweights have flocked to her; she\u2019s landed a coveted endorsement from New Hampshire\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Sununu; and her polling figures have doubled in three months. The 51-year-old is quickly becoming a viable candidate. So could she actually do it? Could Haley become the first female and first Indian-American president of the US? It\u2019s unlikely but not impossible. More important, however, it\u2019s not anything anyone vaguely to the left should wish for. Haley may be a woman (she\u2019s certainly been very happy to lean into her gender and ethnic background when it\u2019s convenient) but she\u2019s no friend to women or minorities. She\u2019s got reactionary views on abortion, immigrants and LGBTQ+ people. Her politics are just as hate-filled as Trump\u2019s are. She\u2019s just as opportunistic and self-serving as the former president. She just comes across as less obviously dangerous and extreme. Partly that\u2019s because she\u2019s not as mercurial, of course. Chaos doesn\u2019t follow her everywhere, like it does Trump. She\u2019s frequently described as the \u201cadult in the room\u201d because she acts like more of a grown-up than the other Republican contenders \u2013 which, to be honest, isn\u2019t saying much. But another reason so many people seem keen to paint her as a \u201cmoderate\u201d\u2013 when her politics are very much to the right \u2013 might be because she\u2019s a woman. Women are becoming increasingly prominent in the far right. Last year Giorgia Meloni, head of Italy\u2019s most rightwing government, became the first female prime minister of Italy. In France, Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally party, has gone from strength to strength. In the UK some of the most aggressively anti-immigrant policies have been voiced by brown women like Priti Patel and Suella Braverman. And one of the rising stars of the Conservative party in the UK is Kemi Badenoch, a Black woman who has styled herself as anti-woke culture warrior. The feminization of fascism isn\u2019t happenstance \u2013 it\u2019s highly strategic. \u201cIt is a trend Marine Le Pen started about 10 years ago \u2013 she softened the image of the party [the former Front National], getting rid of the unappealing aspects and the macho image,\u201d Dorit Geva, a sociologist at Central European University told DW last year. \u201cI think that women do play a huge, important role in mainstreaming more radical ideas,\u201d Seyward Darby, author of the book Sisters in Hate, similarly told Vice World News shortly after Meloni was elected. \u201cThey are \u2026 crucial to spreading the ideology with a smile and making it seem palatable \u2026 It\u2019s about putting a certain veneer on it, a certain gloss on it.\u201d It would be patronizing to say that women are being used by far-right organizations to soften their image, but they\u2019re certainly useful. Haley gives a veneer of respectability to an increasingly dysfunctional and dangerous GOP. Beneath her grown-up gloss, however, is the same old rot. It\u2019s 2023 and a woman with short hair is still shocking apparently Eve Gilles has become the first contestant with short hair ever to win Miss France and the usual suspects are very angry indeed about it. Sniffing women\u2019s tears makes men 40% less aggressive, new study finds This builds on previous research which showed that women\u2019s tears reduced levels of testosterone and self-reported sexual arousal in men. Judge orders release of over 150 names of people mentioned in Jeffrey Epstein lawsuit documents The list of names will be made public on 1 January 2024. A very unhappy start to the year for a lot of rich and powerful people! The couch-surfing predator A horrifying story: Dino Maglio, a former Italian police officer, hosted over 200 young women travelers he had connected with on couchsurfing.com at his home in Padua. He would lace their tea or wine with drugs and assaulted many of them. But then some of these women found each other and fought back \u2013 eventually securing justice against the odds. Being sexist makes you a worse parent Both mothers and fathers who firmly believe in traditional gender roles are less responsive parents, a new study has found.

            "title": "US will \u2018lose face before world\u2019 if it abandons Kyiv, says ex-Ukraine president",
            "date": "2023-12-11T05:00:10Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s former president Leonid Kuchma has warned that the US \u201cwill lose face before the entire world\u201d if it abandons Kyiv, and said mistakes by the west contributed to Vladimir Putin\u2019s all-out invasion last year. In his first interview with a western publication since 2015, Kuchma described Putin as a career KGB operative. \u201cIt\u2019s his profession, with everything that implies,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cPeople say his obsession with Ukraine is a kind of mania or mental disorder. Maybe it\u2019s true.\u201d On 24 February 2022, Kuchma and his wife, Lyudmila, were in the centre of Kyiv as Russia attacked. \u201cI was sure Putin was capable of invading but not sure whether he would decide to invade,\u201d he said. That morning they woke to explosions. \u201cIt was terrible, a shock. I saw two bombers flying over my head in the street.\u201d Putin\u2019s goal was not only to seize land but to destroy the \u201cconcept\u201d of Ukraine itself, as a \u201ccompetitive alternative to Russia\u201d, he said. \u201cThe proof of this is the terrible human losses and reputational sacrifices that Putin is willing to make for this,\u201d he suggested. Kuchma \u2013 a Russian-speaker from Ukraine\u2019s industrial south-east and the ex-director of a Soviet rocket factory \u2013 was president of Ukraine between 1994 and 2005. He signed two historic agreements with Russia that guaranteed Ukraine\u2019s post-USSR borders: the 1995 Budapest Memorandum and a 1997 treaty of friendship, negotiated with Boris Yeltsin, with whom he had good relations, and ratified by the Duma. The first indication of Moscow\u2019s revisionist ambitions came in 2003, Kuchma said. Putin, Russia\u2019s new president, laid claim to the small island of Tuzla in the Black Sea, between Crimea and the Russian mainland. On this occasion Putin backed down. He gave further \u201cclear signals\u201d of his intention to expand Russia\u2019s borders by force when he sent troops in 2008 into neighbouring Georgia. He followed this up in spring 2014 by seizing Crimea. \u201cIt was extremely unpleasant that the world didn\u2019t react. It was silent,\u201d Kuchma said. \u201cPutin understood that he could do anything because there was no principled response.\u201d Russia was able to seize further territory in the eastern Donbas region, he explained, beginning an almost decade-long Russo-Ukrainian war. Last week Kuchma said he turned on the TV at 3am and watched Republicans in the US Senate vote down a $61bn package of assistance for Ukraine. The Biden administration has warned that without further US military aid Putin will \u201cprevail\u201d on the battlefield, where Ukrainian troops are already running short of ammunition. \u201cWe have to hope Biden can get the legislation through. The US has lost Afghanistan. Defeat for Ukraine means the US loses face before the entire world,\u201d Kuchma said. Asked if Kyiv could win, at a time when international solidarity appears to be waning, he replied: \u201cI believe in victory. I can\u2019t exist in any other way.\u201d The former president said it was unrealistic to think Putin would agree to peace talks. He has already declared that four Ukrainian provinces in the south and east \u201cbelong\u201d to Russia, even though they are only partly under Moscow\u2019s control. He added: \u201cPutin can\u2019t sign a document which states that he didn\u2019t get what he wanted [in Ukraine]. He would have to explain this to the Russian people. He\u2019s the leader of Russia.\u201d Last month Kuchma, 85, published an updated edition of Ukraine is Not Russia, a book he wrote in 2003. The original edition was addressed to Russians and Ukrainians. Much of it now looks prophetic. He complained that Russian politicians saw his country as an \u201cindivisible part of Russia\u201d. They regarded Ukrainians as \u201cyokels\u201d and \u201ccountry cousins\u201d, with a quaint \u201cethnographic\u201d culture. The new version of Kuchma\u2019s book concedes that his efforts to enlighten ordinary Russians were \u201cin vain\u201d. They overwhelmingly supported Putin\u2019s \u201caggression\u201d and \u201cimperialist\u201d so-called special operation, he said. Asked why Ukraine resisted Russia last year, to the Kremlin\u2019s surprise, Kuchma answered: \u201cBecause Russians are not Ukrainians. They have a different mentality.\u201d He said the Russian way of thinking derived from the Mongols, who ruled early Moscow. Ukraine, by contrast, originated with Kyivan Rus, the ninth-century Orthodox princedom, whose legacy Putin controversially claims. \u201cFor centuries the west saw Ukraine exclusively through a Russian lens,\u201d Kuchma said, adding that Moscow used its size and natural resources to \u201chypnotise\u201d and \u201cbluff\u201d foreign leaders. Kuchma said he had never been \u201canti-Russian\u201d as a person and politician. He had tried to establish friendly \u2013 and equal \u2013 relations. This proved impossible because Russia under Putin wanted \u201cintegration\u201d rather than cooperation. The book details Kuchma\u2019s wartime childhood, growing up in a rustic village in Polesia, a northern forested region near the border with today\u2019s Belarus. His father died fighting the Nazis. Kuchma\u2019s widowed mother was a schoolteacher. Their family was poor. He carried water, tended the vegetable patch and grazed cows. In the 1950s he studied physics and became active in communist politics. Kuchma met his Russian wife at an organised weeding expedition. He became the director of Yuzhmash, Europe\u2019s largest missile factory. In the 1980s his awareness that he was Ukrainian and not Russian grew. After the Soviet Union fell apart, Kuchma became a Ukrainian MP, then prime minister and president. Critics accuse him of enabling oligarchs. One scandal haunted his administration. In 2000 the Georgian-Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze was kidnapped and murdered. His headless body was found in woods outside Kyiv. Tapes surfaced during which Kuchma allegedly discussed \u201csilencing\u201d Gongadze with senior aides. Four interior ministry officials were subsequently convicted of the killing. He denied involvement or appearing on the tapes. Supporters say he managed relations with Moscow more deftly than his successors. Kuchma\u2019s last controversial term in office ended with the 2004 Orange Revolution, brought about in part by the fallout from the Gongadze affair and amid accusations of authoritarianism and government thuggery. Thousands of protesters camped out in Kyiv\u2019s Maidan Square after Viktor Yanukovych, the Russian-backed candidate, whom Kuchma supported, fraudulently declared victory following presidential elections. Kuchma said Putin \u201cdirectly urged me to use force\u201d against unarmed demonstrators. \u201cI categorically refused,\u201d he told the Guardian. Yanukovych lost a rerun vote and became president in 2010. In 2014, faced with another Maidan uprising, Yanukovych was under similar pressure from Moscow. His security forces shot dead 100 people. \u201cPutin managed to persuade Yanukovyich to commit this crime. I have no doubt that it was their joint decision, a bilateral one,\u201d Kuchma said. Afterwards, Yanukovuch fled to Russia and Putin began his Ukraine land-grab. In 2019, Volodymyr Zelenskiy defeated Yanukovych\u2019s replacement, the oligarch Petro Poroshenko. \u201cUkraine is lucky to have Zelenskiy. In my analysis he is a sincere person. He was invited to leave Ukraine [when the Russians closed in on Kyiv] but stayed,\u201d Kuchma noted. Politics has returned in recent months in the wake of Ukraine\u2019s failed counter-offensive, and as an exhausted population grows ever more tired of war. Zelenskiy has ruled out holding elections next year. Kuchma said this was correct. \u201cOur homes are being bombed. Soldiers are in trenches. Five million Ukrainians live in Europe. You can\u2019t ask people to go out and vote in these circumstances. It\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIf they did happen I\u2019m sure Zelenskiy would win.\u201d There was no prospect Russia and Ukraine could be reconciled, he said. The full-scale war had \u201cunited\u201d Ukraine and erased the \u201ccontradictions\u201d that used to exist during his presidency between eastern and western regions. \u201cPeople hate Russia because of the suffering and loss. So many Ukrainians have died or got wounded.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s future was with the EU and Nato, he said, and not as part of a rebooted Russian empire. He finished with a warning to the west, and to those contemplating leaving Ukraine to its difficult fate. \u201cI want to say only one thing: we will not retreat. We will stand until the end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will never give up \u2013 no way. If you help us, we will win. If you stop helping us, we can die.\u201d He added: \u201cBut then you will be the next ones Russia wants to destroy.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 December 2023 to add contextual details about Leonid Kuchma\u2019s last term in office as president, including reference to the 2000 death of the Georgian-Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze."

            "title": "Expert says there\u2019s no evidence of fraud in Trump case as ex-president claims \u2018the bank loves us\u2019 ",
            "date": "2023-12-07T17:48:34Z",
            "content": "Donald Trump returned to his New York civil trial on Thursday as an accounting expert told the court there was \u201cno evidence whatsoever\u201d that the former US president and his family company committed fraud. It was the first time that Trump had attended the $250m fraud trial in over a month. Outside the court, Trump called the witness \u201cone of the greatest experts in the country.\u201d \u201cWe did nothing wrong. There were no victims. The bank loves us,\u201d Trump said. Eli Bartov, an accounting professor at New York University, told the court: \u201cMy main finding is that there is no evidence whatsoever of any accounting fraud.\u201d Letitia James, New York\u2019s attorney general, has accused Trump, his adult sons and other company executives of manipulating the value of the company\u2019s assets to obtain more favorable loans from banks. In one instance, the value of Trump\u2019s Manhattan triplex apartment was nearly tripled from $80m to $180m in one year. Bartov said his reading of the documents suggested this was an error and not an attempt to mislead. \u201cThere is no evidence here of concealment,\u201d Bartov said. \u201cIt\u2019s true this is an error. But it is no fraud.\u201d Bartov argued that the Trump organization\u2019s outside auditors had a duty to spot the errors, adding: \u201cMy analysis shows the statements of financial condition for all the years were not materially misstated.\u201d Asked if he thought the case had no merit, Bartov replied: \u201cThis is absolutely my opinion.\u201d State lawyer Kevin Wallace complained that Bartov\u2019s opinions strayed beyond his expertise, calling him \u201csomeone who\u2019s hired to say whatever they want in this case\u201d. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself, talking to me like that!\u201d Bartov exclaimed. \u201cI am here to tell the truth.\u201d Engoron overruled the state\u2019s objection. Trump is set to testify in the case for a second time on Monday and has been gagged from attacking the judge\u2019s staff. Ahead of his arrival at court, Trump once again attacked Judge Arthur Engoron and the New York attorney general, Letitia James. \u201cHeading to a Witch Hunt with a Crooked Judge and a Bats.. t CRAZY (and Racist!), A. G. This case was decided against me before it even started,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social. Trump has denied wrongdoing and said James, an elected Democrat, is biased against him. The trial largely concerns damages, because Engoron has already found that Trump\u2019s financial statements were fraudulent. Engoron imposed gag orders in the case restricting Trump and his lawyers from speaking publicly about court staff after Trump published a photo of the judge\u2019s main law clerk with Chuck Schumer, the Democratic US senator, on social media and falsely called the clerk Schumer\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend\u201d. Engoron said the post left the court \u201cinundated\u201d with threats from Trump supporters. Trump is appealing the gag orders. James is seeking $250m in penalties, and wants Trump banned from New York state real estate business. Over the past several weeks, bankers and others who did business with the Trump Organization have testified for the defense that they did not rely solely on Trump\u2019s valuations in deciding to deal with his company. Trump faces four unrelated federal and state criminal indictments, including two over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. He has pleaded not guilty in all of those cases. None of them have dented his commanding lead in the Republican race to challenge Joe Biden in next November\u2019s election. Inside the court, Trump was less combative as he viewed the work of sketch artists Jane Rosenberg and Isabelle Brourman. \u201cI gotta lose some weight,\u201d Trump said after viewing Brourman\u2019s portrait, according to the artist.

            "date": "2023-12-08T02:05:07Z",
            "content": "The presidents of three of the nation\u2019s top universities are facing intense backlash, including from the White House, after being accused of evading questions during a congressional hearing about whether calls by students for the genocide of Jews would constitute harassment under the schools\u2019 codes of conduct. In a contentious, hours-long debate on Tuesday, the presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) sought to address the steps they were taking to combat rising antisemitism on campus since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. But it was their careful, indirect response to a question posed by the Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York that drew scathing criticism. In an exchange that has now gone viral, Stefanik, a graduate of Harvard, pressed Elizabeth Magill, the president of UPenn, to say whether students calling for the genocide of Jews would be disciplined under the university\u2019s code of conduct. Earlier in her line of questioning, Stefanik had appeared to be conflating chants calling for \u201cintifada\u201d \u2013 a word that in Arabic means uprising, and has been used in reference to both peaceful and violent Palestinian protest \u2013 with hypothetical calls for genocide. \u201cYou understand that the use of the term \u2018intifada\u2019 in the context of the Israeli-Arab conflict is indeed a call for violent armed resistance against the State of Israel, including violence against civilians and the genocide of Jews,\u201d she asked Harvard president Claudine Gay. The New York Times reported that when she failed to get the presidents to agree that calls for intifada amounted to calls for genocide, she pivoted to asking about genocide alone. \u201cIf the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment,\u201d Magill replied, in a reference to distinctions in first amendment law. \u201cIt is a context-dependent decision.\u201d Stefanik pushed her to answer \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d, which Magill did not. The backlash was swift and bipartisan. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that this needs to be said: calls for genocide are monstrous and antithetical to everything we represent as a country,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson. \u201cAny statements that advocate for the systematic murder of Jews are dangerous and revolting \u2013 and we should all stand firmly against them, on the side of human dignity and the most basic values that unite us as Americans.\u201d The White House was joined by several Jewish officials and leaders in condemning the university presidents\u2019 testimony before the US House committee on education and the workforce, at a hearing called by Republicans titled Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism. Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, said the simple response was, \u201cYes, that violates our policy.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Shapiro urged UPenn\u2019s board to meet soon, as a petition calling for Magill\u2019s resignation garnered thousands of signatures. According to CNN, Penn\u2019s board of trustees held an \u201cemergency meeting\u201d on Thursday. The liberal Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe noted that he rarely agreed with Stefanik, a far-right Trump ally, but wrote: \u201cI\u2019m with her here.\u201d The Harvard president Claudine Gay\u2019s \u201chesitant, formulaic, and bizarrely evasive answers were deeply troubling to me and many of my colleagues, students, and friends\u201d, Tribe added. Republican presidential candidates also seized on the episode, folding it into their broader criticism of the US\u2019s elite institutions as too \u201cwoke\u201d and liberal. In an interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday, Ron DeSantis, who has led the rightwing crackdown on higher education as Florida\u2019s governor, said the college presidents\u2019 lack of moral clarity was a reflection of the liberal orthodoxy permeating higher education. \u201cI think what this has revealed is the rot and the sickness that\u2019s been festering inside higher education for a long time,\u201d said DeSantis, a graduate of Harvard Law School who is running for president. He continued: \u201cThey should not be these hotbeds of anti-Americanism and antisemitism. But that\u2019s what they\u2019ve become.\u201d On Thursday, the Republican-led House committee on education and the workforce opened an investigation into the three universities, saying it believed the schools were not doing enough to address antisemitism on campus. At the University of Pennsylvania, a donor reportedly withdrew a $100m gift in the wake of the backlash to the hearing. Axios also reported on Thursday that the board of the university\u2019s Wharton business school of had called on Magill to resign in a letter. Amid a surge in youth activism around the conflict, university leaders have struggled to balance the free speech of some pro-Palestinian activists with the fears of Jewish students who say the rhetoric crosses a line into antisemitism. In a number of cases, schools have responded by banning campus groups supportive of Palestinian rights. During their appearances, Magill, Gay and Sally Kornbluth of MIT all expressed alarm at the rise of antisemitism and Islamophobia on college campuses, some of which have triggered federal investigations by the Department of Education. In response, the presidents said they had taken steps to increase security measures and reporting tools while expanding mental health and counseling services. They also said it was their responsibility to ensure college campuses remain a place of free expression and free thought. In a new statement on Wednesday, Gay stated: \u201cThere are some who have confused a right to free expression with the idea that Harvard will condone calls for violence against Jewish students. Let me be clear: calls for violence or genocide against the Jewish community, or any religious or ethnic group are vile, they have no place at Harvard, and those who threaten our Jewish students will be held to account.\u201d Magill also sought to clarify her remarks to the committee in a video statement, in which she said her response to Stefanik\u2019s question was an attempt to parse the university policies stating that speech alone is not punishable. But in doing so she said she failed to acknowledge the \u201cirrefutable fact\u201d that such speech represents a \u201ccall for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate. \u201cI want to be clear, a call for genocide of Jewish people is threatening \u2013 deeply so,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIn my view, it would be harassment or intimidation.\u201d In the video, posted to X, Magill said the university\u2019s policies \u201cneed to be clarified and evaluated\u201d and committed to immediately convening a process to do so. Some free speech advocates expressed alarm at the possibility that universities may respond to the backlash by adopting speech-restrictive policies that depart from the protections of the first amendment, which governs government actors including public schools. But the universities at issue in Tuesday\u2019s hearing are all private. Fire, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, called Magill\u2019s comments on re-evaluating Penn\u2019s policies a \u201cdeeply troubling, profoundly counterproductive response\u201d to the anger. \u201cWere Penn to retreat from the robust protection of expressive rights, university administrators would make inevitably political decisions about who may speak and what may be said on campus,\u201d it said in a statement. The result of placing new limits on speech, it said, would mean \u201cdissenting and unpopular speech \u2013 whether pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian, conservative or liberal \u2013 will be silenced\u201d. Reuters contributed reporting \u2022 This article was amended on 8 December 2023 to add a quote from Elise Stefanik, in which she asked the university presidents to agree that using the term \u201cintifada\u201d constituted a call for violence, including genocide, and to clarify that she then asked them directly about calling for genocide (whether this violated school codes)."

            "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: Biden and Zelenskiy hold press conference after US president announces $200m extra Ukraine aid - as it happened",
            "date": "2023-12-12T22:43:08Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s summary time, before we close this blog about Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s day in Washington DC. What did we learn from the Ukrainian president\u2019s press conference with Joe Biden? Not too much. Zelenskiy and Biden reiterated their belief that the US should pass a significant supplemental aid package for Ukraine in its war with Russia, but acknowledged that Republicans on Capitol Hill are holding that process up as they seek concessions from Biden and Democrats on immigration policy and particularly the southern border. That, of course, was the position coming into the press conference, after Zelenskiy went to the Hill and met senators and the House speaker, Mike Johnson. Biden has ordered $200m in aid from the Pentagon via a \u201cdrawdown\u201d, a process to provide ammunition, missiles and more swiftly to allies in need. Neither leader was drawn into making dire predictions about what a second term for Donald Trump might mean for Ukraine. Biden, of course, had no good news for Zelenskiy on membership of Nato. But the US president did get off a zinger, of a sort, when he highlighted praise for Republicans by a Russian TV host and said: \u201cIf you\u2019re being celebrated by Russian propagandists, it might be time to rethink what you\u2019re doing. History \u2026 will judge harshly.\u201d And with that, goodnight. A Ukrainian reporter asks about Nato: what does Zelenskiy expect from the Washington summit next year and does he hope for membership and does Biden support such membership? Zelenskiy: \u201cI will answer very quickly on this very complicated question. We are allies but we are not members of Nato. So I will pass this very complicated question to our big friend, President Biden.\u201d Laughter. Biden: \u201cNato will be in Ukraine\u2019s future, no question \u2026 but conditions have to be met and right now we want to be sure they win the war.\u201d Biden then says, \u201cThank you all very much\u201d, which begins the shouting of extra questions as the two leaders take their leave from the room. Zelenskiy gives a strong response to a question about the notion of giving up territory to achieve peace with Moscow. Biden says Ukraine is a sovereign, independent nation and that it deterring aggression remains the US aim. Both are asked whether they believe a second term for Donald Trump would mean the end of an independent Ukraine. Biden says there is strong bipartisan support for Ukraine and a small minority of Republicans who do not back it, but he says they do not speak for their party. It would send a \u201chorrible\u201d message if we walked away at this time, he says \u2026 so, an answer without a mention of the subject of the question, Donald Trump. Biden is asked about Israel and Hamas next, about when the US will think or perhaps say the Israelis have gone far enough in their response to the attacks of 7 October. He doesn\u2019t say when. Zelenskiy says he has been speaking to Democrats and Republicans and that they offered ful-fledged support. \u201cWe will see, but until now we\u2019ve always been trusting of our strategic partner, the United States,\u201d he adds. Biden invites the first question. It is about stalled advances and blocked aide: what is the strategy to turn this around, and if that fails, what is the right time to tell Ukraine it\u2019s time for peace talks? Biden starts by rehashing previous statements about how well Ukraine is doing against Russia and how much support Ukraine\u2019s allies have given. The best way to keep doing this is to \u201cpass the supplemental\u201d funding bill, he says, to no one\u2019s surprise. Zelenskiy answers in Ukrainian, having delivered his opening statement in English. He also rehashes remarks about successes in the field. From Mike Johnson, the House speaker, and other Republicans in Congress, Zelenskiy says, he \u201cgot this signal \u2026 they were positive but we know that we have two separate worlds and particular goals\u201d. Biden continues, saying he has asked Congress for more aid for Israel too, and says Jake Sullivan, his national security adviser, is on his way to the region, as is Lloyd Austin, the secretary of defense. He ends by thanking Zelenskiy again. Zelenskiy speaks in English, thanking Biden in return and saying Ukraine is fighting for \u201cour freedom and yours\u201d, a motto he says resonates in Poland, the Baltic states and other countries. \u201cWhen freedom is strong in one country, it is strong everywhere,\u201d he says. Biden stands next to him, in front of US and Ukrainian flags, seeming to take notes on the podium before him. Zelenskiy says he and Biden discussed how to \u201cincrease our strength for next year\u201d, including a bid for control of the skies. He eventually says he informed Biden of the progress of moves towards Ukrainian membership of the European Union, and stresses the importance of sending \u201ca strong signal of unity to the aggressor\u201d. And we begin, Joe Biden opening with remarks in praise of Volodymyr Zelenskiy for \u201can enormous victory already\u201d over Russia and Vladimir Putin, in \u201cstanding strong\u201d against the invasion. Ukraine will prevail \u201cunless we walk away\u201d, Biden says. Biden goes on to warn about failing to pass supplementary funding through Congress, saying \u201cIt\u2019s stunning that we\u2019ve got to this point\u201d with funding held up by Republicans seeking immigration reform. \u201cRussia and loyalists in Moscow celebrated when Republicans voted to block Ukraine to aid last week,\u201d Biden says. \u201cThe host of a Kremlin-run show literally said, and I quote, \u2018Well done, Republicans. That\u2019s good for us.\u2019\u201d Biden repeats the line, adding: \u201cIf you\u2019re being celebrated by Russia propagandists, it might be time to rethink what you\u2019re doing. History \u2026 will judge harshly.\u201d Here\u2019s the White House livestream link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxAnSckZ34w. It is not yet livestreaming from a press conference that was meant to start at 4.15pm ET. This is, of course, not surprising. I may or may not therefore be spending my time reading up on why John Adams hasn\u2019t got a DC monument yet. Here, meanwhile, is an interesting post, about Zelenskiy\u2019s meeting with senators, from Lisa Desjardins of PBS: We\u2019re waiting now for Biden and Zelenskiy to face the press. Our Washington bureau chief, David Smith, is in the room. The room, as it happens, (and thus also David), is not actually in the White House itself, but instead in the Eisenhower executive office building, just to the west of the executive mansion but part of its larger campus. The White House itself says \u201cthe reason for the room\u2019s name is a mystery. It is not clear where it originated, despite extensive research. Some believe it was due to the fact that during the 1930s the war department stored papers there, including treaties with the American Indian nations. But this is not true, as the state department used it for storage until the 1940s after the Navy Library moved out.\u201d Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian\u2019s defense and security editor, filed a report on Zelenskiy\u2019s Washington visit before the Ukrainian president\u2019s trip to the White House. It begins: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has struggled to persuade US Republicans to support a $61bn military aid package for Ukraine on a trip to Washington DC, with objectors insisting on White House concessions on border security as a condition for a deal. The Ukrainian president addressed members of the Senate in a closed 90-minute meeting on Tuesday morning, but afterwards key Republicans repeated that they wanted to see a crackdown on immigration between the US and Mexico in return for supporting the package. Lindsey Graham, a senator for South Carolina, told reporters he told Zelenskiy the problem was \u201cnothing to do with you\u201d. He added: \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019ve done everything anybody could ask of you. This is not your problem here.\u2019\u201d Graham went on to accuse the White House of failing to tackle the southern border issue and called for Joe Biden to become personally involved in negotiations. Senate Republicans last week blocked an emergency aid package primarily for Ukraine and Israel after conservatives complained at the exclusion of immigration policy changes they demanded. Zelenskiy sought to reassure senators concerned about whether US military aid would be wasted because of corruption, Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, told CNN, and that Ukraine needed more air defence systems to support counteroffensives. Senior Democrats expressed frustration. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, said \u201cThe one person happiest right now about the gridlock in Congress is Vladimir Putin. He is delighting in the fact that Donald Trump\u2019s border policies are sabotaging military aid to Ukraine.\u201d Dan\u2019s report continues: The Associated Press has a few details about the $200m Department of Defense drawdown Biden mentioned in the Oval Office earlier: The roughly $200m in weapons and equipment will be taken from Pentagon stocks and include additional ammunition for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), high-speed anti-radiation missiles, anti-armor systems, artillery rounds, missiles, demolition munitions, 4 million rounds of small arms ammunition, generators and other equipment and spare parts, one official said. Including that latest package, the US now has about $4.4 billion remaining in weapons it can provide from department stockpiles. Here\u2019s the White House pool readout on the Oval Office meeting and spray between Biden and Zelenskiy just now. As the pooler, Daniel Bush of Newsweek, advises, all quotes should ultimately be checked against the later transcript: Pool was led into the Oval Office at 2.31pm. President Biden and President Zelenskiy \u2026 were seated in front of the fireplace. Biden spoke first. \u2018We stand at a real inflection point in history,\u2019 he said. \u2018Congress needs to pass the supplemental funds\u2019 to provide more aid to Ukraine, he said. Biden also warned that Vladimir Putin was planning to bombard Ukraine\u2019s electrical grid this winter. \u2018We mustn\u2019t let him succeed,\u2019 he said. Zelenskiy thank[ed] America and other allies for supporting Ukraine. \u2018Ukraine can win,\u2019 Zelenskiy said. Zelenskiy said he wanted to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s air defense system. As the pool was asked to leave, Biden said he had signed \u2018another $200m drawdown\u2019 for aid to Ukraine. Pool was ushered out of the Oval at 2.37pm. Today\u2019s foreign pooler, Juliane Sch\u00e4uble, Washington DC correspondent for Der Tagesspiegel, adds that Zelenskiy spoke for about three minutes, in English, saying, \u201cWe have specifically defeated Russia in the Black Sea,\u201d and saying the IMF and the World Bank were \u201cimpressed with Ukraine\u2019s economy growth, almost 5%\u201d. Then he said: \u201cWe also have to walk faster with the frozen Russian assets \u2013 over $300bn frozen assets from terrorists and we should use it to protect against Russians war.\u201d Both poolers offer a list of participants in the bilateral meeting that is now taking place, before the two presidents face the press later: US delegation The president Antony Blinken, secretary of state Lloyd Austin, secretary of defense Jake Sullivan, assistant to the president for national security affairs Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Bridget Brink, ambassador of the United States to Ukraine Ukraine delegation The president Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine Oksana Markarova, ambassador of Ukraine to the United States Oleksandr Kamyshin, minister of strategic industries of Ukraine Roman Mashovets, deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine, chief military advisor Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of the office of the president of Ukraine About Joe Biden\u2019s belief that Congress should provide additional aid \u2026 \u2026 as Reuters reports, Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, didn\u2019t have cheering news for the president when reporters managed briefly to collar him on Capitol Hill just now: Republican leader Mitch McConnell said it would be \u2018practically impossible\u2019 for Congress to pass a supplemental funding package including aid for Ukraine before Christmas. McConnell told reporters that a deal will not happen until Joe Biden reaches agreement with Republicans, who want to link funding for Ukraine to new border security measures. Zelenskiy gave reasonably lengthy comments about his time in Washington, thanking everyone who had met with him so far. \u201cPeople need to be confident that freedom is secure,\u201d he concluded. Biden, who told Zelenskiy not to give up hope in the fight against Russia and said Congress should provide additional aid, told reporters to quiet down, then said he had just signed \u201canother $200m drawdown from the department of defense for Ukraine\u201d. Here\u2019s how the state department website defines a drawdown: The use of the Presidential Drawdown Authority to direct a drawdown to provide military assistance under section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) is a valuable tool of US foreign policy in crisis situations. It allows for the speedy delivery of defense articles and services from Department of Defense stocks to foreign countries and international organizations to respond to unforeseen emergencies. Such assistance can begin arriving within days \u2013 or even hours \u2013 of approval. Biden and Zelenskiy are now speaking in the Oval Office. They have met five times since their first, reportedly difficult meeting at the White House in September 2021. Thanks to Juliane Sch\u00e4uble, Washington DC correspondent for Der Tagesspiegel, out of Berlin, here\u2019s a list of the meetings that followed 21 December 2022 \u2013 Washington, DC 21 May 2023 \u2013 Hiroshima (G7 Summit) 20 February 2023 \u2013 Kyiv 12 July 2023 \u2013 Vilnius (NATO Summit) 21 September 2023 \u2013 Washington, DC More soon\u2026 \u2026 and here\u2019s some more on Franklin Foer\u2019s reporting of Biden and Zelenskiy\u2019s first, awkward White House meeting in September 2021: The official transcript of Biden and Zelenskiy\u2019s remarks to reporters before their 1 September Oval Office meeting shows declarations of mutual respect and policy aims. But according to Foer, once the meeting began properly, Zelenskiy \u201cseemed oblivious to Biden\u2019s doubts\u201d and \u201calmost wilfully unaware of Biden\u2019s moral code\u201d. Biden expected expressions of gratitude for US support, Foer writes. Zelenskiy \u201ccrammed his conversations with a long list of demands\u201d. Chief among them: \u201cHe needed to join Nato.\u201d Biden was then 78. Zelenskiy was 43. The older man \u201ctried to pass along some wisdom that might temper the younger man\u2019s zeal\u201d, Foer says, including by noting that sufficient support did not then exist for Ukraine to join Nato. Russia had been stoking fighting in Ukraine since 2014 and was widely thought to be preparing a full-scale invasion. Foer writes: \u201cZelenskiy\u2019s frustration occluded his capacity for logic. After begging to join Nato, he began to lecture that the organisation is, in fact, a historic relic, with waning significance. He told Biden that France and Germany were going to exit Nato. \u201cIt was an absurd analysis \u2013 and a blatant contradiction. And it pissed Biden off.\u201d As Volodymyr Zelenskiy heads for the White House and his scheduled appearance with Joe Biden, it\u2019s worth a brief look at the reporting about his first such visit. In August, Franklin Foer revealed in his book The Last Politician that Zelenskiy \u201cbombed\u201d in his first White House meeting with Biden in September 2021. The following is from my own reporting on the book, linked to at the bottom. Biden and Zelenskiy, Foer says\u2026 \u2026failed to establish a rapport as the Ukrainian leader\u2019s demand to join Nato and \u201cabsurd analysis\u201d of alliance dynamics left the US president \u201cpissed off\u201d. \u201cEven Zelenskiy\u2019s most ardent sympathisers in the [Biden] administration agreed that he had bombed,\u201d Foer writes. \u201cIt suggested more difficult conversations to come.\u201d As in other sections of the book, Foer does not use direct quotes or cite sources when reporting the Biden-Zelenskiy meeting on 1 September. But his publisher, Penguin Random House, says the book is based on \u201cunparalleled access to the tight inner circle of advisers who have surrounded Biden for decades\u201d. Elected in 2019 and under constant pressure from Russia, Zelenskiy had long sought a White House meeting. Donald Trump rebuffed him, because he refused to help dig up dirt on rivals including Biden \u2013 efforts which led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment. Foer claims Zelenskiy nursed \u201clingering resentments from the episode\u201d and \u201cat least subconsciously \u2026 seemed to blame\u201d Biden, Trump\u2019s successor in the Oval Office, \u201cfor the humiliation he suffered, for the political awkwardness he endured\u201d. The author also says Zelenskiy regarded Biden as weak, particularly over his decision to waive sanctions against a Russian company building Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline to Germany, a move Zelenskiy saw as undermining Ukrainian economic and security interests. Biden granted Zelenskiy a meeting but \u201cdidn\u2019t think much\u201d of him, Foer reports, particularly over friendly relations the Ukrainian president had struck up with the hard-right Republican Texas senator Ted Cruz, over the Nord Stream decision. In protest, Cruz blocked confirmation of state department nominees. \u201cWhether he understood this or not,\u201d Foer writes, \u201cZelenskiy was complicit with this stunt. It reeked of what the administration considered amateurism. To be fair, Biden didn\u2019t think much of his Ukrainian counterpart, either.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defence minister, Rustem Umerov, rejected any notion on Tuesday that two of the country\u2019s top military commanders were about to be dismissed, Reuters reports. Commander in chief Valery Zaluzhnyi and joint forces commander Serhiy Nayev\u2019s positions were reported to be in the balance. Zaluzhnyi\u2019s relations cooled with Volodymyr Zelenskiy after the commander said the war with Russia was entering a stalemate. Reuters\u2019 report adds: On this matter, there is no such question,\u201d Umerov told a news conference alongside his Latvian counterpart. \u201cOn this matter, I am always open and if the question is ever raised, I will say something immediately. There are no such issues.\u201d Umerov, appointed in September, made a similar denial last month that changes in Ukraine\u2019s command were under consideration. In his latest comments, Umerov said rotations of positions were a normal part of military operations \u201cbut there are no such issues, however much our enemies want to knock us off stride\u201d. US speaker, Mike Johnson, has reasserted his hardline stance on the border issues that are holding up an agreement on US aid for Ukraine. \u201cThe border is an absolute catastrophe,\u201d he said, and made clear that issue would be the priority for House Republicans. \u201cThese are the conditions of the American people,\u201d he added, \u201cwe are resolute on that.\u201d This is bad news for Volodymyr Zelenskiy who had just met the US speaker and would have hoped to have seen a softening of his stance. Johnson said he reiterated to Zelenskiy that the American people stood with him against Vladimir Putin, but he was unconvinced by White House assurances that Ukraine could win. He reiterated that his issue was with the White House and the Senate rather than Ukraine. The Republican senator Eric Schmitt said he was told \u201cnothing new\u201d and that \u201cthe questions were very scripted\u201d during the meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard all of this before,\u201d he added. A declassified US intelligence report has assessed that the war in Ukraine war has led to 315,000 Russian deaths or injuries among its troops, or nearly 90% of the personnel it had when the conflict began, a source familiar with the intelligence told Reuters. The report also assessed that Moscow\u2019s losses in personnel and armoured vehicles have set back its military modernisation by 18 years, the source said. Republicans senators left the meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy unmoved from their position that aid to Ukraine had to be paired with border security policy, the Associated Press reports. Senator Markwayne Mullin said the emergency funding wouldn\u2019t gain GOP support unless it included \u201creal, meaningful border reform\u201d. Zelenskiy is scheduled to visit the new House speaker, Mike Johnson, the Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, and then Joe Biden. Biden has expressed a willingness to engage with Republicans as migrant crossings have hit record highs along the US-Mexico border, but Democrats in his own party oppose proposals for expedited deportations and strict asylum standards as a return to Trump-era hostility towards migrants. With talks at a standstill, one Republican negotiator, Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, said there was nothing Zelenskiy could say during his visit with the senators to sway the outcome. \u201cHey, pay attention to us, but not your own country? No,\u201d Lankford told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to deal with all these things together.\u201d The US has imposed sanctions on hundreds of people and entities, including in China and Turkey, as it targets Russia\u2019s sanctions evasion. The treasury and state departments targeted more than 250 individuals and entities, Reuters reports. \u201cWe will continue to use the tools at our disposal to promote accountability for Russia\u2019s crimes in Ukraine and those who finance and support Russia\u2019s war machine,\u201d the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. The treasury said it imposed sanctions on a network of four entities and nine people based in China, Russia, Hong Kong and Pakistan over the facilitation and procurement of Chinese-manufactured weapons and technologies to Russia. It said the network sought to circumvent US sanctions and Chinese controls on the export of military-related materials. It also targeted Turkey, UAE and China-based companies over the shipment of technology, equipment and inputs, including aircraft parts and X-ray systems. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is in Washington today, where he will meet Joe Biden as he attempts to rescue a critical $61bn military aid package. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said Zelenskiy told senators earlier that \u201cif he gets the help, he can win this war\u201d. Jake Sullivan, the White House\u2019s national security adviser, said that a failure to add funding to Kyiv\u2019s military campaign to repel Russia will weaken Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself. Ukraine\u2019s biggest mobile network operator, Kyivstar, said it was the target of a major cyber-attack on Tuesday morning that temporarily knocked out its cellular and internet signal. The cyber-attack affected the air raid alert system in more than 75 settlements in the Kyiv region, the regional military administration said. Poland will demand the full mobilisation of the free world to help Ukraine, the newly appointed prime minister, Donald Tusk, said. He said: \u201cWe will demand full mobilisation of the west to help Ukraine. I can no longer listen to politicians who talk about being tired of the situation in Ukraine.\u201d Russian forces in southern Ukraine have \u201cadvanced considerably\u201d around the village of Novopokrovka in the Zaporizhzhia region, Moscow\u2019s occupational authorities have said. \u201cOur units have advanced significantly forward north-east of Novopokrovka,\u201d the Moscow-installed head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, wrote on Telegram. The whereabouts of Alexei Navalny, the jailed Russian opposition leader, inside the prison system remains unknown and he again did not show up at a court hearing by video link, Kira Yarmysh, his spokesperson, said on Tuesday. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, later said it was \u201chighly worrying\u201d that Navalny was reported to have been missing for seven days. Oleksiy Danilov, who coordinates Ukraine\u2019s war cabinet, has spoken to BBC News before the meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Joe Biden. He said: If it happens so that we receive a gift before Christmas, we will be happy with that. But if it will happen a bit later, then it shouldn\u2019t be made into a tragedy \u2026 Will Putin destroy us before humanity\u2019s eyes? Will he be killing our children, our women, our elderly men? And will the whole world watch with their eyes closed? Then the question should be, in what world do we live? Chris Murphy, a US senator, said the Senate could reach a deal on Ukraine aid and border security by Christmas if Congress delayed its upcoming break to keep working on an agreement, Reuters reports. There are just three days before Congress breaks for the year. Republican senators blocked an emergency aid package last week, which was intended primarily for Ukraine and Israel, after conservatives complained at the exclusion of immigration changes they had demanded as part of the package. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, said Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, told senators earlier that \u201cif he gets the help, he can win this war\u201d. Schumer was quoted by BBC News as saying: He also made clear \u2026 that if we lose, Putin wins. This will be very dangerous for the United States. A cyber-attack on the biggest Ukrainian mobile operator, Kyivstar, affected the air raid alert system in more than 75 settlements in the Kyiv region, the regional military administration has said (see earlier post at 13.31). The system did not work in some cities, including Bucha and Irpin, Reuters reports. \u201cThere are also spot outages of the warning system in Boryspil and in 75 other localities,\u201d it wrote on Telegram. The administration also said alerts were duplicated by another warning system and that police would report air hazards through loudspeakers. BBC News reports that the meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskiy; Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader and Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, is nearly over. A statement should be read out soon. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has arrived on Capitol Hill as he prepares to keep military support flowing to his country. The White House said the time was right for Zelenskiy\u2019s trip to Washington as Joe Biden tries to get his aid package approved before the Christmas holidays, the Associated Press reports. A senior spokesperson said the US could not let Ukraine aid lapse, adding that the president was willing to make compromises with Republicans. Zelenskiy, who has spoken at the National Defense University in Washington DC, is due to visit the new House speaker, Mike Johnson, then talk with Biden at the White House. A failure to add funding to Kyiv\u2019s military campaign to repel Russia will weaken Ukraine\u2019s ability to defend itself, Jake Sullivan, the White House\u2019s national security adviser, has warned. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal forum, he said if US assistance is no longer forthcoming it would harm Ukraine\u2019s ability to hold territory. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has flown to Washington DC in an attempt to rescue a critical $61bn military aid package. Zelenskiy is due to meet the US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday, as well as US senators and the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, at a time when Congress is holding up future American financial support for Kyiv\u2019s war effort. Ukrainian exports through the alternative Black Sea corridor could increase to 5m metric tonnes in December from 3.8m tonnes in November, Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted a senior Ukrainian government official as saying. Ukraine launched the corridor in August after Moscow withdrew from the UN brokered Black Sea grain export deal in July and threatened to treat all vessels as potential military targets. Here are some of the latest images from the newswires: The US house speaker, Mike Johnson, said in a letter to the Joe Biden administration released last week that lawmakers need more detail on the administration\u2019s objectives in Ukraine. \u201cSupplemental Ukraine funding is dependent upon enactment of transformative change to our nation\u2019s border security laws,\u201d he wrote. Johnson, a Republican, said on Tuesday he was still waiting for the White House to respond. \u201cThey haven\u2019t sent anything back in return. There\u2019s no return volley,\u201d he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. Ukraine\u2019s intelligence agency said the cyber-attack on the country\u2019s biggest mobile operator, Kyivstar, may be a Russian special services operation (see earlier post at 11.37 for more details). \u201cOne of the versions that SBU is currently investigating is that the Russian special services may be behind this hacker attack,\u201d the agency said in a statement sent to Reuters. Earlier today, Kyivstar, which has 24.3 million customers, said it was the target of a major cyber-attack that temporarily knocked out its cellular and internet signal. Kyivstar blamed it on Russia\u2019s invasion without giving further details on the connection between the two. \u201cThis is a war, it takes place not only on the battlefield, it also takes place in virtual space and unfortunately, we are affected as a result of this war,\u201d Kyivstar\u2019s general director Oleksandr Komarov said on national television. \u201cWe see the main goal of this attack is the maximum possible destruction of the operator\u2019s IT infrastructure. They partially achieved this goal,\u201d he said. Finland\u2019s government has said it will reopen two crossings on its long border with Russia later this week after closing all eight roads between the two countries in late November to prevent an influx of asylum seekers. \u201cWithout dismantling the restrictions, we cannot verify whether a change for the better is taking place. If the phenomenon continues, we will close these border crossing points,\u201d prime minister Petteri Orpo told journalists. Last month, Finland shut the Russian border until 13 December to block a rising number of refugees from arriving in the Nordic nation in what the government and its allies said was an orchestrated move by Moscow. The Guardian\u2019s Nordic correspondent, Miranda Bryant, has spoken to one of the asylum seekers caught in the geopolitical drama who crossed from Russia after a treacherous journey from Syria. You can read more here: EU diplomats are discussing technical proposals to raise emergency funding for Ukraine outside of the bloc\u2019s shared budget, as Hungary vowed it would not yield to pressure to drop its veto on a support package critical for Kyiv, the Financial Times reported this morning. EU leaders are gathering today at a summit, where the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, plans to block Brussels\u2019 bid to provide a critical \u20ac50bn financial aid lifeline to Ukraine and approve formal talks on the country joining the EU. His stance comes in spite of efforts by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and other EU capitals to persuade him. Failure by the EU to agree the proposed funding package would severely affect Ukraine\u2019s financial stability, Ukrainian and European officials have warned. It would also mark the most egregious reversal in Brussels\u2019 support since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, amid uncertainty over a similar-sized funding package in the US. EU officials are working on possible solutions to overturn Hungary\u2019s block on the package, which require unanimity, including the release of bloc funds earmarked for Budapest but currently frozen on rule-of-law concerns. Diplomats have also begun private talks on a potential financial package between the other 26 members, people briefed on the discussions told the Financial Times. This would provide Kyiv with emergency funding for at least a year. Hungary has repeated a promise that it will not be the last Nato country to ratify Sweden\u2019s application to join the alliance, Tobias Billstr\u00f6m, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, has said. Billstr\u00f6m met his Hungarian counterpart, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, in Brussels on Monday, in part to discuss Sweden\u2019s accession to Nato \u2013 a major shift in the country\u2019s security strategy following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine - which Hungary and Turkey have blocked. Billstr\u00f6m asked whether Hungary stood by its promise not to be the last Nato member to approve Sweden: His clear message was, yes we do. We will not be last. Turkey indicated in late November it could be ready to approve Sweden as a Nato member within a few weeks. But President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has linked the process to Turkey\u2019s hopes of buying F-16 fighter jets from the United States, a deal Congress has delayed. The IT infrastructure of Kyivstar, Ukraine\u2019s largest mobile network provider, was \u201cpartially destroyed\u201d by a large cyber-attack on Tuesday, Oleksandr Komarov, its chief executive, has said on national television. Komarov said: (The attack) significantly damaged the (IT) infrastructure, limited access, we could not counter it at the virtual level, so we shut down Kyivstar physically to limit the enemy\u2019s access. It\u2019s unclear who the hackers were at this point, but Jason Jay Smart, a correspondent for the Kyiv Post, has posted on X that there have been \u201csignificant\u201d cyberattacks from Russia on telecommunications and banking today. The EU aims to convince Hungary of its proposed \u20ac50bn (\u00a343bn) aid facility for Kyiv at its summit later this week to send a clear signal to Russia, a German government official said. The official told a briefing in Berlin that all but one of the bloc\u2019s 27 member states supported the Ukraine facility, Reuters reports. The official said: Our clear aim is to convince this state that the Ukraine facility is the right instrument to show our unity and send Russia a clear signal, but also to support US President [Joe] Biden\u2019s efforts to mobilise the further necessary support. Asked if there was a plan B, the official said: \u201cWe are betting on plan A\u201d. Some European diplomats think Victor Orb\u00e1n, the Hungarian prime minister, is stalling support for Ukraine to pressure Brussels to release billions of euros of EU support to Budapest frozen over a rule-of-law dispute. Ukraine\u2019s biggest mobile network operator, Kyivstar, said it was the target of a major cyber-attack on Tuesday morning that temporarily knocked out its cellular and internet signal, Reuters reports. The company said it was working to repair the outage and cooperating with law enforcement bodies. Separately, the co-founder of Monobank, a major Ukrainian payment system, said his company was experiencing a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, but that everything was \u201cunder control\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is in Washington today, where later he will meet Joe Biden as well as US senators and the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, at a time when Congress is holding up future American financial support for Kyiv\u2019s war effort. Poland will demand the full mobilisation of the free world to help Ukraine, the newly appointed prime minister, Donald Tusk said. He said: \u201cWe will demand full mobilisation of the west to help Ukraine. I can no longer listen to politicians who talk about being tired of the situation in Ukraine.\u201d Russian forces in southern Ukraine have \u201cadvanced considerably\u201d around the village of Novopokrovka in the Zaporizhzhia region, Moscow\u2019s occupational authorities have said. \u201cOur units have advanced significantly forward north-east of Novopokrovka,\u201d the Moscow-installed head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, wrote on Telegram. The whereabouts of Alexei Navalny, the jailed Russian opposition leader, inside the prison system remains unknown and he again did not show up at a court hearing by video link, Kira Yarmysh, his spokesperson, said on Tuesday. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, later said it was \u201chighly worrying\u201d that Navalny was reported to have been missing for seven days. While Ukraine\u2019s hopes of beginning membership talks will take centre-stage at this week\u2019s EU summit, another potential member, Georgia, will also be seeking progress towards eventual entry to the bloc. \u201cIn the case of Georgia, we have a government that is seemingly more interested in doing business with Russia than advancing on the EU path,\u201d a senior EU official involved in talks with countries that want to join told Reuters. The official said Georgia had gone backwards on some key reforms. Donald Tusk, Poland\u2019s prime minister, has also said his new government will try to put an end to the truck drivers\u2019 protest at the Ukrainian border quickly. Polish truckers have been blockading some of the road crossings between the two countries since early November in protest at Ukrainian drivers getting permit-free access to the EU. Poland will demand the full mobilisation of the free world to help Ukraine, the newly appointed prime minister, Donald Tusk, has said. Speaking in the Polish parliament, Tusk underscored the importance of continued Polish support for Ukraine. He said: We also need to speak with one voice about Ukraine. This must also unite us. The attack on Ukraine is an attack on all of us. We will demand full mobilisation of the west to help Ukraine. I can no longer listen to politicians who talk about being tired of the situation in Ukraine. They tell President Zelenskiy that they are tired of the situation. I will demand help for Ukraine from day one. You can follow all the updates from Tusk in our Europe liveblog here: The EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has said it is \u201chighly worrying\u201d that Alexei Navalny, the jailed Russian opposition leader, is reported to have been missing for seven days. The Kremlin has described comments by the US expressing concern over the condition of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny as unacceptable meddling in Russia\u2019s domestic affairs, Reuters reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he was unaware of the whereabouts of Navalny, who has been moved from his penal colony to an undisclosed location (see earlier post at 08.26). The White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, called for the immediate release of Navalny, saying \u201che should never have been jailed in the first place\u201d. Moscow will \u201cvery attentively\u201d watch a meeting between Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskiy planned for Tuesday, the Kremlin said. The Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, also said that \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d already provided by Washington to Kyiv had failed to turn the tide of war and further aid would similarly fail to do so, Reuters reports. He added that Zelenskiy\u2019s authority was being undermined by the failures. The meeting on Tuesday between Biden and Zelenskiy is intended \u201cto underscore the United States\u2019 unshakeable commitment to supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia\u2019s brutal invasion\u201d, the White House said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cAs Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine, the leaders will discuss Ukraine\u2019s urgent needs and the vital importance of the United States\u2019 continued support at this critical moment.\u201d The UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said Russian forces are highly likely continue to struggle when fighting at night. In its latest intelligence update, the MoD said Russian military training had not focused on night exercises, but has instead prioritised building towards set-piece, daylight events \u201cto impress visiting senior officers\u201d. Writing on X, the MoD said: Russian forces highly likely continue to struggle when fighting at night. Numerous reports from combatants have highlighted this trend since the start of the war. In late November 2023, a social media user claiming to be a Russian soldier serving in Kherson highlighted the shortage of night vision goggles (NVGs) and low-light cameras for uncrewed aerial vehicles. NVGs have frequently featured high in the lists of equipment Russian units request from their families and supporters. Ukrainian forces have often been equipped with night vision devices from international partners. Russian forces in southern Ukraine have \u201cadvanced considerably\u201d around the village of Novopokrovka in the Zaporizhzhia region, Moscow\u2019s occupational authorities have said. \u201cOur units have advanced significantly forward north-east of Novopokrovka,\u201d the Moscow-installed head of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, wrote on Telegram. Novopokrovka lies about 12 miles east of Robotyne, which Kyiv said it recaptured in the summer but has since struggled to keep. Balitsky said Russian forces are \u201cnot only holding the line but are gradually moving forward\u201d. These claims are yet to be independently verified. Gyunduz Mamedov, a former deputy prosecutor general of Ukraine, said 597 shells were fired in the Kherson region over the last 24 hours, damaging a dormitory and administrative buildings. One person was killed and six others injured, he said. Writing on X, Mamedov added that the Ukrainian air force destroyed nine out of 15 kamikaze drones that were \u201cattacking from the south\u201d. These claims are yet to be independently verified. Europeans are generally open to the idea of Ukraine joining the EU, despite the costs and risks, but lukewarm at best about the bloc\u2019s prospective enlargement to also take in Georgia and countries in the western Balkans, according to a survey. The European Commission recommended last month that formal accession talks begin with Ukraine and Moldova. The EU\u2019s 27 heads of government are due to discuss the proposal at a Brussels summit this week \u2013 although Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has said repeatedly he opposes opening negotiations with Kyiv. The polling, of six EU member states for the European Council on Foreign Relations, found considerable support for the candidacies of Ukraine and, to a lesser extent, Moldova and Montenegro, but also deep economic and security concerns. You can read the full story by the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, Jon Henley, here: The whereabouts of Alexei Navalny, the jailed Russian opposition leader, inside the prison system remains unknown and he again did not show up at a court hearing by video link, Kira Yarmysh, his spokesperson, said on Tuesday. Yarmysh wrote on X: Today Alexey was again not taken to court via video, but now no one is talking nonsense about the \u201celectrical accident\u201d. An employee of IK-6 stated that Alexey \u201cleft their colony,\u201d but allegedly did not know where he was transferred. Navalny\u2019s allies said on Monday that he had been removed from the penal colony where he had been imprisoned since the middle of last year and that his whereabouts were unknown, Reuters reports. They had been preparing for his expected transfer to a \u201cspecial regime\u201d colony, the harshest grade in Russia\u2019s prison system. Navalny, the anti-corruption activist who became a leading opponent of Vladimir Putin, has been convicted of extremism and other charges and is set to remain in prison for three decades. He has called the charges against him politically motivated and said he believes he will not be released while Putin is alive. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is in Washington today, where later he will meet Joe Biden as well as US senators and the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, at a time when Congress is holding up future American financial support for Kyiv\u2019s war effort. Here are the latest developments: Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has flown to Washington DC, in an attempt to rescue a critical $61bn military aid package, while separately the UK hinted that it may increase the value of the arms, ammunition and training that it donates to Kyiv. Zelenskiy is due to meet the US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday, as well as US senators and the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, at a time when Congress is holding up future US financial support for Kyiv\u2019s war effort. Shortly after arriving in the US capital, Zelenskiy said Ukraine was counting on the US, and that delays to future rounds of military aid were \u201cdreams come true\u201d for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. \u201cPutin must lose,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a speech at the National Defense University. \u201cYou can count on Ukraine, and we hope just as much to be able to count on you.\u201d Defence secretary Lloyd Austin, who introduced the Ukrainian president, said America\u2019s commitment to Ukraine was unshakeable and supporting the war was critical to ensuring the security of the US and its allies. Russia\u2019s air defence systems destroyed a Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile over the Belgorod region that was launched from Ukraine, the Russian defence ministry said on Tuesday. The ministry, in a statement on the Telegram messaging app, said the attack took place at about 5am (0200 GMT). It did not say whether there was any damage as a result. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s executive board (IMF) on Monday approved a $900m disbursement for Ukraine from its $15.6bn loan programme, hours before the IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, met Zelenskiy. Alexei Navalny, the jailed Russian opposition leader, has not been heard from for nearly a week and his lawyers have been unable to contact him, his supporters have said. On Monday, Navalny\u2019s supporters said he again failed to appear by videoconference for a court hearing, with prison officials blaming a power outage. Later that day, Navalny\u2019s lawyers were told he was no longer listed as a prisoner at IK-6, the penal colony where he has been incarcerated in the Vladimir region near Moscow. A decision to start talks on Ukraine\u2019s EU accession is on a knife-edge after Hungary said it would not bow to mounting pressure to give the green light. Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s threat to veto the launch of negotiations is being taken seriously, with Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister warning of \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d for his country if the talks are blocked. Russia will hold its presidential election in four annexed regions of Ukraine, Interfax news agency quoted the country\u2019s central election commission as saying. Russian forces have unleashed a major offensive on Avdiivka, with 610 artillery shellings reported near the eastern Ukrainian town over the past day, according to the Ukrainian military. Britain has said it delivered two mine-hunting ships to Ukraine. The mine hunters, originally HMS Grimsby and HMS Shoreham, were renamed Chernihiv and Cherkasy in Glasgow in June, and will help Ukraine to maintain a critical route for merchant shipping travelling across the Black Sea."
