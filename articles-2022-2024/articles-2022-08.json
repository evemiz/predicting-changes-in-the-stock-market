            "content": "Black voters challenging Georgia\u2019s method of electing members to the state\u2019s public service commission scored a preliminary US supreme court order in their favor late Friday. The decision came after conflicting rulings from lower courts earlier this month, offering up a rare example of the supreme court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority\u2019s siding with voters over state officials. Earlier this month, a federal district judge found that the current system gave Black residents\u2019 votes less weight. Each of the commission\u2019s five seats hold jurisdiction over a specific district, but each seatholder is elected in a statewide race that dilutes Black voters\u2019 power, said that ruling, which came from Trump White House-appointed judge Steven Grimberg. Grimberg ordered the postponement of a November election for two commissioners\u2019 seats to allow the state legislature the time to create a new system for electing commissioners, granting a request from a group of voters challenging the system. However, last week, the federal 11th circuit court of appeals temporarily halted Grimberg\u2019s ruling, citing the \u201cPurcell principle\u201d, which discourages courts from changing election rules immediately before an election. The supreme court on Friday reinstated the Grimberg ruling, with the plaintiffs citing testimony from numerous experts who found the current Georgia public service commission election system to be discriminatory against Black voters. Political data analyst Bernard Fraga, who focuses on the behavior of voting within communities, testified that statewide voting lets Georgia\u2019s majority white population drown out votes coming from districts with mostly Black residents. \u201cAnd, because elections are staggered, a minority group has less of an opportunity to concentrate its voting strength behind a candidate of choice,\u201d Fraga said, according to the ruling. The ruling also cited the testimony of a former employee at the US justice department\u2019s civil rights division, Stephen Popick. He said his study on voting behavior in Georgia between 2012 and 2020 showed \u201cvoter polarization\u201d between Black and white voters, and the latter\u2019s candidate always won even though Black voters all got behind the same leader as a group. Plaintiffs attorney Nico Martinez on Saturday told the Guardian he is \u201cconfident the district court\u2019s well-reasoned decision will ultimately be upheld\u201d as the case continues playing out in the 11th circuit. Georgia officials withdrew a request for a stay at the 11th circuit, keeping the public service commissions off the ballot during the November election cycle. \u201cWe are pleased that the supreme court took this important step to ensure that . [public service commission] elections are not held using a method that unlawfully dilutes the votes of millions of Black citizens in Georgia,\u201d said Martinez, a partner at the law firm Bartlit Beck. Note: This post was updated to note that Georgia officials withdrew a request for a stay."

            "title": "Election lies pose physical threat to US poll workers, House report warns",
            "date": "2022-08-11T19:49:53Z",
            "content": "A sweeping US House oversight committee report has warned that lies and misinformation around the 2020 American presidential election present an \u201congoing threat to representative democracy\u201d and pose a grave physical danger to election officials. The 21-page report called for emergency funding to address increased security costs related to 2022 contests and warned that there was a much-heightened risk that conspiracy theorists could gain power over elections in the future. The report also detailed chilling threats against election administrators across the country. One Texas official received menacing messages targeting him and \u201cthreatening his children, saying, \u2018I think we should end your bloodline.\u2019\u201d The messages against him came following \u201cpersonal attacks on national media outlets\u201d. Another threat included a social media call to \u201chang him when convicted for fraud and let his lifeless body hang in public until maggots drip out of his mouth\u201d. The committee started investigating the impact of lies surrounding election administration in early 2021. After former Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, he falsely insisted that the election was stolen from him. While there is no evidence that the 2020 election had irregularities, let alone widespread fraud, many Trump supporters still believe in the \u201cbig lie\u201d. This falsehood energized a mob of Trump supporters to attack the US Capitol during the January 6 2020 insurrection. The House committee said that conspiracy theorists, \u201cled by former President Donald Trump and his supporters\u201d, have fueled threats against election officials. Several in Florida publicized an election supervisor\u2019s phone number and encouraged listeners to call and say \u201cthat they are watching him, that he is a piece of crap, and that these are their elections\u201d. The committee\u2019s analysis described lies about elections as operating as a positive feedback mechanism. The report said: \u201cThe spread of false information about elections harms nearly every element of election administration.\u201d \u201cFor the past two years, election misinformation in the United States has often followed a feedback loop that produces more false information, heightens threats and pressures on election administrators, and increases the possibility of election subversion,\u201d the report said. \u201cConspiracy theorist candidates across the country have gained notoriety and run for office with the explicit goal of overturning election results,\u201d it added. The report said that the spread of misinformation has exerted enormous pressure on election officials, who are swarmed with \u201ccoordinated campaigns of records requests and bad faith inquiries\u201d to interfere with their work. Meanwhile, lawmakers in some states seized on the chaos to greenlight laws that make illegal minor mistakes by election officials, which \u201callow partisan actors to intervene in ballot counting and certification\u201d. These statutes, along with the confusion and distrust that has grown since 2020, \u201chave paved multiple pathways for the future subversion of legitimate election results,\u201d the report said."

            "title": "Rightwing sheriffs\u2019 groups ramp up drives to monitor US midterm elections",
            "date": "2022-08-17T11:00:14Z",
            "content": "Two groups of rightwing sheriffs that echo some of Donald Trump\u2019s false claims about widespread voting fraud in 2020 are ramping up drives to monitor this year\u2019s elections for potential voting and election fraud. The two Arizona-led groups together boast over 350 sheriffs as members nationwide, and have forged various ties with Texas-based True the Vote, which has a history of making unverified claims of voting fraud, spurring watchdogs and law enforcement veterans to voice alarms of looming threats to voting rights and election workers. The burgeoning sheriffs\u2019 drive to investigate so-called voting fraud was evident at a secretive Arizona meeting on 13 August that drew a crowd of some 200 allies, including former sheriff Richard Mack and current sheriff Mark Lamb, who each lead sheriffs\u2019 groups. The True the Vote chief, Catherine Engelbrecht, arranged the event, Mack told the Guardian. The gathering lasted about seven and a half hours and featured talks by Engelbrecht and Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county, Arizona, who teamed up in June to create ProtectAmerica.Vote. to promote a larger role for sheriffs in election monitoring, said Mack. \u201cI totally support what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Mack, who leads the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, which has thousands of members around the country, including hundreds of sheriffs. The event, to which Mack invited several of his staff and two former law enforcement officials, provided \u201cmore evidence of quite extensive election fraud\u201d, said Mack. \u201cThere\u2019s no way anyone in this country should be trusting computers to tabulate votes.\u201d The meeting, which was covered live by the conservative Right Side Broadcasting Network, was held at a venue \u201c that was very surreptitious\u201d, added Mack, former sheriff of Graham county, Arizona. Notably, the gathering also heard at the outset from Kari Lake, the Trump-backed GOP gubernatorial nominee for Arizona and former Fox News reporter, and was attended by Mark Finchem, a state legislator and the Trump-endorsed nominee for secretary of state, which has authority over election supervision, according to Mack. Both Lake and Finchem are prominent election deniers. The meeting, about a half-hour outside Scottsdale, underscores how sheriffs with Lamb\u2019s group, Protect America Now, and Mack\u2019s group, are working with True the Vote to provide more muscle to investigate charges of current and past voting fraud, despite numerous reports indicating such fraud is historically small, and was not significant in 2020 elections. At a press conference in Las Vegas on 12 July with several sheriffs and Engelbrecht, Mack declared that investigating voting fraud is now his group\u2019s top priority, calling it a \u201choly cause\u201d. Voting watchdogs raise strong concerns about the budding alliances between far-right sheriffs and True the Vote. \u201cThere is a critical role for law enforcement to play in protecting our elections: they should be offering protection to election officials and election workers that have come under attack as a result of lies being spread by groups like True the Vote,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, the acting director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center. \u201cWhen law enforcement or anyone else spreads false claims about elections, they\u2019re contributing to pressure on election officials.\u201d Morales-Doyle added: \u201cTrue the Vote was one of the groups behind the failed lawsuits seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It has a long history of anti-voter conduct, including orchestrating mass challenges to voters, as it did in the 2021 Georgia runoff elections.\u201d Both Engelbrecht and Mack have sparked other criticism for promoting 2020 election conspiracies, and Mack\u2019s sheriff\u2019s outfit and other sheriffs have pushed the dubious concept that they have extraordinary powers in their counties and can intervene in the running of elections and access voting equipment. Mack\u2019s Constitutional Sheriffs website, which he launched in 2011 and has hundreds of members, claims that a sheriff\u2019s authority in a county is greater than those of other officials and \u201ceven supersedes the powers of the president\u201d. Mack and his group have prompted other concerns due to ties to anti-government groups: Mack spent a few years on the board of Oath Keepers, the militia group that played a key role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol that led to several of its members being charged with seditious conspiracy, before he left the board in 2016. \u201cI think it\u2019s a significant overreach of authority by sheriffs across the country, including Mack and Lamb, to on their own declare they have the authority to investigate voting fraud,\u201d said David Mahoney, a former president of the country\u2019s largest sheriffs organization, the National Sheriffs Association which represents some 3000 sheriffs. \u201cMack has promoted a whole host of conspiracies,\u201d said Mahoney, who spent 15 years as sheriff of Dane county, Wisconsin. \u201cI think it\u2019s entirely for self-aggrandizement and to make himself relevant. Mack is playing to a far-right constituency and helps feed conspiracies.\u201d Mahoney added that Mack \u201chas said individuals have the right to form militias. I put very little credibility in him.\u201d But Mack and True the Vote now seem to be on the same page in a growing crusade to hunt for election fraud. Last month in Las Vegas during the annual libertarian Freedom Fest, Mack\u2019s group hosted a panel talk that featured several like-minded sheriffs and Engelbrecht, who revealed her rationale for enlisting sheriffs in her long-running search for alleged voting fraud. \u201cAll of a sudden, it\u2019s like the lights went on. It\u2019s the sheriffs,\u201d she told an audience of about 200 attendees at the event. \u201cThat\u2019s who can do these investigations. That\u2019s who we can trust.\u201d To cement other ties and bolster the hunt for voting fraud, True the Vote and a sheriffs group led by Lamb, Protect America Now which claims about 70 members in 30 states, in June formed ProtectAmerica.Vote. The joint effort features an \u201celection integrity hotline\u201d that True the Vote has deployed in past elections that can connect citizens with tips to sheriffs and ads that the group hopes to run in a \u201chandful of states\u201d, Engelbrecht told the Guardian. ProtectAmerica.Vote also may give grants to some sheriffs in key states such as Wisconsin and Michigan where county sheriffs have launched investigations into alleged election fraud, and provide surveillance equipment to monitor drop boxes and other voting sites, she added. To date Engelbrecht said they had raised slightly more than $100,000 of a $1m-plus goal. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there was tremendous election fraud in 2020,\u201d Engelbrecht said despite numerous reports stating otherwise. \u201cWe have big, big problems. We found many ways in which the election process was subverted in 2020.\u201d Engelbrecht added her new drive with sheriffs aims to \u201cidentify preventive solutions to avoid a repeat of 2020\u201d. The website for ProtectAmerica.Vote states its mission is to \u201cempower sheriffs\u201d and \u201cconnect citizens and sheriffs\u201d as part of a wide-ranging drive to ferret out potential voting fraud. In a video on its website Sheriff Lamb of Pinal county says: \u201cWe will engage voters, we\u2019ll help clear up confusion through education and where necessary sheriffs can and will investigate where laws are being broken.\u201d Since Engelbrecht, an early Tea Party activist, founded the dark money True the Vote in 2009 it has raised millions of dollars boasting to have discovered widespread voting fraud, but not revealed significant evidence to back up such allegations, say several voting analysts and watchdogs. True the Vote\u2019s financial angels have in recent years included several of the right\u2019s top donors. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, State Policy Network, Franklin Center for Government &amp; Public Integrity, DonorsTrust, the League of American Voters and Judicial Crisis Network have reported giving money to True the Vote since its founding, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign financing. True the Vote has seen its star rise in Trump world and \u201cbig lie\u201d circles this year due to its key role in 2000 Mules, a film by rightwing provocateur and commentator Dinesh D\u2019Souza that purported to show major fraud linked to ballot drop boxes in 2020, but was widely panned for its weak evidence. True the Vote supplied surveillance video and cellphone tracking data that were instrumental in making the film. But critics have faulted it for its flawed methodology and unproven claims that Democrats rigged the vote in several major states Biden won by paying \u201cmules\u201d who delivered 400,000 illegal votes. Former attorney general William Barr called the film \u201csingularly unimpressive\u201d during an interview he had with the House panel investigating January 6. Other critics go further. \u201c2000 Mules failed spectacularly in its efforts to present demonstrable evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election,\u201d said David Levine, a former Idaho election official and the elections integrity fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy. \u201cExperts in geo-tracking data analysis say GPS data from apps on cellphones aren\u2019t even precise enough to place cellphone users at a drop box, let alone show the commission of a crime at one.\u201d Mack was impressed by the documentary, which debuted at Mar-a-Lago, saying the evidence it presented \u201cis overwhelming and justifies criminal investigation\u201d. But Mack added that \u201cif True the Vote and D\u2019Souza lied they should be charged\u201d. Still, the heavy criticism of 2000 Mules spurred True the Vote to make several promises that more explosive evidence would be coming soon. At the Arizona meeting on 13 August, Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, a key associate who had starred in 2000 Mules, finally unveiled their promised bombshell, dubbed \u201cThe Pit\u201d. What Phillips had hailed as \u201cdevastating\u201d materials that were left out of 2000 Mules turned out to be only a new website Open.ink where they promised to put election lawsuit documents from various states and surveillance videos of drop boxes. On another controversial front, True the Vote\u2019s financial operations have drawn more scrutiny since June when Reveal news published a well-documented report focused on questionable accounting and insider financial dealings that seem to have personally benefited Engelbrecht and key associates. Engelbrecht attacked the story, saying \u201cit was filled with inaccuracies\u201d. Marc Owens, a former chief of the tax exempt division at the Internal Revenue Service, told the Guardian that Reveal\u2019s report underscored \u201ca pattern of insider financial transactions totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars involving Engelbrecht and the organization\u2019s senior management and advisers\u201d. More broadly, True the Vote\u2019s growing alliance with sheriffs to mount aggressive election fraud monitoring drives has prompted some former federal prosecutors to raise strong concerns. \u201cI am aware of no state that permits vigilante-style election monitoring and voter fraud hunting by zealous conspiracy minded conservatives and sheriffs,\u201d Paul Pelletier, the former acting chief of the fraud section at the Department of Justice, said. \u201cGiven True the Vote\u2019s history of wholly unsupportable claims of fraud, the group\u2019s \u2018election monitoring\u2019 alliance with some sheriffs who claim extraordinary powers for themselves runs the risk of violating federal law by intimidating voters. It seems to me they are flying too close to the sun here, and I am sure the DoJ [Department of Justice] will pay special attention to anyone who acts to intimidate or interfere with voters who are exercising their rights so fundamental to a democracy.\u201d"

            "title": "Election denialism remains powerful in Republican politics | The fight to vote",
            "date": "2022-08-04T10:00:05Z",
            "content": "Hello, and Happy Thursday, I\u2019m writing this as we\u2019re still digesting the results of Tuesday\u2019s primary elections in several states, the latest test of whether Republican candidates who have embraced lies about the 2020 election can get the backing of GOP voters. So far, the results only add to the considerable evidence showing election denialism remains remarkably powerful in Republican politics. One of the most consequential results on Tuesday was in Arizona, where Mark Finchem, a state lawmaker, easily won the Republican nomination to run for secretary of state, a position from which he would oversee elections. Few people in Arizona have fought as aggressively to overturn the 2020 election as Finchem has \u2013 he first tried to block Congress from recognizing Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate victory in the state, and has since sought to spread misinformation and decertify the election, which is not possible. Finchem now joins Kristina Karamo in Michigan, Jim Marchant in Nevada, and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania as Republican nominees on the verge of claiming offices where they would have enormous power over elections (Karamo and Marchant are running for secretary of state, Mastriano is running for governor, where he would get to appoint the secretary of state). So far, three of the four secretary of state candidates Trump has endorsed have won (the one exception came in Georgia\u2019s primary). \u201cHaving even one election denier in a statewide office would be a five-alarm fire for our elections,\u201d Joanna Lydgate, CEO of States United Action, which is tracking election deniers running for office, said in a statement. \u201cRecent primaries \u2013 particularly in Arizona and Michigan \u2013 should worry all of us as Americans. But voters have the power here. They can slow this trend in the primaries to come, and they can stop it in its tracks in the general election.\u201d Before Tuesday\u2019s vote, Finchem, who was endorsed by Trump, encouraged supporters to congregate at voting sites to watch for wrongdoing. \u201cStand 75ft away from the entrance of the polls,\u201d Finchem told a crowd recently, according to the Arizona Mirror. \u201cThe mere fact that you are there watching scares the hell out of them.\u201d \u201cIf Mark Finchem is victorious this November, it could jeopardize the integrity of the 2024 presidential election and possibly could subvert the will of the people for years to come,\u201d Ellen Kurtz, the founder and president of iVote, a liberal group focused on voting rights and elections, said in a statement. \u201cNo one who attempts to stop the peaceful transfer of power by attending a violent, deadly attack on our Capitol deserves to be on any ballot.\u201d There\u2019s deep concern that these officials, if elected, could use the power of their office to attempt to overturn the results of a valid election. Last week, I asked Chuck Coughlin, a Republican consultant in Arizona, what he thought Finchem would do if he was in charge of a future election and the result was in doubt. \u201cHe would not fall in line. He would follow the Donald Trump script of doing everything possible to be a disrupter if the election outcome is anything but what he wanted. I don\u2019t see any go-along-to-get-along in Mark Finchem,\u201d he told me. Kari Lake, a Republican who made election denialism a pillar of her campaign, also is leading in the Arizona governor\u2019s race. Votes are still being counted, but if she wins, it would place election denialism front and center in a state where top Republicans have aggressively embraced it. There was one other big victory for Trump on Tuesday. Rusty Bowers, the term-limited GOP speaker of the Arizona House, lost his primary to a Trump-backed challenger in a state senate race. Bowers played a central role in rebuffing Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election in his state and was censured by the state GOP after he testified in front of the panel investigating the January 6 attack. Acknowledging the headwinds he faced for going against the former president, Bowers told NBC before the primary it would be a \u201cmiracle\u201d if he won. Also worth watching \u2026 Arizona\u2019s attorney general debunked a claim from Cyber Ninjas that nearly 300 dead people could have voted in the 2020 election in Arizona Some voters were stealing pens from voting sites in Arizona, egged on by a conspiracy theory A retired supreme court justice hired by Wisconsin Republicans to review the 2020 race publicly said in March lawmakers should consider decertifying the race. Privately, he said doing so was \u201ca practical impossibility\u201d."

            "date": "2022-08-25T16:06:44Z",
            "content": "Provisional results from elections in Angola have put the incumbent president, Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, and the ruling People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) ahead. The polls are the most tightly contested vote in the country\u2019s democratic history, and have been described by analysts as an \u201cexistential moment\u201d. The opposition has also claimed a lead, increasing tensions and fears of unrest when full results become known in coming days. Ballot counting began after polls closed on Wednesday. On Thursday the electoral commission said that with about 86% of the votes counted, the MPLA was ahead with a 52% majority, while its main opposition rivals the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), led by Adalberto Costa J\u00fanior, had 42%. The vote for Unita would be a big advance on previous elections but still below levels needed to threaten the MPLA, in power since Angola declared independence from Portugal in 1975. Polls before the election had showed the MPLA only seven percentage points ahead but with very large numbers yet to make a choice. Earlier on Thursday, Unita\u2019s deputy leader, Abel Chivukuvuku, told Portuguese radio station TSF that the party was considering contesting the results because they did not \u201ccorrespond to reality\u201d, fuelling fears of post-election violence. He had told reporters on Wednesday evening that reports from counting centres had given \u201cus clear provisional indication of a winning trend for Unita in all provinces of the country\u201d. Results in past elections have been contested, in a process that could take weeks. Observers have warned that discontent with the rule of MPLA has reached a point where the party could only now secure another five years in power through widespread rigging and repression. An activist monitoring group, Mudei Movement, has taken pictures of results sheets at as many polling stations as possible, fearing the fraud that marred past polls. Unita urged voters to stay near polling stations after casting their ballots, a call many seemed to be heeding as polls closed on Wednesday evening. \u201cThe police said to vote and go home. I told them I would vote and sit down,\u201d said Severano Manuel, 28, in Cacuaco, outside Luanda. The electoral commission earlier said polling had gone smoothly. Analysts say the opposition will face a dilemma if they reject official results. To instigate a campaign of street protests would leave Unita open to accusations of deliberately fomenting disorder, but to seek redress through legal or other constitutional channels is unlikely to succeed. The elections have pitted veteran politicians in power for decades against a generation of young voters just beginning to grasp the potential to bring about a radical change. Louren\u00e7o, a Soviet-educated former general who had promised a new era for the southern African nation when he succeeded veteran leader Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos five years ago, called on voters to recognise his achievements in power. The 68-year-old MPLA veteran is credited withenacting some reforms, including boosting financial transparency and efficiency in parastatal organisations, and promoting business-friendly policies to lure foreign investors. However, Louren\u00e7o has largely failed to improve the lives of most of the 35 million inhabitants. Critics say a high-profile anti-corruption drive only targeted potentially powerful enemies \u2013 such as Isabel dos Santos, the hugely wealthy daughter of the former president \u2013 while Amnesty International has described \u201can unprecedented crackdown on human rights, including unlawful killings and arbitrary arrests, in the lead up to the 24 August election\u201d. The low-key, night-time repatriation of the remains of Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, who died in Spain last month, has added a macabre touch to the election. The former president will be buried on Sunday, which would have been his 80th birthday. Though only eight years younger than the incumbent, Costa J\u00fanior has tried to position himself as a representative of the young civil society and all those who have lost out under the years of MPLA rule. More than 60% of Angolans are under 24."

            "content": "Kenya\u2019s election count has dragged into its fourth day, after an election this week that pitted former prime minister Raila Odinga against the deputy president, William Ruto. On Friday, the head of Kenya\u2019s election commission blamed the slow progress on disruptions by political parties, who he said were treating the process like a \u201cforensic audit\u201d. \u201cPlease don\u2019t interrogate the returning officers and slow down the process,\u201d the electoral body\u2019s chair, Wafula Chebukati, said during a press briefing. \u201cIf we do that, then we shall not be able to finish this exercise.\u201d The electoral commission has until 16 August to announce the results, but was expected to announce a winner within the week. Election watchers say that the drawn-out count is fuelling public anxiety and misinformation. Unverified claims of rigging have begun to surface. \u201cIt\u2019s important for both political sides to follow legal mechanisms if there are any concerns, without whipping up public emotions or indicating to the public that they should reject the result, because that amounts to public incitement,\u201d said Javas Bigambo, a governance expert. The country\u2019s elections have been contested in its last three cycles. In 2017, the Kenyan supreme court ordered a repeat poll due to \u201cwidespread discrepancies\u201d and in 2007, a disputed outcome led to a deadly post-election violence. Reports show that public faith in the electoral body is at a meagre 26%. National media, political parties and the public ran independent vote counts based on data made publicly available by the electoral commission. Experts say the move bolstered the body\u2019s public image. But the parallel counts faced some challenges. Some public groups lacked the resources and manpower to sift through the data, and conflicting national media tallies caused some initial public confusion as different outlets worked their way through the data. To the frustration of the public, national media outlets also unexpectedly halted their tallies at the height of the count on Thursday, without explanation. Tallies by one leading outlet had showed that the race would come down to the wire, with Ruto and Odinga within less than a percentage point of each other with about 90% of votes counted. The electoral commission is the only body that can declare the results. Governance experts say that while media and public tallies are an important step towards transparency, an announcement by the electoral body would hold more weight. \u201cThe media does not yet have the capacity and independence from the state that would allow it to call an election,\u201d said Bigambo. \u201cIf they completed their count before the IEBC [Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission], it would have put the IEBC under pressure to declare a winner even before it has finished its verification process. With our history, that could have led to a political catastrophe.\u201d"

But chaos erupted minutes before the results were announced, with four out of seven electoral commissioners saying they disowned the outcome, which they termed \u201copaque\u201d. \u201cWe are not able to take ownership of the results that will be announced,\u201d said the deputy chair of the electoral commission, Juliana Cherera. The sudden declaration prompted fears that vote-rigging allegations could lead to a legal challenge or even deadly violence like the country witnessed after 2007 and 2017 presidential polls. Cherera tried to allay concerns by advising those involved to take their complaints to court. The 55-year-old president-elect later issued a conciliatory message, vowing to work with \u201call leaders\u201d. \u201cThere is no room for vengeance,\u201d said Ruto. \u201cI am acutely aware that our country is at a stage where we need all hands on deck.\u201d As news of the results filtered through to Odinga\u2019s stronghold of Kisumu, there were some outbreaks of violence. In one area, protesters congregated on a roundabout, throwing stones, setting tyres on fire and throwing up roadblocks with broken rocks. \u201cIt was not free and fair. We were cheated,\u201d Collins Odoyo, 26, an Odinga supporter, told AFP. Some international analysts suggested that the commissioner\u2019s move might be politically motivated because the four commissioners criticising the vote count as opaque were appointed by the outgoing president Uhuru Kenyatta late last year. \u201cTheir intervention smacks of political interference from the Raila Odinga camp,\u201d said Benjamin Hunter, an Africa analyst with Maplecroft, a UK-based consultancy. Kenyatta had backed Odinga after falling out with Ruto. Odinga and Kenyatta come from two of Kenya\u2019s wealthiest and influential families. Kenyatta\u2019s endorsement was expected to draw in support for Odinga from the Kikuyu community, which held a critical number of votes in the election. But Odinga\u2019s community, the Luo, have been at political odds with the Kikuyu for decades, and a reconciliation between the two after a long rivalry was ultimately not enough to bridge the divide. In the Kikuyu heartlands, Ruto swept the vote with his appeal to Kenyans on economic terms and not only traditional ethnic ones. \u201cRuto\u2019s populist tenor convinced Kikuyu voters angry at the flatlining economy and Kenyatta\u2019s alliance with Odinga to side with him,\u201d Hunter said. Despite the chaos surrounding the announcement, celebrations briefly broke out in parts of the country, including Kayole, a residential neighbourhood in Nairobi where Ruto and Odinga both have some support. Ruto\u2019s supporters were eager to see the self-proclaimed \u201chustler\u201d rise to the country\u2019s highest office from his humble beginnings selling chickens by the roadside. \u201cHe started from the very bottom and has kept rising up, so it makes us hopeful that he will empower Kenyans at the bottom, because he knows what it\u2019s like to face problems,\u201d said Miriam Wangeci Karuga, 36, an informal worker in Nairobi. Shadrach Ouma, 33, a doctor and Odinga supporter from Embakasi North, said before the announcement that he would be ready to accept any outcome if won fairly. \u201cThe country belongs to all of us, so we\u2019ll just continue to coexist peacefully with our neighbours and focus on building the country.\u201d The election was largely peaceful, but analysts said the election officials\u2019s move to disown the results may throw the country into an old pattern. Kenya\u2019s last three elections have been contested, with a 2017 poll rerun, and a dispute in 2007 leading to deadly post-election violence. Hunter said: \u201cThe sentiment that Raila has been cheated yet again will intensify anger in his Nyanza stronghold and spark protests in the coming days.\u201d The last-minute divide among the electoral officials was unexpected. Trust in the electoral commission had received a significant boost in this election after it made all voter forms publicly available, opening them up to independent counts by the media and the public. On the back of Monday\u2019s events, Odinga may contest the results in court, in what is likely the opposition figure\u2019s last bid for the presidency. \u201cKenya faces up to three treacherous weeks of uncertainty if Odinga files a petition with the supreme court, as he did in 2013 and 2017,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cOdinga has a week to file a challenge to the result and the court has two weeks to decide, casting an already delayed outcome into further suspense.\u201d If the electoral commission\u2019s announcement holds, Ruto will take over the reins of the country at an economically turbulent time. Kenya\u2019s inequality has been laid bare by a cost of living crisis that has been fuelled by the Covid pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Rising prices of basic commodities have left many Kenyan households struggling and placed the country\u2019s staple food ugali (thick maize flour porridge) out of reach for many of the country\u2019s poor. \u201cThe incoming president is in an unenviable position,\u201d said XN Iraki, a Kenyan economist. Pointing to some of Ruto\u2019s campaign promises, such as a pledge to set up a fund for small businesses, he said: \u201cIt is not clear where that money will come from.\u201d Kenya is saddled with public debt of more than 8.5tn shillings (\u00a355bn) and is due to spend more on debt repayments than on recurring expenditure this year. \u201cPeople have been waiting for the results so that they can get back to work. Kenyans have come to realise that whichever way it goes, they are still on their own,\u201d Iraki said. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 August 2022 to remove part of a quote that incorrectly said the four commissioners criticising the vote count as opaque were appointed by the outgoing president Uhuru Kenyatta in 2018. Those appointments were in 2021."

            "date": "2022-08-10T05:59:02Z",
            "content": "Federal investigators searched Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida on Monday bearing a warrant that broadly sought presidential and classified records that the justice department believed the former president unlawfully retained, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The criminal nature of the search warrant executed by FBI agents, as described by the sources, suggested the investigation surrounding Trump is firmly a criminal probe that comes with potentially far-reaching political and legal ramifications for the former president. And the extraordinary search, the sources said, came after the justice department grew concerned \u2013 as a result of discussions with Trump\u2019s lawyers in recent weeks \u2013 that presidential and classified materials were being unlawfully and improperly kept at the Mar-a-Lago resort. The unprecedented raid of a former president\u2019s home by FBI agents was the culmination of an extended battle between Trump and his open contempt for the Presidential Records Act of 1978 requiring the preservation of official documents, and officials charged with enforcing that law. For years, Trump has ignored the statute. But the criminal investigation into how he took dozens of boxes of presidential and classified records in apparent violation of that statute when he left the White House last year signals potential legal jeopardy for him for the first time. The statute governing the wilful and unlawful removal or destruction of presidential records, though rarely enforced, carries significant penalties including: fines, imprisonment and, most notably, disqualification from holding current or future office. But the justice department may take no further action now that it has secured what sources said were around 10 boxes\u2019 worth of documents in addition to 15 boxes recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year \u2013 but what it does next was not immediately clear. The FBI obtained a warrant for the search, meaning it showed there may be evidence of a crime at the location, which in this case would be the very presence of sensitive government documents that the justice department concluded should be held at the National Archives. The improper handling of classified materials raised the additional prospect that the FBI might have sufficient basis to open a counterintelligence investigation, amid concerns that the records could have been accessed by individuals not authorized to view secret documents. On his social media app, Trump on Tuesday denounced the search as a \u201ccoordinated attack\u201d that included congressional and federal investigations into his role in the Capitol attack, and state-level probes in Georgia and New York as he weighs running for a second term. The search warrant appeared to be approved by Florida federal magistrate judge Bruce Reinhart. The attachment to the warrant, describing the \u201cproperty to be seized\u201d, broadly referred to classified documents and materials responsive to the Presidential Records Act, one of the sources said. The operation would have likely required approval from the highest echelons of the justice department, former officials and FBI agents said, including attorney general Merrick Garland, and the Trump-appointed FBI director Christipher Wray. An agency spokesperson declined to comment. One of Trump\u2019s lawyers, Christina Bobb, later said the warrant sought \u201cpresidential records\u201d. Trump has not released his copy of the warrant. In executing the search warrant on Monday, teams of FBI agents wearing nondescript clothes fanned out across the entirety of the Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, the sources said. Trump was not there at the time of the raid and learned about it while he was in New York. The agents searched through storage areas in the basement of the property, the sources said, before moving to Trump\u2019s office on the second floor of the main house, where a safecracking team opened a hotel-style safe, though that contained no records responsive to the warrant. Later, the FBI agents searched the residence of Trump and his wife, Melania, and navigated through the pocket-door that separates their separate rooms, one of the sources said. The FBI agents believed the records they were seeking were at Trump\u2019s residence, the sources said, in part through the justice department\u2019s talks with Trump\u2019s lawyers \u2013 led by former assistant US attorney Evan Corcoran \u2013 about the retrieval of official records from the property. In early June, the sources said, four justice department officials, including the chief of counterintelligence and export control Jay Bratt, went down to Mar-a-Lago to ask about what materials Trump removed from the White House, and met with Corcoran and Bobb. The officials asked to see where the White House records were being kept. They were shown the storage facility in the basement where the boxes had been placed, and after looking around for some time, during which Trump dropped by to say hello, the officials left. Corcoran and Bobb continued to be in touch with the justice department in the weeks afterwards, and complied with a 8 June 2022 letter that asked the basement storage area to be secured with a lock, the sources said. The justice department is understood, at some point since the investigation was opened in April this year, to have asked for the return of classified materials. Trump\u2019s lawyers are understood to have agreed, and indicated they would go through the boxes to comply with the request. But that otherwise cordial channel of communication appears to have somehow gone awry \u2013 prompting the justice department to take the aggressive step of seeking a search warrant to seize documents \u2013 though a person close to Trump disputed this assessment and called it an incomplete account. The exact inventory of what the FBI removed was still not clear late on Tuesday. Corcoran was in possession of the search return \u2018receipt\u2019 but appears to have not divulged its contents even to some associates. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Corcoran declined to comment."

            "date": "2022-08-16T09:15:00Z",
            "content": "Campaigning in Brazil\u2019s most important election for years formally gets under way this week amid fears of political violence on the campaign trail and possible turmoil before and after the October ballots. Far-right president Jair Bolsonaro is trailing in the polls and has hinted he will not give up power if defeated by the leftist frontrunner and former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. A former army captain, Bolsonaro has sharpened his rhetoric in recent weeks, telling foreign diplomats that Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system is not reliable and ordering army officers to monitor the source code used in more than half a million ballot boxes. His supporters have attacked two Lula rallies in recent weeks, throwing faeces, urine and a crude explosive device at Lula backers, as well as shooting dead one prominent Workers\u2019 party official in the western city of Foz de Igua\u00e7u. Politicians and poll watchers fear that political violence will only escalate ahead of the 2 October elections for president, congress and 27 state governors. \u201cThere is real reason for concern because even though political violence has been a fact of life here for years the situation today has been exacerbated by the way Bolsonaro has promoted violent discourse as a way to resolve political conflicts,\u201d said Pablo Nunes, head of the CESeC thinktank. On the national stage, Lula\u2019s security details have requested more manpower to deal with the threats and the 76-year-old now wears a bulletproof vest at public events. His campaign kicks off this week with rallies in S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte. Ironically, the most prominent victim of violence in recent years is Bolsonaro, who was stabbed at a campaign event in September 2018, just weeks before the election that brought him to power. He spent three weeks in hospital and was forced to undergo surgeries as a result of the attack, carried out by a lone assailant with mental health problems. The incident, though, did not temper his outlook. The former army captain was already notorious for his love of weapons and his close links to the military, where he served for 15 years. One of his trademark moves is to make a gun with his thumb and index finger and he once joked he would like to \u201cstrafe\u201d members of the Workers\u2019 party. It was only weeks after taking power that his justice minister sought to reduce punishment for law enforcement officials who killed suspects while acting with \u201cexcusable fear, surprise or violent emotion\u201d. The wording was removed from the eventual bill but under Bolsonaro\u2019s watch congress has passed 20 different measures making it easier to buy weapons. In the first two years of his government alone the number of gun licenses issued in Brazil rose by 65% to more than 1m, according to the NGO Instituto Sou da Paz. Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper, has also spent much of the last year undermining the electoral system, repeating baseless claims about the reliability of Brazil\u2019s electronic ballot boxes and insulting the judges who preside over the supreme electoral court, which organises the election and sanctions results. He has hinted at the possibility of closing congress and in May told evangelical voters that \u201cOnly God can remove me\u201d \u2013 a comment that prompted fears of a Trump-like insurrection if the vote goes against him. \u201cThere is good reason to fear a possible Brazilian January 6 kind of situation,\u201d said Nunes. \u201cThe conditions are there for this to happen.\u201d Although Bolsonaro has the backing of many in the military, it is unclear whether the top brass would support any attempt to subvert the democratic process. Bolsonaro, though, is obviously preparing his supporters for action. Last week he told agricultural leaders, \u201cBuy your guns! It\u2019s in the Bible!\u201d \u201cHe is doing it to focus attention away from the country\u2019s real problems and frighten the opposition, as well as to keep his militant base charged,\u201d said Felipe Borba, the coordinator of a political violence thinktank at Rio\u2019s Unirio university. \u201cIt\u2019s also done to prepare his side for a violent reaction if they lose.\u201d Borba said Bolsonaro wants to accumulate chips for the high-stakes poker game that will come after the election, which will go to a runoff on 30 October if no candidate gets a majority on 2 October. A congressional inquiry into his disastrous handling of the pandemic \u2013 680,000 Brazilians perished from the Covid-19 virus, more than any other country outside the United States \u2013 accused the president of nine offences, including crimes against humanity. He also faces charges related to his spread of fake news. If he loses, he could face jail time and those close to the president said he is terrified at the prospect. Borba believes the sabre-rattling is a tactic aimed \u201cat gaining power in any possible amnesty negotiation for him and his family. He needs to show strength.\u201d Bolsonaro continues to trail in the polls with one study this week giving Lula a 12-point lead, although the gap has narrowed slightly in recent weeks. Lula remains the favourite but Bolsonaro has the government machine at his disposal and has already increased the amount of monthly aid handouts given to 18 million of Brazil\u2019s poorest families. Whether that will be enough to close the gap remains to be seen but political analysts said the incumbent can win only by taking votes directly from Lula. \u201cIf he keeps growing by consolidating votes from those who in theory should be voting for him, the kind of people who hate Lula more than anything and who were maybe not entirely happy with his government, then that won\u2019t change the game,\u201d said V\u00edtor Oliveira, a political scientist with the Pulso P\u00fablico consultancy. \u201cHe needs to take votes from Lula to win; there is no other way.\u201d"

Meanwhile, Republican and rightwing groups have swiftly used the FBI raid at Mar-a-Lago to raise money from their supporters by bombarding them with fundraising emails and appeals for donations. Could the Mar-a-Lago raid benefit Trump politically? Trump is widely believed to be pursuing a presidential run in 2024. Some suggested that it would fuel his supporters\u2019 suspicion of federal law enforcement officials, whom Trump and his allies have long disparaged as corrupt and biased. Why didn\u2019t the FBI just use a subpoena? The fact that the FBI sought a search warrant rather than a subpoena implies it did not trust Trump to hand over or preserve official documents in his possession. What else has the FBI done? Federal investigators seized the cellphone of the Republican congressman Scott Perry on Tuesday, his office said. Perry is a close ally of Trump. Biden administration ends Trump-era \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 policy The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that it had ended a Trump-era policy requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in US immigration court, hours after a judge lifted an order, in effect since December, that the so-called Remain in Mexico rule be reinstated. The timing had been in doubt since the US supreme court ruled on 30 June that the Biden administration could end the policy. Homeland security officials had been largely silent, saying they had to wait for the court to certify the ruling and for a Trump-appointed judge, Matthew Kacsmaryk, in Amarillo, Texas, to then lift his injunction. The supreme court certified its ruling last week and critics of the policy had been increasingly outspoken about the Biden administration\u2019s reticence on Remain in Mexico, calling for an immediate end to it. What will happen now? The program now will be unwound in a \u201cquick, and orderly manner\u201d, DHS said in a statement. No more people are being enrolled and those who appear in court will not be returned to Mexico when they appear in the US for their next hearings. Why did the Biden administration decide to end the policy? The policy \u201chas endemic flaws, imposes unjustifiable human costs, and pulls resources and personnel away from other priority efforts to secure our border\u201d, the department said. \u2018This is about striking fear\u2019: China\u2019s Taiwan drills the new normal, analysts say China\u2019s military drills targeting Taiwan have set a new normal, and are likely to \u201cregularise\u201d similar armed exercises off the coast or even more aggressive action much closer to the island, analysts have said. China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has been conducting live-fire exercises and other drills in the seas around Taiwan\u2019s main island for almost a week, in a purported response to the controversial visit to Taipei by the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Beijing claims Taiwan as a province. It has not ruled out taking it by force and objects to any and all foreign shows of support for its sovereignty. Taiwan has accused Beijing of using Pelosi\u2019s visit as an excuse to prepare for an invasion. While some drills are continuing, the big show put on last week has ended, and observers are now trying to assess how the dynamics of the region have changed, and what the future holds for cross-strait relations. What does Taiwan think? Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said yesterday there was concern the PLA would \u201croutinise\u201d crossing the median line. He urged the international community to push back, saying Beijing clearly aimed to control the strait.

Elon Musk has sold $6.9bn (\u00a35.7bn) worth of shares in Tesla after admitting that he could need the funds if he is forced to buy the social media platform. The Tesla chief executive walked away from a $44bn deal to buy Twitter in July but the company has launched a lawsuit demanding that he complete the deal. China is racing to stamp out Covid-19 outbreaks in the tourist hubs of Tibet and Hainan, with the authorities launching more rounds of mass testing and closing venues to contain the highly transmissible Omicron variant as Beijing presses ahead with its Covid zero strategy. A former Twitter employee has been found guilty of spying on Saudi dissidents using the social media platform and passing their personal information to a close aide of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

As climate change heats the oceans, predictions of a dangerous phenomenon known as \u201cred tides\u201d are on the rise. Red tides occur a type of rust-colored alga known as Karenia brevis grows, which produces toxic compounds that are harmful to humans as well as dolphins, manatees and other sea life.

            "date": "2022-08-03T15:37:46Z",
            "content": "Candidates who question the 2020 election results won a handful of key primaries on Tuesday, underscoring the continued political potency of the myth of a stolen election in US politics. The most significant victory was in Arizona, where Mark Finchem, who was endorsed by Donald Trump, easily won the GOP nomination for secretary of state, placing him one step closer to overseeing elections in a key battleground state. Finchem, who has self-identified with the far-right Oath Keepers, vigorously fought to block certification of Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate victory in Arizona and has sought to overturn it ever since. He told reporters on Tuesday he received a subpoena from the Department of Justice, which is investigating the January 6 attack, about a month ago. He has also been subpoenaed by the congressional committee investigating the attack. Finchem joins prominent election deniers in Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania who have earned the Republican nomination for positions in which they would wield considerable power over elections. In the Arizona gubernatorial primary, Kari Lake, a Trump-backed former news anchor who has made election misinformation a centerpiece of her campaign, narrowly led rival Karrin Taylor Robson on Wednesday morning. Even before she took the lead in ballot counting, Lake, who has already alleged fraud in the vote, claimed victory. \u201cThere is no path to victory for my opponent and we won this race, period,\u201d Lake said at her election night party. On Wednesday morning she led by just over 11,300 votes with 20% of the vote left to count. Blake Masters, a Trump-backed US Senate candidate in Arizona who has questioned election results also easily won the GOP primary to take on the Democratic senator Mark Kelly. Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona house who faced censure from his party and Trump\u2019s fury after testifying in front of the January 6 committee, lost his primary for state senate to a Trump-backed challenger. There were other signs of how election conspiracies continue to dominate Arizona politics. In Maricopa county, a Republican candidate for the board of supervisors urged voters to steal pens the county provided to fill out ballots, a nod to a baseless fraud claim promoted on Gatewaypundit, a far-right website. In Michigan, Peter Meijer, one of 10 Republicans to support Trump\u2019s impeachment, lost a primary battle against John Gibbs, who served in the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Trump administration. In a debate last month, Gibbs said there were \u201cmathematically impossible anomalies\u201d in the 2020 race, which is not true. Meijer blasted Democrats for boosting Gibbs\u2019s campaign as part of a strategy to elevate more extreme candidates who might be easier to beat in November. Michigan Republicans nominated Tudor Dixon, a conservative commentator, to take on Gretchen Whitmer for governor. Dixon has said the 2020 election was stolen in Michigan, where Trump lost by more than 150,000 votes, but has been vague about what exactly she says went wrong. In Missouri, Eric Schmitt, who lead a coalition of attorneys general urging the US supreme court to overturn the 2020 election, won the Republican nomination for US Senate. Trump endorsed \u201cEric\u201d in the race, declining to say whether he was backing Schmitt or another challenger, Eric Greitens. In Washington state, two US House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump appeared to be doing fairly well as votes continued to be counted. With about half of the vote counted, Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse were both leading Trump-backed opponents."

            "content": "Kenya\u2019s longtime opposition leader, Raila Odinga, has filed a case with the country\u2019s supreme court to challenge the results of the 9 August presidential election in which his opponent, William Ruto, was declared the winner with 50.49% of the vote. Ruto, who has served as deputy president since 2013, was named president-elect amid protests from four of the seven electoral commissioners, who renounced the results, calling them \u201copaque\u201d. They claimed that the chair of the electoral commission, Wafula Chebukati, had hijacked the process leading up to the announcement and declared the results unilaterally. Odinga said the results were \u201cnull and void\u201d and accused the chair of acting with impunity. His team has claimed that the results were not \u201ccomplete, accurate or verifiable\u201d. Civil society groups also filed a case with the supreme court on Monday, requesting that it nullify Ruto\u2019s win for reasons including electoral fraud and process failures. They argue that the voter register was poorly managed, leaving it open to tampering. \u201cBy the end, we weren\u2019t even sure how many people had voted,\u201d said Betty Okero, the national coordinator of the Angaza Movement coalition. \u201cIt was fuzzy through to the end.\u201d Contested elections have led to deadly violence in previous election cycles. Odinga, 77, has disputed the outcome of elections three times before \u2013 twice in court. Philip Gichana, the head of policy at the parliamentary watchdog Mzalendo, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had very contentious elections over the years, occasioned with a number of malpractices. But even though electoral reform has been slow, we\u2019ve made some strides.\u201d The supreme court has ordered a rerun of presidential elections once before, in 2017, because of \u201cwidespread discrepancies\u2019\u2019 by the electoral commission, after the sitting president was declared winner in a flawed race. \u201cThere\u2019s been growing trust in our court systems,\u201d says Gichana. \u201cPeople now believe that if you have concerns, they can be addressed in the courts in a fair manner. It has slowly been ingrained in the culture that the proper way to settle disputes is through the court process.\u201d Confidence in the electoral body grew in this month\u2019s elections after it made voter forms publicly available, opening them up to independent tallies by the media and the general population. However, the civil society groups that have moved to court question the authenticity of some of the forms uploaded to the electoral body\u2019s website. The election challenges are taking place amid public fatigue after a long election season. \u201cPeople overwhelmingly want to maintain the current peace,\u2019\u2019 says Gichana. \u201cBut they also want things settled if there are any questions about the elections.\u201d The 9 August race was Odinga\u2019s fifth, and probably his last, attempt at the presidency. The court will rule on the case within the next two weeks. If it nullifies the results, a repeat election will be held within 60 days, pitting Ruto and Odinga against each other once again. If it confirms the results, Ruto will then be sworn in as the country\u2019s fifth president."

            "content": "The Kenyan opposition leader, Raila Odinga, has rejected as \u201cnull and void\u201d the result of a presidential election that he was declared to have lost, and pledged to challenge the outcome with \u201call constitutional and legal options\u201d. Odinga said he would channel his complaints through \u201cappropriate authorities\u201d, in his first comments since William Ruto, the deputy president, was declared the winner with 50.49% of the vote by the electoral commission chair, Wafula Chebukati, on Monday. \u201cWe totally and without reservations reject the presidential results announced yesterday by Mr Chebukati,\u201d said Odinga on Tuesday. His announcement came shortly after four electoral commissioners said they stood by their decision to disown the outcome of the election, saying Chebukati had declared the results without the involvement of all commissioners. \u201cThe results of the presidential elections held in August 9th 2022, declared and announced by Mr Wafula Chebukati on August 15th, 2022 belonged to himself and do not represent the (position) of the commission,\u201d said the deputy chair of the electoral body, Juliana Cherera. The commissioners also said Chebukati did not address some of the political parties\u2019 complaints before calling the win. Odinga lauded the four commissioners\u2019 \u201cheroism\u201d for denouncing the results, adding: \u201cWe are certain that justice will prevail.\u201d He also urged his supporters to remain calm, following outbreaks of violence in some of Odinga\u2019s strongholds on Monday after the results were announced. Odinga is expected to file a case with the courts in coming weeks. However, lawyers said Odinga may not have strong legal grounds. \u201cOdinga has not spoken to any substantive issues of law or fact regarding why he is disputing the results,\u201d said Javas Bigambo, a lawyer and political analyst. \u201cHe is saying that Chebukati made the announcement without involving the four other commissioners who have sidestepped the declaration of the results, but the commission does not make a decision about the results \u2013 it only announces it. The voting is the ultimate decision.\u201d A number of public and civil society groups have also released tallies that support the electoral body\u2019s count. \u201cThe commission\u2019s verification process was credible and every critical player was involved with that process \u2013 from observers, political party agents, media, body officials,\u201d said Marcus Ageng\u2019a, a senior programmes officer at the Elections Observations Group. Observers say the commission has made significant progress from 2017, when the country had to conduct a repeat poll after \u201cwidespread discrepancies\u201d by the electoral body. \u201cThe commission made data publicly available in line with the rights of the public to information \u2013 anyone can interrogate the results forms,\u201d said Ageng\u2019a, a move that observers say increased public confidence in the outcome. The dramatic events on Monday raised fears of violence such as that seen after previous disputed polls. In 2017, more than 100 people were killed after the supreme court overturned the result, citing anomalies in the voting process. A decade earlier, more than 1,200 people were killed in widespread violence after the 2007 presidential vote. But some analysts believe a concession may still be possible. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that Odinga is finding a political way of giving psychological healing to his supporters, so that he does not seem to have just thrown in the towel after the declaration of results and puts them on the path of slow acceptance,\u201d said Bigambo."

            "date": "2022-08-06T08:00:09Z",
            "content": "Progressives watching the latest US primary results last Tuesday night might have felt understandably torn. While two of the most leftwing members of the House, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Cori Bush of Missouri, easily fended off their challengers, Andy Levin lost in his Michigan primary to a much more centrist colleague, Haley Stevens. The results epitomized the mixed success that progressive Democrats in the US have seen in this primary season, which will draw to a close over the next few weeks. Although a number of progressive candidates have secured important victories in congressional primaries, centrists have prevailed in some of the most high-profile races. Rather than being discouraged by their losses, however, progressive groups are celebrating their wins and strategizing about how to continue pushing the Democratic party to the left on crucial issues as they look ahead to November\u2019s midterm elections. Those progressive groups point to the success of congressional candidates like Greg Casar and Jasmine Crockett in Texas and Summer Lee in Pennsylvania to demonstrate how their movement made important gains this year. All three of those candidates won their primaries in reliably Democratic districts, meaning they will almost certainly be elected to Congress in November, boosting the strength of the left of the party. \u201cI started the season with trying to temper my own and my organization\u2019s expectations for what we were able to accomplish,\u201d said Natalia Salgado, director of federal affairs for the Working Families party. \u201cI\u2019m walking away feeling like we far exceeded what our expectations were, and I feel like we truly met our moment.\u201d The primary victories of incumbents like Tlaib and Bush have also proven how progressive lawmakers can have staying power in Congress and potentially build long political careers. \u201cI think a lot of centrists try to paint our movement and the candidates that come from our movement as being sort of temporary,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cI think what [Tlaib and Bush] demonstrate is that progressives are not only able to speak with authenticity and credibility to their electorates, but they are also able to go into Congress and govern like serious lawmakers.\u201d But progressives have also seen some bruising primary losses this year. In Texas, Jessica Cisneros lost an extremely close runoff race to Congressman Henry Cuellar, who is the last anti-abortion Democrat serving in the House. Progressive Nina Turner lost her rematch primary race against Congresswoman Shontel Brown, and Maryland\u2019s Donna Edwards, seeking to return to the House after leaving office in 2017, was defeated by a more centrist candidate. Progressives have blamed some of those losses on massive spending from outside groups aimed at undermining their candidates. Pro-Israel groups like the United Democracy Project, affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), and the Democratic Majority for Israel spent millions of dollars attacking progressive candidates and promoting their centrist opponents. The UDP spent more than $4m against Edwards alone, even though the former congresswoman had secured the endorsements of prominent Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. \u201cI think that should be a real wake-up call for the entire Democratic party, not just progressives,\u201d said Usamah Andrabi, candidate communications manager for the progressive group Justice Democrats. \u201cMainstream Democrats and Democratic leadership think that they have power over these corporate Super Pacs, but I think [Edwards\u2019s] election shows just how wrong they are.\u201d Andrabi and other progressive leaders have also criticized Democratic leaders for helping to prop up centrist incumbents like Cuellar. In the final days of Cuellar\u2019s race against Cisneros, Pelosi recorded a robocall for the congressman, while the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, traveled to Texas to campaign alongside his colleague. To Andrabi, Democratic leaders\u2019 aid to Cuellar sent a dangerous message to voters that the party does not live up to the values it espouses ahead of November, when Republicans are heavily favored to regain control of the House. \u201cHow can you be the party that supports reproductive freedom, while also supporting the last anti-abortion Democrat in the House?\u201d Andrabi said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t line up.\u201d But Salgado saw a silver lining to the many hurdles that progressive candidates have faced this primary season. The extensive efforts by big money groups and centrist leaders to promote their preferred candidates demonstrated that progressives are being taken seriously as a political movement, she argued. \u201cIf progressives weren\u2019t being successful and weren\u2019t seen as a threat, I don\u2019t know that the forces of the Democratic party \u2013 with a capital D \u2013 and the centrist and moderate forces in our country and the big money forces would have coalesced in the way that they did,\u201d Salgado said. Even in the races where progressives lost, their supporters say those candidates helped to shape the conversation around important issues such as racial justice and the climate crisis. Given that the Democratic party has moved to the left in recent years, progressives hope that their candidates\u2019 platforms will help persuade voters to embrace even more liberal reforms. \u201cThere has been a real battle, especially in the last decade and a half, to redefine what the Democratic party means,\u201d said Cristina Tzintz\u00fan Ramirez, president and executive director of the young progressive voting group NextGen America. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the minimum wage, taxing the rich, climate change, or policing and immigration, progressives are actually winning. They are moving the Democratic party in the right direction.\u201d As the primary season starts to wind down and Democrats prepare for the general elections in the fall, progressives have promised to do everything they can to prevent Republicans from regaining control of Congress. Salgado said her group was eager to use the insight it has gained over the past several months to help Democratic candidates win in November. \u201cWe truly have a winning formula for being able to beat back big money,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cWhen we head into the general election, when we\u2019re all on the same team, let\u2019s take the lessons learned from this cycle \u2026 to keep out the true enemy, to keep out insurrectionists, to keep out fascists from taking over our country.\u201d Centrists and progressives alike agree that the stakes could not be higher for this year\u2019s midterm elections, which will mark the first time that every House member will be on the ballot since the January 6 insurrection. As Donald Trump and many of his allies continue to spread lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election, progressives are committed to putting any lingering disappointment about primary results behind them. \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t get the candidate of choice, the future of democracy is in your hands,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cFor me, the choice is clear, and for voters, we hope the choice is clear as well.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-25T16:16:04Z",
            "content": "Further education and sixth form colleges are calling for the exams watchdog to investigate the reasons for delays to BTec results, which have left thousands of students in limbo. Exam board Pearson said there were 5,700 students who didn\u2019t receive their grades for level two BTecs alongside GCSE results as scheduled on the morning of 25 August, plunging them into uncertainty over where they will be studying next year. This follows thousands of pupils failing to receive results for their level three BTecs from Pearson, and Cambridge Technicals from the exam board OCR last week. Pearson said the delays were due to problems with entries not meeting the \u201cqualification criteria\u201d, making them \u201cineligible\u201d for grading. David Hughes, the chief executive of the Association of Colleges, urged Ofqual to launch \u201ca full, thorough and open investigation into what went wrong to make sure this never happens again\u201d. Labour has also called for an investigation, describing the delays as \u201ca debacle\u201d. Hughes said: \u201cThis cohort of young people has already suffered severe disruption to their learning due to the pandemic. That makes it even more unacceptable that these same students have faced extra stress with delayed results. Pearson and OCR\u2019s systems simply did not deliver results on time to thousands of students, and they have badly let them down.\u201d Hughes added that it had been difficult to communicate with Pearson, which has not been clear about the reasons for the delay, leaving \u201ccollege staff to pick up the pieces without all the available information to hand\u201d, although he said the awarding body was starting to open up. A spokesperson for Pearson said that 240,000 students received their results for BTecs and related vocational qualifications on time, and apologised to those who were still waiting. She said: \u201cAs of 10pm yesterday, there are 5,700 students registered for the qualification who are currently ineligible to receive their grade \u2013 meaning we need to work with schools and college to resolve queries, run eligibility checks and confirm if the student still wishes to claim a grade.\u201d Pearson said BTecs were modular qualifications based on a combination of internal modules, assessed by colleges and schools, and external assessments, which Pearson marks. Unless it receives grades for all units, it is unable to assess the qualification. It said that changes made to account for Covid disruption had \u201cadded more complexity\u201d this year. Colleges said there was always some human error involved in providing the unit results, but this would not usually result in comparable delays. John Thornhill, chief executive of LTE group, which runs several colleges in Manchester, tweeted his frustrations with the awarding bodies, warning that he would review the business relationship. He wrote: \u201cThis a third year in a row we\u2019ve had abject disregard for students, &amp; LTE Group as a customer, while paying them \u00a3millions\u201d. Last week, thousands of students were left without their level three BTec results. Although colleges and universities promised to hold places for those with an offer, students who missed their grades were delayed from entering clearing, meaning there were fewer places still available. In an update to level three entrants published on Wednesday, Pearson said it had sent an additional 2,450 BTec results to the University and College Admissions Service to enable students to claim their places for further study, adding that 900 outstanding claims remained. OCR said that it had \u201cnow issued every [Cambridge Technicals] result for students with higher education progression needs\u201d that it could identify, and that it was \u201cvery sorry for the additional stress to students over the past week\u201d. Ofqual did not confirm whether it would launch an investigation, but a spokesperson noted that \u201cit is important that, as regulator, we review what has happened to make sure that students in future years receive results when they expect them\u201d. \u2022 The headline and text of this story were amended on 25 August 2022; the original version incorrectly stated that there were calls for Pearson to investigate the delays, rather than Ofqual. The text was further amended on 29 August 2022 to add a clarification from OCR that had been omitted from an earlier version, noting that it has issued results for all students with higher education progression needs only where it knows that they have met the criteria for a Cambridge Technicals qualification."

            "date": "2022-08-24T10:46:14Z",
            "content": "Angolans are voting in an election in which the ruling People\u2019s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) faces the most significant challenge from opposition parties for decades. More than 14 million people in the oil and diamond rich country are eligible to vote, with a high turnout likely after polls showed the main opposition party closer to victory than many expected. Observers have described the election as an \u201cexistential moment\u201d for Angola, and a test for democracy across a swath of sub-Saharan Africa. The MPLA has been in power since Angola declared independence from Portugal in 1975, but discontent has now reached a point where the party may have to resort to fraud to secure another five years in power through rigging and repression, experts say. The party is led by Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o, a former defence minister, who won power in 2017 after being handpicked as successor to Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, whose authoritarian rule lasted 38 years. \u201cThe MPLA is not so confident,\u201d said David Boio, a respected sociologist. \u201cThere are many polls that show the results might not be so good for them. It\u2019s very close and we are talking about an authoritarian regime that will not take any risks.\u201d Though Louren\u00e7o, 68, has tried to boost economic growth and pay off vast debts, he has failed to improve the lives of most Angolans. Critics say a high profile anti-corruption drive targeted only potentially powerful enemies \u2013 such as Isabel dos Santos, the hugely wealthy daughter of the former president \u2013 while Amnesty International has described \u201can unprecedented crackdown on human rights, including unlawful killings and arbitrary arrests\u201d. \u201cI hope this election brings a bit of change because the country is not good as it is,\u201d Goncalo Junior Maneco, a 25-year-old electrician, told Reuters as he waited to vote at a polling station in the capital, Luanda. Louren\u00e7o voted at the same polling station surrounded by heavy security. \u201cWe have just exercised our right to vote. It\u2019s fast and simple. We advise all eligible citizens to do the same. In the end, we will all win, democracy wins and Angola wins,\u201d he told reporters. As elsewhere in Africa, a key factor in Angola is the youth of the population. More than 60% is under 24. Louren\u00e7o\u2019s principal rival is Adalberto Costa J\u00fanior of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita). Though only eight years younger than the incumbent, Costa J\u00fanior has tried to position himself as a representative of the young, civil society and all those who have lost out under the years of MPLA rule. Thousands of supporters \u2013 mainly young people \u2013 turned out at a rally in a densely populated and impoverished district of Luanda on Monday to show support for Costa J\u00fanior. \u201cYou\u2019re showing that Angola has a fighting spirit,\u201d Costa J\u00fanior told the enthusiastic crowd. \u201cUnita\u2019s mandate represents the realisation of a dream, the realisation of the youths\u2019 goals.\u201d Unita were once the proxies of the west, funded and armed by the US and its allies, but eventually losing the civil war to the MPLA, which was backed by the USSR and Cuba. Under Costa J\u00fanior, the party has shifted to the centre but is still seen as pro-western and pro-business, contrasting with the MPLA with its Socialist ideological background and continuing links with Russia. The Angolan electoral commission has promised a fair election and there are hundreds of international observers to monitor the process. Boio said Costa J\u00fanior would face a dilemma after the poll. After promising that he would call out fraud, the Unita leader will be expected to act. He will also need to channel the anger of many voters, particularly the younger cohorts. An attempt to use the courts or other institutions is unlikely to succeed, but the government has made clear it will move fast to shut down any protests and would blame Unita for any disorder. \u201cIn the long run it will be very difficult for the MPLA to stay in power. They can win tomorrow, but the only real option for the government is more and more repression and the situation of the country will get worse,\u201d Boio said. Eric Humphery-Smith, senior Africa analyst at consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft, said tensions would peak when results are announced in two weeks\u2019 time. \u201cWe expect a heavy handed response to any protests, which would sully president Louren\u00e7o\u2019s already chequered human rights record. One black mark on his record is that he continues to stymie probes into human rights violations carried out during Angola\u2019s messy civil war,\u201d Humphery-Smith said."

            "date": "2022-08-03T19:51:29Z",
            "content": "Most primary elections turn out only a small portion of the electorate \u2013 but this year\u2019s Kansas primary was unlike any other in the state. This year\u2019s primary ballot included a question to decide whether to stop the state\u2019s constitution from protecting abortion rights, which could have paved the way for the state legislature to completely ban abortion. On Tuesday, Kansans resoundingly voted against the anti-abortion measure \u2013 and turned out in record numbers to do so. With 95% of precincts reporting, more than 900,000 voters turned out for the primary election, which accounts for nearly half of registered voters. It\u2019s the kind of turnout the state usually sees in general elections. After the US supreme court overturned federal protections for abortion in June, the Kansas primary was the first electoral test of abortion rights in the country. Not only was turnout high, but before the election Kansans were also registering to vote in record numbers. As of July 2022, weeks after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, about 1.9 million people registered to vote \u2013 comparable only to the 2020 general election, when Donald Trump was vying for a second term. A typical primary election draws only the most engaged citizens because they\u2019re only choosing which candidate will represent each political party in the general election. Turnout in primaries is usually between 20% and 30% of registered voters. More than 47% of registered voters participated on Tuesday, with tens of thousands of votes still to be counted. This comes after a concerted Republican effort to sway the vote and clear the path for abortion restrictions. Last year, the Republican state legislature put this measure on the primary ballot, rather than the November general election ballot, probably because they knew primary voters tend to be more conservative than the overall electorate. In addition, the language Republicans put on the ballot was confusing and misleading. For example, the ballot language says the amendment would stop state funding for abortion, even though the state already bans public funding for abortion. A poll in late 2021 found that more than 60% of Kansans oppose making abortion completely illegal \u2013 44% of the state\u2019s voters are registered Republicans and 26% are registered Democrats. With nearly all the votes counted on Wednesday, about 59% of voters said they did not want to remove the state constitution\u2019s protection for abortion rights."

            "date": "2022-08-10T10:00:13Z",
            "content": "It is no longer possible to understand politics without understanding polling. It doesn\u2019t just drive the media narrative around politicians and candidates but, often, the policy agendas they adopt and the way they talk about issues. Yet it remains poorly understood, not just by the wider public, but by analysts and office holders too. In the UK, for example, you don\u2019t have to spend long on social media to find an MP promoting an entirely unrepresentative poll from a newspaper website, or a talk radio host claiming a result they dislike is due to that pollster being in cahoots with some nefarious actor. In this short, valuable guide, G Elliot Morris gives us a brief history of how polls came to play such an important role in politics, and how they work. Its focus is on the US but the debates play out in a similar way in Britain. The history is interesting, particularly on the various polling gurus used by presidents, such as Emil Hurja, a mercurial small-town hustler who ended up working for Franklin D Roosevelt and transforming the way in which political parties used data. But the most useful part of the book focuses on the methodological challenges that make polling difficult, and increasingly so. The biggest problem is that people don\u2019t answer phones any more. In the 1970s or 80s pollsters could achieve a representative sample of the population by calling randomised numbers. But now that\u2019s impossible: only a handful of people will pick up and they won\u2019t be typical members of the public. As a result, polling has moved increasingly online. This has some advantages \u2013 it\u2019s much cheaper to collect large amounts of data and easier to do repeat surveys of the same people to identify trends over time. The downside is that companies can\u2019t randomise their sample as they typically rely on people signing up to online panels. This then increases the importance of modelling the sample against ever more complex lists of variables. It\u2019s when this modelling goes wrong that we see the kind of polling misses that have increased scepticism about their value, even as they become more central to political life. In the 2015 UK election, pollsters overestimated the number of younger voters who would turn out, failing to spot the impending Conservative majority. In 2016 many US pollsters oversampled voters with degrees, making Trump\u2019s victory seem less likely. In 2020 they fixed that problem but again underestimated Trump\u2019s support \u2013 possibly because, after he attacked polls, some of his fans stopped answering them. The reaction to this has been to employ increasingly opaque and sophisticated methods such as MRP (multilevel regression with poststratification). Even the more thoughtful political analysts struggle to understand how these polls are constructed. One result is that there\u2019s little distinction in the amount of coverage well and poorly designed models get. Morris is surely right in his conclusion that pollsters and the media that use them need to do a better job at explaining complexity and uncertainty. He\u2019s also right that issue polling, where being a few points out matters much less, is more important than voting intention data. It can be a critical tool in pushing back against vested interests by showing the level of public concern about, say, the climate emergency or its dislike of corporate tax cuts. Most of all Morris is right that, for all its problems, polling remains our best tool for understanding how people think about politics. The alternative is prejudice and guesswork. \u2022 Strength in Numbers: How Polls Work and Why We Need Them is published by WW Norton (\u00a321.99).

            "content": "Millions of Kenyans have been voting in an election that pits the longtime opposition politician Raila Odinga against the deputy president, William Ruto. In Kayole, a poor neighbourhood in the capital, Nairobi, residents woke up to the sound of vuvuzelas and whistles from 4am \u2013 a rallying call to get out and vote. Geoffrey Otieno, 26, an artisan in the informal sector, marshalled his neighbours to the nearest polling station. \u201cI\u2019m waking up this early to vote for Baba (Odinga) because of his plans for healthcare and food security. I\u2019m able to put food on the table, but many people I know are not,\u201d he said. Odinga, 77, a former prime minister, has pledged to introduce a health-care-for-all system called \u201cBabacare\u201d and allocate 6,000 shillings (\u00a341) a month to each vulnerable household. Kenya is facing a cost of living crisis, fuelled by the pandemic and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which has cut global food supply chains and affected food prices and availability in the country. \u201cLife has been hard,\u201d said Atieno Okello, a salon owner from the area. \u201cThings have really gone up and it\u2019s really hit us hard.\u201d Odinga has run a campaign centring on social protection, a revival of agriculture and manufacturing, and anti-corruption. He is backed by his former-nemesis, the outgoing president, Uhuru Kenyatta, who had a falling out with Ruto during his final term. Odinga and Kenyatta put their long political rivalry to rest after a handshake in 2018, meant to signify that they were moving on from bitterly fought, ethnically divisive elections in 2017 in an effort to unify the country. Ruto, 55, has had a political career spanning decades. The live chicken-seller turned billionaire has been dogged by corruption allegations for years, though never indicted. He has positioned himself in the race as an underdog and a class warrior \u2013 a move that observers say gave him mileage in his efforts to take on the country\u2019s most powerful political families. The populist candidate has fronted a \u201cbottom-up\u201d economic model that he says would empower low-income communities. \u201cRuto will bring development for the youth,\u201d said Munia Musyoka, 35, a motorcycle taxi rider from Kayole. \u201cFor him to get to where he is, he\u2019s ambitious and can definitely change things for us.\u201d Voter turnout in poor areas like Kayole and Mathare was strong, but more sparse in middle-income neighbourhoods like Kilimani. \u201cThe middle class have historically been a weak link,\u201d said political analyst Mark Bichachi. \u201cThey suffer from a sense of absurdism \u2013 that the issues are too big for their vote to count.\u201d With the country\u2019s poor far-outnumbering its rich and middle class, support along economic lines could shift the tides in Ruto\u2019s favour. Kenya is a highly unequal country. Less than 0.1% of the population own more than the 99% of the country\u2019s wealth, according to an Oxfam report. In Nairobi, more than 60% of the population live in overcrowded informal settlements that occupy just 5% of the total area of the city. \u201cKenya has always been ripe for the kind of class politics Ruto has advanced,\u201d said says Murithi Mutiga, programme director for Africa at the International Crisis Group thinktank. \u201cWhether he wins or loses, he\u2019s had a definitive impact on the public discourse.\u201d But ethnic politics are still at the centre of Kenyan elections. For the first time in more than a decade, there is no leading candidate from the Kikuyu community, the largest ethnic group in Kenya and one that has produced the majority of the country\u2019s presidents. Analysts say this has defused ethnic tensions in the 2022 elections. \u201cPast elections tended to be quite divisive because they were essentially referendums on perceived Kikuyu elite economic and political domination,\u201d said Mutiga. With votes from the bloc up for grabs, competition for influence has been stiff, and both Ruto and Odinga have selected running mates from the Kikuyu heartlands of south-central Kenya. But the tough economic realities facing Kenyans have pushed campaigning beyond ethnic and personality-driven politics. The outgoing Kenyatta government has faced growing criticism over the rising cost of living, high unemployment rates and public debt. \u201cThe Kenyatta endorsement has been a mixed blessing for Odinga,\u201d said Mutiga, adding that it had forced the latter to run a fairly conservative campaign. Odinga has been accused of softening his criticism of the government since the 2018 handshake. While the general elections are high stakes for the political elite, with voting also taking place for parliament and local government, they have attracted less than usual public interest. Mutiga said there was public exhaustion over the shifting alliances. \u201cThey\u2019ve wised up to the fact that the political elite are divided by very little,\u201d he said. Some are even boycotting the elections.\u201cI don\u2019t trust them,\u201d said Jacqueline Muturi, 29, of the presidential frontrunners, citing their involvement in the 2007 post-election violence, which engulfed the country after a disputed election \u2013 leaving over 1,000 Kenyans dead and hundreds of thousands displaced. Voting at most polling stations has been fairly peaceful and analysts say that violence is unlikely. The electoral body is expected to announce a winner within a week but analysts say a leading candidate is expected to emerge within days. To win the election in the first round, Odinga or Ruto will need to gain more than 50% of the total votes and at least 25% of those cast in at least 24 of 47 counties."

            "date": "2022-08-09T11:00:27Z",
            "content": "They were cruel, brutish years. Dissidents languished in torture chambers. Rebels were shot in cold blood. Artists fled abroad. \u201cIt was a time of constant sorrow and fear,\u201d the Brazilian lawyer and former justice minister Jos\u00e9 Carlos Dias said of the military dictatorship that hijacked his country in 1964 and would rule for more than two decades. \u201cViolence wasn\u2019t just something the torturers enjoyed. It was government policy.\u201d In 1977, Dias and a group of like-minded legal experts decided they could no longer tolerate the repression and spoke out with a historic pro-democracy manifesto called the \u201cLetter to the Brazilians\u201d. The document \u2013 an extraordinary rebuke to Brazil\u2019s military rulers and watershed moment in the fight for freedom \u2013 was read at a packed assembly at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s top law school one evening in August that year. \u201cWe denounce as illegitimate all governments that are based on force \u2026 A dictatorship is a regime that governs for us, yet without us,\u201d the group\u2019s spokesman, the conservative professor Goffredo da Silva Telles J\u00fanior, proclaimed. Exactly 45 years later Dias, who defended hundreds of political prisoners during the dictatorship and was arrested three times, will this week return to the same venue to make a similar appeal. On Thursday morning, intellectuals, impresarios and artists will crowd into one of the university\u2019s courtyards to champion another manifesto inspired by the 1977 rallying cry, called the \u201cLetter to Brazilian Women and Men in Defense of the Democratic Rule of Law\u201d. \u201cWe are living through a moment of immense danger for democratic normality,\u201d warns the 2022 proclamation, which has been signed by more than 800,000 people from across the political spectrum. \u201cThere is no room for authoritarian backsliding in today\u2019s Brazil. Dictatorship and torture belong to the past.\u201d The document \u2013 whose signatories include wealthy bankers and tycoons, prominent members of the judiciary and three former presidents \u2013 makes no direct mention of the man whose actions inspired its authors. But his identity is crystal clear: Brazil\u2019s dictatorship-admiring far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who some fear is on the verge of trying to plunge the country back into another era of tyranny. \u201cI lived under one dictatorship and I do not want to live under another,\u201d said Dias, who helped write both manifestos and is convinced Bolsonaro is plotting to cling to power ahead of a presidential election he looks set to lose. \u201cThe polls show he will be defeated. But there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s laying the groundwork for a coup. It\u2019s my belief that he wants to repeat what happened in the Capitol in the United States,\u201d Dias claimed in reference to the 6 January assault on Congress by supporters of Donald Trump. Bolsonaro \u2013 a pro-Trump populist whose politician son was in Washington during that failed insurrection and met with Trump\u2019s supporters and relatives \u2013 has never been shy about his disdain for democracy or his admiration for autocrats such as Chile\u2019s General Augusto Pinochet. Since taking office in 2019, Bolsonaro has repeatedly encouraged anti-democratic protests and attacked Brazil\u2019s institutions. He once invited the wife of the dictatorship\u2019s most notorious torturer to visit him at the presidential palace, calling him a \u201cnational hero\u201d. Visiting Hungary earlier this year, Bolsonaro hailed its far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2013 who has governed since 2010 and been accused of eroding his country\u2019s democracy \u2013 as \u201ca brother\u201d. But fears for the future of Brazil\u2019s young democracy have intensified in the lead-up to October\u2019s crunch election, which polls suggest will be won by Bolsonaro\u2019s leftist rival, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Facing electoral wipeout and possible jail for his calamitous Covid response and other alleged crimes, Bolsonaro has radicalized, urging supporters to \u201ctake to the streets for the last time\u201d. \u201cWe are the majority, we are upstanding folk, and we are prepared to fight for our freedom,\u201d the Brazilian president declared ominously last month as he launched his re-election campaign. Those threats, and Bolsonaro\u2019s outlandish decision to summon foreign ambassadors to trash Brazil\u2019s internationally respected electronic voting system, have convinced some he is cooking up some kind of pre-election political rupture. Dias and others fear that upheaval could come on 7 September, when Brazil celebrates 200 years of independence from Portugal and Bolsonaro has instructed supporters to march down Rio\u2019s Copacabana beach with members of the armed forces. \u201cIt\u2019s just madness and I fear there could be scenes of violence,\u201d warned Dias, the president of a human rights group called the Arns Commission. Intelligence chiefs are reportedly investigating whether radical rightwing extremists are conspiring to attack Bolsonaro supporters at the rally and blame the crime on leftists in an attempt to change the course of the election. Even conservative media outlets such as the magazine Veja have expressed alarm, with one recent front page picturing an imaginary timebomb set to detonate on 7 September 2022. Many dismiss Bolsonaro\u2019s declarations as the empty bluster of a politician in decline, or an attempt to fire up his base and intimidate opponents before the 2 October vote. But in a message to the Guardian, the former supreme court judge Celso de Mello said Bolsonaro\u2019s coup-mongering rhetoric and \u201ccontemptible autocratic spirit\u201d meant it was essential that democracy-loving Brazilians take a stance before the election. \u201cBolsonaro\u2019s conduct has shown itself to be intolerable,\u201d said De Mello, who has signed the pro-democracy manifesto and said the president\u2019s rhetoric veered \u201cdangerously into the marshland of seditious talk\u201d. Another signatory, the singer-songwriter Nando Reis, said he felt apprehension over possible disturbances in the coming weeks. \u201cThere is a real threat to democracy here \u2026 We cannot just ignore someone who is crazy and urges civilians to arm themselves and then incites them to \u2018defend their freedom\u2019,\u201d Reis said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t take him seriously before and he became the president of Brazil,\u201d the musician added. \u201cI expect everything from Bolsonaro, except for reasonableness.\u201d Dias said he felt encouraged by the unexpectedly large and diverse response to the pro-democracy campaign, whose backers Bolsonaro has called \u201cdespicable brass necks\u201d. The manifesto will be read at universities around the country on Thursday, while street protests are planned. A second pro-democracy declaration, which Dias will read at the S\u00e3o Paulo event, was signed by capitalist associations including the Brazilian Federation of Banks as well as Brazil\u2019s largest trade union. \u201cIt is capital and labour coming together to defend our democracy and freedom,\u201d said Dias, who thought the unlikely collaboration came in the nick of time. \u201cBrazil is in intensive care. We have an utterly deranged president who \u2026 pays homage to torturers and dictators. We face the risk of having to live through a dictatorship once again \u2013 and this is inconceivable,\u201d the 83-year-old lawyer said. Speaking out was hazardous given the venomous political atmosphere and hundreds of thousands of firearms that have gone into circulation under Brazil\u2019s pro-gun president. \u201cWe are exposing ourselves. I have no doubt that all of us are facing the risk of violence,\u201d Dias admitted. \u201cBut we must fight this while there is still the chance of us surviving in democracy \u2026 We must fight until the very end \u2013 and as long as I\u2019m alive I will continue to fight.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-04T02:04:08Z",
            "content": "In the wake of US House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan, China has revealed plans for unprecedented military exercises near the island, prompting fears of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Pelosi visited the self-governing island this week in defiance of a series threats from Beijing, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province, and warned it would consider the visit a major provocation. As tensions in the Taiwan Strait simmer, what\u2019s at stake for China and how worried should we be? How has China responded to Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taiwan? China\u2019s military announced joint air and sea drills near Taiwan and test launches of conventional missiles in the sea east of Taiwan. According to Chinese state media, three of the six live-fire drills will overlap with sea Taiwan claims is its territory. Ahead of the exercises, which are due to begin on Thursday, Taiwan said 27 Chinese warplanes had entered its air defence zone. Taiwan has never been part of the People\u2019s Republic of China and says it is already a sovereign nation with no need to declare independence. It wishes to maintain the safety of the status quo and does not want a conflict, but has said it will defend itself. Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry called China\u2019s planned exercises an aerial and maritime blockade of Taiwan. \u201cThis is a big deal given a blockade is a legal act of war,\u201d said Indo-Pacific defence policy expert Blake Herzinger. \u201cI think it needs to be signalled to Taiwan that this is not the time to inflame things further.\u201d This week, Taiwan has also been hit by a series of cyber-attacks though it is not yet clear who was responsible. China, Taiwan\u2019s largest trading partner, also suspended a number imports from the island. How worrying are China\u2019s military drills? Live-fire exercises are a test of a military\u2019s ability to perform missions under conditions most resembling actual warfare. In this case, they are designed to show the level of force China could unleash against Taiwan if Beijing decided to seize control of the island. Experts agree that neither the US nor China have the appetite for the tension to escalate to war. According to Justin Bassi, executive director for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, China\u2019s military exercises will probably be calibrated to avoid escalation from the US. Herzinger said the US has been very careful to not express support for Taiwan\u2019s independence given that is China\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d. \u201cIn the US engagement with Taiwan, they\u2019re always careful to ensure they find the right balance between supporting Taiwan, but without emboldening Taiwan to do something that would cause a larger conflict,\u201d he said. Amanda Hsiao, a senior analyst for China at the Crisis Group, said while China\u2019s military escalation is concerning, it is not an unexpected response. \u201cBeijing is clearly trying to express it\u2019s resolute objections to Pelosi\u2019s visit,\u201d she said \u201cAnd that means that the military response that it chooses right now has to visibly escalate above military activities that it has previously engaged in around Taiwan, and that baseline is pretty high. \u201cI think the intention of the military drills is more likely to posture and demonstrate military strength,\u201d she said. China\u2019s Global Times newspaper said on Wednesday the drills were aimed at showing that China\u2019s military is \u201ccapable of blockading the entire island\u201d. Has the situation been this tense before? There have been several crises in the Taiwan Strait, most recently in 1995. That incident was known as the Third Strait of Taiwan Crisis and followed the island\u2019s announcement that it would hold its first democratic presidential elections. China flexed its military muscle with months of military drills, including firing missiles 35 miles from Taiwan\u2019s ports. While there is a history of military displays in the Taiwan strait, Hsiao said it appears missile tests planned by China in response to Pelosi\u2019s visit will be closer to the island this time. What is at stake for Chinese leader Xi Jinping? Since Xi came to power in 2012 he has made it clear that reunification with Taiwan is high on his agenda. Yet some experts say Xi\u2019s response to Pelosi\u2019s visit is likely to be as much about domestic issues in China as it is about asserting power. Mainland China is plagued by an unfolding property crisis that has provoked protests, and economic slowdown resulting from its strict zero-Covid policy and continued lockdowns. \u201cWhen it comes to Pelosi\u2019s visit it may perhaps be an opportunity for Xi Jinping to sort of turn the lens away from domestic issues and focus outward as a method of distraction,\u201d said Jennifer Hsu, a research fellow at Australia\u2019s Lowy Institute. According to Jade Guan, an expert in China\u2019s foreign policy at Deakin University, Xi\u2019s actions to look strong on Taiwan and against the US are also likely influenced by the upcoming 20th National Congress, a meeting that occurs every five years to announce major leadership changes. \u201c[Xi] projects himself as the protector of China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, of which Taiwan is a central part,\u201d Guan said. \u201cSo Xi\u2019s administration cannot afford to look weak before [National Congress].\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-24T19:53:55Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. It is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date, bringing to over $13bn the total the US has supplied or pledged to Kyiv under the Biden administration. The new equipment, however, will have to be ordered by defence manufacturers and will not be delivered for months or years. US officials said it represented a longer-term investment in Ukrainian security. The new package was announced on the country\u2019s independence day and in the run-up to an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian-occupied territory. \u201cThe United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cAs part of that commitment, I am proud to announce our biggest tranche of security assistance to date: approximately $2.98bn of weapons and equipment to be provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defence systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.\u201d The new US-built Vampire drone defences, which use small missiles against unmanned aircraft, are particularly significant as Russian forces, facing low morale, general exhaustion and widespread equipment shortages, have been expanding their use of drones, an area where they are receiving support from Iran. Russian officials watched a display of Iranian drones in June and US officials believe Russians are being trained to use them inside Iran. The US is also delivering six National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems (Nasams), a Norwegian-US build anti-aircraft missile, bringing the total promised to eight. Other weapons included in the package are 245,000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition, up to 65,000 rounds of 120mm mortar ammunition, two dozen counter-artillery radars, and Puma drones. However, unlike recent US arms deliveries, this batch under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), does not come from US military stockpiles but will be ordered directly from manufacturers. That means that some of the equipment will not be delivered for months or even years. \u201cThis package of capabilities is really aimed at getting Ukraine what they\u2019re going to need in the medium to long term,\u201d Colin Kahl, the Pentagon policy chief, said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not relevant to the fight today, tomorrow, next week. It is relevant to the ability of Ukraine to defend itself, and deter further aggression a year from now, two years from now.\u201d The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, expressed gratitude for the new aid, which includes some of the types of weapons he has been demanding. \u201cThe people of Ukraine, all our defenders highly appreciate [the USA\u2019s] unwavering support. Together we will win!\u201d Zelenskiy said in a tweet. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US had \u201cdemonstrated that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes\u201d, and a recent poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs suggested there were few signs of \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d so far among the US electorate. Near three-quarters of the Americans questioned backed increasing military aid to Ukraine. Fifty-eight per cent agreed with the statement that the US should support Ukraine \u201cfor as long as it takes, even if American households will have to pay higher gas and food prices as a consequence\u201d. And 38% thought the US should send troops to Ukraine to fight the Russians, something that Biden has vowed not to do. On most questions there was little difference between the views of Democrats and Republicans, making it one of the relatively few issues that does not split the country. That level of bipartisan support may become an important factor if Republicans take back control of the House of Representatives in November\u2019s congressional elections."

            "content": "Good morning. Europe\u2019s largest nuclear plant was shelled over the weekend, and for days Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other. The plant was seized by Russia in March and used as a military base but is still run by Ukrainian staff. The incident has prompted significant concern from international organisations, scientists and neighbouring countries. Beyond the obvious dangers of a nuclear plant being shelled, there is also anxiety that Russia is trying to connect the facility to the grid in Crimea. If this happens, it\u2019ll be the first time that one country has stolen a nuclear reactor from another. As the war moves into its sixth month, the end seems no closer. I spoke to Guardian foreign correspondent Luke Harding in Ukraine about the current situation and what to expect from the coming months. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories US | Donald Trump has refused to testify in the New York attorney general\u2019s investigation of the former president\u2019s real estate dealings. Wildfires | More than 6,000 people have been evacuated from the Gironde region of France after a wildfire, which began in July, reignited due to drought and high temperatures. Energy | Research by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit has found that poorly insulated homes will have to pay almost \u00a31,000 more than other homes on their energy bills this winter. Politics | Former prime minister Gordon Brown has called for the government to scrap the energy price cap and renationalise energy companies that cannot offer lower rates. Space | An image of the remnants of a supernova has been captured in stunning detail by a new Australian supercomputer called Setonix. The second installation is expected to be completed later this year. In depth: \u2018It\u2019s going to be hard and it\u2019s going to be bloody\u2019 As Russian forces gather in the south of the country, it\u2019s becoming clear that the war in Ukraine is entering a new, decisive phase. Russia wants to hold out for the winter, when most of Europe will be in the thick of an energy crisis and more likely to push for a negotiated agreement. President Zelenskiy has made it clear that Ukraine will not cede territory to Russia. So, what happens next? *** What does Russia hope to achieve? When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, the goal was clear: topple the government and replace it with a pro-Putin administration. When Kyiv didn\u2019t fall, the strategy changed: take the Donbas. \u201cThis led to a grinding fight over the last three months that was being fought primarily with artillery, second world war style, where Russia has an advantage,\u201d Luke says. That relentless onslaught led to the Russians gaining some territory \u2013 they now occupy all of Luhansk province. \u201cThat\u2019s still happening. But where I am in the south is in phase three of the war,\u201d Luke says. There, Ukraine has launched its first major offensive in Kherson \u2013 a city that has been under Russian occupation since the start of the invasion. It\u2019s of significant tactical importance as a transport hub and it has a key river crossing that would act as a natural barrier from attacks. \u201cFrom a strategic point of view, it makes complete sense for Ukraine to take back the city,\u201d says Luke. He adds that there are humanitarian reasons too: \u201cBy all accounts it is a place of murder, of kidnapping, of intimidation, of Bucha style horror.\u201d However, whether Ukraine will be successful remains an open question: \u201cTalking to commanders here, they still haven\u2019t really got enough heavy weapons. Russia has got enormous advantages in terms of firepower, ammunition, artillery shells, rocket launchers. So for Ukraine, it\u2019s going to be quite hard and it\u2019s going to be bloody.\u201d *** What are the chances of de-escalation? The tactical agreement to allow grain exports via the Black Sea was seen as a tentative sign of cooperation \u2013 the UN chief, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, hailed the agreement as \u201ca beacon of hope\u201d. However it is also incredibly fragile. \u201cYou never want to predictive in this situation, because it\u2019s very fluid, but it would surprise no one if Russia were to sink one of these grain ships, and claim Ukraine did it,\u201d Luke says. While the deal is essential for Ukraine\u2019s economy, it is also beneficial for Russia \u2013 so it\u2019s not simply an olive branch from the Kremlin. Their core plan still hasn\u2019t changed, Luke explains. \u201cThe goal [for Russia] is still to exterminate Ukraine, its infrastructure, its education system and its culture.\u201d With both sides clear that they will accept no less than full victory, de-escalation seems unlikely. *** The west\u2019s response Earlier this week, the US president, Joe Biden, pledged to give Ukraine another billion dollars in rockets, ammunition and other equipment \u2013 its single largest military aid package yet. But Ukrainian commanders say they still need more to stand any chance of keeping Russian forces at bay: one commander has said that for every hundred shells that Russia fires at the city, Ukraine can respond with 10. However, Luke points out that US supplied Himars precision-guided artillery has partly equalised the situation because they\u2019re being used to target Russian logistics centres, weapons depots, and command points, severing some supply lines which has in turn led to a decrease in Russian shelling. But Ukraine\u2019s reliance on western military aid could create further complications down the road. \u201cLet\u2019s say there\u2019s a change of administration in the US or the Democrats get smooshed in November, the fear is the supply of weapons to Ukraine will decrease or stop,\u201d Luke explains. \u201cIf the Americans stop supplying Ukraine with weapons, then you imagine that Ukraine would fall.\u201d \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Support our journalism in Ukraine The truth, they say, is the first casualty of war.

The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad In the 1800s, rabbits, cats, rats and mice were introduced to Macquarie Island, a world heritage site in the Southern Ocean, and the critters promptly multiplied, causing havoc. At one point there were as many as 300,000 rabbits on the island. Since 2014 the island has been pest-free after what might considered a brutal but necessary eradication scheme. The result: birds such as blue and grey petrels, which had been hunted off the island by cats, were returning, and the numbers of Antarctic prions and white-headed petrels, which nest in burrows, began increasing. \u201cThis one action, the eradication, has saved entire communities and species,\u201d says conservationist Dr Justine Shaw.

            "date": "2022-08-18T19:07:20Z",
            "content": "Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a \u201cprovocation\u201d at a nuclear power plant they control, as the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. Guterres, on his second visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, joined the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, for meetings and then a press conference in the western city of Lviv. \u201cWe are worried. We don\u2019t want another Chernobyl,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. It was the first visit to Ukraine by Turkey\u2019s leader, who has been a key intermediary in negotiations with Russia. Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN chief called on Russian forces to leave with their military equipment, amid fears that fighting around the site could lead to a deadly disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have traded accusations of shelling the site. \u201cThe facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia\u2019s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,\u201d Guterres said. Video footage shared online by a New York Times reporter showed at least five apparently military trucks parked inside the plant\u2019s engine room near the turbo generator. In the hours before the international summit in western Ukraine, Russia announced it had deployed warplanes armed with hypersonic missiles to its Kaliningrad region, an enclave on the Baltic Sea that borders the EU and Nato members Poland and Lithuania. The commander of its Black Sea fleet has also been replaced, the Russian RIA news agency said, in one of the most high-profile military sackings since the invasion. It came after a series of humiliations for the fleet, including the sinking of its flagship Moskva cruiser and an attack on a key airbase in Crimea. Inside Ukraine, Russian forces stepped up attacks on Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second largest city, ahead of the summit in Lviv. In attacks overnight and early on Thursday morning, at least 11 people were killed and more than 40 injured and a residential block was destroyed. Ukraine\u2019s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia\u2019s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a \u201cprovocation\u201d at the plant to coincide with the UN leader\u2019s trip, raising fears that Russia\u2019s military could be planning a \u201cfalse-flag attack\u201d. When Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must \u201cprepare for all scenarios\u201d, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. On Wednesday, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Russia\u2019s seizure of the plant had \u201craised the risk of a nuclear accident or incident\u201d and accused Moscow of being \u201creckless\u201d by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Ukraine\u2019s hydrometeorological institute also warned of contamination spreading across Europe, a BBC journalist reported. Two issues are causing deepening anxiety about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors, and contact with staff, all of which have been disrupted by the conflict. A second issue is shelling around the plant. According to Energoatom, Ukraine\u2019s nuclear authority, the impacts from Grad missiles earlier this month were close to the spent fuel storage area, with the plant\u2019s operator claiming Russian troops \u201caimed specifically\u201d at the containers, despite the Russian military\u2019s presence at the site. Russia accuses Ukraine of carrying out the shelling. On Friday, Guterres will travel to the Black Sea port of Odesa, a crucial gateway for Ukrainian grain to reach the rest of the world. He will then continue to Turkey to visit the Joint Coordination Centre, the body tasked with overseeing the accord. Ukraine\u2019s fields feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide, so the abrupt halt to shipments has pushed up global grain prices at a time when famine is already threatening east Africa. The UN last month brokered an agreement to let shipments restart. So far, 24 ships have left Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea ports, a monitoring group said. Kyiv has a backlog of 18m tonnes of grain from last year\u2019s harvest, even as it starts bringing in the 2022 crop. It hopes to soon raise exports to 3m tonnes a month, easing world prices and clearing storage space for new grain. It will be six months on 24 August since the start of the invasion \u2013 which Russia calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d \u2013 and several UN security council members, including the US, Britain, the Republic of Ireland and Norway, have called for a meeting on that date. Kyiv is expected to launch a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine in the coming weeks and has carried out spectacular attacks deep inside Russian-held territory, including on an airbase in Crimea. But despite shipments of western weapons and ammunition, Ukraine is still struggling against heavy Russian artillery bombardment along the eastern front. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video on Wednesday that the war had reached a \u201cstrategic deadlock\u201d. \u201cRussian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,\u201d he said."

            "title": "FBI sought national defense documents at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago, affidavit shows",
            "date": "2022-08-26T17:20:33Z",
            "content": "The FBI searched Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this month after speaking to a significant number of witnesses and finding probable cause that national defense information and evidence of obstruction existed at the former president\u2019s property, according to newly unsealed court filings on Friday. The details contained in the affidavit used to secure a warrant to search Mar-a-Lago \u2013 partially redacted to protect the ongoing criminal investigation into Trump\u2019s unauthorized retention of government secrets \u2013 offered the clearest insight yet into the basis for the FBI\u2019s seeking permission to search the resort. \u201cThere is probable cause to believe that additional documents that contain classified NDI or that are presidential records subject to record retention requirements currently remain at the premises. There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found,\u201d it said. The affidavit made the case that the FBI needed to forcibly retrieve the United States government\u2019s most sensitive secrets, especially after it came to suspect Trump and his team were holding on to classified documents despite repeated efforts \u2013 including with a subpoena \u2013 to secure their return. Most pressing, according to the affidavit, was that the FBI had identified probable cause that documents containing national defense information were scattered across Mar-a-Lago, potentially jeopardizing intelligence gathering and revealing the identities of human clandestine sources. The specific mentions of the most private areas at Mar-a-Lago \u2013 for instance Pine Hall, which is not particularly widely known \u2013 suggests the FBI had close operational knowledge from a source about where the documents were being kept and potentially being moved around the resort. While the exact origin of that information appears to have been kept redacted, in an accompanying legal memo explaining its redactions, the justice department revealed for the first time that the FBI had interviewed a \u201csignificant number of civilian witnesses\u201d before seeking the warrant. The affidavit also mentioned an additional significant reason for needing the document to initially be kept under seal: \u201cThe FBI has not yet identified all potential criminal confederates and not located all evidence related to its investigation.\u201d In making the case that the FBI needed to search Mar-a-Lago, the affidavit \u2013 produced by an FBI agent working in the bureau\u2019s Washington field office \u2013 also showed how Trump had previously retained government secrets at Mar-a-Lago after he was no longer president. The FBI noted that after Trump finally returned about a dozen boxes of materials to the National Archives this year, an FBI triage found 184 unique classified documents, including 25 marked top secret, 92 marked secret, 67 marked confidential, and some with Trump\u2019s distinctive handwriting. The documents also included some with markings like \u201cSI\u201d for special intelligence, \u201cHCS\u201d for intelligence from human clandestine sources, \u201cNOFORN\u201d, for \u201cNot Releasable to Foreign Nationals\u201d, \u201cFISA\u201d for the \u201cForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act\u201d, and \u201cORCON\u201d, which restricts non-US dissemination. \u201cOf most significant concern was that highly classified records were unfoldered, intermixed with other records, and otherwise unproperly [sic] identified,\u201d it warned. According to the affidavit, the FBI essentially concluded that Mar-a-Lago was the scene of potential violations of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and a statute that criminalizes the unauthorized removal or retention of government records more generally. The affidavit became public after Bruce Reinhart, the federal judge who approved the warrant and is overseeing the case, ordered the justice department to submit the redacted version before noon, leading to a tense and breathless wait for the court in West Palm Beach to unseal the documents. Trump was unhappy about the affidavit. In a statement on his social media website, Trump, in typically strident language, blasted the release of the document. He called it a \u201ctotal public relations subterfuge\u201d by the FBI and the justice department and accused the judge of having personal animosity towards him. \u201cWITCH HUNT!!!\u201d the former president said in a subsequent post, using one of the most common phrases he deploys to portray himself as the victim of a hostile conspiracy, and he again described the FBI search as a \u201cbreak-in\u201d. Joe Biden weighed in after being asked if it was ever appropriate for a president to bring home classified material, saying that \u201cit depends on the document and it depends on how secure\u201d the location was. He had a \u201ccompletely secure\u201d site at his home and on Friday was taking home a copy of his daily intelligence briefing, he said, but those records would later be returned to the military. The partial release of the affidavit used for the Mar-a-Lago search is a significant juncture for the justice department, which had opposed unsealing any part of the affidavit until it was overruled by Reinhart, and the attorney general, Merrick Garland, who personally approved the warrant after days of deliberations. The justice department had originally opposed unsealing the affidavit at all and filed a redacted version only after being forced by Reinhart last week. Trump had indicated previously that he had supported unsealing the affidavit but his lawyers never filed a formal motion to that effect, instead leaving the effort to a coalition of media outlets that pushed to have the affidavit become public. Trump has since filed a separate motion to have a so-called special master appointed to determine what seized materials prosecutors can use as evidence in the investigation. The motion also aims to force the justice department to provide a more detailed list of what was retrieved by the FBI. Trump\u2019s lawyers said their motion should be granted because the redacted affidavit \u201cprovides almost no information that would allow [Trump] to understand why the raid took place, or what was taken from his home. The few lines that are unredacted raise more questions than answers.\u201d"

            "title": "US universities have become arms of the defense industry. This isn\u2019t healthy | Indigo Olivier",
            "date": "2022-08-18T10:00:43Z",
            "content": "In his 1961 farewell address, Dwight D Eisenhower warned the nation against the \u201cunwarranted influence\u201d of the military-industrial complex. But a lesser known part of the speech was addressed to universities: \u201cIn the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.\u201d We didn\u2019t listen. For the better part of the pandemic, I\u2019ve been researching the defense industry\u2019s ties to college campuses as part of an investigative fellowship for the magazine In These Times. On 11 August, we published a 4,300-word feature article on Lockheed Martin\u2019s sweeping recruitment on college campuses. We found an environment in which Stem students are funneled into the defense industry through recruitment, research, financial assistance or some combination of the three. Lockheed offers cash-prize competitions, scholarships and paid internships to students which have served as pipelines to employment. In 2020, the company hired 2,600 interns and claimed over 60% of graduating former interns converted to full-time jobs. On campus, Lockheed has set up recruiting tables in the lobbies and hallways of student buildings and hosts workshops on everything from space exploration to r\u00e9sum\u00e9-building. At the University of Texas at Arlington, a $1.5m donation resulted in one of their buildings being renamed the Lockheed Martin Career Development Center. But the company\u2019s signature recruiting event, which is hosted at more than a dozen universities, is something called Lockheed Martin Day. Recruiters attract students with virtual reality demos, flight simulators and, in some cases, landing their helicopters directly on campus. Company officials have been known to offer on-the-spot job and internship opportunities to students during the event. Additionally, Lockheed has poured resources into the financial support and recruitment of students at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), earning its place as the number one industry supporter of HBCU engineering institutions for seven years in a row. But before anyone says this is a good thing, it\u2019s worth pausing to ask ourselves how we got here in the first place. When Black women hold the highest average student loan debt ($41,466), it\u2019s hard to argue against additional financial support no matter where it comes from. Unless you start with a more basic question: why do Black women graduate with the largest debt burden? Why are HBCU endowments, on average, 70% smaller than other universities? Why is $1.7tn for Lockheed\u2019s F-35 fighter jet considered a worthwhile investment but $1.7tn in student debt relief considered a handout? The answer boils down to what priorities we set as a nation and the investments we are willing to make based on those priorities. Last year, the Biden-Harris administration announced an unprecedented $5.8bn investment for HBCUs. By comparison, the administration has sent nearly twice that figure in military assistance to Ukraine. This country reached a grim milestone in 2020. For the first time, government funding to Lockheed Martin exceeded funding to the Department of Education. When a nation spends more on a single military contractor than the agency tasked with overseeing college financial assistance, Lockheed\u2019s scholarships seem less like an act of charity and more like intentional policy choices. While Lockheed\u2019s presence on college campuses goes back decades, its scholarship program was only launched in 2019. Following Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Lockheed made a commitment to invest $50m in Stem education enrichment programs and a Stem scholarship program over the next five years. Hundreds of millions of dollars more went to employee training and other education initiatives including tuition assistance for employees, research and development, and award money for competitions. Corporations will have saved millions in profits while adding nearly $2tn to the deficit over the next decade. At the same time, Republican officials in congress argued that universities, which have traditionally been tax-exempt, were hoarding their wealth and needed to pay up. The 2017 tax cuts included a provision to impose a 1.4% excise tax on the endowments of the wealthiest private universities in the country. One Washington Post reporter explained that \u201cthe revenue from the endowment tax will not be used to lower the cost of higher education but instead to offset corporate tax cuts\u201d. If budgets are moral documents, what do ours say about us? By the air force\u2019s own admission, the F-35 has been a failure. What was supposed to be a lightweight, low-cost, multi-purpose fighter jet has, over the years, gotten heavier, more expensive and less effective. As the air force\u2019s top general put it last year, \u201cThe F-35 is a Ferrari. You don\u2019t drive a Ferrari to work every day, you only drive it on Sundays.\u201d I\u2019ll acknowledge that these policies have resulted in a complicated reality. Millions of people around the country, including students, now depend on exorbitant defense spending. According to a 2021 Bloomberg report, \u201cnearly every US state has economic ties to the F-35, with 29 states counting on the project for $100m or more in economic activity.\u201d A similar analogy can be drawn based on the defense research at universities that support students, professors and institutional budgets. But knowing that all of this work is underwritten by the federal government and funded by taxpayers, we could just as easily decide that investing in jobs that improve human lives is more important than investments in ending them. Lockheed\u2019s presence on college campuses poses this question to us and underscores two competing visions for the university: a political and economic tool in service of the world as it is or an institution dedicated to advancing critical thinking and civic engagement for the world as it could be. Once the question has been asked, it\u2019s up to us to decide whether we will continue to prioritize war profiteering over posterity. Indigo Olivier is a Reporter-Researcher at The New Republic"

            "date": "2022-08-29T17:00:02Z",
            "content": "\u201cIn over 20 years leading schools I have never before been faced with such a shock to our budgets,\u201d said Richard Sheriff, the chief executive officer of the Red Kite Learning Trust of 13 schools in North and West Yorkshire. \u201cWe are in the desperate position of having to look at cutting everything from school trips to teaching resources.\u201d Sheriff is not alone. School leaders across England have spent the past few weeks poring over their balance sheets, trying to make their budgets stretch to accommodate soaring energy costs, a growing wage bill and the impact of mounting inflation on everything. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d said Vic Goddard, the CEO of Passmores Cooperative Learning Community, a trust made up of four schools in Harlow, Essex. In 2022-23 the trust\u2019s income will go up by an extra \u00a3575,000, but additional costs will be \u00a31,062,000, leaving his schools \u00a3487,000 \u2013 nearly half a million pounds \u2013 short. \u201cThese figures are without the ongoing inflationary increases that will happen throughout the year,\u201d said Goddard. The cuts have already begun. The trust has already decided to halt the further rollout of devices to students; there will be no new staff appointments, no new textbooks and no replacements for classroom PCs, unless absolutely vital. The curriculum will have to shrink to save money, squeezing out subjects like music which attract smaller numbers, and prompting a review of other \u201cresource heavy\u201d subjects such as photography. School trips face the chop. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to afford to subsidise school curriculum trips to make them accessible for all so we\u2019ll need to cancel most of them over the year.\u201d Only essential repairs and maintenance will be carried out, departments will get a 50% cut in their resource budgets and the cost of school lunches may have to go up. Then there\u2019s the issue of redundancies. \u201cIf we avoid it this academic year then we\u2019ll need to do some next year,\u201d Goddard says grimly. Sean Maher, headteacher at Richard Challoner school in Kingston, is similarly bleak. \u201cWe are looking at \u00a3150,000 in excess of what we had budgeted for, just from the pay rises that have been passed on by the government. I\u2019ve been on various WhatsApp groups, and the consensus is there\u2019s no school in the country that\u2019s going to be able to afford these pay rises that have been passed on unfunded.\u201d The only way he can fund the pay rise this year is by taking money from funds saved for planned building projects. Next year he has no way of meeting the extra bill, and if there\u2019s no additional funding, he will have to look at redundancies. \u201cThat\u2019s before we start talking about the increasing cost of food, which is my biggest worry.\u201d Last year the school canteen service was in deficit to the tune of \u00a320,000 because of rising costs. \u201cFood prices are only going up,\u201d said Maher, who is having to consider increasing the cost of a lunch from \u00a33.80 to \u00a34.50. \u201cI\u2019m really terrified about what\u2019s going to happen to some of our parents,\u201d said Maher. \u201cI\u2019ve been a headteacher for nine years. I\u2019ve dedicated my whole professional life to trying to give young people the very best opportunity to shine and grow and develop. I feel like I\u2019m fighting against the government who are actively undermining what we are trying to do for young people.\u201d The headteachers the Guardian spoke to knocked back media reports that the school week could be cut to three or four days to save money in the most extreme circumstances, but Maher did not dismiss the idea that children might have to wear more clothes in the classroom to keep warm. \u201cHow can it come to that in this country? Where we would be asking children to wear coats and gloves in the classroom because we can\u2019t afford the heating?\u201d asked Maher. \u201cBut it will happen. In schools up and down the country teachers will turn round and say: \u2018Keep your coat on \u2013 we won\u2019t put on the heating until the end of November.\u2019\u201d Elsewhere, headteachers say agency staff are being cut and site opening hours reduced. Staff and students are being encouraged to switch off appliances where possible and the heating will be turned down a degree or two \u2013 small savings to try to keep costs down. Matthew Shanks, the executive principal and chief executive officer of Education South West, a multi-academy trust in Devon, said his trust was facing a 285% increase in energy costs. \u201cWe are meeting this initially from reserves. But these reserves will disappear quickly and spending them on this ultimately means we cannot use them to provide the additional support needed for children in the classroom. \u201cAdd this increase to the unfunded increase in pay and there will not be sufficient funding to operate as we currently do in the future unless we make cuts.\u201d Sheriff agrees. \u201cThe budget shortfall we face will push our successful trust into a deficit position even if we use up all our reserves. This will leave us extremely vulnerable in following years and is likely to lead to us having to make significant changes to how we deliver our service in years to come. \u201cThe expectation that schools will deliver a rich and broad curriculum will need to be adjusted, I doubt this new offer will meet the aspirations and needs of our children and families.\u201d"

            "title": "England\u2019s housing strategy would blow entire carbon budget, says study",
            "date": "2022-08-22T23:01:45Z",
            "content": "England would use up the entirety of its 1.5C carbon budget on housing alone if the government sticks to its pledge to build 300,000 homes a year, according to a new study. The building of new homes under a business as usual scenario, coupled with current trends on making existing homes more efficient, would mean the housing system would use up 104% of the country\u2019s cumulative carbon budget by 2050. Radically retrofitting existing houses, cutting the number of second homes, stopping people from buying houses as financial investments and making people live in smaller buildings would be more sustainable ways to address the housing crisis, the paper says. A carbon budget is the cumulative amount of emissions a country can emit over a specific period. England\u2019s 1.5C budget means restricting total emissions to 2.5 gigatonnes of CO2 between 2022 and 2050 say the researchers, who did not look at how this compares in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, but they believe it is likely to be a similar picture. \u201cIn the long run, we argue that England can\u2019t go on building new houses forever, and needs to start thinking about better and more systematic solutions as to how we are going to house everyone within our environmental limits,\u201d said lead researcher Dr Sophus zu Ermgassen, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology at the University of Kent. The paper, published in Ecological Economics, is the first to comprehensively analyse the impact of the government\u2019s response to the housing crisis on national carbon and biodiversity goals. The researchers write: \u201cSecure housing is a fundamental human right. However, potential conflicts between housing and sustainability objectives remain under-researched.\u201d They looked at two existing models, one for evaluating the emissions needed to run UK houses, and the other, emissions from constructing new housing. The figures come from looking at decarbonising trends of housing between 1990 and 2019, meaning housing is set to be 50% more efficient by 2050. For England, if current trends continue, 92% of emissions will come from existing housing, and 12% from the emissions of building and running new houses, the study finds. There are about 25m dwellings in England, and the amount of emissions from existing homes is high because large parts of the housing stock are prewar, and more challenging to insulate. For example, half of homes built between 1919 and 1930 have uninsulated solid walls which account for almost half of heat loss. Researchers looked at the biodiversity and climate impacts of these trends continuing as they are. \u201cOur scenarios show how drastic the problem is and how ambitious the solutions actually have to be if we\u2019re serious about staying within our 1.5C carbon budget,\u201d said Ermgassen. The paper also warns that policies to protect wildlife will have to be \u201cvery effective\u201d if housing is not to undermine the government\u2019s big biodiversity target of halting species declines by 2030. The government has committed to implement legally binding targets to halve wildlife declines by 2030, which requires all new developments to have \u201cbiodiversity net gain\u201d. Globally, 24% of threatened species on the IUCN red list are threatened by commercial and residential building developments. Retrofitting existing stock so all homes could be zero carbon by 2050 would save 38% of the cumulative carbon budgets for 1.5C, the researchers say, adding that this is \u201cby far the most impactful policy for reducing housing\u2019s conflict with climate targets\u201d. Meeting housing needs without rapid expansion of housing stock is in theory possible, although the paper did not look at how many homes the government should be building. Using figures from the English Housing Survey, the researchers estimate that there are 1.2m empty or underused homes. Dr Kate Simpson from Imperial College London, who was not involved in the study, said: \u201cThis is an ambitious paper that highlights some of the big problems with the current UK housing system, our collective lack of a cohesive strategy to meet carbon budgets, and fundamental biodiversity considerations. We urgently need more joined-up thinking like this. \u201cAs my research is on housing retrofit, I agree we need to find incentives to bring empty homes back into use, protect the embodied carbon of existing homes and prioritise efforts to upgrade those to reduce energy demand while ensuring affordable housing and comfort for all.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

            "date": "2022-08-08T12:48:42Z",
            "content": "China carried out fresh military drills around Taiwan on Monday, including anti-submarine attack and sea raid operations, a day after its major live-fire exercises targeting the territory were supposed to end. Beijing\u2019s defence ministry also defended its shelving of military talks with the US in protest against Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei last week, which have raised concerns about potential accidents escalating into conflict. Last week, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) targeted Taiwan with days of major live-fire exercises, which were scheduled to end on Sunday. Their end was never announced by the PLA, but notices of avoidance were reportedly lifted and normal sea and air traffic had resumed. On Monday, however, China\u2019s Eastern Theatre Command announced it would conduct joint drills focusing on anti-submarine and sea assault operations \u2013 confirming the fears of some security analysts and diplomats that Beijing would maintain pressure on Taiwan\u2019s defences. No further details were provided. \u201cThe eastern theatre of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army continued to carry out practical joint exercises and training in the sea and airspace around Taiwan island,\u201d the military said. The exercises, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Command added, were \u201cfocusing on organising joint anti-submarine and sea assault operations\u201d. Taipei condemned Beijing for extending the drills. \u201cChina\u2018s provocation and aggression have harmed the status quo of the Taiwan strait and raised tensions in the region,\u201d the island\u2019s foreign ministry said. The Taiwanese military said it detected 39 Chinese warplanes and 13 ships operating in the strait on Monday. Of those, 21 aircraft crossed the median line, an unofficial demarcation between China and Taiwan that the former does not recognise. The US president expressed concern Monday but said he did not expect the situation to escalate further. \u201cI\u2019m not worried, but I\u2019m concerned they\u2019re moving as much as they are. But I don\u2019t think they are going to do anything more than they are,\u201d Joe Biden told reporters at Dover air force base. The US defence department policy chief, Colin Kahl, said the Pentagon had not changed the assessment given last year by the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mark Milley, that China was unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two years. However, Kahl said Beijing was trying to \u201csalami-slice their way into a new status quo\u201d. \u201cA lot has been made of the missile strikes but really it\u2019s the activities in the strait itself, the sheer number of maritime and air assets that are crossing over this de facto centre line, creeping closer to Taiwan shores, where it\u2019s clear that Beijing is trying to create a kind of new normal,\u201d he said. Beijing\u2019s goal was to try to coerce Taiwan and the international community by threatening to cut off the strait to shipping, Kahl said. \u201cAll I say is: we\u2019re not going to take the bait and it\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s a manufactured crisis and that doesn\u2019t mean we have to play into that. I think it would only play to Beijing\u2019s advantage,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat we\u2019ll do instead is to continue to fly, to sail and to operate wherever international law allows us to do so, and that includes in the Taiwan strait, and we will continue to stand by our allies and partners in the region.\u201d The PLA had already announced that China would conduct live-fire exercises in the Yellow Sea from Sunday until 15 August, in five exclusion zones. Taiwan authorities said the areas would not affect its international flight routes. Pelosi\u2019s visit last week infuriated China, which regards Taiwan as its own territory and responded with test launches of ballistic missiles over Taipei for the first time, as well as ditching some lines of dialogue with Washington. The island\u2019s defence ministry said that during last week\u2019s drills Chinese military ships, aircraft and drones had simulated attacks on the island and its navy, and conducted multiple sea and air incursions over the median line. About 10 warships each from China and Taiwan manoeuvred at close quarters around the line on Sunday, according to a person familiar with the situation who is involved with security planning. The defence ministry in Taiwan said it had sent aircraft and ships to react \u201cappropriately\u201d. A Taiwan defence ministry spokesperson said no PLA craft had entered Taiwan\u2019s territorial waters, stretching 12 nautical mile out from its coastline, during the drills. He did not say how close the PLA had been detected, or if it was inside the 24-nautical-mile contiguous zone. He said the military had also identified multiple cyberwarfare attacks allegedly from China, and at least 272 attempts to spread disinformation. Timothy Heath, a defence researcher at the Rand Corporation, said China\u2019s drills over the past few days showed the PLA was strengthening its ability to carry out a blockade. \u201cA blockade could be executed alone or in conjunction with other military options such as missile barrages or an invasion of Taiwan,\u201d he said. Amid the furious responses, China also called off formal talks involving theatre-level commands, defence policy coordination and military maritime consultations on Friday as Pelosi left the region. China\u2019s defence ministry spokesperson, Wu Qian, defended the decision to suspend military channels, saying in an online post on Monday: \u201cThe current tense situation in the Taiwan strait is entirely provoked and created by the US side on its own initiative, and the US side must bear full responsibility and serious consequences for this. \u201cThe bottom line cannot be broken, and communication requires sincerity,\u201d Wu said. Pentagon, state department and White House officials condemned the move, describing it as an irresponsible overreaction. China\u2019s cutting of some of its few communication links with the US military raises the risk of an accidental escalation over Taiwan at a critical moment, according to security analysts and diplomats. One US official noted that Chinese officials had not responded to calls from senior Pentagon officials amid the tensions last week, but that they did not see this as a formal severing of ties with senior figures, such as the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin. Asked directly about those reports, Wu said: \u201cChina\u2019s relevant countermeasures are a necessary warning to the provocations of the United States and Taiwan, and a legitimate defence of national sovereignty and security.\u201d Additional reporting by Vincent Ni"

            "title": "China sanctions Taiwan officials and stages new military drills after US lawmakers\u2019 Taipei visit",
            "date": "2022-08-16T07:01:27Z",
            "content": "China has sanctioned senior Taiwanese officials and staged a new round of military drills around Taiwan in response to a brief visit to the island by a delegation of bipartisan US lawmakers. The arrival of the lawmakers took place after the House speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s controversial visit to the island. On Monday, Chinese state media announced seven individuals had been sanctioned for allegedly supporting Taiwan independence, including Taiwan\u2019s de facto ambassador to the US, Hsiao Bi-khim, the head of Taiwan\u2019s national security council, Wellington Koo, and Lin Fe-fan, the deputy secretary general of the governing Democratic Progressive party. The seven \u2013 who are barred from traveling to China, Hong Kong or Macao, and from making profit in China \u2013 join Taiwan\u2019s premier, foreign minister, and speaker, who were sanctioned in November 2021. The island\u2019s foreign ministry said Taiwan was a democracy that \u201ccould not be interfered with by China\u201d. Lin said while the sanctions were \u201ca blow to the current state of cross-strait relations\u201d, he viewed those imposed on him as a \u201cgreat honour\u201d. \u201cPeople in Taiwan have congratulated me on the \u2018distinction\u2019, and I understand why \u2013 I am proud to be labeled as a staunch advocate for my home,\u201d Lin told the Guardian. \u201cChina\u2019s choice to impose sanctions as a response to our engagement in diplomatic dialogue cases a dark shadow over the current state of global relations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Taiwan is by no means enthusiastic about the prospect of war, in the face of such threats we are unwilling to give up on our way of life \u2026 Aggression will only damage our willingness to engage in dialogue and improve our overall relationship with Beijing.\u201d Beijing earlier said it had carried out a fresh round of \u201ccombat readiness patrol and combat drills in the sea and airspace around Taiwan island\u201d. Military officials and state media also renewed their \u201cprepare for war\u201d rhetoric on Taiwan, over which Beijing has long claimed sovereignty. Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China\u2019s defence ministry, said: \u201cThe Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) continues to train and prepare for war, resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely crush any form of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 separatism and foreign interference attempts.\u201d \u201cWe warn the US and the DPP authorities: using Taiwan to contain China is doomed to failure,\u201d he added, referring to Taiwan\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive party. Taipei\u2019s government condemned Beijing\u2019s bellicosity. On Monday evening, the island\u2019s defence ministry reported that 30 PLA aircrafts and 5 PLA vessels had conducted military activities around Taiwan. The ministry also said that out of the 30 aircraft, 15 had crossed the median line, an unofficial maritime line that crosses the middle of the Taiwan strait. Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, told the American delegation that the self-ruled island was \u201ccommitted to maintaining the stable status quo in the Taiwan strait\u201d. The bipartisan US delegation, led by Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, arrived in Taipei on Sunday evening. The unannounced brief visit came after Beijing sent warships, missiles and jets into the waters and skies around Taiwan, prompting fears of military calculation between the world\u2019s two largest militaries. Their visit would focus on trade, regional security and climate change, Washington\u2019s de facto embassy in Taipei, the American Institute in Taiwan, said. Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry hailed the visit as another sign of a friendship between Taipei and Washington \u201cthat is not afraid of China\u2019s threats and intimidation\u201d. But the bipartisan trip prompted another caustic response from Beijing. The state news agency Xinhua published a commentary after the lawmakers\u2019 arrival on Sunday with the headline \u201cUS politicians should stop playing with fire on Taiwan question\u201d. It called the visiting American lawmakers opportunists, thinking about their own political interests as November\u2019s midterm elections draw near. \u201cThose US politicians who are playing with fire on the Taiwan question should drop their wishful thinking,\u201d the agency said. \u201cThere is no room for compromise or concessions when it comes to China\u2019s core interests.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s government has accused Beijing of using Pelosi\u2019s visit as an excuse to kickstart drills that would allow it to rehearse for an invasion. That decades-old threat was reiterated in a white paper published last week when China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said it would \u201cnot renounce the use of force\u201d against its neighbour and reserved \u201cthe option of taking all necessary measures\u201d. It added, however: \u201cWe will only be forced to take drastic measures to respond to the provocation of separatist elements or external forces should they ever cross our red lines.\u201d Pelosi has stood by her visit but president Joe Biden said the US military was opposed to the trip by his fellow Democrat, who is second in line to the presidency after the vice-president. Congress is constitutionally an equal branch of government with lawmakers free to travel where they wish, and Taiwan enjoys bipartisan backing in divided Washington. The US switched diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. But it remains a key ally of Taiwan and maintains de facto diplomatic relations with Taipei. Washington\u2019s official policy opposes Taiwan declaring independence or China forcibly changing the island\u2019s status. It remains deliberately ambiguous about whether it would militarily come to Taiwan\u2019s aid if China invaded. Visits by senior US officials to Taiwan have happened for decades and even Pelosi\u2019s trip was not without precedent \u2013 a previous house speaker, Newt Gingrich, visited in 1997. But the frequency and profile of US visits has increased under the former president Donald Trump and now under Biden. Taiwan has also bought an increased amount of US weaponry in recent years as China continued to pressure the island amid deteriorating US-China relations. In the UK, the House of Commons foreign affairs committee is planning a visit to Taiwan later this year, also to show its support to the island democracy."

            "title": "US and South Korea begin largest military drills for years as North ramps up tensions",
            "date": "2022-08-22T04:04:21Z",
            "content": "The US and South Korea have begun their biggest joint military drills in years \u2013 a show of force that is expected to raise tensions with an increasingly hostile North Korea. The exercises, known as Ulchi Freedom Shield, are being seen as a sign of the allies\u2019 determination to restore large-scale training after they cancelled some regular drills and scaled down others to facilitate nuclear talks, and because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Details of the operation have not been released, but past exercises have involved tens of thousands of troops and large numbers of aircraft warships and tanks. They will reportedly include simulated joint attacks, frontline reinforcements of arms and fuel, and removals of weapons of mass destruction. The two militaries said in a joint statement said the drills were a response to an \u201cincreased volume and scale of [North Korean] missile tests\u201d over the past year. \u201cWith this in mind, and considering the evolving threat \u2026 both leaders committed to expanding the scope and scale of combined military exercises and training, they said, adding that Ulchi Freedom Shield would \u201cbolster combined readiness\u201d. The 2019 exercises were cancelled after Donald Trump\u2019s first summit with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, the previous year. Trump\u2019s surprise concession was seen as an attempt to persuade Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons programme amid a flurry of diplomacy led by the then president and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in. Four years on, Washington and Seoul have nothing substantive to show for their efforts at engagement. The North has resumed missile tests \u2013 including its first launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile at full range since 2017 \u2013 and speculation is building that it is preparing to conduct what would be its seventh nuclear test. The US has said it will consider deploying strategic assets \u2013 which could theoretically include tactical nuclear weapons \u2013 if the North tests a nuclear device. South Korea\u2019s new president, Yoon Suk-yeol, took office in May promising a harder line against North Korean provocations that would include \u201cnormalising\u201d the military exercises and boosting his country\u2019s defences against the North. The resumption of the drills suggests that South Korea and the US, which has 28,500 troops in the country, have reverted to robust displays of their combined military might in the wake of North Korea\u2019s resumption of ballistic missile tests. \u201cThe significance of this joint exercise is rebuilding the South Korea-US alliance and solidifying the combined defence posture by normalising \u2026 combined exercises and field training,\u201d the South Korean defence ministry said. While the allies insist the field exercises are designed to plan their response to a North Korean attack, Pyongyang routinely condemns them as a rehearsal for an invasion, and in the past has responded with missile launches. The drills, which will end on 1 September, began against a backdrop of increasingly hostile rhetoric from the North. It recently warned of \u201cdeadly retaliation\u201d against the South, which it blamed for its Covid-19 outbreak, while Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un\u2019s influential sister, last week dismissed Yoon\u2019s offer of economic help in return for denuclearising as \u201cabsurd\u201d, warning that the North would never \u201cbarter\u201d its nuclear deterrent for aid. Kim Jong-un, whose until recently appears to have been focused on containing the coronavirus outbreak, has said his country is \u201cready to mobilise\u201d its nuclear capability in any war with the US and North Korea, although the regime has always insisted its nuclear weapons are a deterrent against a \u201chostile\u201d US. In a TV interview last month, Choe Jin, the deputy director of a thinktank run by North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry, said the US and South Korea would face \u201cunprecedented\u201d security challenges unless they abandoned their \u201chostile military stance\u201d against the North, including joint drills. The North has been conducting missile tests at a record pace, with more than 30 ballistic missile launches this year, as it continues to pressure Washington to accept its status as a legitimate nuclear power \u2013 and one that some experts believe now has the ability to carry out a nuclear strike against the US mainland."

            "date": "2022-08-24T19:53:55Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden has announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. It is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date, bringing to over $13bn the total the US has supplied or pledged to Kyiv under the Biden administration. The new equipment, however, will have to be ordered by defence manufacturers and will not be delivered for months or years. US officials said it represented a longer-term investment in Ukrainian security. The new package was announced on the country\u2019s independence day and in the run-up to an expected Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russian-occupied territory. \u201cThe United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cAs part of that commitment, I am proud to announce our biggest tranche of security assistance to date: approximately $2.98bn of weapons and equipment to be provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defence systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term.\u201d The new US-built Vampire drone defences, which use small missiles against unmanned aircraft, are particularly significant as Russian forces, facing low morale, general exhaustion and widespread equipment shortages, have been expanding their use of drones, an area where they are receiving support from Iran. Russian officials watched a display of Iranian drones in June and US officials believe Russians are being trained to use them inside Iran. The US is also delivering six National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems (Nasams), a Norwegian-US build anti-aircraft missile, bringing the total promised to eight. Other weapons included in the package are 245,000 rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition, up to 65,000 rounds of 120mm mortar ammunition, two dozen counter-artillery radars, and Puma drones. However, unlike recent US arms deliveries, this batch under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), does not come from US military stockpiles but will be ordered directly from manufacturers. That means that some of the equipment will not be delivered for months or even years. \u201cThis package of capabilities is really aimed at getting Ukraine what they\u2019re going to need in the medium to long term,\u201d Colin Kahl, the Pentagon policy chief, said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not relevant to the fight today, tomorrow, next week. It is relevant to the ability of Ukraine to defend itself, and deter further aggression a year from now, two years from now.\u201d The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, expressed gratitude for the new aid, which includes some of the types of weapons he has been demanding. \u201cThe people of Ukraine, all our defenders highly appreciate [the USA\u2019s] unwavering support. Together we will win!\u201d Zelenskiy said in a tweet. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US had \u201cdemonstrated that we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes\u201d, and a recent poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs suggested there were few signs of \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d so far among the US electorate. Near three-quarters of the Americans questioned backed increasing military aid to Ukraine. Fifty-eight per cent agreed with the statement that the US should support Ukraine \u201cfor as long as it takes, even if American households will have to pay higher gas and food prices as a consequence\u201d. And 38% thought the US should send troops to Ukraine to fight the Russians, something that Biden has vowed not to do. On most questions there was little difference between the views of Democrats and Republicans, making it one of the relatively few issues that does not split the country. That level of bipartisan support may become an important factor if Republicans take back control of the House of Representatives in November\u2019s congressional elections."

            "date": "2022-08-26T15:38:34Z",
            "content": "Ukraine has said it has managed to partly reconnect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to its grid after the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it had narrowly avoided a \u201cradiation disaster\u201d when all lines to it were cut on Thursday. The plant was captured in early May by Russian forces, who are reportedly storing equipment at Europe\u2019s largest nuclear facility, but is still being run by Ukrainian technicians under the gaze of occupying forces. Three of the four power connections the plant relies on to keep its reactors cool were previously cut during fighting, and on Thursday, fires around the plant that Zelenskiy blamed on Russian shelling brought down the fourth, disconnecting it for the first time in its history. Russia blamed Ukrainian shelling and on Friday said it had destroyed the gun responsible. Zelenskiy said the disconnection had put \u201cUkraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s authorities said backup systems had kicked in to ensure the cooling and safety systems at the plant but as of Friday morning, Energoatom, Ukraine\u2019s state nuclear agency, said efforts were still under way to link it back to the Ukrainian grid before announcing success in the early afternoon with the connection of one of its six reactors. \u201cZaporizhzhia NPP nuclear power professionals are real heroes! They tirelessly and tightly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders,\u201d wrote Energoatom on its Telegram channel. The situation however remains fragile as fighting continues around the plant. Ukrainian authorities and international experts have consistently warned of the potential for nuclear catastrophe because of fighting around the facility, which sits close to the frontlines in the south. Disconnecting from the grid raises the risk of a catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. A nuclear incident could have disastrous consequences for the immediate population and clouds of radiation could travel across Europe. A mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency is scheduled to visit the plant next week to monitor the situation and take protective measures, said Lana Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, on Ukraine\u2019s Radio NV. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had received assurances from Zelenskiy and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, that the mission would be allowed to reach the plant safely. But Zerkal said she remained sceptical that the mission would reach it. \u201cAll the logistical routes are now being worked out,\u201d Zerkal said. \u201cDespite the fact that the Russians agreed that the mission will go through Ukrainian territory, they are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission does not reach the object given the situation around [the plant].\u201d Civilians across Ukraine\u2019s south who rely on the plant for electricity, including those in the occupied territories, have experienced power outages with the disconnection of the plant. More that 18,000 people in 72 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were without power as on Friday, the regional administration said. People living in occupied areas already face severe problems accessing medicine, basic goods, information and freedom of movement, and those who disagree politically face repressive measures from the new administration. Thousands living along the contact line have been caught up in shelling. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over whose shells have damaged the power plant and the surrounding area. The Wall Street Journal reported that Russia was using the plant as a military base and Washington\u2019s Institute for the Study of War said that Russia had failed to present evidence that the shelling was caused by Ukraine, despite the fact they controlled the territory. During the outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, the plant must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If these break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative impasse, with no significant territorial gains or losses in the last two months. This week, Putin signed a decree to increase the size of the Russian army by 137,000 men, and the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence said on Friday it believed he had fired six generals for advancing too slowly. Also on Friday, Ukraine said it would expand the number of districts on the frontline where civilian evacuations would be mandatory, as those areas could be occupied and face central heating problems this winter. Russia\u2019s takeover of the plant is the latest in a long list of challenges Russia and its occupying authorities are facing in running newly conquered territories. Ukrainians continue to use the western-supplied long-range missiles to target infrastructure within enemy lines. Explosions could be heard in occupied Kherson on Friday afternoon as Ukraine\u2019s southern command said it had successfully disabled the Dariiv Bridge to the north of the city. Russia\u2019s RIA news agency reported that the Russian air defence systems had been activated. It is not clear if the two incidents were connected. Video footage released on Thursday show the occupying authorities are attempting to build a pontoon bridge across the river to replace the Antonovskiy Bridge struck by Ukrainian forces last month, rendering it unusable. Russian authorities will hold referendums in newly occupied parts of southern Ukraine, although it appears they will take different forms and may be conducted on different dates. In the city of Melitopol in the occupied-Zaporizhzhia region, pollsters will go door-to-door instead of voters attending polling stations, according to its mayor-in-exile, Ivan Fedorov, citing sources on the ground. Authorities are trying to operate while apparently being attacked from within. RIA reported that a bomb exploded in the building from where the referendum was being planned and Russian passports were issued. In the occupied southern city of Berdiansk, the deputy head of the traffic police was killed on Friday by an explosion, Russia\u2019s state news agency, Tass, reported. On Wednesday, Ivan Sushko, the head of another occupied city nearby, was killed by a car bomb, occupying authorities reported on Telegram. Their deaths are the latest in a string of assassinations that have targeted members of the occupying authorities. On 23 August, Ihor Telehin, the deputy head of the internal policy department for the occupied Kherson region, was also targeted with a bomb but survived, according to Tass."

            "content": "Campaigners have begun a legal challenge against the government\u2019s decision to give the Sizewell C nuclear power station the go-ahead amid warnings that UK nuclear plants will be on the frontline of climate breakdown. Citing the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water stressed, the threats to coastal areas from climate change and environmental damage, the challenge is the first step in a judicial review of the planning consent. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled the independent Planning Inspectorate to grant permission for the new nuclear reactor in Suffolk in July. Kwarteng is pushing ahead with government plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year as part of an energy strategy that aims to bolster the UK\u2019s nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 25% of projected energy demand will come from it. But Sizewell C has faced stiff opposition from local campaigners, and environmental groups both for its cost and the environmental impact. In a letter to Kwarteng outlining their legal challenge Together Against Sizewell C (TASC) argues that the permission by the government for the plant was given unlawfully. Represented by Leigh Day solicitors and supported by Friends of the Earth, the group says there was a failure to assess the implications of the project as a whole, by ignoring the issue of whether a permanent water supply could be secured, a failure to assess the environmental impact of that project and the suggestion that the site would be clear of nuclear material by 2140, which was not upheld by evidence showing highly radioactive waste would have to be stored on site until a much later date. The Planning Inspectorate had rejected the scheme saying \u201cunless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out\u201d. Pete Wilkinson, chair of TASC, said: \u201cThe case against Sizewell C is overwhelming, as has been carefully documented throughout the inquiry stage and was found by the planning inspector to have merit. \u201cEven to consider building a \u00a320bn-plus nuclear power plant without first securing a water supply is a measure of the fixation this government has for nuclear power and its panic in making progress towards an energy policy which is as unachievable as it is inappropriate for the 21st-century challenges we face.\u201d The risk to UK nuclear facilities from climate change has been outlined by Dr Paul Dorfman, an academic at the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, and the chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group. He warns the UK\u2019s coastal nuclear facilities are on the frontline of climate breakdown and some may have to be abandoned in the face of the threat. Dorfman said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Suffolk coast by the proposed Sizewell C nuclear plant is fragile, vulnerable to erosion and climate-driven storm surge. It looks like the site will be almost entirely cut off by flood water at least once per year, and much sooner than models predict.\u201d Sizewell C is expected to cost \u00a320bn and would be paid for with a surcharge on customer energy bills as well as \u00a31.7bn of taxpayers\u2019 money. Experts on nuclear waste disposal who advise government say no new nuclear plants should be built until a permanent disposal dump has been built. But a site for a permanent waste facility has yet to be identified, and is unlikely to be ready until the late 2040s at the earliest, if there is agreement on where it should be sited. Rowan Smith, the solicitor representing TASC, said: \u201cWe are proud to represent TASC in the local community\u2019s continued fight to help protect Suffolk\u2019s heritage coast and wildlife sites. Our client is understandably shocked that the secretary of state has gone against the considered and reasoned view of the independent planning inspectorate and granted development consent in a potentially legally flawed manner. TASC has very real concerns that the environmental impacts of Sizewell C have not been properly assessed. If the secretary of state does not see the error of his ways, then we intend to do all we can to bring this to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d The government said in granting the permission for Sizewell C that a very substantial and urgent need to build the plant outweighed the environmental harms. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. But the UK government is keen to ease CGN out because of concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Boris Johnson\u2019s government has already put up \u00a3100m of funding this year to support its development. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 August 2022. Dr Paul Dorfman is based at the University of Sussex; he is not a professor at University College London, as an earlier version said."

            "title": "Impact of war on Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant \u2013 visual guide",
            "date": "2022-08-26T09:58:46Z",
            "content": "Where is the plant and how significant is it? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and ninth largest in the world. It sits on the eastern bank of the Dnieper River, about 550km (340 miles) south-east of Kyiv. It was built between 1984 and 1995, and modernised over the last two decades with the help of European Union funds released in the wake of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. That programme meant to finish this year, but was disrupted by the Russian invasion. The plant has six nuclear reactors, and when all of them are online it can produce 5.7 GW, enough to power roughly 4 million Ukrainian homes. Two are operating at the moment but it is still a vital part of Ukraine\u2019s electric grid. It has been in the news because of safety concerns after Russia troops took control of the area, stationed military vehicles inside turbine halls, and drew up a risky plan to disconnect it from Ukraine\u2019s grid. What has happened at the plant since the outbreak of war? The Russian military took over the area in the early days of the war, although the plant is still run by Ukrainian workers. Here are some key dates since the outbreak of war. 24 February: Russia invades Ukraine, two of six reactors shutdown. 27 February: Fighting first reported in vicinity of the plant. 4 March: Russia seizes the plant after a battle during which a fire breaks out in a training area. Footage of the battle is captured on a security camera: There is global alarm at the prospect of fighting so close to nuclear reactors. Another reactor is shut down. Footage published the next day shows some of the damage: A photograph published on 17 March showed damage to an administrative building at the site: 5 July: Report that Russia has deployed military equipment to the plant, turning it into a base. Footage of Russian vehicles and personnel at the plant emerges in the weeks that follow: 5 August: One of three remaining reactors online is shut down after shelling. 6 August: Alarm over strikes near storage area for radioactive materials. 24 August: Ukraine\u2019s nuclear chief says Russia has a plan to disconnect the plant from the grid, and has filled the turbine halls of two reactors that are still operational with military vehicles: 25 August: The plant is temporarily disconnected from Ukraine\u2019s national grid for first time in nearly 40 years of operation, after final power line connecting the plant to the grid is cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plan. How has war affected the plant and its workers? About 9,000 of a 11,000-strong workforce have chosen to stay on to keep the reactors operating safely, despite extremely difficult working conditions, including mass detentions and assaults. One worker was beaten to death, another so badly assaulted he spent three months in hospital and about 200 workers have been detained, Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, told the Guardian. They have chosen to stay on because without them the risks of some kind of accident that would affect not just the local area or Ukraine, but possibly many neighbouring countries, would be much higher. Although the plant was originally built to Soviet designs, updates to the system means Russian engineers do not know how to run it safely, Kotin said. What might happen next? Ukraine has warned that Russia is contemplating disconnecting the plant from Ukraine\u2019s national grid and connecting it to Russia\u2019s power network. This would be extremely dangerous, because the plant\u2019s cooling systems rely on electricity to work, and if back up diesel generators fail the reactors could only operate safely for 90 minutes. This may be the biggest danger, but Kotin warned that Russia\u2019s management of the site is reckless. Military trucks block access to the turbine halls next to reactors, so if a blaze broke out firefighters might struggle to tackle it. And even if Russia does not attempt a switch, three out of four main power lines to the site are down, along with two out of three backups. On Thursday, the last remaining power line was disrupted twice, leading the plant to be cut off from the national grid for the first time since reactors began operation nearly 40 years ago. All sides have called for a delegation from the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to visit and inspect the site. Kotin said that could happen within one to two weeks, with all sides hammering out practical details. World leaders have urged Russia not to attempt the switch between grids, and called on Moscow to remove military equipment and personnel from the site."

            "title": "Russia blocks UN nuclear treaty agreement over Zaporizhzhia clause",
            "date": "2022-08-27T02:52:02Z",
            "content": "Russia has blocked an agreement at the United Nations that was aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) because Moscow objected to a clause about control over the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine. The failure to agree to a joint statement after four weeks of debate and negotiation among 151 countries at the UN in New York is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. The closing session was put off for more than four hours over Russian refusal to agree to a lengthy statement of support for the NPT which included a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is occupied by Russian forces close to the frontline in Ukraine\u2019s south-east. Alarm was raised on Thursday when the plant was temporarily cut off from the Ukrainian electricity grid but the connection was restored. Russian forces are reportedly planning to sever the plant more permanently from the grid, raising concerns of a possible disaster. A paragraph in the final draft text on Friday stressed \u201cthe paramount importance of ensuring control by Ukraine\u2019s competent authorities of nuclear facilities \u2026 such as the Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant\u201d. The Russian delegation was the only one to speak against the agreed text, but blamed the breakdown of the conference on Ukraine and its \u201cprotectors\u201d, calling the negotiations a \u201cone-sided game\u201d. After delivering its statement, the Russian delegation walked out of the UN chamber. The NPT was a deal struck in 1968 in which nuclear weapons states pledged to disarm while states without nuclear weapons promised not to acquire them. At the time there were five acknowledged nuclear powers, though Israel had secretly developed a weapon of its own by then. There are now nine states which possess nuclear warheads. Before the NPT came into force, some had predicted there would be dozens countries with their own arsenals. It is the second five-yearly review conference that has failed to issue a joint statement recommitting to the goals of the treaty. It has been 12 years since there was even partial agreement. But Sarah Bidgood, the director of the Eurasia nonproliferation program at the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, said the NPT was not irreparably broken, and that every other country would have accepted the text. \u201cThe bigger takeaway for me is just how far-reaching the impact of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has become,\u201d she said. \u201cEven at some of the darkest moments of the cold war, cooperation in support of the NPT was often possible. But what we saw at the final plenary today does not bode well for the future of nuclear diplomacy, including on issues like arms control.\u201d Beatrice Fihn, the executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said the disarmament elements in the proposed text had already been diluted by all five of the official nuclear powers recognised by the treaty \u2013 Russia, the US, France, the UK and China. \u201cSo, in all honesty, I don\u2019t think it makes much difference,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the very dangerous game the nuclear weapon states are playing by consistently failing to achieve anything in this treaty. At some point, non nuclear weapon states are really going to start questioning whether or not this treaty is worth the effort, and if it\u2019s relevant.\u201d Fihn argued that the continued failure of NPT review conferences to find common ground meant it was all the more important for countries to join the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW), which seeks to ban them outright. It came into force in January 2021, and so far 66 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really relevant that we quickly move forward with the TPNW and get more states,\u201d Fihn said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an insurance that if [the NPT] continues to fail, that we don\u2019t stand without anything.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-25T18:26:41Z",
            "content": "Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine\u2019s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country\u2019s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, has said. There have been growing international concerns about safety at Europe\u2019s largest nuclear plant. It has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war, and they are now using it to house military vehicles and equipment. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country\u2019s 31st Independence Day, celebrated on Wednesday, which was also the six-month mark since Russia invaded. \u201cI know it is a bittersweet anniversary, but I made it clear that the United States would continue to support Ukraine and its people as they fight to defend their sovereignty,\u201d Biden tweeted after the phone call. Negotiations are under way for the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine\u2019s top nuclear official told the Guardian that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. Until then, continued fighting puts the plant, and potentially much of Europe, at risk. A nuclear accident could spread radiation far across the continent. The plant was disconnected twice from the Ukrainian grid on Thursday after a blaze at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant affected the fourth and last connection into the plant\u2019s reactors. Three other lines had already been taken out during the war. \u201cThe actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid \u2013 for the first time in the history of the plant,\u201d Energoatom said on Thursday. The severing of that connection briefly caused a blackout in the Zaporizhzhia region, said Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed governor for the area. Power has now been restored. Disconnecting the plant from the grid is dangerous because it raises the risk of catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. During the outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Zelenskiy claimed late on Thursday that the world narrowly avoided a radiation accident. \u201cIf the diesel generators had not turned on \u2026 if our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,\u201d he said in an evening address. \u201cRussia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.\u201d He called on the IAEA and other world bodies to act much faster to force Russian troops to leave the territory of the station. The head of Energoatom\u2019s told the Guardian on Wednesday that Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from the national grid and connect it to the Russian power network instead. Petro Kotin said the plan was ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine were cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday. But Ukraine fears Russia may deliberately cut the lines. The latest crisis at the plant, which has previously been threatened by fires, came as the death toll from a Russian rocket attack on a railway station and village in south-central Dnipropetrovsk region rose to 25. The three rocket strikes also injured 31, according to Ukraine\u2019s authorities. The area was hit on Independence Day \u2013 an anniversary overshadowed by US warnings that Russia may be planning to \u201cstep up\u201d attacks. Russia\u2019s defence ministry said its forces had successfully hit a military train, killing 200 Ukrainian soldiers. It said the train was set to deliver arms to the frontline in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region. It is impossible to corroborate the claims. Ukraine\u2019s authorities do not regularly share information about their military losses. At least some of the victims appear to have been civilians. Pictures and footage of the aftermath aired by Ukraine\u2019s public broadcaster Suspilne showed at least one destroyed house in the village and extensive damage elsewhere. Those interviewed by Suspilne said fellow villagers had died. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said two children, aged six and 11, were killed, the latter when their house was destroyed. Zelenskiy said five people were killed while sitting in a car. Tetyana Kvitnytska, the deputy director of health at the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said four children were among the injured, three of whom were in a serious condition. She said there were shrapnel wounds, burns and fractures. Only two pictures have been released so far of the railway carriages that were hit, which appear burnt out and flattened in places. Tymoshenko said five passenger carriages caught fire and a utility building at the railway station had been hit. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs representative, Josep Borrell, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe EU strongly condemns another terrible Russian attack on the civilian population in Chaplyny on Ukraine\u2019s independence day. Those responsible for Russian missile terror will be held accountable.\u201d Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative stalemate in recent months, partly after the west supplied new long-range missiles that have hampered Russia\u2019s supply lines and ability to continue with its offensives. Ukraine says it also does not have the weapons it needs to launch a decisive counteroffensive."

            "date": "2022-08-12T21:44:52Z",
            "content": "The House passed Democrats\u2019 healthcare and climate spending package on Friday, sending the landmark piece of legislation to Joe Biden\u2019s desk and delivering a much-needed political victory for the party ahead of the midterm elections this November. The bill passed the House in a party-line vote of 220 to 207, and Democratic members broke into raucous applause as the proposal crossed the finish line. \u201cToday is really a glorious day for us. We send to the president\u2019s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said before the final vote. \u201cIf you are sitting at your kitchen table and wonder how you\u2019re going to pay the bills \u2013 your healthcare bills, your prescription drug bills \u2013 this bill is for you.\u201d Joe Biden is expected to quickly sign the legislation, which he has celebrated as a significant step toward combatting the climate crisis and reducing Americans\u2019 healthcare costs. The final House vote capped off a lively debate among members in the chamber, as Republicans attacked the bill as a reckless spending spree that would fail to address Americans\u2019 financial needs. A number of Republicans sharply criticized the bill\u2019s provision to increase funding for the Internal Revenue Service, which far-right congresswoman Lauren Boebert compared to \u201carmed robbery on the taxpayers\u201d. That comment prompted a rebuke from John Yarmuth, the Democratic chairman of the House budget committee. \u201cI would implore my Republican colleagues to cut out the scare tactics, quit making things up and debate the substance of this bill,\u201d Yarmuth said. The House\u2019s passage of the bill came five days after the Senate approved the package in a vote of 51 to 50, following a marathon session that lasted overnight and stretched into Sunday afternoon. The bill, formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act, is the culmination of more than a year of negotiations among Democratic lawmakers. The proposal was negotiated behind closed doors by the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and centrist Democratic senator Joe Manchin, who single-handedly quashed the bill\u2019s predecessor, the Build Back Better Act, last year. House progressives complained that the new bill is much narrower in scope than the Build Back Better Act, but they ultimately supported the spending package, largely because of its climate provisions. The legislation includes $369bn in funds aimed at expanding renewable energy sources and lowering planet-heating emissions. Experts have estimated the bill could reduce America\u2019s emissions by about 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. \u201cThis landmark legislation marks the largest ever federal investment in climate action,\u201d Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said on Friday. She added: \u201cWe think we crafted the best bill in the world with Build Back Better \u2026 So as soon as we get a couple more Democrats, we\u2019ve made the case for the rest of the bill.\u201d The bill also fell short of expectations for some of the centrist members of the House Democratic caucus. Lawmakers from high-tax states like New Jersey and California had pushed for changes to the limit on federal deductions for state and local taxes (Salt), but they failed to get that policy added to the spending package. Instead, the bill includes a number of tax changes to cover the cost of the rest of the proposal. Those policies, including a new corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, are expected to bring in more than $700bn in revenue for the government. Despite their reservations, centrist Democrats supported the bill, while emphasizing that they would continue their efforts to reform the Salt deduction. \u201cI will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing Salt,\u201d Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat of New Jersey, said on Sunday. \u201cBecause this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district, but in fact significantly lowers their costs, I will be voting for it.\u201d The bill previously attracted criticism from the progressive senator Bernie Sanders, who said the spending package did little to help working Americans who are struggling under the weight of record-high inflation. Sanders attempted to expand the healthcare and financial assistance provisions in the bill during the Senate\u2019s 16-hour vote-a-rama session last weekend, but those efforts were unsuccessful. Sanders has taken particular issue with the bill\u2019s provisions aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs, which he has said are too limited. The bill will allow Medicare to start negotiating the price of certain expensive drugs and will cap Medicare recipients\u2019 out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year, but key provisions meant to help Americans who receive health insurance coverage through the private market were stripped out of the legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s a very modest step forward,\u201d Sanders told MSNBC on Sunday. \u201cBottom line is, I\u2019m going to support the bill because given the crisis of climate change, the environmental community says this is a step forward. It doesn\u2019t go anywhere near as far as it should. It is a step forward.\u201d Democratic leaders have downplayed criticism of the bill, instead championing the legislation as America\u2019s most significant effort yet to address the climate crisis. \u201cAs I say to members, you cannot judge a bill for what it does not do. You respect it for what it does do. And what this bill does do is quite remarkable,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC on Tuesday. \u201cDo we want more? Of course. Will we continue to work for more? Of course.\u201d Democrats hope the passage of the bill could help the party\u2019s prospects in the midterm elections, which have appeared grim so far. Republicans are heavily favored to regain control of the House of Representatives, although Democrats have inched ahead in polling since the supreme court\u2019s reversal of Roe v Wade, which ended the federal right to abortion access. Party leaders have voiced optimism that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will show the country how Democrats are delivering for their constituents and convince voters to support them in November. \u201cYes, I do. It\u2019s going to immediately help,\u201d Biden said on Monday when asked whether he believed the bill will bolster Democrats\u2019 midterm prospects. \u201cIt changes people\u2019s lives.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-01T15:50:45Z",
            "content": "John Oliver delved into the woeful state of mental healthcare in the US, which has only been strained more by the spike of mental health concerns during the pandemic. In 2020, four in 10 Americans have reported symptoms of anxiety or a depressive disorder, compared with one in 10 in 2019. \u201cIt may help explain why for that one month last year, everyone on the internet suddenly started singing sea shanties,\u201d the Last Week Tonight host said on Sunday evening. \u201cIt was clearly a collective cry for help.\u201d But despite widespread awareness of the problem, people looking for help are encountering a system \u201cthat\u2019s just not set up to provide it\u201d. For one thing, there\u2019s overwhelming demand for a short supply of mental health professionals. According to the American Psychological Association, in 2021, 65% of psychologists reported that they had no capacity for new patients. A Senate report found that more than half of Americans who need mental healthcare do not receive it, with higher rates for minorities. Oliver pointed to one Black man in an NBC News report, who said he couldn\u2019t find a Black male therapist \u201cfor my life\u201d. \u201cWow, \u2018I couldn\u2019t find a Black man for my life\u2019 isn\u2019t something you expect to hear about finding a therapist,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you more expect to hear about the crowd on January 6th or all 10 seasons of Friends.\u201d \u201cAcross the board, whether in small towns or big cities, we don\u2019t have enough mental health professionals,\u201d he said, a gap that has proven attractive to Silicon Valley. Tech companies such as Woebot, Talkspace and Chatbot \u201cclaim to hook you up with therapists and in some cases, medication,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cThey\u2019re basically Uber, but for your brain. \u201cAnd look, there is nothing inherently wrong with teletherapy,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn theory, it can help fill in some of the very real gaps in access\u201d but \u201cthe reality of these services has often been deeply underwhelming\u201d. The company Cerebral, for example, became subject of a federal investigation over whether it over-prescribed controlled substances like Adderall. \u201cIt is clear mental health apps are not going to save us here, because they\u2019re not dealing with the main underlying issue,\u201d Oliver said, as they \u201ccan\u2019t suddenly hire more clinicians if not enough exist. And that shortage speaks to a mental healthcare system that is so dysfunctional, it seems almost designed to prevent people from accessing it or providers from entering the field.\u201d This is despite so-called \u201cparity\u201d laws at the state and federal levels, which require insurance companies to reimburse for mental healthcare at the same rate as other health services. Nevertheless, Oliver pointed out, insurance companies have found ways to deny coverage, such as through \u201cghost networks\u201d, which are lists from insurance providers padded with clinicians who either don\u2019t take new patients or are no longer in the coverage network. Insurance companies have also overturned coverage in the middle of treatment; Oliver pointed to the case of one Ohio family left on the hook for $88,000 of their own money after insurance deemed inpatient care for their suicidal teenager to be \u201cmedically unnecessary\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering how insurers can get away with that sort of thinking,\u201d Oliver explained, \u201cit\u2019s partly because the government has, to this point, done shockingly little when it comes to enforcing parity laws\u201d. Federal and state agencies rarely penalize insurance plans \u2013 the Labor Department closed just 74 parity investigations in fiscal year 2021, finding violations in only 12; state-level enforcement have levied fines just 13 times since 2017, \u201cwhich is absolutely pathetic\u201d, said Oliver. Public insurance such as Medicare and Medicaid also reimburse community health providers, whose own funding has deteriorated, at \u201cwoefully insufficient\u201d levels. \u201cBasically from top to bottom, we significantly underpay mental health professionals,\u201d Oliver said, \u201cmany of whom do difficult, high burnout work\u201d. Overworked, underpaid, struggling to make ends meet unless they practice in a high density, high wealth area \u2013 \u201ctherapists are in a no-win situation here\u201d, Oliver added, referring to a news clip in which anonymized mental health providers say they\u2019re being run into the ground by low reimbursements. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, it is just not a great sign that insurance companies are now so powerful that mental health providers feel like they have to go on the news like they\u2019re in witness protection after seeing someone get whacked.\u201d The costs of not addressing the crisis are high: mental health problems drive homelessness and force people into contact with the criminal justice system. \u201cIt is often said the correctional facilities have become the largest providers of mental healthcare services in our country,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cBasically, we\u2019ve gone from warehousing people with mental illness in buildings that felt like prisons,\u201d such as the sanatoriums of the early 20th century, \u201cto warehousing them in actual prisons instead. It\u2019s very much the new look, same great taste of America\u2019s failures.\u201d How to fix it? \u201cClearly, this is an absurd way to operate a healthcare system, and for the umpteenth time, I would argue single-payer healthcare is the way to go,\u201d Oliver said. In lieu of that political non-starter, it\u2019s strengthening and enforcing mental health parity laws \u2013 such as in California, which in 2020 passed a measure requiring insurance companies to base decisions of \u201cmedical necessity\u201d on current standards, not criteria they impose themselves. \u201cIn the past, so much of the problem here was that people would not ask for help. And thankfully, that\u2019s now less of an issue,\u201d Oliver concluded. \u201cBut now when people do reach out for help, we\u2019re just not in a position to give it to them. If we want to be a society that truly respects and values mental health, we have to respect and value mental healthcare, and that means supporting the people who deliver it.\u201d"

            "content": "As the first Covid wave hit, it quickly became clear that people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds were dying in disproportionate numbers. The immediacy and visibility of these deaths was shocking and revealed a disparity so clear-cut that some wondered if the explanation could be genetic. But those who have spent a lifetime studying health inequalities were less surprised. People from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds do worse across a wide range of health outcomes. Black women in the UK remain four times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth than white women. Black and ethnic minority patients are less likely to be prescribed newer medication for type 2 diabetes and are more likely to suffer retinopathy, a side-effect of the disease that can lead to blindness. The revelations that black and Asian people have to wait longer for a cancer diagnosis is another stark example. When trying to understand the causes of health inequalities, there has too often been a complacent tendency to look at factors that set minority groups apart, rather than face the more uncomfortable possibility that the healthcare system itself is discriminatory. If a group of people are genetically vulnerable to a disease, for example, the NHS can hardly be blamed for worse outcomes (genetic factors are rarely a major contributor to health inequalities). Socio-economic factors can play a substantial role in health outcomes, but this problem is mostly beyond the remit of healthcare leaders. Academic papers refer to \u201chealthcare-seeking behaviour\u201d, a phrase that seems to subtly place responsibility for poor outcomes on patients who failed to attend the doctors in a timely fashion. In fact, a recent report from the NHS Race and Health Observatory concluded that many people from ethnic minorities may delay or avoid seeking help because they fear racist treatment from NHS professionals. The differences in diagnosis wait times for black and Asian people compared with white people provides clear evidence that health inequalities can \u2013 and often do \u2013 result from inequalities in the healthcare system. These were all people who attended their GP surgery with symptoms. Underlying risk factors such as diet and lifestyle cannot have played a role. More work is needed to understand the factors at play. One possibility is that GPs are more likely to downplay the seriousness of cancer symptoms in black and Asian patients. Another possibility is that black and Asian patients are more likely to live near hospitals with longer waiting times. The NHS needs to make collecting data on patient ethnicity a priority so that health inequalities can be more fully understood and remedied. \u201cEveryone counts\u201d is a core value, written into the NHS constitution, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that in 2022, from maternity wards to oncology clinics, not everyone receives equal treatment."

            "date": "2022-08-08T09:51:37Z",
            "content": "Good morning. Senate Democrats passed their climate and healthcare spending package on Sunday, sending the legislation to the house and bringing Joe Biden one step closer to a significant legislative victory ahead of crucial midterm elections in November. If signed into law, the bill, formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act, would allocate $369bn to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewable energy sources. Experts have estimated the climate provisions of the bill will reduce America\u2019s planet-heating emissions by about 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. Democrats have promised the bill will lower healthcare costs for millions of Americans by allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and capping Medicare recipients\u2019 out-of-pocket prescription drug prices at $2,000 a year. Those who receive health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are also expected to see lower premium costs. Will Biden be able to meet his goal of halving emissions by 2030? Slashing America\u2019s planet-heating emissions by about 40% by the end of the decade, compared with 2005 levels, would bring the US within striking distance of the goal. China to resume military drills off Taiwan after shelving US talks China\u2019s military has announced new drills near Taiwan, including anti-submarine attack and sea raid operations, a day after its major live-fire exercises targeting the territory were supposed to end. The defence ministry also defended its shelving of military talks with the US in protest against Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei last week, which have raised concerns about potential accidents escalating into conflict. The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) posted online that it would practise anti-submarine attacks and sea raids on Monday, following four days of unprecedented drills around the self-ruled island. The defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian defended the decision to suspend military channels, saying in an online post on Monday: \u201cThe current tense situation in the Taiwan strait is entirely provoked and created by the US side on its own initiative, and the US side must bear full responsibility and serious consequences for this. \u201cThe bottom line cannot be broken, and communication requires sincerity,\u201d Wu said. Why is China so angry? Pelosi\u2019s visit last week infuriated China, which regards Taiwan as its own and responded with test launches of ballistic missiles over Taipei for the first time, as well as ditching some lines of dialogue with Washington. What has the US said about China\u2019s actions? Pentagon, state department and White House officials condemned the move, describing it as an irresponsible overreaction. Has the love affair between Trump and Fox News gone sour? For years, Donald Trump and Fox News were smitten. The former president would call into the rightwing news channel seemingly whenever he liked. Fox News hosts pumped up every Trump utterance. Trump watched the channel religiously, and in 2019 alone he sent 657 tweets in response to Fox News or Fox Business programs. Since then, however, things appear to have changed. Trump, as the New York Times has pointed out, has not been interviewed on Fox News for more than 100 days. A recent Trump speech was largely ignored by the network, and in a sign that Fox News has recognized alternative Republican presidential candidates are available, a Mike Pence address was broadcast live, in its entirety. With the news channel embroiled in a billion-dollar lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems over its claims the voting machine company tampered with the 2020 election, Trump\u2019s continuing lies about election fraud seem to have rattled Rupert Murdoch, the media titan who owns Fox News. What has Murdoch said about Trump recently? Nothing publicly yet but this week the Washington Post reported that Murdoch had \u201clost his enthusiasm\u201d for Trump. In other news \u2026 A visit to Solomon Islands by senior US diplomats included a touching personal moment, as Caroline Kennedy, the new US ambassador to Australia, met the children of two men who saved the life of her father, John F Kennedy, during the second world war. The actor Anne Heche was \u201cstable\u201d in hospital amid a wave of support from fans and fellow stars after an accident in which she drove her car into a Los Angeles home, causing severe burn injuries to herself as well as damaging the house, which has become \u201cuninhabitable\u201d. Three Muslim men have been killed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in a span of just 10 days, stoking fear in one of America\u2019s smallest Muslim communities as police have warned the deaths may be linked. Officials have said there is a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d the victims were targeted because of their race and religion. A truce between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad has taken effect in the Gaza Strip after three days of cross-border fighting triggered by surprise Israeli airstrikes. The US president, Joe Biden, welcomed the agreement yesterday, and called on all parties to \u201cfully implement the ceasefire\u201d. Don\u2019t miss this: Japan laments lack of progress on same-sex marriage In June, the Japanese capital became the latest city to recognise same-sex partnerships, and recent upper house elections featured a record four candidates from the LGBT community. Yet Japan\u2019s official resistance to same-sex unions is as fierce as ever. It is the only country in the G7 that denies LGBT couples the right to marry. Advocates hope an upcoming ruling in Tokyo district court will help spur progress on an issue that already has public backing. Climate check: \u2018There are no safe levels of pollution\u2019 As the climate crisis brings drought and dried-out landscapes, wildfires in the US west are spreading smoky air to millions of people, even those who live far from where the fires burn. The problem is becoming so pronounced that some television weather forecasters in California now include \u201csmoke casts\u201d in their reports. Scientists warn that current health policies are not effectively protecting people against smoke inhalation dangers. Wildfire smoke in recent years accounted for up to 50% of all dangerous, small-particle air pollution in the western US, research shows, and the problem is growing. Last Thing: Meet Casper the ghostly octopus A white octopus sat on the seabed, gently waggling its short, stubby arms and peering with beady eyes into the camera of a deep-diving robot. It was 2016, in waters off Hawaii, at a depth of 4,290 metres (2.6 miles). No one had ever seen an octopus like it, and certainly not so deep. Based on its ghostly appearance, it was nicknamed Casper. That first glimpse of Casper threw up many tantalising mysteries. Why is it so pale? Another puzzle is the short arms.

            "date": "2022-08-07T20:00:11Z",
            "content": "Senate Democrats passed their climate and healthcare spending package on Sunday, sending the legislation to the House and bringing Joe Biden one step closer to a significant legislative victory ahead of crucial midterm elections in November. If signed into law, the bill, formally known as the Inflation Reduction Act, would allocate $369bn to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewable energy sources. Experts have estimated the climate provisions of the bill will reduce America\u2019s planet-heating emissions by about 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels. Democrats have promised the bill will lower healthcare costs for millions of Americans by allowing Medicare to start negotiating the price of certain expensive prescription drugs and capping Medicare recipients\u2019 out-of-pocket prescription drug prices at $2,000 a year. Those who receive health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are also expected to see lower premium costs. The legislation includes a number of tax provisions to cover the costs of these policies, bringing in $739bn for the government and resulting in an overall deficit reduction of roughly $300bn. The policy changes include a new corporate minimum tax, a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks and stricter enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service. \u201cToday, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,\u201d Biden said in a statement celebrating the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cI ran for president promising to make government work for working families again, and that is what this bill does \u2013 period.\u201d The final Senate vote was 51-50, with every Democrat supporting the bill while all 50 of their Republican colleagues opposed the legislation. With the Senate evenly divided on the bill\u2019s passage, Vice-President Kamala Harris cast the tie-breaking vote. Because Democrats used the reconciliation process to advance the bill, they needed only a simple majority to pass the proposal, allowing them to avoid a Republican filibuster. But the choice to use reconciliation also somewhat limited what Democrats could include in their bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled on Saturday that a key healthcare provision, which would have placed inflation-related caps on companies\u2019 ability to raise prescription drug prices for private insurance plans, ran afoul of reconciliation rules. Another proposal to cap the cost of insulin in the private insurance market at $35 a month was also stripped out of the bill after 43 Senate Republicans voted to block the policy on procedural grounds. Still, Democrats celebrated that the Senate parliamentarian allowed most of their healthcare and climate provisions to move forward. \u201cWhile there was one unfortunate ruling in that the inflation rebate is more limited in scope, the overall program remains intact and we are one step closer to finally taking on big pharma and lowering Rx drug prices for millions of Americans,\u201d the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said on Saturday. Democratic leaders previously had to alter the tax provisions of the bill to secure the vote of Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who announced her support for the proposal on Thursday. Sinema caused some last-minute hand-wringing among Democrats on Sunday, as she pushed for changes to the new corporate minimum tax that would exempt some businesses from the policy. Democratic senators ultimately reached an agreement with Sinema to approve the exemption, which was paid for by extending loss limitations for pass-through businesses. Sinema was considered the last Democratic holdout in the negotiations, after fellow centrist Joe Manchin said he would vote in favor of the bill. The Senate\u2019s approval of the bill came nearly eight months after Manchin abruptly scuttled talks over the Build Back Better Act, which was viewed as Biden\u2019s signature legislative proposal. After tanking that bill, Manchin spent months participating in quiet deliberations with Schumer over another spending package that was more focused on reducing the federal deficit and tackling record-high inflation. The resulting bill was able to win the support of the entire Senate Democratic caucus on Sunday, even though the legislation is much smaller in scope than the Build Back Better Act. The bill\u2019s narrower focus frustrated the progressive senator Bernie Sanders, who criticized the compromise in a Saturday floor speech. Sanders complained that the legislation would do little to help working Americans struggling to keep up with rising prices, and he unsuccessfully pushed for expanding the bill to further lower healthcare costs. \u201cThis legislation does not address the reality that we have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time in the last hundred years,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThis bill does nothing to address the systemic dysfunctionality of the American healthcare system.\u201d Despite that criticism, Sanders backed the final version of the bill. The Senate\u2019s approval followed a marathon session that lasted overnight and into Sunday afternoon, as Republicans forced votes on dozens of proposed changes to the spending package. Democrats remained mostly unified in opposing Republicans\u2019 amendments, keeping the bill unchanged and ensuring the legislation\u2019s passage. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, tough and winding road. But at last, at last we have arrived,\u201d Schumer said on Sunday. \u201cI know it\u2019s been a long day and a long night, but we\u2019ve gotten it done. Today, after more than a year of hard work, the Senate is making history.\u201d Republicans fiercely criticized the bill, rejecting Democrats\u2019 arguments that the legislation will help tackle rising prices. According to a report issued by Moody\u2019s Analytics, the bill will \u201cmodestly reduce inflation over the 10-year budget horizon\u201d. \u201cDemocrats want to ram through hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes and hundreds of billions of dollars in reckless spending \u2013 and for what?\u201d the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said in a Saturday floor speech. \u201cFor a so-called inflation bill that will not meaningfully reduce inflation at all.\u201d House Democrats have dismissed Republicans\u2019 criticism of the bill, insisting they will swiftly pass the legislation and send it to Biden\u2019s desk. The majority leader, Steny Hoyer, has said the House will return on Friday to take up the legislation, and Democrats do not need any Republican votes to pass the bill. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has promised that the chamber would move quickly as soon as the Senate gave the bill its stamp of approval. She told reporters at a press conference last week, \u201cWhen they send it to us, we\u2019ll pass it.\u201d"

            "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday authorized retooled Covid-19 booster shots made by both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech to target the currently dominant BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants of the coronavirus. Both vaccines also include the original version of the virus targeted by all previous Covid shots as the US prepares for another vaccination campaign in the fall. As a single dose, Moderna\u2019s vaccine is authorized for those aged 18 and above. Pfizer\u2019s two-dose candidate is for those aged 12 and above. The US government has purchased 175m doses of the booster shots in an effort to stave off the worst effects of a potential surge in new infections as schools reconvene and people spend more time indoors as the weather grows colder. The FDA commissioner, Robert Califf, said: \u201cAs we head into fall and begin to spend more time indoors, we strongly encourage anyone who is eligible to consider receiving a booster dose with a bivalent Covid-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variants.\u201d In June, the FDA asked vaccine makers to tailor shots to the two subvariants responsible for the most recent surge in infections worldwide. The BA.5 subvariant currently accounts for more than 88% of US infections. In a statement, the FDA said: \u201cThe authorized bivalent Covid-19 vaccines, or updated boosters, include an mRNA component of the original strain to provide an immune response that is broadly protective against Covid-19 and an mRNA component in common between the omicron variant BA.4 and BA.5 lineages to provide better protection against Covid-19 caused by the Omicron variant.\u201d The agency said it made its decision based off the \u201ctotality of available evidence\u201d including \u201csafety and effectiveness data for each of the monovalent mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, safety and immunogenicity data obtained from a clinical study of a bivalent Covid-19 vaccine \u2026 and nonclinical data obtained using a bivalent Covid-19 vaccine that contained mRNA of the original strain and mRNA in common between the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages of the omicron variant\u201d. Individuals who receive the bivalent booster shot may experience side effects commonly reported by those that received monolanent Covid-19 vaccines, the FDA said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory panel is scheduled to meet on Thursday to make recommendations for use of the redesigned shots. The CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, will take the recommendations into consideration before making a final decision. Currently, 79% of the US population has received at least one dose and 67% is considered fully vaccinated. Only 33% of Americans have received a booster dose."

            "date": "2022-08-13T17:00:46Z",
            "content": "Angela Rasmussen studies the interactions between hosts and pathogens and how they shape disease. Before the pandemic, she worked on the emerging viruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), Ebola, dengue and avian flu. Then, when Covid-19 erupted, the American virologist, who works at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, was drawn into the debate over where it came from. She has been among the most vocal scientists on Twitter defending a \u201cnatural\u201d origin, as opposed to a lab leak. Last month, she and 17 co-authors published findings in Science that they feel should silence all rational critics on the question. In the Science paper, which started life as a preprint in February before going through peer review, you say that the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan was the \u201cearly epicentre\u201d of the Covid-19 pandemic. To be clear, are you saying that the Huanan market was the origin of the pandemic? That is what the research heavily implies. We are not able to pinpoint the exact spillover event, the exact animal from which the virus crossed into humans, but there\u2019s really no other explanation for what our analysis shows. And that is that there weren\u2019t any Covid-19 cases in Wuhan or anywhere else prior to these early cases that we looked at, which are all strongly associated with the market. What does your paper add that is new? Nobody disputes that there were a lot of early cases associated with the market. The question was, could the virus have come from elsewhere and just been amplified at the market? First, we did a lot of detective work to see if there was a geographical relationship between those early cases. Their geospatial coordinates had been available but nobody had conducted that kind of analysis before. Importantly, when we excluded the early cases that had a direct link with the market \u2013 meaning the patient had been there \u2013 the association with the market became even stronger. That\u2019s consistent with the virus acquiring the capacity for human-to-human transmission at the market, so that people who hadn\u2019t been there started catching it from those who had. It radiated out like ripples on a pond. Second, we have known since June 2021 that many species of live animal were on sale at Huanan. We obtained plans of the market, and legal and business records regarding what species were sold at the various stalls, and we cross-referenced these with data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) about swabs taken from surfaces in the market in early 2020, that tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 the virus that causes Covid-19. These positive samples clustered in the part of the market where the live animals were sold; they came from cages, carts and equipment that had been in contact with those animals. That wasn\u2019t widely known. By a crazy coincidence, in 2014 one of my co-authors, Edward Holmes, had taken a picture showing one particular stall where live raccoon dogs \u2013 which are susceptible to Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 were kept in cages stacked on a cart. He took the photo while being given a tour of the market by Chinese scientists who considered it to be at high risk of viral spillover. That stall later produced five samples positive for Sars-CoV-2. Finally, we showed that many of the species on sale at the market are susceptible to infection by Sars-CoV-2. We were the first ones to put all this evidence together, and to say that when you look at the whole picture, there\u2019s really no explanation other than that the virus started spreading in the human population at that market. There was a companion paper to yours in the same issue of Science. What did that show? In the early cases the virus already existed in two distinct lineages, A and B \u2013 though confusingly, B was the older of the two. Until February this year it was thought that only lineage B was present at the Huanan market, but then a group led by George Gao, the former head of the CCDC, showed that lineage A was there too [this paper is undergoing peer review]. The companion paper, by Jonathan Pekar of the University of California San Diego and colleagues \u2013 which I wasn\u2019t involved with \u2013 reconstructs their family tree to show that they probably reached humans as a result of two separate spillover events within a couple of weeks of each other. Now, if the virus had escaped from a lab, somebody would have had to get infected with lineage B in the lab, go to the market and infect people there without having infected anyone along the way, and then somebody else would have had to do the exact same thing with lineage A a few weeks later. It\u2019s not impossible, but a simpler explanation is that the virus was brought to the market in an animal, from where it spread to other animals, diverging in the process. The two lineages then spilled over separately into humans. One of the criticisms of your paper is that you remain vague on \u201cupstream events\u201d \u2013 that is, how the virus got to the market in the first place. That is one thing we don\u2019t know. We do know that the live animal trade uses a common supply chain. Animals are gathered from all over the place, including far-off parts of China, and brought to the market. There may well have been other spillover events upstream, but the other thing to keep in mind about the market is that it\u2019s an environment where human-to-human transmission can be established and sustained \u2013 because there are many animals housed in close contact with each other, and many humans milling around them. Spillover events in remote, sparsely inhabited areas are more likely to be dead ends because there are too few susceptible human hosts. We also know that when a related coronavirus, Sars, emerged in China 20 years ago, it was linked with the live animal trade. Have you ruled out that a lab leak caused the pandemic? I don\u2019t think you could ever completely rule it out, but we have demonstrated pretty conclusively that it came from the market. Could more be found out? Yes. We\u2019re still trying to establish the susceptibility to Sars-CoV-2 of the various species that were on sale at the market. I\u2019d like to see information about the farms where the animals were raised, and any samples taken from those animals before the farms and the market were closed, and the animals culled. These might allow us to identify the intermediate host \u2013 the animal from which the virus likely jumped to humans. I\u2019d be curious to see human serology data too, to find out if people working in the live animal trade in 2019-20 had elevated levels of Sars-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood. It is possible that this information exists and we\u2019re not being given access to it, and this is one of the hardest things to discuss with people who support the lab leak theory. If you look at it from the Chinese government\u2019s point of view, though, it\u2019s actually worse if this came from the market. After Sars they were supposed to have cracked down on the live animal trade, so it\u2019s hugely embarrassing for them if the same thing happened again \u2013 especially in a city where world-class coronavirologists work. One thing is clear: no meaningful further studies will happen without Chinese collaboration, and this debate has damaged the chances of that. Some scientists who defend a natural origin have been accused of conflicts of interest, generally because they have collaborated with Chinese scientists including researchers working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology \u2013 the institution most often named as the source of a hypothetical lab leak. Do you have a potential conflict of interest? I have never collaborated with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. I\u2019ve never had grants to work in China, and I\u2019ve never been to China. I have nevertheless been accused of a conflict of interest, for work I have done on Mers and Ebola that was funded by the US Department of Defense. Some of the wilder conspiracy theories implicate US biodefence. What should we take away from this origins debate? Every time a new virus emerges there is a debate over its origins. It\u2019s important to have it, but often there\u2019s an unrealistic expectation that the explanation will be simple. Some of the language doesn\u2019t help \u2013 the term \u201cpatient zero\u201d, for example. If there were multiple spillover events it may not be theoretically feasible to identify the first person who got sick. You can never entirely prevent the debate from being politicised, but you can do the analyses that are most likely to persuade serious scientists. Some critics will never be satisfied. In the case of Sars-CoV-2, they are twisting themselves into ever more complicated logical pretzels to keep the lab leak theory alive. You\u2019ve been a Twitter warrior throughout, and the debate has been toxic at times. What has that been like? If I had known what it was going to be like, I probably would have never opened my mouth. I\u2019ll also point out that there is a reason there aren\u2019t many female co-authors on this paper. All of us get personal attacks, but the men are accused of being corrupt or evil, whereas we are also accused of being ugly, fat, old, mediocre. I\u2019ve had rape and death threats; I\u2019ve had to call the police. I\u2019ve got pretty high self-esteem, but it wears you down. Should Twitter be regulated? Twitter has good and bad sides. It can be a great place for talking about science, for reaching audiences that you wouldn\u2019t normally reach, for meeting colleagues. It\u2019s how I heard about my current job and yesterday I got a grant for a collaboration that started on Twitter. It\u2019s also how I came to collaborate with my co-authors on this paper. This origins discussion is the worst of the bad things about Twitter, which incentivises abusive behaviour. I do think it should be regulated, but in a way that minimises the abuse, not in a way that silences people I disagree with."

            "content": "Instagram and Facebook have suspended a prominent anti-vaccine group led by Robert Kennedy Jr for repeatedly violating rules prohibiting misinformation about Covid-19. The non-profit, Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD), is one of the most influential anti-vaccine organizations active on social media, where it has spread misleading claims about vaccines and other pandemic-related public health measures. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaxxer, has attracted controversy for repeatedly sharing falsehoods and was himself booted from Instagram in 2021. His personal Facebook page is still active. Public health advocates and misinformation experts have criticized Facebook for not acting more swiftly to contain potentially harmful misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines. \u201cToday\u2019s step is too late and too little,\u201d said Karen Kornbluh, the director of the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative, in an emailed statement reacting to the decision. She added that platforms must work to address the root cause of misinformation. \u201cIt even leaves up RFK Jr\u2019s public Facebook page. In addition, both RFK Jr and CHD remain active on Twitter, showing how inadequate the Whac-A-Mole approach is to conspiracy campaigns. Instead platforms must address the algorithms and other design loopholes that allow their sites to be weaponized in the first place.\u201d In a statement, Kennedy compared Facebook\u2019s actions to government censorship, even though Facebook is a private company that can set and enforce its own rules about misinformation. \u201cFacebook is acting here as a surrogate for the federal government\u2019s crusade to silence all criticism of draconian government policies,\u201d Kennedy said. Children\u2019s Health Defense had hundreds of thousands of followers at the time of the suspension, according to a statement from the organization, which also noted that it has sued Facebook over its moderation policies. Facebook and Instagram confirmed the company action on Thursday in a statement to the Associated Press. \u201cWe removed these accounts for repeatedly violating our policies,\u201d a spokesperson for Meta, Facebook and Instagram\u2019s parent company, told the AP. Under the platforms\u2019 policies, suspensions are typically enforced only after multiple violations. Several state affiliates of Children\u2019s Health Defense remain on Facebook and Instagram despite the ban of the national organization."

But the US president has greeted this \u201chot streak\u201d in his usual quiet fashion. For his predecessor, it was a decidedly rough week after his home was raided by the FBI, looking for official documents that Donald Trump had held on to after his presidential term had ended. The reaction was a typical explosion of rage and accusation. David Smith, our Washington bureau chief, follows this compare-and-contrast theme to see which of the two men, who at this juncture still look likely to face each other again in the 2024 presidential election, came out on top. We report on two anniversaries in one region this week as Monday marked 75 years since the Partition of India, as well as a year since Afghanistan returned to Taliban rule. Our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, examines the extent to which Pakistan and India are still scarred by a final, brutal colonial flourish that divided communities, while Stefanie Glinski\u2019s photo essay from Kabul focuses on how women\u2019s rights have been eroded in the past year. The shocking news of the stabbing of Salman Rushdie reminded the world of the importance of free speech and how the efforts of ideological fanatics to curb it must be resisted. As Margaret Atwood writes on our Opinion pages, attacks on writers are a cheap populist distraction, while on the news pages we look at how Rushdie\u2019s novel The Satanic Verses triggered hatred against him. Leading our features section this week is a story about a reversal in reputation. Peru-based writer Dan Collyns explains how Bolivian tin baron Moritz Hochschild, had been viewed as an exploitative oligarch until the discovery of a cache of papers revealed his role in saving thousands of Jews from Nazi Germany and how he used his power to overcome antisemitism in the ruling elites. And then we take a full and frank look at the growing popularity of naturism in Britain. The photographs are necessarily coy, with artfully placed props, but writer Sally Howard takes the pastime as seriously as its practitioners. We hope you enjoy this week\u2019s issue.

            "date": "2022-08-19T13:04:11Z",
            "content": "Cineworld, the world\u2019s second-largest cinema chain, is preparing to file for bankruptcy after failing to see a quick enough recovery in movie-going since the end of the pandemic. The London-listed business, which has run up debt of more than $4.8bn (\u00a34bn) after losses soared while cinemas were shut during the global coronavirus crisis, has hired lawyers from Kirkland &amp; Ellis and consultants from restructuring experts AlixPartners to advise on the process. The company, which operates 751 sites in 10 countries including the Cineworld and Picturehouse chains in the UK, is expected to file a chapter 11 petition in the US and is considering insolvency proceedings in the UK, according to the Wall Street Journal. Cineworld\u2019s already battered share price crumpled from 20p to 2p after the report. Before the pandemic it was trading at \u00a31.97. The move follows Cineworld\u2019s market value more than halving on Wednesday after the company said it had started talks with stakeholders about a financial rescue package, blaming a lack of blockbuster films for lower-than-expected admissions. The group said it was in \u201cactive discussions with various stakeholders\u201d and evaluating strategic options to obtain additional liquidity and potentially restructure its balance sheet to reduce debt. \u201cAny deleveraging transaction will likely result in very significant dilution of existing equity interests in Cineworld,\u201d it warned. Investors reacting to the news sent the company\u2019s market value plunging to less than \u00a350m on Friday, having been valued at as much as \u00a34.4bn before the pandemic all but destroyed the cinema industry. On Wednesday, the chain said its business operations were expected to remain unaffected by its move to seek financial stability and that it \u201cexpects to continue to meet its ongoing business counterparty obligations\u201d. Unions representing Cineworld\u2019s 45,000 global workforce, including more than 5,000 in the UK, expressed concern about their fate. \u201cThis is very worrying news, not least for the UK\u2019s Cineworld and Picturehouse workforce, who have already been through a tumultuous time during the pandemic,\u201d said Philippa Childs, the head of the UK union Bectu. \u201cWe will do everything we can to support our members during this challenging time and will be looking to Cineworld to mitigate the impact of any bankruptcy arrangements on its employees.\u201d Cineworld, which faces an almost $1bn payout for pulling out of a deal to buy its Canadian rival Cineplex, reported a $493m year on year increase in net debt to $4.8bn at the end of 2021. The group made a $708m loss last year. However, revenues more than doubled from $852m to $1.8bn, thanks to the latest James Bond and Spider-Man films. In 2020, the company reported a record $3bn loss. \u201cThe firm will blame the lack of summer blockbusters as a reason behind its sharp downfall but in reality its aggressive acquisition plan has taken on too much debt and this was always a huge risk as interest rates rise,\u201d said Walid Koudmani, chief market analyst at the financial brokerage XTB. \u201cMoreover, the move to stay-at-home entertainment and streaming providers has created a pivotal shift in the way consumers enjoy films, and Cineworld simply has not adapted fast enough. It\u2019s all quite sad as the UK\u2019s high street will now likely lose a popular and familiar brand name.\u201d The company admitted about 95 million cinemagoers in 2021, up 75% on the 54 million in 2020 but well below the 275 million who attended before the Covid crisis. The state of Cineworld is in stark contrast to the performance of AMC Entertainment, the world\u2019s largest cinema group and owner of the Odeon chain in the UK, which said the new Top Gun and Dr Strange films had fuelled a doubling of ticket sales in the US. The company, which has a $12.8bn market value, said July had the highest monthly attendance in US cinemas since before the pandemic."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s official public inquiry into Covid-19 will begin scrutinising how Boris Johnson and his government handled the pandemic, it has been announced. The delayed investigation has been broken into modules, with teams investigating and commissioning research on different issues. The second module will have a particular focus on early 2020 and the decisions taken by Johnson and the cabinet, as well as decisions taken in the devolved institutions in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \u201cMy team and I will establish what was understood about Covid-19 at the time, what information was available in each of the four UK nations and how and why key decisions were made, especially early in the pandemic,\u201d said its chair, Lady Heather Hallett, first appointed to the position in December 2021. The investigation will also take into account the advice from civil service, senior advisers and relevant subcommittees. The first module, on the identification of the disease and the UK\u2019s readiness in responding, opened in July. The announcement comes nearly two and a half years after the coronavirus first swept across the UK. Preliminary hearings will be held from late autumn, with witnesses giving evidence in summer 2023. Hallett, a retired court of appeal judge and a crossbench peer, said she would begin using evidence given next year to build a full picture of challenges faced by the UK, and the ways in which governments chose to confront them. The investigation also allows for individuals, organisations and institutions to access evidence, make opening and closing statements at inquiry hearings, or suggest lines of questioning to counsel. The process to participate opens on Wednesday and closes on 23 September. \u201cIt\u2019s time for facts, not opinions \u2013 and I will be resolute in my quest for the truth,\u201d Hallett said when the first investigation was launched in July. Before its investigations, the inquiry launched a four-week consultation and received more than 20,000 responses on the government\u2019s draft terms of reference, on what should be investigated, and from individuals severely affected by the pandemic. \u201cWhen meeting those who lost loved ones earlier this year, I was struck by the devastating nature of their loss, exacerbated by the impact of the restrictions in place at the time on their ability to grieve. Millions felt hardship and loss during the pandemic, and for some life will never feel the same again,\u201d said Hallett. Jo Goodman, the co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, previously said all bereaved families want the same thing: \u201cto make sure that lessons are learned from our devastating losses to protect others in the future\u201d."

            "date": "2022-08-30T07:30:19Z",
            "content": "In the last few months, Dr Jeannina Smith has seen organ transplant recipients who have been very careful throughout the pandemic venture out for one activity, contract Covid-19 and lose their transplant. \u201cI have been at the bedside of a transplant recipient\u201d who \u201cwas very ill and in the hospital, and she got Covid the second time in a healthcare setting\u201d, said Smith, medical director of the infectious disease program at University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. \u201cShe was sobbing because she said, \u2018It\u2019s so hard for me to see that people care so little about my life that wearing a mask is too much for them.\u2019\u201d While much of US society has breathed a collective sigh of relief at no longer having to wear a mask in public, that freedom has placed people who are immunocompromised at risk, such as Smith\u2019s patients. Nor are they the only ones. Older adults, the very young and those with long Covid are at greater risk too. So while for many Americans the pandemic increasingly feels over, for others \u2013 often the most vulnerable \u2013 it rages on. As Smith puts it, \u201cWhat troubles me as an infectious disease specialist with an interest in public health is the abandonment of the idea that public health exists to protect the most vulnerable.\u201d About 7 million people in the United States are immunocompromised, according to the American Medical Association. That includes people who are organ or stem cell transplant recipients, or who have cancer, certain genetic disorders or take an immunosuppressive medication. While there are now vaccines and better treatments for Covid and variants that appear to cause less severe disease than earlier ones, people like Smith\u2019s patients still face a significant risk of becoming very sick or dying from Covid in part because they take medications that suppress their immune systems, she said. \u201cThe problem is that the vaccination is less potent if you aren\u2019t able to make a good immune response and so much of the protection that other people are afforded by vaccination\u201d doesn\u2019t protect transplant patients, Smith said. And when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stopped enforcing a mask mandate for public transportation in April, it made traveling harder for people who are immunocompromised, Smith said. Several of her patients contracted Covid while traveling. \u201cThey have an increasing number of family members who are out and about, exposed and actually having Covid, and it makes them feel, rightly, that they are less able to do the things that they did safely,\u201d Smith said. Older adults also continue to face a greater risk from Covid. Of the more than 146,000 people who have died this year from Covid, 77% were over the age of 65. \u201cThe risk of dying is not as great as it was before we had vaccines \u2013 not even close \u2013 but this is not a fun virus to get, and if you\u2019re in your 80s, for example, you don\u2019t really want to get any colds; you don\u2019t want to get sick because you have less reserve,\u201d said Dr Michael Wasserman, a geriatrician and chair of the Public Policy Committee of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine. But older adults must also balance that need for caution with the need for social engagement, which is also important to people\u2019s health, Wasserman said. That\u2019s difficult in some senior housing where \u201cthe lazy approach to dealing with the health and wellness of older adults is to isolate them, and it takes away their choice\u201d, said Wasserman. \u201cWe are at a point where this pandemic should not keep older people from socializing.\u201d The key for older adults is getting a second booster of the Covid vaccine, Wasserman said. He also recommends that older adults wear masks when they are indoors around people they don\u2019t know. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alarmist. I think that\u2019s the key here. I think people can live their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m 63, and I\u2019m doubly boosted, and when I go to the supermarket, I wear my N95\u201d mask. But wearing a mask can also be taxing on people who are required to do so in their jobs, said Erica Birkley, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience in the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. \u201cIt can be a lot more difficult to get a sense of the other person\u2019s emotions,\u201d said Birkley, who also provides psychotherapy. \u201cWe also tend to drink less water or not take as many breaks throughout the day \u2026 We can get into a pattern of essentially being depleted in ways related to having to wear a mask.\u201d The key is ensuring that people can take mask breaks, she said. It can also be helpful to think about how wearing a mask could benefit others, she said. \u201cIt is usually going to be cathartic for me to think about the possible positive ripple effect for another human being in that room who possibly might be immunocompromised,\u201d she said. People with long Covid also often must contend with a lack of recognition of their disease, said Dr Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, who chairs the department of physical medicine and rehabilitation at University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and founded its Post-Covid Recovery Clinic. Almost one in five US adults who had Covid continued to have long Covid symptoms in June, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. Symptoms include severe fatigue; shortness of breath; heart palpitations; brain fog; and sleep problems. \u201cEven though yes, we are learning more, we don\u2019t have a biomarker yet. We don\u2019t have definitive treatments,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cA lot of people see it as a legitimate disease, and then I\u2019m on social media \u2026 and occasionally people will say, \u2018Well, how do you know it\u2019s not just anxiety?\u2019\u201d A new Brookings Institution report estimates that between 2 and 4 million people in the United States are out of work due to long Covid. Gutierrez said her patients can only obtain social security disability insurance or employer disability insurance benefits \u201cvery infrequently\u201d. \u201cEveryone was hoping that they would get over it or that time will heal it, and they are just still not feeling that way,\u201d Gutierrez said. *** Before contracting Covid in January 2021, Jennifer Ramey spent almost three decades as a cardiology nurse and ran 20 marathons and hiked some of Colorado\u2019s 14,000ft mountains. \u201cI loved what I did and was a hopeless romantic nurse and loved patient care,\u201d she said. But she has been out of work since February 2021 and feels exhausted after walking a couple of aisles at the grocery store, she said. She spent eight months in rehab \u2013 some of it inpatient \u2013 working with physical, occupational, recreational and speech therapists. While she is now able to again drive, she still must do cognitive workbooks featuring pattern identification and word search exercises. Ramey also lost her job. She applied for disability benefits, but the Social Security Administration recently denied her. She plans to appeal. She does not expect that she will be able to return to work as a cardiology nurse. \u201cI should probably never check defibrillators and pacemakers. Even though I can do it in my head, I know my head is slower than it needs to be for something like that,\u201d said Ramey. \u201cI will never do the things that I loved as a nurse as far as the critical thinking part.\u201d Still, Gutierrez is encouraged by some of the recent research on long Covid. For example, a study from a Yale University researcher, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that cortisol levels were often lower among long Covid patients as compared to control groups. That\u2019s important because it could mean they are closer to identifying a biomarker for long Covid, which could lead to treatments and prove to \u201cthe naysayers, the insurance companies that this means you have long Covid, or this means you are impacted by long Covid\u201d, Gutierrez said. Smith, the transplant infectious disease specialist, also said she was hopeful that nasal vaccines under development could help reduce the risk of infection rather than just preventing severe outcomes, which would be helpful for her patients who are more vulnerable to the virus. But even if that turns out to be the case, Smith remains discouraged by the lack of societal concern for such patients and doesn\u2019t expect that to change. \u201cI think that the damage to public health is profound,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd in regards to Covid, I think likely permanent.\u201d"

            "content": "Gordon Ramsay\u2019s restaurant empire has reported almost \u00a312m in losses and cut almost 300 staff because of closures and restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic as the businessman warned of the potential impact of soaring inflation and rising bills on restaurant dining habits. The celebrity chef runs or owns a stake in 35 restaurants in the UK \u2013 including P\u00e9trus, Bread Street Kitchen, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and three at the Savoy \u2013 and has licence agreements for a further 13 worldwide. The latest published company accounts for Gordon Ramsay Restaurants show that his businesses made a pre-tax loss of \u00a36.84m in the year to the end of August 2021, after a \u00a35m loss in the same period in the preceding year, which included the first months of the pandemic. Last year, Ramsay said his restaurants had suffered tens of millions of pounds in revenue losses because of cancelled reservations due to coronavirus. The latest companies accounts highlight the extreme financial pressure the hospitality trade has faced, with the \u00a326.2m in revenues Ramsay\u2019s restaurants made in its last financial year less than half the \u00a354.7m they made before the pandemic hit, in 2019. In the year to the end of August 2019 the company made \u00a315m in profits. As the ultimate controlling party, Ramsay effectively earns what the company makes in post-tax profits, which was \u00a311.9m in 2019. The company said that since February, when the last of the restrictions on hospitality businesses were lifted in England after the initial outbreak of the Omicron variant, its restaurants had bounced back to profitability and sales were \u201cconsistently ahead of pre-pandemic trading\u201d. However, with household budgets continuing to be squeezed by soaring energy bills and inflation hitting a 40-year high, the company warned of tough trading conditions ahead. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the group for a second year, and there are new risks to consider associated with inflationary pressures and consumer spending,\u201d it said. The financial filings reveal that the restaurant group can withstand a potential 20% reduction in sales \u2013 the same level as it recorded during the first Omicron outbreak, from late November to February \u2013 without leading to cash shortages or breaking lending covenants. Ramsay also turned to the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme for \u00a36.5m to support staff over the past two years, and another \u00a3524,000 in \u201clocal government support grants\u201d last year. The financial filings also show that staff numbers were reduced from 914 to 622 between August 2020 and August 2021 as the company tried to cut millions from its wage costs during the pandemic. Nearly all of the losses were restaurant staff. Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, which has \u00a323.7m of net debt, also has \u00a313.7m in bank loans secured by the group and \u201cpersonal guarantees\u201d. The accounts show that as of 31 August last year, Ramsay had given \u00a310m in personal guarantees over the two years of the pandemic."

            "content": "This is the cinematic equivalent of the stopped clock telling the right time twice a day: a film full of stylistic overkill suddenly runs into the material that justifies it. Near the end of this otherwise unconvincing lakeside thriller from Canada\u2019s Fuica brothers, there\u2019s suddenly a protracted murderous brawl shot in an ecstatic ultra slo-mo sequence. It dazzles not just on its own terms, but for briefly elevating the film into something innovative, rather than the redundant showboating that\u2019s gone before. Maybe the Fuicas had too much time on their hands. Camping Trip is the fruit of Covid-19 lockdown, and hinges on a tenuous pandemic tie-in. Pent-up party people Ace (Alex Gravenstein) and Coco (Hannah Forest Briand) hook up with besties Enzo (co-director Leonardo Fuica) and Polly (Caitlin Cameron) for some forest-bathing R&amp;R beside a secluded lake. But they stumble on the corpse of a doctor involved in some kind of shady tradeoff, who has dumped a bag of money in their tent; if that wasn\u2019t nice enough, he\u2019s left a patent for a prototype vaccine in there, too. The prospect of instant riches divides the party, with skint Ace keen on scarpering with the proceeds. It\u2019s not a great time for Orick (Michael D\u2019Amico) and Billy (Jonathan Vanderzon), the little\u2019n\u2019large roughnecks who offed the doctor, to turn up at the fireside. There\u2019s not much logic or depth to any of this. Characterisation is puddle-deep, with Ace\u2019s serial dick-flashing predominating. It\u2019s not every day you see protagonists having a bisexual foursome, something that goes weirdly unexplored in the later tensions. Everyone behaves idiotically, prompted by story needs: the first squabble over the loot is quickly forgotten, so they can have an impromptu dance party to draw in the criminals. The actors overcompensate for the weak script with postural, shrill performances. The directors overcompensate, never throwing in one drone shot when three or four will do. Which makes the sudden lurch into an operatic bloodbath, shot with considerable psychological acuity, all the more impressive. Shortly afterwards, there is a second confrontation that\u2019s almost as eye-catchingly lensed, the camera swivelling ceaselessly to reveal and then hide the carnage, a bit like Jack Nicholson\u2019s death scene in The Passenger. The Fuicas don\u2019t hone the choreography as finely this time, but clearly there is some visual talent there. So it\u2019s a shame they bandy it around indiscriminately, like noisy city folk in the sticks. \u2022 Camping Trip is available on digital platforms on 16 August."

The third-generation Bavarian-Nordic vaccine will be prioritised for at-risk groups including gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, especially those travelling to countries with a significant outbreak. Australia has so far only had 58 cases of monkeypox in the 13 weeks since the virus began spreading in 76 countries outside those where it has been endemic for years. On 28 July monkeypox was declared a \u201ccommunicable disease incident of national significance\u201d in Australia after a declaration by the World Health Organization. On Thursday the health minister, Mark Butler, told reporters in Canberra that the Morrison government had begun negotiations for the third-generation vaccine on 20 May, just one day after the first case in Australia and one day before the federal election. After 27 meetings, Australia has bought 450,000 doses including 100,000 to arrive this year and the remaining 350,000 in 2023. The vaccine can be used to prevent spread and post-exposure. Monkeypox can also be prevented with a smallpox vaccine, ACAM2000, which is registered for use in Australia and contained in the national medical stockpile, but that vaccine uses a weakened live pox virus, making it unsuitable for the immunocompromised. Butler said the third-generation Bavarian-Nordic vaccine was \u201cby far the more effective and user-friendly for patients with compromised immunity\u201d. It could also be administered to pregnant women, children and those with skin conditions. The minister said the government had procured the \u201cworld\u2019s best vaccines for Australians and we are one of only a very limited number of countries that have been able to secure supplies of this third-generation vaccine in 2022 in a highly contested market\u201d. \u201cWe will be rolling out the vaccine through state and territory largely, central health clinics,\u201d he said, starting with the at-risk cohorts identified by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. These are: people categorised as a high-risk monkeypox contact in the past 14 days; gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men with a high number of sexual contacts; sex workers; and immunisation providers who are administering the ACAM2000 smallpox vaccine. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the work the chief medical officer and the department have been able to do in a short period of time, particularly the secure the supply of vaccines in a highly contested global market,\u201d Butler said He noted that case numbers had \u201cincreased quite quickly\u201d around the world, to more than 25,000 including 6,000 in the US, 4,000 in Spain, and 3,000 in the UK but Australia had \u201cmanaged to avoid the worst elements you have seen in North America and Europe\u201d. The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said he would not \u201cpick a number\u201d of estimated total cases. \u201cBut the important thing is all the work done since May in Australia, and the added benefit of the vaccine, will continue to help us to control the epidemic here in Australia and I\u2019m very confident that will happen.\u201d The Australian Federation of Aids Organisations acting chief executive, Heath Paynter, said \u201cthe swift procurement of these vaccines is a very positive step\u201d. \u201cWhile local transmission of Monkeypox has so far been limited, we can\u2019t rely on that to continue,\u201d he said. \u201cCities such as London, Montreal, Lisbon and Madrid are all dealing with significant community transmission.\u201d \u201cThe availability of the monkeypox vaccine for people who need it is a critical forward defence against transmission. It will help people look after their own health as well as that of people they are intimate with.\u201d Dr Nick Medland, a sexual health specialist and researcher at the Kirby Institute, said: \u201cWe expect the outbreak will begin to slow after 75,000 members of our community have had one dose of the vaccine and may not be eliminated until 250,000 doses have been administered to those who need them most.\u201d Monkeypox results in rashes and flu-like symptoms, which Kelly said in July were \u201crelatively mild, and in most cases, resolve themselves within two to four weeks without the need for specific treatments\u201d. \u201cAlthough monkeypox is not usually considered a sexually transmissible infection, physical contact with an infected person during sexual intercourse carries a significant risk of transmission and intimate physical contact such as hugging, kissing and sexual activities represent a risk of infection, with infectious skin sores being the likely mode of transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rash usually occurs on the face before spreading to other parts of the body, including the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However, in this outbreak it is being seen especially on the genital and perianal regions of affected people.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-15T15:19:47Z",
            "content": "A vaccine designed to target two different forms of Covid will be offered as part of the autumn booster programme, after the jab was approved by the UK\u2019s regulator. Manufactured by the US firm Moderna, the jab attacks not only the original coronavirus \u2013 as is the case for vaccines currently in use \u2013 but is designed specifically for the Omicron variant BA.1, which fuelled a wave of the virus in the UK last winter. The UK is the first country to approve the bivalent vaccine, known as \u201cSpikevax bivalent Original/Omicron\u201d, giving the green light for its use as a booster for people over the age of 18. The UK\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said the vaccine would be used in the planned autumn booster programme. This is expected to begin in September, ahead of what could be a difficult period for the NHS with an expected surge in respiratory diseases, including Covid and flu. Dr June Raine, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\u2019s (MHRA) chief executive, said clinical trials had shown the bivalent vaccine provided a strong immune response to the Omicron BA.1 variant as well as the original 2020 strain. \u201cThe first generation of Covid-19 vaccines being used in the UK continue to provide important protection against the disease and save lives. What this bivalent vaccine gives us is a sharpened tool in our armoury to help protect us against this disease as the virus continues to evolve,\u201d she said. Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human Medicines, which independently reviewed the vaccine data, said the commission agreed with the MHRA\u2019s decision, adding that the jab was able to lead to a broader immune response than the original vaccine. According to Moderna, trial participants who were given the bivalent booster had antibody levels against BA.4 and BA.5 that were 1.7 times higher than those given the original booster. These subvariants fuelled the most recent Covid wave in the UK, and have caused infections, breakthrough reinfections, deaths and disruption around the world. However, the difference is small and it is unclear what impact such a rise in antibody levels means clinically in terms of the protection offered by the jab. Nonetheless, the bivalent vaccine is expected to be no less effective than current jabs. The JCVI said that getting vaccinated is more important than focusing on the jab involved, with existing jabs having offered very good protection against severe disease for all Covid variants to date. \u201cIt is important that everyone who is eligible takes up a booster this autumn, whichever vaccine is on offer. This will increase your protection against being severely ill from Covid-19 as we move into winter,\u201d said Prof Wei Shen Lim, Chair of Covid-19 immunisation on the JCVI. The autumn booster programme is focused on protecting those at increased risk from Covid, including people over the age of 50 and residents in care homes for older adults, with about 26 million people expected to be eligible for the jab. The Guardian understands the approach is an effort to move away from an emergency response to Covid in favour of a more targeted stance. The JCVI said it was preferable for a single type of vaccine to be used in the autumn booster programme, but it is not yet clear if this will be the bivalent Moderna jab or the existing booster jabs from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which the JCVI have also said can be used. In addition, the JCVI have said the Novavax jab can be offered as a booster. This is based on more traditional vaccine technology and can be given to people who cannot have the other booster jabs, for example because of allergies. Children who require a booster will be offered one of the current Pfizer/BioNTech jabs, at the appropriate dose for their age. Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, suggested the \u201cSpikevax bivalent Original/Omicron\u201d vaccine may not offer huge gains in the fight against the latest Omicron subvariants. \u201cWe lack the certainties we had in early 2020 of which way to go with the vaccines, not least how to keep up with evolution of the variants,\u201d he said. \u201cBA.5 is highly immune-evasive, so that even boosted people have highly impaired protection. Even exposure to the original Omicron sequence \u2013 as used in this, new, bivalent vaccine booster \u2013 only gives a rather marginal advantage to the antibody response.\u201d Altmann said that meant the outlook was complex. \u201cWe\u2019re in a terribly vulnerable position heading into the winter, so any booster programme is better than nothing, and this bivalent booster almost certainly an improvement over the first-generation vaccines,\u201d he said. \u201cMy view is that this approach offers a marginal improvement in our battle against BA.5, but actually, we still need to think harder about this and look more broadly at the diverse vaccine candidates. In the meantime, get boosted.\u201d"

            "content": "Anti-lockdown protesters who abused the BBC journalist Nick Watt and left him feeling in \u201cimmense danger\u201d have been sentenced. Footage played in court showed demonstrators shouting in the Newsnight political editor\u2019s face and calling him a traitor before chasing him at a rally near Downing Street on 14 June last year. The anti-vaccine demonstrators were said to have targeted Watt because he was wearing a BBC lanyard. Djazia Chaib-Eddour, 44, Martin Hockridge, 58, Alexander Peat, 34, Christopher Aitken, 62, and Gary Purnell, 45, denied using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress, but were found guilty at trial. The district judge, Louisa Cieciora, sitting at Westminster magistrates court, said the incident was \u201cextremely unpleasant\u201d, as she handed Purnell, Peat and Hockridge 12-month community orders, with a requirement to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Chaib-Eddour was given a 12-month community order, with a requirement to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and 20 hours of rehabilitation. They were each ordered to pay \u00a3395 in costs and other charges and given an indefinite restraining order not to contact Watt. The judge said: \u201cThis was an extremely unpleasant incident in which each of you used abusive words and threatening behaviour towards Mr Watt. This was committed against somebody who was providing a service to the public, even if you did not agree that service was being performed to the standard it should have been.\u201d The judge issued an arrest warrant for Aitken, who did not attend the hearing. Joseph Olswang, 40, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing and was sentenced to 20 weeks\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for 18 months. In a victim impact statement, Watt told how he ran to the gates of Downing Street \u201cas fast as I could\u201d because of the \u201csize and aggression of the crowd\u201d. \u201cAt the time of the incident I was shocked and alarmed at what was happening to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I was in immense danger.\u201d The reporter said he has been the subject of death threats on \u201cconspiracy theorist forums\u201d and had concerns \u201cmy safety can no longer be guaranteed\u201d. \u201cWhilst not from identified suspects in this case, they were clearly inspired by the incident,\u201d he said. \u201cMy family and I found them very distressing.\u201d The prosecutor, Sudara Weerasena, said on Tuesday that Watt had been intimidated during the trial. \u201cHaving given evidence in this particular case, he was intimidated leaving the court,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prosecution advocate had to be escorted out of the building by police.\u201d The judge said the allegations could not be \u201claid at the door of any of the defendants\u201d, who were still in court at the time."

            "date": "2022-08-18T16:05:46Z",
            "content": "The Biden administration will accelerate the distribution of monkeypox vaccines by providing an additional 1.8m doses, as well as taking other steps to address the rapidly spreading disease amid criticism of the government\u2019s slow response. The new doses will accelerate the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) previous timeline, and HHS also announced a new program to coordinate additional doses for states and local health departments organizing mass events for at-risk communities, said the White House monkeypox response coordinator, Bob Fenton, during a morning briefing on Thursday. Moreover, the administration will offer an additional 50,000 courses of antiviral treatment for people who test positive. States and municipalities can begin ordering the supplies next week, reported Reuters. State and local jurisdictions will only be able to acquire additional doses if they administer the vaccine intradermally and have used 90% of their current vaccine supply. There are 13,517 cases of monkeypox in the US, according to the latest data from the CDC from Wednesday, with the majority in New York and California. Both the Biden administration and the CDC have been criticized for their slow response to the spread of monkeypox, including sluggish vaccine rollout and poorly communicated information on the illness. The New York Times reported on 3 August that the US was distributing only 1.1m monkeypox vaccines, less than one-third of the 3.5m doses that health experts said would be needed. A lack of federal supplies has made distributing the vaccine difficult on a local level, with eligible patients struggling to secure doses. The announcement of additional monkeypox vaccines comes after the CDC director, Dr Rochelle Walensky, announced a radical reorganization of the agency following criticism of its response to Covid-19, monkeypox and other recent public health crises. She said the goal was to make the CDC more nimble in response to public health emergencies, and to address issues of public trust. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s my responsibility to lead this agency to a better place after a really challenging three years,\u201d Walensky said on Wednesday."

            "content": "Instagram and Facebook have suspended a prominent anti-vaccine group led by Robert Kennedy Jr for repeatedly violating rules prohibiting misinformation about Covid-19. The non-profit, Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD), is one of the most influential anti-vaccine organizations active on social media, where it has spread misleading claims about vaccines and other pandemic-related public health measures. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaxxer, has attracted controversy for repeatedly sharing falsehoods and was himself booted from Instagram in 2021. His personal Facebook page is still active. Public health advocates and misinformation experts have criticized Facebook for not acting more swiftly to contain potentially harmful misinformation about Covid-19 and vaccines. \u201cToday\u2019s step is too late and too little,\u201d said Karen Kornbluh, the director of the Digital Innovation and Democracy Initiative, in an emailed statement reacting to the decision. She added that platforms must work to address the root cause of misinformation. \u201cIt even leaves up RFK Jr\u2019s public Facebook page. In addition, both RFK Jr and CHD remain active on Twitter, showing how inadequate the Whac-A-Mole approach is to conspiracy campaigns. Instead platforms must address the algorithms and other design loopholes that allow their sites to be weaponized in the first place.\u201d In a statement, Kennedy compared Facebook\u2019s actions to government censorship, even though Facebook is a private company that can set and enforce its own rules about misinformation. \u201cFacebook is acting here as a surrogate for the federal government\u2019s crusade to silence all criticism of draconian government policies,\u201d Kennedy said. Children\u2019s Health Defense had hundreds of thousands of followers at the time of the suspension, according to a statement from the organization, which also noted that it has sued Facebook over its moderation policies. Facebook and Instagram confirmed the company action on Thursday in a statement to the Associated Press. \u201cWe removed these accounts for repeatedly violating our policies,\u201d a spokesperson for Meta, Facebook and Instagram\u2019s parent company, told the AP. Under the platforms\u2019 policies, suspensions are typically enforced only after multiple violations. Several state affiliates of Children\u2019s Health Defense remain on Facebook and Instagram despite the ban of the national organization."

            "date": "2022-08-15T10:50:03Z",
            "content": "Most students relish their time at university, enjoying new freedoms, friendships and interests. However, it\u2019s not uncommon to also experience more difficult moments, such as adjusting to being away from home, coping with exam stress, or managing an existing mental health problem. \u201cEveryone is going to have issues that they deal with at some point, because it is an intense and overwhelming experience,\u201d says Poppy Lindsey, 20, students\u2019 union welfare officer at Reading University, which recently topped a league table that ranked mental health support on campus. \u201cBut people are more supportive than you think and want to help you.\u201d While universities must offer counselling services and advice on registering with a local GP or their own dedicated medical centre, some, such as Reading University, are going further in terms of the support they offer. \u201cI have a lot of friends who have accessed help at Reading,\u201d says Lindsey. \u201cI myself was struggling with anxiety and panic attacks, and found counselling a really positive experience. People tend to be quite open about their mental health.\u201d This attitude has been encouraged by campaigns run by the students\u2019 union to de-stigmatise issues around mental wellbeing. In parallel, the university has an average spend of \u00a370 per student on welfare, and a holistic approach to mental health support, with staff receiving mental health first aid training. The annual Relax with RUSU (Reading University students\u2019 union) event, which coincides with exam season, encourages students to de-stress by accessing everything from gardening and painting to a mobile animal petting farm. Students can make use of a relaxation room, sessions on resilience, and yoga and meditation classes. \u201cThe union tries to make sure every student feels included,\u201d says Lindsey. \u201cAnd that they can come for support if they need it.\u201d The need for these types of measures is clear. Universities have reported that more students are experiencing mental health problems in the wake of the pandemic. A study from the Office for National Statistics published in October 2021 found that 37% of students were showing signs of moderate to severe depression and 39% had some form of anxiety. In June, the government announced \u00a33m to improve services on campus, with a further \u00a315m being distributed by the Office for Students to fund student mental health support, and a tsar appointed for student wellbeing. The services available vary by institution. Some, such as Middlesex University, have a mental health triage system, where students can voice concerns and quickly gain access to relevant professional help required. At Cardiff University, meanwhile, dedicated mental health nurses are on hand. Jua O\u2019Kane, 24, who studies illustration at Arts University Plymouth, says: \u201cI had frequent sessions with a mental health support officer who ended up being much more beneficial to me than counselling was. He taught me meditation, gave me a relaxed space to unload, and we worked through problems together. He mediated me through various crises and was a really important point of contact in trying to de-escalate when I was doing badly.\u201d Pastoral care for students is provided by personal tutors, and universities encourage staff and students to undertake mental health first aid training. Workshops can help participants to learn more about their own mental health and how to support others. A University Mental Health Charter was launched in 2019 by the mental health charity Student Minds, encouraging institutions to strive to provide the best possible care. Ucas forms give applicants the opportunity to declare mental health issues. An English student at Leeds with OCD, who wished to remain anonymous, says that this meant she was placed in a flat with another student with similar health struggles, and was given extra time for essays and exams. There has been a gradual rise in online support, from web-based counselling to therapy apps. Loneliness and isolation have always been problems for some and can be made worse by living accommodation choices. Dr Nicola Byrom, a senior lecturer in psychology at King\u2019s College London and founder of Student Minds, points to the rise in upmarket accommodation, with students often living alone rather than in traditional halls and house shares \u201cwhere you find yourself with a bunch of strangers\u201d. While initially living with a group may be harder for some students, ultimately it makes it easier to integrate, make new friends and find your feet, she says. At King\u2019s College London, a Students Against Loneliness society was established \u201cto show that you\u2019re never alone\u201d, thanks to telephone befriending schemes and social events such as group walks. Finding a sense of belonging can be key to positive mental wellbeing at university. Aneeska Sohal, 24, is a team lead for the charity Mind. When working towards a master\u2019s in Modern South Asian Studies at Oxford, she set up the podcast All Things Mental Health. \u201cStudents came on and spoke about all the different things that helped them,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a really powerful one about a student who ran a hospital radio show. Playing songs for patients helped his wellbeing because it gave him a sense of purpose.\u201d For Sohal, her previous experience as president of the University of York Student Minds not only gave her a community but paved the way for her career. \u201cIf we\u2019re saying mental health and wellbeing underpins every person, then universities need to realise that it is a key component of the experience. It can give young people the tools to help them in later life.\u201d In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

            "title": "The drugs don\u2019t work (and other mental health myths)",
            "date": "2022-08-07T10:00:40Z",
            "content": "There can be little doubt that public attitudes to mental health have already turned a corner. Just consider the sheer number of public figures \u2013 from Robbie Williams and Lady Gaga to Baroness Davidson \u2013 who have opened up about their struggles. According to one analysis of English newspapers, the number of articles stigmatising mental illness roughly halved between 2008 and 2016, while those challenging that stigma roughly doubled over the same period. And that seems to be having a positive impact on day-to-day experiences of prejudice \u2013 people with mental illness now report markedly less discrimination from family, friends and colleagues compared to just a few years ago. Despite this progress, some myths about mental illnesses are still widely shared, including false claims about the efficacy of treatments. Here are six of the most prevalent beliefs, and the truth behind them. Mental illnesses are overdiagnosed Let\u2019s begin with the idea that people are mistaking everyday distress for a clinical disorder. The claim is a favourite of TV personalities and newspaper columnists, who periodically claim that the increased focus on mental health is reducing people\u2019s self-reliance, so that they turn to medical interventions, rather than addressing the problems in their lives. In reality, there is very little hard evidence that overdiagnosis is the serious problem that some claim. Surveys of depression in western countries, for instance, have failed to reveal a large uptick in diagnoses as people jump on the \u201cmental health bandwagon\u201d. \u201cThe evidence points at stability,\u201d says Prof Johan \u201cHans\u201d Ormel of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. He suggests that doctors are just as likely to miss real cases as they are to wrongly diagnose someone who is simply experiencing transient distress. Time is a healer Related to the claim that doctors are medicalising everyday distress, there is the suggestion that many people who think they have depression should show more resilience and simply wait for time to heal their woes. If they are simply suffering transient sadness, after all, then the problem should surely go away on its own? To find out if this were really the case, researchers in Australia examined the data from 16 clinical trials, in which a control group of patients had been placed on a \u201cwaiting list\u201d before being given a treatment. They found that just one in eight of these patients went into remission as they waited for therapy, while the rest continued to show symptoms during the three-month period. Antidepressants don\u2019t work It\u2019s not just the diagnostic process that has inspired medical myths; the treatments used to help patients are often the subject of misinformation. One common belief is that a common class of antidepressant medications, called SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), are ineffective, and work no better than a placebo. The idea recently attracted widespread attention following the publication of a paper that raises some serious questions about the proposed mechanism of these pills. SSRIs, which include Prozac, were thought to address a \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d in the brain, by correcting levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin that is thought to be involved in mood regulation, among other functions. The recent paper, however, examined the evidence to date and concluded that there was no clear link between levels of serotonin and depression. But there are many other ways that they may help relieve symptoms \u2013 by reducing inflammation, which is another potential contributor to depression, for example. Importantly, a recent meta-analysis in the Lancet, considering multiple clinical trials, confirmed that SSRIs are effective at relieving depression. While they do not work for everyone, they are about 50% more likely to produce a response than placebo pills. In the words of Prof Cathryn Lewis of King\u2019s College London and Prof Andrew M McIntosh of the University of Edinburgh, the clinical benefits are now \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d. \u2018Happy pills\u2019 simply numb people\u2019s feelings Other myths concern side-effects. You will see many articles, for example, claiming that antidepressant pills \u201cblunt\u201d people\u2019s emotions. There is a seemingly good basis for this idea: many patients do report concerns that their medications have muted life\u2019s ups as well as its downs, resulting in numbed feelings. Until recently, however, few studies had interrogated the causes of the emotional blunting, and it now seems that the feelings of numbness may be a residual symptom of depression. It makes sense: depression is often accompanied by apathy and an inability to feel pleasure. The SSRIs have taken away the more salient feelings of hopelessness \u2013 but they don\u2019t necessarily increase positive emotions and motivation, says Prof Guy Goodwin of the University of Oxford, who conducted the recent study: \u201cThe feeling of emotional blunting is real, but it isn\u2019t caused by the drugs.\u201d Mental illness makes people more creative Perhaps the most persistent myth has been the idea that mental suffering is a source of artistic genius \u2013 from Virginia Woolf to Kanye West. But any evidence supporting the link between creativity and mental illness is extremely tenuous, says Prof James C Kaufman at the University of Connecticut. \u201cHistoriometric\u201d analyses, for example, have plumbed the biographies of notable artists. While these studies seem to suggest that mental illness is more prevalent in creative personalities, any post-hoc diagnoses, based purely on a text, have to be treated with great caution. \u201cThey are not super objective,\u201d says Kaufman. \u201cVery few creativity researchers believe there is a strong connection.\u201d And the idea that mental anguish may inspire great art certainly shouldn\u2019t be grounds for avoiding treatment for a serious conditions, he says. Schizophrenia is untreatable Despite the changing attitudes to other mental illnesses, schizophrenia is still subject to a huge amount of stigma, says Marjorie Wallace, the founder and chief executive of the mental health charity SANE. \u201cSchizophrenia is still a \u2018forgotten illness\u2019 because it has been squeezed out of all these anti-stigma campaigns, which have emphasised stress, depression and anxiety.\u201d This means that most people have only a vague understanding of the condition, despite the fact the lifetime prevalence is around 1.5% in the UK. One big misconception is that schizophrenia is simply \u201cuntreatable\u201d. With the right medications and talking therapies, however, 45% of people with schizophrenia go into remission after one or more psychotic episode, while 35% show mixed patterns of remission and relapse. The belief that there is no chance of recovery can be a cause of great despair for people who have been diagnosed with the disease, and their families. (The campaigner and film-maker Jonny Benjamin famously described the diagnosis as feeling like a life sentence.) In general, earlier interventions are more effective. But a chronic lack of resources in the health service means that many people with schizophrenia fail to get help in the first stages of a crisis, says Wallace, which reduces their chance of recovery. They may be turned away from hospitals or psychiatric facilities, and often it will be police officers who end up dealing with the patient. The escalation of their condition in these cases only adds to the perception that it is impossible to treat, yet the person may have fared far better if they\u2019d had earlier access to treatment.

            "content": "Final-year pupils awaiting their A-level results next week will feel they have got an \u201cunfair deal\u201d if they miss out on university places due to a crackdown on grade inflation, according to teachers who have shared their fears about the impact on students\u2019 mental health. Julie Richardson, the headteacher of Verulam school in St Albans, said her pupils would be \u201cfrustrated\u201d if predictions from the University of Buckingham of a 10% fall in A and A* grades materialise next week. The \u201cCovid generation\u201d of year 13 students have experienced two years of disruption, including the 2020 U-turn over their GCSE results \u2013 when the government agreed marks should be awarded by teacher assessments after the use of an algorithm led to almost 40% of predicted grades being downgraded. \u201cThat was remedied but that did cause significant strain on year 11s at the time. That won\u2019t be forgotten, so they will feel incredibly hard done by if [they receive lower grades] next week,\u201d she said. \u201cMy biggest concern when it comes to our students, if results are 10% lower, is the impact that could have on their mental health and wellbeing. They\u2019ve already been through significant stress at GCSE.\u201d Although there have been no lockdowns this academic year, there has still been disruption due to staff taking time off to recover from Covid and the stress caused by the pandemic. Richardson said her school \u2013 like many others \u2013 had significant issues with staffing, including having no religious education teacher for a long period. While her staff will be on hand to advise students on how to go through clearing if they miss their university place, she said many would be disappointed. \u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult for young people when they\u2019ve got their heart set on going to a particular institution. It\u2019s quite hard to get them to understand that there are other options and that it\u2019s not a completely lost cause.\u201d Maija, a teacher at a state school in Portsmouth, said she was feeling \u201cvery nervous\u201d for her pupils next week. \u201cAll the offers my students have received are for really high grades and it\u2019s really difficult to say right now what\u2019s going to happen. My hope right now is that the universities will be flexible in their offers.\u201d She said four of her students who were not expecting to meet their offer conditions were already planning to take a year out and apply again next year, which is unusual in her school. She felt some pupils had underperformed relative to their potential because online learning did not reach the same standard as in-person lessons and they had been deprived of exam experience in their GCSEs. \u201cI know a lot of teachers did their best. I did my best, but the content I delivered isn\u2019t comparable to what you can do face-to-face. Even the best students said they switched on the lesson and then they switched off. It\u2019s very difficult to follow. They had a full timetable and a lot of learning was lost,\u201d she said. \u201cI think most of them, if you spoke to them, would say they had an unfair deal. On the other hand, they\u2019re all in the same position. Most of them do understand that it\u2019s not their fault, but some life choices were taken away by this.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-16T17:30:12Z",
            "content": "At first sight, Denizen looks like another rural noir. Some bookshops place its red dirt cover in crime. Others in literary fiction. Some have called it a gothic thriller. It doesn\u2019t really matter where it goes, such is the arresting nature of its content. It was the sixth manuscript in three years for the young author, James McKenzie Watson. He knew Denizen was dark, but he wrote it for himself. He had begun writing as a form of therapy because he was a troubled child. Then it won the Penguin Literary prize in 2021 for new Australian authors and it became clear this deeply personal story resonated with others. McKenzie Watson lives in Dubbo in regional New South Wales, where he works as a nurse in oncology, but he is also trained in emergency nursing. The 29-year-old grew up about 150km away in the country town of Coonabarabran. He struggled at school and describes his childhood self as a sensitive boy who could not find his tribe. In Denizen, he has created Parker, a nine-year-old boy in a country town. Parker fights with his parents, his school and himself. He suspects there is something wrong with his brain. The book opens with Parker as a new father \u2013 an experience that sends him on a well-worn path back to his childhood. That emotional journey coincides with a camping trip back in his home town with old friends. There begins a cleverly written story that reads like an emotional autopsy, shining light on the big issues: mental health, parenthood, inequity and Australia\u2019s enduring rural myths. Like life, Denizen is contradictory; equal parts savage and empathic. \u201cI think the emotional truth at the core of Denizen was that I felt very, very acutely as a child and teenager and I didn\u2019t know how to sit with that. And I felt that there was something very wrong with me in terms of how intensely I felt,\u201d McKenzie Watson says. \u201cI look back at that and realise it\u2019s not normal for a nine-year-old to feel so intensely that they want to die as opposed to continuing to live.\u201d James describes his own mental health without flinching. He was a \u201cdestructive and self-harming teenager\u201d. He felt as if he was in pain most of the time. One of his great pleasures was amateur film-making, but his school attendance slipped and he finally left in year 11. In a town of 2,000 or so, it was hard to find mental health support and this is one of the themes he hopes readers take away from Denizen. As a result of that lack of support, his mother, father and brother bore the brunt of his behaviour. \u201cIt must have been harrowing for my family to go through because they love me so intensely and could see that I was just actually on the brink of self-destruction. \u201cAnd I think the guilt and shame that I feel about how much I put them through is where the emotional authenticity and the plot of Denizen comes from, even though the specifics of the narrative are entirely different.\u201d During a telehealth consultation, a psychiatrist made the pivotal suggestion to check into a mental health unit six hours away in Sydney. The teenager recognised it might be the circuit breaker he needed to begin recovery. He moved three months later. \u201cI think I probably would have died if I stayed in the bush much longer. I am sure that is true for a lot of people.\u201d He says the treatment worked, but there were a \u201crocky\u201d few years after that. While he was recovering, he lacked direction and it was a mental health nurse, who was also a talented musician, who suggested nursing might be a good way to support McKenzie Watson while he pursued creative work. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Given his history, it may seem odd that McKenzie Watson has returned to a country town. Yet he remains \u201cpowerfully drawn to the bush\u201d, particularly the visceral nature of the landscape. He says he would have ended up back in a rural place with or without nursing, because a lot of his \u201cheart and soul was out there\u201d. \u201cI came away from the bush with a lot of grief and guilt and distress for what my teenage years were like. \u201cI think part of it was a sense of unfinished business that wanted to go back and just spend more time there and work through my feelings about the bush, that part of the world.

            "date": "2022-08-31T23:01:38Z",
            "content": "The Nao robot looks more like a prop from a low-budget sci-fi film than the cutting edge of medical research. But a study found that children felt more comfortable confiding in the child-sized, quizzical-looking humanoid than when responding to mental health assessments with their parents, in some cases disclosing information that they had not previously shared. The team, from the University of Cambridge, say the findings suggest a wider role for robots in assessing children\u2019s mental health \u2013 although they said that they would not be intended as a substitute for professional mental health support. \u201cThere are times when traditional methods aren\u2019t able to catch mental wellbeing lapses in children, as sometimes the changes are incredibly subtle,\u201d said Nida Itrat Abbasi, the study\u2019s first author. \u201cWe wanted to see whether robots might be able to help with this process.\u201d In the study, 28 children aged eight to 13 took part in a one-to-one 45-minute session with the 60cm-tall humanoid robot, called Nao. The robot, which has a child\u2019s voice, and, started with an ice-breaker chat and fist-bump to create a friendly atmosphere. It then asked questions about happy and sad memories over the last week, administered a questionnaire on feelings and mood and also a questionnaire used in diagnosing anxiety, panic disorder and low mood. Children whose responses on traditional questionnaires suggested they could be experiencing mental wellbeing problems, gave more strongly negative responses when answering the same questions with the robot and some shared information that they had not disclosed when responding to in-person or online questionnaires. Children may view the robot as a \u201cconfidant\u201d, allowing them to divulge their true feelings and experiences, the scientists suggested. One of the parents, observing the session through a mirrored window, told the researchers they had not realised their child was struggling until hearing them respond to the robot\u2019s questions. And previous research found that children are more likely to share private information, such as their experiences of bullying, with a robot than an adult. \u201cWe think that when the robot is child-sized it\u2019s easier to relate to the robot as a peer,\u201d said Prof Hatice Gunes, who leads the Affective Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory at the Cambridge. By contrast, she said, children might respond to parents or psychologists with \u201cwhat they think is expected of them rather than what they think is true\u201d. Gunes suggested that in future, robots could be used in schools to screen children for mental health problems, allowing children to get support at an earlier stage. Prof Farshid Amirabdollahian, an expert in human-robotic interaction at the University of Hertfordshire, who was not involved in the work, said there was growing evidence to support the use of robots in supporting mental healthcare provision. \u201cChildren tend to show a very positive attitude to interactive technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want robots to replace people but they seem to be very good tools for breaking the ice.\u201d The findings will be presented on Thursday at the 31st IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication in Naples."

            "date": "2022-08-21T13:44:21Z",
            "content": "Boris Johnson has said he will not introduce any new measures to deal with the cost of living crisis. Big spending decisions are being delayed until his successor as prime minister is in post. However, the result of the Conservative leadership election will not be announced until 5 September. In the meantime, a major increase in the regulated energy price cap, which puts a ceiling on gas and electricity bills, is due to be announced this Friday. It is forecast to rise from just under \u00a32,000, to \u00a33,600 a year for the average household. While the nation waits to hear whether any further help is coming, the Treasury is working on a menu of options. Here we outline the main ideas, and assess the political and economic impact of each one. Targeted help for the most vulnerable The most limited option for the Treasury is to direct additional help for households to those on the lowest incomes, many of whom are already in fuel poverty and struggling even before the bill increases come in this winter. More than half of British households, 54%, will be in fuel poverty by October and more still in January. The most targeted way of getting money to the most vulnerable is via increases in universal credit and pension credit. Liz Truss has also promised to reverse the national insurance rise \u2013 though many poorer households were not affected by that because the last cost of living intervention by Rishi Sunak as chancellor. Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent: This is the most likely level of support Truss is prepared to offer, citing the cost of the package from Sunak announced earlier this year and with the need to fund her promised tax cuts. She has called it \u201cGordon Brown economics\u201d to have a high tax burden and then high amounts of state help. But such a route would mean starting her premiership with tax cuts that benefit the wealthy and some additional aid for the poorest \u2013 meaning the majority of working people get very little. MPs are worried that is not a sound electoral strategy. Richard Partington, economics correspondent: Charities are calling for the existing \u00a31,200 energy support payment for 8 million households on means-tested benefits to be doubled. There is a strong economic case for such targeted support because poor families spend more of their budget on essentials \u2013 such as energy and food \u2013 than richer households, leaving them the most exposed to the inflation shock. The Resolution Foundation estimates a \u201ccost of living\u201d inflation rate for the poorest of 1.5 percentage points higher than for the richest. Double the fuel discount from \u00a3400 to \u00a3800 Sunak announced earlier this year that eligible UK households would receive a \u00a3400 discount to help with energy bills from October. Officials have been looking at the potential for people to receive additional support, perhaps up to \u00a3800, because forecasts for price rises are now considerably higher. The discount is easier to administer but somewhat of a blunt instrument because more well-off households will benefit from the discount. Jessica Elgot: This looks more like the kind of package Sunak would back but Truss has said that she favours giving targeted support rather than increasing the \u00a3400 grant for every household, and her allies including the chief secretary to the Treasury, Simon Clarke, have been disparaging about the entire \u00a3400 scheme \u2013 though have said they would not cancel it. Richard Partington: The case against universal support is that many wealthier households saved money during the pandemic while working from home, with the Bank of England estimating about \u00a3180bn of \u201cexcess savings\u201d. With inflation the result of demand outstripping supply, some economists say putting more money in the pockets of those who can afford to keep spending will pour fuel on the inflationary fire. However, others say the scale of the energy shock requires more people than usual to receive support. Scrapping VAT on energy bills This measure, which was first proposed by Labour, is another option being worked on to reduce bills. VAT on domestic energy is charged at a rate of 5% and it would save a typical consumer \u00a3154 over the year, and cost the exchequer about \u00a34.3bn initially. Removing VAT would help those who face the biggest rise in their energy bills \u2013 those who consume the most. Jessica Elgot: Sunak rejected this as chancellor but has made it a key part of his policy offer as a Conservative leadership candidate. This was widely pilloried by the Truss campaign as a screeching U-turn, making it difficult for her to adopt it in No 10 without losing face. But it has the advantage of enabling a new PM to talk up the measure as a \u201cBrexit freedom\u201d. Richard Partington: One consequence of higher energy bills is that the Treasury will rake in more than expected from the VAT charged on them. Giving some of this back to struggling families therefore makes sense. However, Sunak had previously worried that it would be difficult to put the tax back on again in future, which could cause trouble for the government\u2019s budget deficit amid weaker economic growth and rising spending pressures. A new windfall tax Nadhim Zahawi as chancellor has been candid with energy firms about the option for an expansion of the windfall tax on oil and gas companies announced by Sunak in May. Truss has said she is opposed to windfall taxes though Sunak has not ruled it out if he wins \u2013 though that seems unlikely. Extending the levy could raise \u00a34bn, providing some much needed leeway for the government to help with energy bills. Labour has said the existing windfall tax could be tightened to remove the option for energy firms to claim tax relief on more than 90% of the levy if the money is reinvested. Jessica Elgot: There were raised eyebrows in both leadership camps when Zahawi started talking up the potential for a windfall tax. Truss and her likely future chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, are staunchly opposed to the tax, believing it makes Britain an unpredictable place for investment. Truss has also said profit is \u201cnot a dirty word\u201d. But there is mass public anger about extraordinary profits, which Zahawi has alluded to, so it may be an unpopular stance to defend them. Richard Partington: Continued high energy prices have helped the world\u2019s five biggest oil companies to bumper profits of nearly \u00a350bn, lining shareholders\u2019 pockets at the expense of consumers. This shows a clear case for a bigger windfall tax. However, chopping and changing the plan could undermine the argument that the policy is a one-off, potentially leading firms to reassess their investment plans. Scrapping the price rise and absorbing the costs This is the plan that is gaining momentum, backed by Labour and the Lib Dems, so it would be unusual if the Treasury was not beginning some preliminary work on the possibility. It would involve freezing the energy price cap at its current level of just under \u00a32,000 a year rather than allowing it to rise in line with global wholesale gas prices. Labour says the plan would cost just under \u00a330bn, although that\u2019s on the assumption that it would apply only for the next six months \u2013 so it may cost much more in the long term. Jessica Elgot: Both candidates have ruled this out, despite overwhelming public support for the measure, which is backed by 85% of Tory voters. However, given past experience of the Tories dismissing and then adopting popular cost of living policies, it is not impossible this one could seem appealing in the cold light of day in September. Richard Partington: There are clear pros and cons. A universal cap could halt headline inflation from rising further, potentially saving the government money on inflation-linked borrowing. However, it would have a hefty price tag and need to be in place for a year (inflation is based on the 12-month change in consumer prices). Free-market economists argue it would destroy price signals; incentivising energy use, rather than lower consumption and investment in insulation. It would also benefit rich and poor alike. Deficit fund for suppliers to cover fuel price rise The idea has been suggested by the boss of ScottishPower that the government could set up a deficit fund to cover the difference between what people pay and how much it costs to supply their homes with gas and electricity. The fund could be underwritten by the government, or a willing financial institution, and repaid over a 10 to 15 year period to smooth out the costs. Suppliers would be expected to use the period the scheme was in place to focus on investments in green energy while policymakers delink electricity prices from gas. Jessica Elgot: This could be a way for Truss to U-turn on freezing prices while claiming it is a way to boost investment and get better value for taxpayers\u2019 money. But it would still require vast sums which she has said she is not prepared to spend \u2013 and that would be on top of additional billions of spending commitment she has made on tax cuts and defence. Richard Partington: Spreading energy bills over a longer time frame would ease some of the pain today, helping the economic outlook in the short-term. However, it would build up costs for the future, and would ultimately be a cost ultimately borne by consumers rather than the state. If prices stay high, it would mean higher bills for households in future. However, it could help smooth the transition, rather than having cliff-edge moments each time the Ofgem price cap is updated."

            "date": "2022-08-04T22:41:16Z",
            "content": "It\u2019s often said that Westminster exists in a bubble, deaf to life outside the M25. But if that was ever true, SW1 now looks positively on the money compared to the massed ranks of Conservative party members. The Bank of England\u2019s doomsday forecast on Thursday \u2013 inflation rising to 13%, a long grim recession, rising interest rates and plummeting living standards \u2013 only confirmed what everyone involved in politics had been afraid was coming for months. But what were Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak asked as they roamed the country? Whether they\u2019ll bring back grammar schools. How they\u2019ll fight a \u201cwar on woke\u201d. Whether Boris Johnson was shabbily treated. Meanwhile, neither candidate has demonstrated the sense of urgency you\u2019d expect from someone applying to lead Britain through a full-blown national emergency. The gravity of the moment has somehow passed the whole contest by. Sunak has come closest to acknowledging reality by arguing that cutting taxes now \u2013 the answer the Tory faithful always reach for, whatever the question \u2013 is unaffordable. Truss has sunnily told them what they want to hear, even suggesting at Thursday night\u2019s Sky News hustings that this kind of recession isn\u2019t inevitable, whatever the Bank says. As a result Sunak has become the \u201cactually it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that\u201d candidate, struggling to explain without sounding patronising that if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Anyone who remembers how that ended for remainers in 2016, or Hillary Clinton up against Donald Trump, will have some insight into why Truss has been wiping the floor with him. But she\u2019s also a better player of Conservative internal politics. Sunak did the right thing for his country and his party by moving against Johnson, but alienated a significant number of Tories who have subsequently convinced themselves Johnson could have somehow staggered on. Truss has merrily attacked Johnson\u2019s government over everything from lockdowns to tax policy but because she stood by him in those final days, still isn\u2019t seen as disloyal. But if Sunak was ever to have his moment, a chance to stop her runaway bandwagon, this is it. At the height of the banking crash in 2008, with not just the Tories but Labour rivals nipping at his heels, Gordon Brown bought time by growling that this was \u201cno time for a novice\u201d in No 10. In a crisis, people become risk-averse. They seek leaders who know what they\u2019re doing. Sunak is an ex-chancellor who has already navigated one once-in-a-lifetime crisis; Truss is a far less battle-hardened former chief secretary to the Treasury. She is the bolder but riskier choice for many Tories and while so far she has emphasised the boldness, this week the risks bubbled to the surface. Thursday\u2019s interest rate rise significantly raises the cost of borrowing, on which her economic plans depend. She was forced to scrap her own regional pay policy after being accused of inflicting a pay cut on the north. At the Sky hustings, she insisted that disowning her own policy was somehow an example of her honesty and straightforwardness. But a gimlet-eyed Kay Burley (never underestimate Kay Burley) gleefully listed all the things Truss once said she believed in \u2013 remaining in the EU, mass housebuilding, Britons going to fight in Ukraine \u2013 and has since renounced. Arguably the toughest question Truss faced was from the audience member who snapped: \u201cWe\u2019re having this election because of poor judgment and trust. Why should we trust your judgment?\u201d The first question to Sunak, however, was whether he should just throw in the towel given how badly it\u2019s going. Things have reached the stage where merely dragging himself out of the dressing room for another mauling must take some doing. But his answers were punchier, more confident than usual; asked why he turned on Johnson, he reminded the audience of the Chris Pincher scandal and effectively challenged them to defend it. He not only said Truss\u2019s plans would worsen the crisis but accused her of making a mistake \u201cwhich I am just going to correct\u201d by suggesting that taxes, not inflation, were the cause of Britain\u2019s ills. Will her supporters call that mansplaining? Maybe, but if so we need a new word for what happens when men are actually right. Interestingly the studio audience, at the end of the night, voted for Sunak. The Conservative party of 2010 or even 2015 would have picked him over Truss. But the members who would have been most drawn to him then are also those most likely to have quit the party now, driven away by the Brexit Sunak himself backed and the post-truth politics it spawned. Are there enough of them left? We\u2019ll have to wait until September to find out. What this country can\u2019t wait another day for, however, is someone to get a grip on the economic horrors to come. Right now, that seems terrifyingly elusive.

            "date": "2022-08-23T11:54:31Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s factories are bearing the brunt of the slowdown in the economy as higher costs, weaker demand and supply bottlenecks combine to send output plunging. Two separate snapshots of industrial activity showed a decline in manufacturing activity \u2013 part of a Europe-wide trend exacerbated by the economic fallout from the war in Ukraine. The monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index from S&amp;P/Cips found manufacturing output at its weakest level since the early stages of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. Other than the fall suffered during the Covid lockdown, the decline from 48.9 to 42.4 between July and August was the quickest since the global financial crisis in 2009. A reading below 50 indicates contraction rather than expansion. Modest growth in the UK\u2019s much bigger service sector prevented the overall measure of private-sector activity dipping below 50, but the drop from 52.1 to 50.9 left the composite index at its weakest in 18 months. The eurozone\u2019s overall PMI fell from 49.9 to 49.2 in August, also the lowest in 18 months. Annabel Fiddes, economics associate director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: \u201cThe UK private sector moved closer to stagnation in August, as mild growth of activity across the service sector only just offset a deepening downturn at manufacturers. \u201cWaning customer demand amid the weaker economic outlook, and shortages of both staff and inputs, were reported to have hit goods producers hard, with firms registering the quickest drops in output and new work since May 2020. Excluding the initial phase of the pandemic in early 2020, the reduction in manufacturing output was the quickest seen since the start of 2009. Meanwhile, the service sector registered the weakest increase in activity since the recovery began in early 2021.\u201d The CBI\u2019s industrial trends survey showed that in the latest three months manufacturers\u2019 order books shrank and output fell for the first time since February 2021. The employers\u2019 lobby group said the mood in industry had become gloomier in recent months amid expectations that there would be no pickup in output in the months ahead. Alpesh Paleja, a CBI economist, said: \u201cFrom rising prices to bottlenecks in supply chains, manufacturers continue to operate against a background of high input costs and significant operational delays. When coupled with an oncoming economic downturn, it is not surprising to see orders and activity ebb away as we move through the year.\u201d In addition to rising energy bills, manufacturers are also braced for further increases in interest rates from the Bank of England. The City expects official borrowing costs, currently 1.75%, to reach 4% by next spring."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s cost of living crisis is set to get much worse. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.75% and forecast that inflation would spike at 13% by the end of the year. It also said that Britain would experience a prolonged recession and living standards would drop by 5% in the next year or so, the biggest fall since records began. This comes after 15 years of stagnant living standards: the poorest fifth of households experienced zero growth in average household incomes between 2005 and the start of the pandemic. The energy price cap, just over \u00a31,200 in 2019, is now forecast to reach \u00a33,600 in the autumn; rising energy costs account for around half of the inflation rate. It will leave families on low incomes unable to meet basic housing, heating and food costs and many parents facing existential choices around how to house and feed their children. Russian president Vladimir Putin is responsible for the global energy price shock that is driving up inflation everywhere. As a result of the war in Ukraine, global gas prices have spiked as Russia has cut supply to Europe via the Nordstream 1 pipeline. Putin has threatened further consequences if the west imposes more sanctions. But the UK, forecast to have the lowest growth of any wealthy nation next year by the IMF and OECD, has been left particularly exposed. We have barely any gas storage capacity as a result of government decisions and the economy has suffered from a long-term crisis of productivity. Productivity growth dropped significantly after the 2008 financial crisis and has never recovered. The sluggish growth in the decade that followed was propelled instead by consumer spending, fuelled by resurgent house prices. A decade of public spending cuts has left low-paid people further exposed as tax credits and benefits have been eroded, public services unable to meet demand and widened regional inequalities. Brexit has compounded these structural economic issues. What Britain needed after the financial crisis was a plan to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on the housing bubble and towards investment- and export-led growth. Those countries that have enjoyed tentative recoveries after Covid have done so as a result of exports. Britain, on the other hand, has seen business investment and exports contract as a product of Boris Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit. One estimate has suggested that the economy is already 5% smaller than it would have been had the UK remained part of the single market and customs union. This amounts to billions of pounds lost each year from household incomes and public services\u2019 budgets. It is an indulgence Britain can ill afford, a decision that will be looked back on as a ludicrous act of economic self-harm at a time of global economic crisis. Many people will be experiencing a financial crisis by the autumn, facing defaulting on their mortgage or being unable to pay their rent. Yet the prime minister and the chancellor are now abroad on holiday. Meanwhile, the contest between Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss to become the next Conservative leader continues to play out. One will be selected by Conservative party members on 5 September and will become responsible for leading the country through this economic emergency. Yet their proposed solutions are geared towards attracting the support of fewer than 200,000 members rather than the pressing needs of the country. Sunak remains a deficit hawk who would leave the NHS, schools and other public services horribly exposed to the real spending cuts that would result from double-digit inflation and who, it last week emerged, has boasted about diverting funding away from the country\u2019s poorest areas. Truss has pledged to loosen fiscal policy by \u00a330bn, but by handing out tax cuts that will disproportionately benefit the more affluent and do nothing for people who do not earn enough to pay tax. She has explicitly said she is opposed to the targeted measures so desperately needed to ease the burden for low-income families. The Bank of England\u2019s rate rise, which aims to lower inflation by increasing unemployment and suppressing growth further, risks making an already painful recession even worse. The Conservative party is failing the country. It matters not that Boris Johnson is a caretaker prime minister or that MPs are caught up in a bitter leadership contest. The government urgently needs to introduce a new support package before the autumn, which increases levels of universal credit and targets more one-off support at low-income households. It must also increase spending on public services in the face of the inflationary cost pressures that will amount to significant real cuts, with huge implications for the NHS, social care, schools and the police. It should increase the revenues from the windfall tax Sunak introduced on North Sea oil extraction while he was chancellor, by eliminating the generous tax breaks he included. Britain is facing an economic storm that could be even worse than the economic impact of Covid. Yet the Conservative government is missing in action. If the new prime minister fails to act on the first day they take office, voters will not be quick to forgive them."

            "title": "Kenya election: shifting alliances and economic woe to fore",
            "date": "2022-08-08T04:00:02Z",
            "content": "Kenyans are heading to the ballot box on Tuesday after a campaign season marked by a shift in ethnic alliances and two big-ticket issues: the cost of living crisis and high unemployment. The race pits presidential frontrunners Raila Odinga, the former prime minister, and deputy president William Ruto against each other in a hotly contested race. Polls place Odinga in the lead. Odinga has run for the presidency four other times in races that were just as tight. This time, however, he\u2019s going in backed by an unexpected ally: his longtime political rival, President Uhuru Kenyatta. The two united after a public handshake in 2018, signifying an end to their long political hostility. The handshake between the two leaders, who come from Kenya\u2019s legacy families, took the nation and the pair\u2019s supporters by surprise. Odinga and Kenyatta are from the Luo and Kikuyu ethnic communities, which have long been on opposing political sides. In Kenya\u2019s ethnic-driven political landscape, their alliance is seen as the card that could make Odinga fifth-time lucky, with Kenyatta\u2019s backing expected to draw in a part of the Kikuyu vote. But observers are unsure whether the alliance can bridge a decades-long ethnic divide. \u201cA big number of Kikuyus revolted against the alliance,\u201d says Gabriel Muthuma, a political analyst. \u201cThe only way we will be able to know whether it worked or not is by what it will produce at the ballot.\u201d The handshake left Ruto \u2013 Kenyatta\u2019s former ally and successor hopeful \u2013 sidelined. The president and his deputy eventually fell out for reasons that are not clear, ending a once-favoured bromance revelled in by the public when the pair rode into power in 2013, earning them the name \u201cUhuRuto\u201d. But by the time of their fallout, Ruto had already garnered some favour in the Kikuyu-dominated Mount Kenya region. He broadened that influence by selecting a running mate from that region. Analysts say that his choice, Rigathi Gachagua, a businessman and outgoing member of parliament, holds significant sway in the region. Their campaign was dealt a blow, however, after he was recently ordered by the country\u2019s high court to forfeit 202m shillings of his wealth (\u00a31.3m) for being linked to corruption. Odinga, on the other hand, nominated Martha Karua, former justice minister and longtime politician, as his running mate. She is the first woman to be nominated as running mate on a major political ticket, and if elected would be Kenya\u2019s first female deputy president. Karua is also from the Mount Kenya region, but is said to hold less sway there. Analysts say that Karua\u2019s selection as running mate, however, gave his campaign a boost among other voter demographics, including women, civil society and urban, educated Kenyans. Beyond the redrawing of ethnic alliances, a tough economy has invited unprecedented public attention to the presidential candidates\u2019 economic agendas. \u201cThe political class have had to step up after recognising that this time around, it won\u2019t just be about ethnic Balkanisation,\u201d says Kenyan economist Ken Gichinga. Food prices have skyrocketed across the country, fuelled by global disruptions to the food supply chain caused by the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. Kenyans are also bearing the brunt of the country\u2019s soaring 8.6tn shilling (\u00a359bn) public debt through highly taxed goods. Many households are struggling, and one Gallup poll showed that seven out of 10 Kenyans reported having faced food insecurity in 2021. \u201cThe economy is a very big pillar in these elections, and it may be a gamechanger,\u201d says Muthuma. Annan Okenye, who is running for a country assembly seat in Pipeline, Embakasi, one of Nairobi\u2019s most populated neighbourhoods, says that the country\u2019s economic situation has made life unbearable. The greengrocer and street hawker, who ran a shoestring campaign on donations and meagre savings, spent six years trying to put himself through university on a daily income of about 400 shillings (\u00a33) a day. Just as he closed in on his dreams of becoming the first graduate in his extended family in 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic hit, forcing him to quit school and look for work. With formal employment elusive, he found himself where he\u2019d began: eking out a living at his market stall. \u201cKenyans have been ravaged by economic conditions that make many of them believe that their best lives are behind them,\u201d says Gichinga. Ruto, a street hawker in his early years, clawed his way into the ranks of the political elite and significant fortune. He positioned himself during his campaigns as a \u201chustler\u201d who could understand the struggles of the ordinary Kenyan. He pitted himself against \u201cdynasty\u201d candidate Raila Odinga, but as the references to \u201cdynasties\u201d and \u201chustlers\u201d took off some lawmakers labelled it inflammatory, saying it was fanning class tensions and fuelling dangerous divides in a country with extremely high inequality. Ruto\u2019s \u201cbottom-up\u201d campaign messaging has gained ground with small business owners like market stall holders and motorcycle taxi drivers, says Okenye. The model pledges to empower those at the bottom of the economic pyramid by, among other things, providing a 50bn shilling (\u00a3346m) \u201cHustler Fund\u201d to support small businesses. \u201cMarket people feel like he\u2019s a part and parcel of them. I get to hear what people say, as a politician, and he scores high on bottom-up,\u201d says Okenye, who says he is not aligned with either candidate. Odinga, on the other hand, has proposed a healthcare-for-all plan called BabaCare. He\u2019s also pledged that each vulnerable household will get 6,000 shillings (\u00a340) every month as a form of social protection. Economists say that cash transfers can be effective, but Odinga has not been clear on how the billions of shillings needed to implement it would be raised. \u201cWill it be through taxes, and if so, are Kenyans ready for higher taxes? Will it be through borrowing? If so, aren\u2019t Kenyans already debt-fatigued?\u201d asks Gichinga. Going into the elections, voter expectations for change are low. A resident of the Kayole Junction neighbourhood in Nairobi, Noah Dulo, says: \u201cOur debt is now at nearly nine trillion. So the worry is that whichever leader we elect, there are just not enough resources to run the country.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2022 because if elected, Martha Karua would become Kenya\u2019s first female deputy president, not Kenya\u2019s first deputy president as an earlier version said."

Corn cob stock is particularly sweet, aromatic and intense, and perfect for taking all kinds of dishes to the next level. My favourite way to use it is in a Colombian-style chicken-and-potato one-pot meal called sancocho de pollo: to make a meal for four, boil four chicken thighs in a litre of stock made with cobs saved in the freezer from the last time you ate corn. Add a fresh corn cob cut into rounds, a sliced onion, two cubed sweet potatoes and some chopped coriander, and, after an hour, once everything is tender, it\u2019s ready to serve. Corn cob stock Spent corn cobs harbour masses of flavour that is a shame to waste.

            "content": "The \u201cmeme-stock\u201d reprise of 2022 took another beating on Monday as shares in the movie theatre chain AMC, one of the companies driven to dizzying heights by a social media-fueled investing frenzy last year, dropped sharply again as investors soured on its recent rally. Shares of the world\u2019s largest theater chain dropped 31% after the UK-owned rival Cineworld, operator of Regal cinemas in the US, warned of potential bankruptcy filing as it struggles to cut debts that soared during the pandemic. The performance of the two cinema companies is strikingly different. AMC shares are up over 150% since the end of 2019 and it has been able to borrow $1.8bn, while Cineworld\u2019s stock is down 99% over the same period and it has struggled to raise additional funding. Separately, shares in the retailer Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond \u2013 another stock favoured by meme investors who chased returns on Reddit and other social media platforms \u2013 have fallen more than 40% since Thursday, days after stock in the struggling housewares retailer more than doubled. The fall came after investor and \u201cmeme-lord\u201d Ryan Cohen announced plans to sell off his position. CNBC calculated that Cohen made as much as $59m from 9.8% investment in the company \u2013 a stake that has led thousands of online investors to follow his lead. Since 2015, stock in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond has dropped from $77 a share to around $10. Both companies, along with the game retailer GameStop, are strongly associated with the meme-stop frenzy of 2021. The return of their popularity among small investors, perplexing to many, came as US markets have enjoyed a 20% rise in value since June when high inflation and rising interest rates triggered fears of an impending recession. The fall in meme-stock values came as more than 90% of stocks on the S&amp;P 500 posted losses on Monday. The index was down 1.6% by mid-morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 438 points. The market swings indicate that investors are attempting to gauge the US economy as the Fed raises interest rates into a maze of conflicting signals, including record high inflation, low unemployment, poor consumer confidence, resilient consumer spending and weakening economic activity."

            "date": "2022-08-13T07:00:34Z",
            "content": "Just like double denim, it seems some trends never really die. After flaming out in spectacular fashion last year, the meme stock frenzy of 2021 has made a return. In recent weeks the share price of troubled retailers Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and GameStop and the cinema chain AMC Entertainment have once again soared. This may sound all too familiar. Last year all three companies were at the center of a meme-fuelled \u201crevolution\u201d in investing as Gen Z and millennial investors piled into the stocks having apparently spotted something Wall Street had missed. GameStop shares rose from $3.25 in April 2020 to $347.50 in late January 2021 \u2013 a rise of 10,692%. Many small investors then felt like they had hedge funds and big institutional investors on the run. Indeed, the frenzy came close to bankrupting a number of hedge funds. It didn\u2019t last. By February the meme stock craze was unraveling and older heads were smugly smiling again. Now the tide has turned again. Between late July and early last week, shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, a home goods store that has decidedly seen better days, had more than doubled. Movie-theatre operator AMC Entertainment saw a similar bounce, while GameStop \u2013 the struggling US computer games retail company and perhaps the most baffling of that era\u2019s stock darlings \u2013 bumped up close to 25%. None of the three are considered winning bets in any conventional sense, and the rise in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond came days before its stock was downgraded by the ratings agency Baird. \u201cThis frenzied move has been driven by non-fundamentally focused market participants,\u201d Baird analyst Justin Kleber wrote in a note to clients. This time, the battle may not be between younger day-traders flush with government stimulus checks and informed by online forums like Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets. Although social media chatter surrounding the stocks has increased, dueling hedge funds are also playing a part. \u201cNon-fundamentally focused market participants\u201d is an apt way to describe traders at the height of the pandemic meme-stock frenzy. That time around the Reddit board was filled with memes about traders with \u201cdiamond hands\u201d \u2013 unafraid to take bets against conventional wisdom. This time too there are parts of Reddit\u2019s investment community that are all in on the rally. Last week a user under the name of TheDude0007 explained on WallStreetBets that \u201cthis run is just beginning\u201d and name-checked Ryan Cohen, founder of e-commerce company Chewy and chair of GameStop. Cohen, known as a \u201cmeme-lord\u201d for his influence over investors, was one of GameStop\u2019s original boosters before taking on its chair. His meme-filled posts are scrutinized by his fans \u2013 even when they are almost impossible to decipher. In February last year, he tweeted a picture of a McDonald\u2019s ice-cream cone alongside a frog emoji, sending traders on a search to decode its meaning. GameStop\u2019s stock finished the trading day up 104%. But according to an analysis by Bloomberg, the meme-stock return is evidence that they have unusually explosive properties. So many investors have bet that the shares in all these companies are worth zero, argues Jared Dillian, editor and publisher of the Daily Dirtnap. But the fact is that \u2013 as with any asset \u2013 they are worth what people will pay for them. As a result, stock prices of troubled companies can explode upwards at any moment if investors will pay more. \u201cOn Wall Street they call trying to profit despite this as \u2018picking up nickels in front a steamroller\u2019,\u201d he writes. According to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3 Partners, the movement of the meme stocks is not coming from the Reddit board traders but from larger retail investors and the meme-traders are in a sense along for the ride. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a fundamental reason for a lot of these price moves,\u201d Dusaniwsky told the Guardian. \u201cA lot of it is fomo [fear of missing out] on the rally.\u201d One clue that this rally is different comes from the last is Robinhood. Once the favorite trading platform of meme traders, Robinhood is in trouble. As stock markets fell and Covid stimulus cash dried up, so did Robinhood\u2019s business. Its number of active users has dropped from 22 million to 14 million, and its stock trades at around $10 after cresting at close to $60 a year ago after it went public. Last week, Robinhood announced it would lay off 23% of its staff after it posted a 44% decline in revenues. CEO Vladimir Tenev said in a blogpost that the company had been hit by \u201cdeterioration of the macro environment, with inflation at 40-year highs accompanied by a broad crypto market crash\u201d. This time the meme-stock trading is spread across larger trading platforms, including Charles Schwab and E*Trade. That said, Robinhood \u2013 and Reddit \u2013 still offer clues to why these fundamentally troubled companies are hot again, Dusaniwsky said. \u201cWith Robinhood you get an idea of what that cohort of traders are doing and that\u2019s a good proxy for the rest of the market,\u201d said Dusaniwsky. \u201cIt\u2019s really the same type of people \u2013 the same mentality. These guys are momentum traders, they\u2019re not looking at the underlying fundamentals. They\u2019re looking at riding the tide in and out, and it\u2019s worked because the market is trending. The problem comes when the market doesn\u2019t trend, and you get taken out to sea.\u201d"

            "content": "French lawmakers are to definitively adopt a range of new measures to help struggling households cope with rising energy and food prices, as well as an updated budget that will pay for France to renationalise the electricity company EDF. The final vote on Thursday is a formality and follows weeks of heated debate and negotiations at the national assembly, where the French president, Emmanuel Macron, no longer has an absolute majority. The package features \u20ac20bn in inflation relief \u2013 including pension rises and a cap on rent increases \u2013 and had been promised by Macron as growing inflation erodes wages. Ministers argued that France had already been the most generous in Europe in helping households cope with the cost of living crisis \u2013 including by capping gas and power price increases, which allowed it to cushion the inflation rise better than its neighbours. Annual inflation for the 19 eurozone countries has reached a record 8.6%, followed by a huge increase in food and energy costs affected by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But in France, annual inflation is estimated to be lower \u2013 running at about 6.5%. Macron\u2019s centrist grouping suffered big losses in legislative elections in June, winning the most seats in the national assembly but falling about 40 seats short of the absolute majority needed to pass laws. Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally, meanwhile, greatly increased its seats to become the biggest single opposition party. The hard-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s France Unbowed party also increased its seats and is now the biggest leftwing party in a broad coalition known as the Nupes, which includes the Socialists and Greens. The cost of living measures were the first test of Macron\u2019s ability to strike cross-party compromises in the face of a strong opposition and often with angry debates that ran into the evening and weekends. The measures will increase pensions and some welfare payments by 4% and set a cap on rent increases at 3.5%. Amid criticism of long-stagnant wages in the public sector, civil servants will receive a 3.5% pay rise. The state-funded fuel price rebate worth 18 cents a litre will be increased to 30 cents in September and October. Private companies will be encouraged to offer employees an annual tax-free bonus of up to \u20ac6,000, raised from a previous limit of \u20ac1,000. France is to renationalise EDF, one of the world\u2019s biggest energy providers, in response to the energy crisis aggravated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWe must have full control over our electricity production and performance,\u201d the prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, had told parliament. Macron also promised to scrap the TV licence fee. The legislation has been backed by members of Macron\u2019s centrist alliance, the rightwing party Les R\u00e9publicains and the far-right National Rally. The leftwing Nupes coalition criticised the measures as not going far enough and widely voted against the bill in the first vote on Wednesday. After the definitive vote on Thursday, the parliamentary session will end this week for both houses of parliament, the national assembly and the Senate. French lawmakers often resume debating legislation in September, in a special session. But this year the parliament will sit again in October, to allow time for the government to prepare legislation it expects to be harder to pass, including on immigration, which will be the focus of a parliament debate in the autumn."

The central causes of Vaaderpass\u2019s misfortune is a 240% increase in the price of unroasted green coffee and a 20% surge in the cost of the gas he uses to roast his imported beans.

The latest figures, published on Thursday, showed that Estonia has an annual inflation rate of an astounding 23.2% \u2013 the highest in the eurozone, vastly outpacing the average of 8.9%. Vaaderpass is inevitably part of the cycle. He has raised his price to supermarkets by 25% over the last eight months and he fears he will have to do so again this year.

No emotions, you know. The joke is that when Covid hit and people couldn\u2019t meet, it was a lucky day for Estonians. Celebration day.\u201d Part of the explanation for the lack of a political backlash may be that Estonian salaries have been on a sharp upward trajectory for several years and the economy recovered well and quickly from the Covid pandemic, leading to labour shortages and higher wages. Voters are relatively relaxed about a temporary period of higher prices, it is suggested. But there is also an understanding in Estonia, once part of the Soviet Union and containing a large Russian-language minority, that the war in Ukraine is the source of many of their problems, says Kaspar Oja, an economist at Estonia\u2019s central bank. \u201cIn many countries people have gone to the streets even with lower inflation rates, but here people are quite calm,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course there are people who complain, but most people understand that the increase in energy prices is broadly related to the war and they understand what it is behind it.\u201d There is, however, something percolating, he admits. Estonia\u2019s standout inflation rate is also due to some peculiarities in its economy, and potentially some governmental missteps that may be seized upon. Recent pension reforms have allowed people to dip into their nest eggs to spend now rather than later. A large proportion of consumers are on energy deals that are linked to the market price rather than fixed. And the newspapers are increasingly full of complaints about how Estonian energy producers, with relatively low production costs, are racking up high profits as they raise their prices in line with other regional producers in the Nord Pool exchange via which electricity is shared and prices set. Estonia remains a relatively poor country within the EU, and so energy and food prices make up an oversized part of consumer spending. \u201cLately there have been more complaints about the electricity because they can see companies have benefited from it,\u201dOja says. \u201cConsumers are paying more but Estonia has energy producers which are benefiting pretty well and people are not happy about that. That is why the government is planning to have a universal electricity service for small consumers, mostly households, to take effect from October. The electricity companies will have to sell electricity according to the production costs.\u201d It is also, however, starting to be noticed in the media how little the prime minister, Kaja Kallas, who has spoken of the need to keep tight control over spending, has offered in terms of mitigation on energy prices. Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute For International Economics, says the latest inflation figures show that the more interventionist governments, such as the French, with the lowest annual inflation rate in the eurozone at 6.8%, and the Italians (8.4%), have done best in shielding their voters from the inflationary pressures. \u201cThe underlying issue is that the Estonians haven\u2019t done very much,\u201d Kirkegaard says. \u201cThe French have been largely insulated because of the nuclear production and they haven\u2019t had nearly the same pass through. This is unlikely to last because if you look at the forward energy pricing in France, it is higher than most of the rest of the Europe as the fear is that the river levels are so low that they will have to take the nuclear plants off the grid because they will not have the water to cool them. \u201cBut the government has done quite a lot. They have nationalised EDF [the country\u2019s largest energy company] fully and it will do what the government wants. They have also raised public benefits to low-wage people by up to 10% to basically try to mitigate the cost of living for low-income groups.\u201d The link between lower inflation rates and intervention should not be lost on Boris Johnson\u2019s successor in the UK, Kirkegaard suggests. According to data released by the Office for National Statistics this week, consumer price inflation in Britain jumped to 10.1% in July, the highest since February 1982, making it the first major economy to see price growth hit double digits. \u201cMy sense is that the UK when it comes to fiscal transfers or direct government help hasn\u2019t done much compared to the continent, certainly southern Europe and France and the pass through of costs has been much larger,\u201d he says. \u201cI would say the UK is one of the least activist major governments.\u201d It is yet to be seen whether British voters will be as relaxed as those in Estonia. In central Tallinn, Lisa, 34, a psychotherapist picking up some fruit at the covered Balti Jaama Turg market, says she is buying fewer cosmetics and opting for secondhand clothes over new ones, but is more concerned about the fate of Russians and Ukrainians than that of the Estonian economy. \u201cI feel sad about that rather than angry,\u201d she says. Anastasia Kralle, 21, and Elizabeth Liiv, 17, serving at the OA Coffee cafe, agree. \u201cI have noticed the price of eggs keeps on going up, every time I go to the shops,\u201d laughs Kralle. \u201cYes, everything is more expensive, but I don\u2019t want to be angry. I am not blaming anyone, we all know why it is happening.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-12T13:15:07Z",
            "content": "Bosses at the outsourcing firm Amey celebrated a \u00a3500m jump in revenue and \u00a392m rise in profits even as it clashed with workers over a below-inflation pay offer that a union says \u201cwould shame Scrooge\u201d, a video reveals. The self-described \u201clargest strategic supplier to government\u201d employs thousands of staff on outsourced contracts and has been fighting calls from staff, including school cleaners, caretakers and bin collectors, to be paid at the same level as those employed directly by councils. The company said in May that such demands could lead to pay rises of up to 30% that would be \u201cfundamentally unsustainable\u201d, but a video briefing accidentally shared online appears to tell a different story. In the clip, obtained by the Guardian, Amey\u2019s chief executive, Amanda Fisher, who was paid more than \u00a3750,000 last year, and the chief financial officer, Andrew Nelson, praise each other on an outstandingly good start to the year. \u201cThe high level numbers show that the turnover of the core business was some \u00a32.4bn,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cMore remarkable is that this is almost \u00a3500m or 25% more than we had expected when we put the budget together, and as Amanda said all of the businesses exceeded their original targets.\u201d Nelson goes on to say that profits, or earnings, are likely to be \u00a392m higher than expected. Amey employees who clean and maintain schools in Glasgow are preparing to go on strike in order to achieve pay parity with those employed by the local authority. In the video, Fisher says the company is \u201ccommitted to paying the real living wage\u201d and will continue to do so. Amey is paying the Glasgow cleaners \u00a39.90 an hour, the minimum required under the real living wage deal. Fisher said most staff would be awarded a 4.21% pay rise, far below the rate of inflation, which hit 9.4% in June and which the Bank of England forecasts will rise to 13% later this year. John Slaven, an organiser for Amey\u2019s union, the GMB, said: \u201cAmey\u2019s treatment of cleaners and janitors and maintenance workers is Dickensian. Amey is a multinational company raking in vast profits but is driving our members into poverty with a pay offer that would shame Scrooge. \u201cOnce again Glasgow city council need to look at the labour practice of Amey. They are the contract holder and ultimately responsible for the exploitation that is going under their noses.\u201d A GMB union spokesperson said: \u201cAmey is getting rich off the back of public money. But the working people who clean our children\u2019s schools and collect our rubbish are left out of pocket. It isn\u2019t right that our money is being used to help Amey to higher profits, when its workers are struggling in the cost of living crisis. We need Amey to pay its workers fairly.\u201d The video, which is from a briefing from February and was unintentionally made available publicly via Microsoft Teams, was deleted after the Guardian approached Amey for comment. When first approached, a spokesperson for Amey said: \u201cWe don\u2019t recognise the figure for Amey\u2019s finances you have quoted. Our most recent published accounts, for 2019 and 2020, show we made a loss.\u201d When sent the video, a second Amey spokesperson said: \u201cThe figures provided in the internal video from earlier in the year was an early forecast of a variance in revenue to budget regarding specific parts of the business. They were not a forecast for Amey as a whole.\u201d Amey has also been in dispute with workers who collect bins in the Elmbridge and Surrey Heath boroughs of Surrey, who claimed they were paid \u00a33 an hour less than council staff doing similar jobs. In a third statement on Friday, the company announced it had reached agreement with the bin workers in Surrey, adding: \u201cWhere we are in pay negotiations, we have made strong offers, in line with inflation, which maintain salaries at or above rates for other similar roles.\u201d Amey offered the Surrey bin collectors a 10% pay rise, or 25% for bin lorry drivers. The outsourcer, which employs about 15,000 people in the UK, is owned by the Spanish conglomerate Ferrovial. An Amey spokesperson said: \u201cWe benchmark all the maintenance employee salaries in Glasgow to ensure we are offering a package that reflects the rest of the industry and also Glasgow city council. This exercise has demonstrated that we pay our people above average. Specifically, we understand that our cleaning population receive the same salary as those working for the council.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-14T10:00:06Z",
            "content": "Inflation is the top challenge facing small businesses this year, according to a report issued by the National Federation of Independent Businesses this past month, with a whopping 91% admitting that rising prices are having either a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d impact on their companies. The US Chamber of Commerce says that nearly seven in 10 small businesses have raised prices to cope with inflation, which is also considered their \u201cdominating challenge\u201d. Sixty-five percent of small business respondents in a Goldman Sachs study said rising input costs have forced them to raise the price of their goods and services this year, with almost 80% saying the economy has gotten worse over the past three months. If you\u2019re having inflationary challenges in your business, you\u2019re not alone. However, there is some good news for you. And, unfortunately, some bad news. The good news is that inflation appears to be plateauing. Prices for core materials such as industrial chemicals, construction supplies, copper, aluminum, plastics, packaging, iron and steel and even agriculture products like fertilizer and processed feeds are either leveling off or not rising quickly. The price of lumber products has dropped significantly from their highs last year. Oil prices are down 30% from earlier this summer. This is partly because the world\u2019s supply chain is beginning to show signs of normalcy (port traffic in Long Beach, California, is down to 84 ships off the coast, significantly less than during the pandemic, mass lockdowns in China have ended and the Baltic Dry Index, a key measure of freight costs and shipping demand, has fallen almost 30% since the beginning of the year). There\u2019s also been a general slowdown in the world\u2019s demand for goods which, while not great, has certainly affected prices. It\u2019s doubtful whether the Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 regardless of the positive impact it should have on our climate and healthcare problems \u2013 will have much impact on inflation. Penn\u2019s Wharton School says that the bill would actually increase inflation until 2024 and has \u201clow confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation\u201d. But the good news is that government spending has significantly decreased and the Fed is no longer pouring fuel on the fire. This brings me to the bad news: we are still struggling with rising costs and the situation isn\u2019t going to change any time in the near future. Producer prices \u2013 at 11.3% as of June \u2013 are still up well over historical levels and, because the Producer Price Index is considered a leading indicator, that means that ultimately consumer prices will remain at elevated levels for months to come. It took a year and half for inflation to reach these levels (consumer prices began rising in March 2021 and hit 7% by the end of 2021, well before Russia invaded Ukraine). It\u2019s going to take at least that long for it \u2013 hopefully \u2013 to return to the more sustainable levels we\u2019ve seen in the past. It may take even longer. That\u2019s because there are lots of obstacles in the way of significantly taming inflation. Some economists, notably former treasury secretary Larry Summers, believe the Fed\u2019s moves aren\u2019t aggressive enough. Further pressure from the Ukraine war could elevate energy and food prices, particularly as we head into the winter months. More Covid cases in China could once again disrupt the supply chain. Even if the world economy begins to grow significantly again in the near future, that growth could put strains on our fragile supply chains and disrupt pricing for many of the core materials we buy. So what to do if you\u2019re a small business? You leverage your accounting and customer relationship management systems to stay on top of your product lines, customer profits and margins. You raise prices discriminately and carefully. You communicate frequently with your customers and you expand your relationship with your suppliers. You constantly hunt for other sources of supply. You try to lock in long-term contracts and, like so many big brands, practice \u201cshrink-flation\u201d, where you charge the same price for a little less product. You keep your inventories under control, your overhead low and your cash balances as high as possible. You do all of this because, even though it has probably peaked, inflation isn\u2019t going away any time soon. It\u2019s no longer 2012, when rates hovered around 2%. It\u2019s 2022, and you can expect the prices of your core materials to remain significantly elevated for at least the next six to 12 months. My best clients are always planning ahead. So plan for that."

            "date": "2022-08-04T22:25:28Z",
            "content": "Liz Truss has claimed her tax cut plans could avert the looming recession, after the Bank of England forecast 13% inflation and a downturn lasting more than a year. In a televised leadership interview, the foreign secretary was challenged about gloomy projections made by the Bank on Thursday, as it increased interest rates by 0.5 percentage points. \u201cWhat the Bank of England has said today is, of course, extremely worrying. But it is not inevitable,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can change the outcome, and we can make it more likely that the economy grows.\u201d Truss and her Conservative leadership rival, Rishi Sunak, were each grilled by a studio audience made up of Conservative members, and Sky News presenter Kay Burley. Sunak, who appeared after Truss, stepped up his criticisms of her \u00a330bn plan for unfunded tax cuts, claiming it would lead to \u201cmisery for millions\u201d. \u201cThe lights on the economy are flashing red, and the root cause is inflation. I\u2019m worried that Liz Truss\u2019s plans will make the situation worse,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we just put fuel on the fire of this inflation spiral, all of us, all of you, are going to just end up with higher mortgage rates, savings and pensions that are eaten away, and misery for millions.\u201d But Truss insisted that \u201cnow is the time to be bold, because if we don\u2019t act now, we are headed for very, very difficult times\u201d, reiterating her policies of reversing the recent increase in national insurance contributions and halting planned increases in corporation tax. Asked what more she would do to deal with rocketing energy prices, Truss cited her existing policy of temporarily halting green levies that add about \u00a3150 to household bills. Truss rejected the idea of a windfall tax on the bumper profits of energy companies. \u201cShareholders are not all men in suits sitting in offices. There is no such thing as free money, and I just think we\u2019ve got to be very careful if the UK gets a reputation for arbitrarily taking money in tax.\u201d Sunak also said he would do more as prime minister to help hard-pressed consumers through the winter ahead. He recently announced a pledge to cut VAT on energy bills \u2013 a policy he had previously rejected. When asked about the recession, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the tax burden that is causing the recession. That\u2019s simply wrong. What\u2019s causing the recession is inflation. That\u2019s the root of the problems, not just here, but in America and elsewhere.\u201d Truss was challenged robustly by two audience members \u2013 over the public finances, and her botched announcement of pay cuts for public sector workers. Jill of Tunbridge Wells accused Truss of failing to take seriously enough the need to balance the books. \u201cThe one thing Margaret Thatcher believed in was sound money,\u201d she said. \u201cFifteen percent interest rates, I remember those days. I had to pay a mortgage of 15%, are we going back to that level again?\u201d Truss replied \u201cno\u201d, and went on to stress the risks of high taxes for economic growth. Another audience member, Tom from Gateshead, pressed Truss on the plan for regional pay boards which she withdrew earlier this week. \u201cWhy should we trust your judgment?\u201d Pointing out that it would have meant lower pay for public sector workers in his local area of Newcastle, he added: \u201cWill you apologise because it was actually quite offensive?\u201d Truss replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything to be ashamed of, of saying publicly that this is not working as I wanted it to work, and therefore, I have changed the position on it.\u201d Sunak was accused by an audience member, Steven, of plotting to overthrow Johnson, and resigning last month in a cynical bid to win the leadership. Citing the scandal of former Conservative whip Chris Pincher, who was promoted by Johnson despite multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, Sunak insisted \u201cthat was a serious ethical question that the government was on the wrong side of, again, and I couldn\u2019t defend it\u201d. By contrast, Truss gave a staunch defence of Boris Johnson. When Burley said she had \u201cstood shoulder to shoulder with a man who has betrayed the office of prime minster\u201d, Truss insisted: \u201cYes he made mistakes, that\u2019s absolutely true; he said sorry for the mistakes he made \u2013 but I think it\u2019s completely wrong to characterise him in that way.\u201d Challenged about Truss\u2019s broad backing among cabinet members and former leadership contenders, including his former boss Sajid Javid, Sunak stressed the Conservative grandees who have supported him, including former leaders William Hague and Michael Howard. In a show of hands after the show, Sunak was the clear winner among the audience of Conservative members. After the debate, Sunak announced a new housing policy, saying he would introduce a build out levy, which would charge developers a fee if they are given planning permission and fail to build the promised homes. He said the policy would help to promote homeownership \u2013 though he has also promised to tighten planning restrictions on green belt land. \u201cI will do whatever it takes to build housing that is affordable and plentiful, while protecting the green belt \u2013 spreading the joy and fulfilment of homeownership, building the next generation of Conservative voters and keeping Labour out of power,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Almost six months after Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine, the extent of the damage to the European economy is becoming clear. The red lights of recession are flashing. The eurozone\u2019s big four economies \u2013 Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 have all had their growth forecasts for 2023 downgraded by the International Monetary Fund, as a combination of the war and higher interest rates put a brake on activity. In the UK, inflation is above 10% for the first time in 40 years as households struggle with rising energy bills. The Bank of England forecasts inflation will peak above 13% in autumn after a fresh increase in energy costs, while the economy will fall into a lengthy recession. While Britain is contending with additional pressures from Brexit, the impact of soaring energy prices, supply chain disruption, shortages of workers and drought are also hitting the rest of Europe. Analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit say the pain could go on for some time, because countries must wean themselves off Russian hydrocarbons, and building up renewables as an alternative will take time. \u201cIn the near term we expect a recession in Europe in the winter of 2022-23 as a result of energy shortages and sustained elevated inflation\u201d, the EIU said. \u201cThe winter of 2023-24 will also be challenging, and so we expect high inflation and sluggish growth until at least 2024.\u201d Here we assess the chances of recession in the EU \u2013 and Russia. Germany Europe\u2019s largest economy is in the centre of the storm, as the energy crisis, months without rainfall, and a breakdown in global trade batter its manufacturing base. Economic growth slowed to stall speed in the second quarter and is likely to turn negative in the coming months. \u201cIt will need an economic miracle for Germany not to fall into recession in the second half of the year,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski of the Dutch bank ING. \u201cThe fact that the entire German economic business model is currently up for renovation will also weigh on growth prospects in the coming years.\u201d Russia supplied more than half of Germany\u2019s gas in 2020 and about a third of all oil. Since the outbreak of war, the Kremlin has throttled supplies, blaming technical problems for a fall in volume through the key Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Drought and scorching temperatures have caused a sharp fall in water levels on the Rhine, a key transport route for Germany\u2019s dominant industrial sector. Water levels have fallen below the critical 40cm mark, preventing barges from being loaded to full capacity. Some routes have been cancelled, causing delays for chemicals firms and other manufacturers in industrial heartlands. Factories along the shores of the Rhine dependent on water for cooling have also faced problems, while coal shipments to power plants \u2013 which had been earmarked for keeping the lights on \u2013 are likely to be disrupted. In response to the energy crisis, Berlin will impose a gas levy for households, due to come into effect from October and lasting until April 2024, which is designed to spread the higher wholesale cost between households and industry. The government has put in place an energy support package worth more than \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn), including a \u20ac300 lump sum for workers, extra support for those on welfare, cuts to petrol and diesel taxes and discounted \u20ac9 bus and train tickets. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has also promised a fresh package of financial support. Chances of recession (out of five) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 France France should be better insulated than many other European nations, thanks to its large nuclear energy sector, which accounts for just over 70% of its electricity generation, but it has been struggling with serious faults at ageing reactors. Although in a less parlous position than Germany, the eurozone\u2019s second-biggest economy could still face damaging power cuts this winter. GDP rose in France by 0.5% in the second quarter, lower than in other nations across the continent, with domestic consumption notably weak. The government has put in place an emergency support package worth \u20ac20bn, including tax cuts at petrol pumps, while capping an increase in regulated electricity prices at 4%, a policy helped by state ownership of the energy giant EDF. Chances of recession \u2022 \u2022 Italy The Italian economy has performed much more strongly recently than its big eurozone rivals, notching up growth of 1% in the second quarter. But like Germany, Italy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has the added complication of being thrown into a fresh bout of political uncertainty after the resignation of Mario Draghi as prime minister earlier this summer. Opinion polls point to a change of direction from Draghi\u2019s technocratic approach following forthcoming elections. A rightwing coalition government that has been campaigning on a strongly nationalistic and protectionist economic platform is expected to win. Financial markets and the European Central Bank are already alive to the risks of investors demanding a higher interest-rate premium for buying Italian bonds. With Italy firmly in mind, the ECB announced a new financial instrument last month designed to prevent higher interest rates from having a disproportionately adverse impact on more vulnerable member states. In early August, Italy approved a new aid package worth about \u20ac17bn for consumers and businesses, in one of Draghi\u2019s final acts as leader. A tax cut on petrol and diesel, which had been due to expire this month, has also been extended to 20 September. Since the creation of the single currency almost a quarter of a century ago, Italy has been the weakest performing of the \u201cbig four\u201d, with living standards barely higher than at the end of the 1990s. It is benefiting this year from a boost to tourism, which accounted for 13% of its GDP before the pandemic. Chances of recession \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Spain Like every other country in Europe, Spain is affected by the war in Russia but of the big four it has the best chance of avoiding recession, despite soaring inflation. There are a number of reasons for this. Its economy went into the crisis in reasonably good shape and \u2013 like Italy \u2013 has been given an added boost by the surge in tourism after the pandemic. Tourism accounted for 12% of Spain\u2019s GDP before Covid and an even bigger share of employment. But Spain is much less reliant on Russian energy than Italy, and is already a big importer of liquefied natural gas from around the world. GDP rose by 1.1% in the second quarter and the IMF expects it to be the fastest growing of the big four next year. The government has put in place \u20ac16bn of financial aid and loans to help companies and households with soaring energy costs. Chances of recession \u2022 Russia Russia has suffered under the west\u2019s sanctions, plunging its economy into a deep recession and forcing the Kremlin to default on its foreign debts for the first time since 1918, though soaring energy prices have helped blunt some of the impact. Researchers from Yale University said last month that the west was crippling the Russian economy, although other experts disagree. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank, said that recent data did not point to such a \u201cstark conclusion\u201d. Russia\u2019s current account balance \u2013 measuring trade and investment flows \u2013 more than tripled to hit a record $167bn surplus in the second quarter, helped by high wholesale oil and gas prices swelling exports, while western sanctions led to a fall in imports. The proceeds have been a vital source of hard currency for Moscow, reflected in the rouble erasing losses seen since the start of the invasion. However, over the long run experts say Russia\u2019s economy will struggle with the loss of western technology and investment. \u201cOur best guess is that Russia is in a major but still far from catastrophic recession\u201d, Schmieding added.

            "content": "Liz Truss has used her latest pitch to the Tory party membership to warn against talking the UK into a recession, a day after the Bank of England forecast the economy will soon suffer a five-quarter recession. Speaking at the Tory party leadership hustings in Eastbourne, Truss suggested her plans for immediate tax cuts if she becomes prime minister could avert recession. She said: \u201cI know there are difficult forecasts out there, but forecasts are not destiny. And what we shouldn\u2019t be doing is talking ourselves into a recession. We should be keeping taxes low.\u201d She added: \u201cWe can create the British version of Silicon Valley. We can create real opportunities.\u201d During an appearance that was twice interrupted by climate activists, Truss also expressed support for fracking, as well as caution about the government\u2019s net zero target and a crackdown against Extinction Rebellion protests. To cheers from the audience she said: \u201cI want us to frack in parts of the country where there\u2019s local support, so that we can get the energy security we need.\u201d She was urged by an audience member to \u201cexamine the scientific group-think for net zero\u201d. Truss replied: \u201cWe do need to transition to net zero, but I want to do so in a way that doesn\u2019t clobber households and doesn\u2019t clobber businesses. That\u2019s why I\u2019d have immediate moratorium on the green energy levy, while we look at better ways of delivering net zero using private sector innovation and technology to deliver.\u201d After being heckled by climate activists Truss said: \u201cI will make sure that militant activists such as Extinction Rebellion are not able to disrupt ordinary people who work hard.\u201d Rishi Sunak was more enthusiastic about achieving net zero by 2050, but also cautious. He again said the only political issue his two young daughters asked him about was the environment. The former chancellor said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to let them down, first and foremost. You\u2019ve heard me talk passionately about the public finances, the borrowing and the debt that we leave for our kids and our grandkids. I\u2019m equally passionate about the environment that we live in, because we\u2019re Conservatives.\u201d He added: \u201cI do believe in our net zero target. I want us to get there in a measured way because there is no point in us racing there harder and faster than any other country because that will just both impoverish us.\u201d On the economy, the former chancellor said that unless inflation is under control, \u201cwe can kiss goodbye to winning that next election\u201d. Asked by the host and former Downing Street adviser Jimmy McLoughlin what his pitch to win a fifth term is going to be, Sunak said his first priority would be tackling inflation. He said: \u201cAs the Bank of England said, they are worried about inflation becoming embedded, then there\u2019s no hope that we\u2019re going to win that next election. Absolutely none. He added: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a grip of this thing and get a grip of it fast, then we can kiss goodbye to winning that next election. So the first thing to put ourselves in a position to win is to get through inflation and get through it quickly and not do things worse.\u201d Truss, the frontrunner in the race, was asked to identify Sunak\u2019s main strengths. She replied: \u201cHe\u2019s a very intelligent person. He\u2019s a very competent minister. And I would be very pleased that if I\u2019m successful that he would come with me in our team.\u201d Asked the same question of Truss, Sunak said: \u201cLiz is great at explaining Conservative values.\u201d Truss described her membership of the Liberal Democrats as a \u201cteenage misadventure\u201d, adding: \u201cSome people have you know, sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. I was in the Liberal Democrats.\u201d And she praised the outgoing prime minister, saying: \u201cBoris Johnson is hugely respected in Ukraine. He has a street and a croissant named after him and I don\u2019t think many international leaders have achieved that.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-04T15:29:34Z",
            "content": "The economic picture painted by the Bank of England of the years ahead was unremittingly grim: a long recession, high inflation, falling living standards. It would be hard to find a worse set of conditions for a government before a general election. Threadneedle Street was taking plenty of flak even before it announced its latest gruesome forecasts. It can expect no letup now, because the government will need to find a scapegoat for the misery to come. And there could be plenty of that. The fact that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee raised interest rates for a sixth meeting in a row came as no shock. More surprising was the downbeat nature of the predictions that accompanied the MPC\u2019s decision. Inflation is now expected to peak at 13.3% in October \u2013 its highest since September 1980 \u2013 and will still be close to 10% in a year\u2019s time. The economy will begin to contract in the final three months of this year and not start to grow again until early 2024. Living standards will fall by 5% over the next two years \u2013 a drop unmatched since modern records began in the early 1960s. Against this backdrop, the MPC pushed up interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 1.75%. Not only was it the biggest increase in the official cost of borrowing since 1995, it was also the first time the committee has raised rates while forecasting a recession. Eight of its nine members voted for a 0.5-point increase, on the grounds that the labour market remained tight and there was a risk of inflation becoming embedded. But the labour market is not expected to stay strong for long \u2013 the Bank thinks a recession, projected to last as long as those of the early 1980s and the late 2000s, will push unemployment from under 4% to well over 6% by 2025. Longer dole queues and higher interest rates will lead to a marked cooling in the housing market. The forecasts are based on two assumptions: that the financial markets are correct to think interest rates will peak at 3% and that there will be no further government support for struggling households. Both are questionable. Some analysts think the economy is so weak the Bank will stop tightening after one or two more rate rises. There will certainly be more help with energy bills this autumn, whoever is prime minister. Politically, the Bank has rarely been in a tighter spot. A year ago it thought inflation would peak at 4% but it has raised its forecast steadily ever since. Andrew Bailey, the Bank\u2019s governor, rejected criticism that the MPC had been asleep at the wheel and was now slamming on the brakes at exactly the wrong time. The Bank says higher energy prices, which alone account for half the 13% annual inflation rate, and global supply chain bottlenecks are responsible for most of the increase. Bailey said pain was inevitable but it would be even worse if the Bank allowed inflation to take root. The MPC\u2019s warning that it will be \u201cparticularly alert to indications of more persistent inflationary pressures\u201d means another half-point increase is possible next month. Both Conservative leadership contenders said the Bank\u2019s forecasts supported their economic plans: in Rishi Sunak\u2019s case, that bringing down inflation was the number one priority; in the case of Liz Truss, that tax cuts were needed to fend off recession. Truss, the frontrunner to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister, has been openly critical of Threadneedle Street. At the very least, she would order a review of the Bank\u2019s mandate \u2013 the legal obligation to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target \u2013 but she has been hinting at going further. For the first time since it was granted the freedom to set interest rates by Gordon Brown in 1997, the Bank\u2019s independence looks to be under threat."

            "date": "2022-08-12T10:29:20Z",
            "content": "Britain\u2019s recovery from the pandemic stalled in the three months to June when the economy contracted by 0.1%, according to official figures that revealed the weakening outlook for the UK, which is expected to enter a recession later this year. Exports fell and consumer spending contracted to push the UK closer to a long period of contraction that the Bank of England expects will stretch to the end of 2023. The dip in output in the second quarter followed 0.8% growth in the first quarter and was driven by the health sector \u2013 as Covid testing and the vaccine programme was wound down \u2013 and by retail, as household spending fell, according to the figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Economists had forecast a bigger fall in output of 0.2% in the second quarter. \u201cHealth was the biggest reason the economy contracted as the test-and-trace and vaccine programmes were wound down, while many retailers also had a tough quarter,\u201d said Darren Morgan, a director of economic statistics at the ONS. Gas and electricity drove an increase in production output in the second quarter, and construction rose, the ONS said. Hotels, bars, hairdressers and wedding venues also provided a boost to counter the downward trend after they benefited from the return of outdoor events and the extended holiday for the Queen\u2019s platinum jubilee. Business investment improved by 3.6% during the quarter. However, a turnaround in some parts of the private sector was too weak to prevent the economy from shrinking by 0.6% month on month in June, after 0.4% growth in May, which the ONS said was explained partly by the dent to manufacturing, construction and business services from the jubilee holiday, which led to an additional working day in May and two fewer working days in June. The Bank of England has forecast a modest bounceback in GDP in the third quarter to the end of September before a recession beginning in October that the central bank has predicted will last through 2023. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the contraction in the second quarter meant a recession had already begun, brought about by a collapse in consumer confidence that has caused households to curtail spending, and a decline in activity across the services sector. The cost of living crisis, as inflation heads towards 13% by the end of the year and energy bills soar, is expected to weigh heavily on household spending and pile further pressure on businesses already struggling with rising costs. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said that despite the fallout from the pandemic and high energy prices \u201cthe economy showed incredible resilience\u201d. He said he would be working with the Bank of England to bring inflation under control and \u201cgrow the economy\u201d, adding that the government had provided direct financial support to offset the worst effects of rising energy bills, \u201cincluding \u00a31,200 for 8 million of the most vulnerable households.\u201d James Smith, a research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cWhile the contraction in June partly reflects the timing of platinum jubilee bank holidays, the economy has started a difficult period on a weak footing. And with the Bank of England forecasting that inflation will rise above 13% in October, and that the economy will slip into recession in Q4, the outlook is bleak. \u201cThe first priority for the new prime minister will be to provide further targeted support to low- and middle-income households, who will be worst affected by the stagflation that already seems to be taking hold.\u201d Exports fell by 8% in June to reverse two months of consecutive gains, the ONS said. Trade fell with the EU and the rest of the world as the trend for British goods exporters to miss out on a 20% rise in global trade during the pandemic continued. William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK was about to enter choppier waters as major economies in Europe and the US began to suffer downturns. \u201cJune\u2019s trade data ended what was a strong second quarter with a damp squib,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are gathering economic headwinds which all UK goods exporters now face,\u201d he said, which revealed the risks of \u201cweakening, instead of stabilising, trade relations with the EU\u201d. He added: \u201cThere is now an urgent need for real delivery by the UK government\u2019s export strategy to support the growth ambitions of UK exporting businesses.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-28T10:00:25Z",
            "content": "For many women of color, the right to control one\u2019s reproductive destiny has always been about much more than the right to abortion. With the recent loss of the constitutional right to abortion in the US, some reproductive rights advocates are calling for a renewed focus on reproductive justice, a concept developed in the early 1990s by women of color. Reproductive justice stresses not just the right to abortion, but also economic, racial and environmental justice, along with other facets of social equality, as critical to true reproductive freedom. Dorothy Roberts is an internationally renowned scholar of race, gender, and the law at the University of Pennsylvania, who has dedicated her career to exposing attacks on Black women\u2019s reproductive rights dating back to slavery and persisting to the present. She argues that the supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v Wade validates what reproductive justice advocates have been arguing for years: that the mainstream reproductive rights agenda has been blind to how the state has overpoliced Black women\u2019s reproductive lives. Below, she discusses why the reproductive rights movement needs to bring reproductive justice out of the margins and into the center. You\u2019ve written about the reproductive justice movement, and your book Killing the Black Body is an important contribution to this cause. For those who are unfamiliar, could you explain your work and the movement? In the late 1980s and early 1990s, I began looking into the prosecutions of Black women who were pregnant and taking drugs. These prosecutions were racist and sexist in my opinion, and they were part of a long history of policing and penalizing Black women\u2019s reproductive choices, bodies and lives. This work on fighting the criminalization of Black moms and pregnant women during the so-called crack epidemic in the US prompted me to explore the numerous policies that were founded on vilifying stereotypes about Black mothers and blaming Black women\u2019s childbearing for a range of social ills, and then adopting punitive and villainizing actions. That\u2019s what inspired me to write Killing the Black Body. In 1994, while I was writing Killing the Black Body, a group of Black women met at a pro-choice conference and coined the phrase \u201creproductive justice\u201d to describe a holistic approach that puts Black women at the center and incorporates our experiences of having our childbearing decisions punished and devalued. While the mainstream reproductive rights movement focused on abortion, we expanded the definition of reproductive freedom to include not only abortion but also [freedom from] state interference. Reproductive justice includes the right to abort a pregnancy and also to raise a child in a safe and supportive community. The mainstream pro-choice reproductive rights movement, which is led primarily by white women, is associated with organizations such as Planned Parenthood, Naral Pro-Choice America, and the National Organization for Women. This movement has largely focused on the legal right to abortion, and reproductive justice has expanded on that. Because of this strategy, what kinds of things has the movement failed to notice or pay attention to? It overlooked the experiences of Black, brown and Indigenous women who have been sterilized, abused, or punished for bearing children. It overlooked welfare laws based on misleading impressions of so-called welfare queens, Black women who allegedly had babies to collect welfare checks but wasted the money. These stereotypes have led to welfare policies that discourage welfare recipients from having more children by reducing their benefits. Black women\u2019s resistance and fight for reproductive rights and health policies pushed me and other Black feminists in the US to challenge the white-dominated reproductive rights movement\u2019s \u201cchoice\u201d framework. This framework privileges the most socially advantaged people in society who have the wherewithal to make choices. It doesn\u2019t take into account social structures, power arrangements of race, class, gender, heterosexism, immigration status, religion \u2013 all of which shape one\u2019s ability to have reproductive autonomy. Together with other activists of color, we reframed how we should approach reproductive freedom, away from choice and toward social justice. This approach looks at the circumstances in which people give birth. High Black maternal mortality is a matter of reproductive justice. States that have passed or will soon pass abortion bans have the worst healthcare systems, the highest maternal mortality, especially Black maternal mortality, and the highest infant mortality. As a result of [the supreme court decision] Dobbs, we\u2019ll see increases in maternal mortality \u2013 deaths of pregnant people who intended to carry to term \u2013 because their health will be compromised. It includes ending police violence, abolishing prisons, and all the inhumane carceral approaches to meeting human needs that have a profound impact on one\u2019s reproductive life. Prisons are a major impediment in the United States to reproductive freedom. People who have had their children taken away by a discriminatory child welfare system that targets Black neighborhoods for family separation do not have reproductive freedom. To me, reproductive justice is inextricably linked to the fight against the prison industrial complex and the family policing system. Abortion is important, but not the only focus. But having said that, we also have to understand that bans on abortion are connected to all these other aspects of reproductive freedom. Reproductive justice activists have been pointing out these connections for decades. I believe the mainstream reproductive rights movement saw them late in the game, but they are painfully clear now. What should the movement do to survive? What concrete strategies would you recommend? Dozens of organizations around the country are focusing more on state and local legislation and courts to support reproductive justice. Some of the strategies we could employ include passing legislation that guarantees reproductive freedom and filing cases in state courts. Supporting or organizing efforts and organizations that try to help people seeking abortion, such as abortion funds and organizations that provide information to people seeking care, is just as important. Continuing to protest the aftermath of Dobbs and state legislators\u2019 efforts to restrict access to abortion care. All of these are efforts that we can make, in addition to learning about and participating in reproductive justice organizing in general. Who should own the movement now? On one hand, women of color organizing and the reproductive justice framework are more effective than the reproductive choice approach mainstream organizations use. On the other hand, I think we need collective efforts across multiple organizations and struggles. It\u2019s clear that the movement for reproductive justice must be aligned with movements for housing, abolishing the prison industrial complex, environmental justice, and economic justice, because all of those movements are essential to supporting freedom, including reproductive freedom. Movements seeking to limit or abolish the power of the criminal legal system and the prison industrial complex are relevant to opposing Dobbs\u2019 assault on reproductive freedom. People are already being arrested and imprisoned for stillbirths and miscarriages; that standard will be applied to abortions as well. Recognizing the interconnected nature of these challenges is essential. We should welcome reproductive justice activists\u2019 leadership as we build a more collective movement."

            "content": "France\u2019s justice ministry is under pressure to explain why it signed off on games inspired by reality TV at the country\u2019s second largest prison. The political row erupted after a 25-minute video of prisoners at Fresnes jail taking part in go-karting and other challenges in the prison courtyard appeared on YouTube. The prison games were called Kohlantess \u2013 a play on Les aventuriers de Koh-Lanta, a French reality TV show based on the Survivor format. The justice minister, \u00c9ric Dupond-Moretti, described the film as \u201cshocking\u201d and ordered an internal inquiry even though his ministry\u2019s communications department was reported to have approved the project and viewed the film before it was broadcast to ensure there were no security concerns. \u201cThe fight against reoffending involves rehabilitating [prisoners] but certainly doesn\u2019t involve go-karting,\u201d Dupond-Moretti tweeted. Le Figaro reported that approval for the event and the release of the film had been made at the \u201chighest level\u201d of the ministry, but officials told the paper: \u201cWhat we were presented with didn\u2019t mention go-karting; it talked of sporting challenges, skipping ropes,\u201d an unnamed staff member told the paper. The event is believed to have also been approved by the French prison authority. Jimmy Delliste, the prison governor at Fresnes, south of Paris, defended the event saying it was a \u201cfraternal occasion\u201d and thanked the organisers. The games raised \u20ac1,700 for charity, he said. \u00c9ric Ciotti, of the centre-right opposition party Les R\u00e9publicains, was among the most vocal in his outrage. \u201cOur prisons are not holiday camps where prisoners and guards make bonds of friendship,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a form of hypocrisy from the minister \u2026 either he was informed or he was not. He can\u2019t demand an inquiry if his office was informed. The minister has to explain. These images have shocked many French people and many victims,\u201d Ciotti told BFMTV. \u201cBehind every prisoner there is a victim and it\u2019s those victims I am thinking of.\u201d Fresnes was built at the end of the 19th century for about 1,700 prisoners. It is now believed hold more than 2,000 men and 100 women. During Germany\u2019s occupation of France during the second world war, the men\u2019s wing was taken over by the Nazis who tortured and executed members of the French resistance and British intelligence operatives. The American writer James Baldwin was held at Fresnes after being wrongly arrested for theft in 1949. A French prisons official said none of those taking part in the games had been convicted of murder or rape, and that the event had not cost taxpayers \u201ca penny\u201d. Enzo Angelo Santo, an independent producer who worked on the video, told BFMTV: \u201cObviously, as far as we were concerned, everything was approved. We would never have gone against [the] ministry of justice.\u201d The event was organised by a local man, Djibril Dram\u00e9, who is said to have organised several similar games in Fresnes for several years and set up a sports competition between police and youngsters in June. French media reported it had been sponsored by a halal fast food chain, Big M, and an online sports app, Omada."

            "content": "A British Muslim charity is attempting to break the world record on Saturday for the largest number of blood donations in one day, as NHS blood supply stocks are running low. The volunteer-led attempt is being led by Who Is Hussain, a social justice charity that is working with NHS Blood and Transplant, as well as the Imam Hussain Blood Donation Campaign, one of the country\u2019s oldest Muslim blood donation organisations. As part of the campaign, called #GlobalBloodHeroes, blood donation centres across the UK, and dozens of other centres in countries including Iraq and Thailand across six continents, will attempt to collect blood from 50,000 people. Donations began at a centre in New Zealand and will conclude in the US. About 600 people have already registered to roll up their sleeves and donate blood in centres across the UK. \u201cI tried to book myself in today and they haven\u2019t got any slots left,\u201d said Naz Shah, the MP for Bradford West, who visited a donation centre in Leeds. \u201cIt tells you how positive the campaign is going.\u201d Blood donations in the UK are especially lacking from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, who are more likely to develop high blood pressure, diabetes and some forms of hepatitis than white people, according to the NHS. Last year, less than 6% of NHS blood donors in the UK were from people from BAME backgrounds. Blood conditions such as sickle cell disease and thalassaemia most commonly affect BAME communities. Blood donors and recipients from the same ethnic background are more likely to match. Despite the number of Asian people giving blood increasing by 20% in the last three years, a shortage of BAME donors overall remains. \u201cI think we should encourage donations, especially for ethnic minority communities, because we\u2019re not the biggest of blood givers,\u201d said Shah. \u201cFrom a Muslim perspective, we\u2019re the largest charity givers. But do we see that when it comes to donating blood? There\u2019s all these conversations to be had.\u201d The #GlobalBloodHeroes campaign coincides with Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, which is especially significant for Muslims who commemorate the legacy of Hussain, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, who was massacred with his family 1,400 years ago after he refused to give allegiance to a corrupt leader seeking to succeed his father. Aimen Al-Diwani, 31, a volunteer leading donations at an NHS blood donation centre in Leeds, said this significant historical event, and the Islamic principle in which saving one life is compared with saving mankind, motivated his decision to volunteer for the campaign. \u201cI\u2019m inspired by the story of Hussain,\u201d said Al-Diwani. \u201cThrough that story, it\u2019s a way for us to be able to remember him through action by donating blood and taking the same story of self-sacrifice for humanity, in a simple and small gesture of just donating blood that takes less than an hour of your time.\u201d The NHS aims to have a six-day supply of each blood type. However, amid staff shortages at NHS donation centres and a shortage of blood donations because of the Covid pandemic, stocks are running low. NHS Blood and Transplant centres issued an urgent plea last month for people to come forward to donate. \u201cWe are at our most challenging moment in the pandemic,\u201d said Altaf Kazi, a representative for NHS Blood and Transplant. \u201cWe need people to donate over the summer to help recover blood stocks from four days to the usual six days. \u201cThere\u2019s now a huge rise in patients from ethnic minority backgrounds needing blood. We need more people like the amazing Who is Hussain donors to take that next crucial step to start saving lives.\u201d. With 36,000 people registered to donate blood around the world for the #GlobalBloodHeroes campaign, whether this global effort will succeed in breaking the world record will be determined in the next two weeks."

            "date": "2022-08-17T23:09:29Z",
            "content": "Florida Republicans intentionally targeted Black voters when they enacted new voting restrictions last year, the justice department said in a court filing on Wednesday. The department told a federal appellate court that a lower court had correctly evaluated claims of racial discrimination when it came to Florida\u2019s new law. In March, US District Judge Mark Walker blocked new restrictions on the availability of absentee ballot drop boxes, regulations for third party voter registration groups, and a ban on providing food and water to people standing in line to vote. The US court of appeals for the 11th circuit paused that ruling earlier this year while it considers an appeal from Florida officials. The justice department\u2019s allegation of racial discrimination is significant because the agency carefully chooses when to get involved in voting dispute litigations filed by private plaintiffs, and the department\u2019s voice carries significant credibility in court. After going largely quiet under Donald Trump, the justice department\u2019s voting section has filed challenges to voting laws in Georgia, Texas and Arizona, in addition to filing several briefs in other voting disputes. An argument in support of a finding of racial discrimination offers a significant legal boost to challengers of the case, though the challenge to the law faces an uphill battle at the deeply conservative 11th circuit. The justice department said it agreed with the court\u2019s findings that Florida lawmakers enacted those provisions knowing they would harm Black voters after the 2020 election in which turnout surged. The Florida law, the department said, violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting practices. \u201cThe district court\u2019s core factual findings are that, in the face of surging turnout in the 2020 election, the Florida Legislature responded by enacting provisions that impose disparate burdens on Black voters,\u201d DoJ lawyers wrote in their brief. \u201cWhich were chosen precisely because of those burdens to secure a partisan advantage. The court\u2019s findings of discriminatory intent are a permissible view of the record based on the entirety of the evidence.\u201d Florida lawyers dispute that the law is racially discriminatory. \u201cFacially neutral laws regulating drop boxes for vote-by-mail ballots, the return of voter registration forms, and activity at or near a polling place fall squarely within the state\u2019s power to manage \u201c[t]he time, places and manner of holding elections\u201d, lawyers representing the Florida secretary of state and attorney general wrote in a brief to the 11th circuit. \u201cIn concluding otherwise, the district court focused on the distant past and disparities rooted in evidence that was \u2018limited\u2019, \u2018unclear\u2019, \u2018not necessarily representative\u2019, and \u2018not statistically significant\u2019.\u201d In his March ruling, Walker also took the unusual step of saying the risk of racial discrimination was so severe, Florida needed to get approval from a federal court for the next decade moving for changes in its voting law. The 11th circuit also blocked that portion of his ruling while considering appeal. The justice department declined to weigh in on whether that remedy was needed, but suggested seeking further clarification from Walker."

            "content": "Pet owners could access free or subsidised veterinary care at public clinics under a reform proposed in Victoria by the state\u2019s Animal Justice party. MP Andy Meddick said the proposal to create a Medicare-like scheme \u2013 dubbed \u201cVeticare\u201d \u2013 would help make animal health care more affordable while also tackling a national vet shortage. The model \u2013 which is not fully costed \u2013 would see an annual fee charged to domestic animal owners who would receive a Veticare card. It would allow pensioners and concession card holders to bulk-bill vet care at new public clinics, while a means-tested subsidy would apply for other clients. Specialised wildlife hospitals would reduce the burden on vets to treat native animals for free, while vet nurses would be upskilled into nurse practitioner roles to free up vets to focus on more complex cases and surgeries. Speaking ahead of introducing a motion in the state\u2019s upper house on Tuesday, Meddick said the veterinary industry faced a workforce crisis, particularly in regional areas. \u201cWhat we\u2019re attempting to do is alleviate these stresses and fix the system,\u201d he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIf we continue to go down the path we\u2019re going down in just a few short years, it will cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, to reinvest in the sector and to bring it up to scratch because the public simply won\u2019t put up with not being able to take their animals to the vet or to have an incomplete wildlife system.\u201d Natasha Bassett recently left her job as a welfare and wildlife vet in Victoria due to burnout. \u201cI was doing one-and-a-half to two times the vet workload and had no time to reset. It became the new normal and was unsustainable. It causes you distress to know you cannot meet the demand,\u201d Bassett said. She said Medicare had \u201cinsulated\u201d people from the reality of healthcare costs. \u201cIf they were to see the true cost per procedure it may open their eyes a little bit,\u201d she said. Australian Veterinary Association president Bronwyn Orr welcomed the proposal but said there were other issues that needed to be addressed first. \u201cIt\u2019s all fair and good to have subsidised veterinary care but you actually need to have the veterinarians in place to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s not been enough investment in the profession and it\u2019s leading to some rural and regional places actually not having any vets at all. \u201cIf you have subsidised vet care, it\u2019s not much use if you can\u2019t actually get in to see a vet.\u201d Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"

However, this assumes an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach to engaging in socialist or social democratic solutions. It is also based on the doubtful premise that Keir Starmer can be as easily demonised as Jeremy Corbyn and his coterie. The idea of redistributive social justice, including public control of utilities, is popular and is viewed as a pragmatic responses to national crisis in much the same way as it was in 1945. There is a clear opportunity to present it as such, rather than as the dogmatic pursuit of ideology. The idea already had some traction in 2017 and indeed 2019. With private profits running rampant and the prospect of significant and widespread food and fuel poverty looming, its time has surely come. A radical programme of social, economic and political reform is one that the party of Labour needs not only to support but lead on. Otherwise, what is its purpose? Ian Fraser Tregynon, Powys \u2022 Julian Coman joins up several of the dots in his article, but I think he underplays the true nature of the challenges we face in the 21st century. For a progressive politics to be electable, it needs to say something concrete and credible about climate change, the housing crisis, flexible and casualised employment, education, the food system, biodiversity loss, transport and more besides. This shopping list of issues may seem broad and unfocused, but we need a political narrative that shows how they are all connected. The worst excesses of Thatcherism do need to be undone, but not to re-fight the battles of the 1970s.

            "content": "Gordon Brown is right to highlight that the document he has seen that advocates appointing even more Tory peers to avoid challenges to the party\u2019s legislation is corrupt and fails to understand the basic principles of a second parliamentary chamber (Boris Johnson is planning to fill the Lords with his cronies and legitimise bribery, 29 July). Many of us from all parties who have witnessed the raft of new Conservative peers are appalled, but unsurprised. David Cameron appointed more peers per year than any other prime minister before him. Boris Johnson makes him look like an amateur. This isn\u2019t just about appointments, but Johnson\u2019s willingness to break rules that don\u2019t suit him, including his failed attempt to unlawfully prorogue parliament. In the last parliamentary session, with a raft of contentious policies, the Lords sat longer and later than the Commons to scrutinise legislation. And did it well. For example, when the government sought last-minute, badly drafted, unworkable and unjustified attacks on the right to protest, it was peers from across the House who made a stand against them. And the document is right on one point: Tory peers did fail to vote. Not just through poor political management, but because of ministers\u2019 failure to make a convincing case. Reform is desperately needed \u2013 but we don\u2019t have to wait until the next election. The House of Lords itself is crying out for change now. For example, the Burns report has plans for a smaller, more balanced chamber and the Grocott bill would end the absurdity of hereditary byelections. The government\u2019s sole proposal has been to move the Lords out of London \u2013 presumably to make it easier to avoid challenge. This must be the first time in history where the second chamber is proposing reforms and the government is resisting. Angela Smith Labour, House of Lords \u2022 My admiration for Gordon Brown is reinforced by his speaking out about Boris Johnson packing the House of Lords with cronies. Brown\u2019s 2008 attempt at reform is a beacon for those of us who have long argued for structural reforms. Our national narrative of tradition and exceptionalism, held in place by institutions such as the Lords and a constant diet of pomp fed to us by a compliant media, has created and sustained inequality and poverty in Britain, and long sapped the energy and creativity of so many people before it can take root. It is a pity that Mr Brown\u2019s predecessor did not use Labour\u2019s large Commons majority much earlier to initiate a strategy of structural reform. Sadly, I cannot see Keir Starmer heeding Mr Brown\u2019s call to arms, despite the evident support for such changes in his own party and across the country. So how do we make use of Boris Johnson and Lynton Crosby handing us all \u201cthe strongest possible case for long overdue reform\u201d, if political leaders on all sides lack the courage to embrace it? Christopher Tanner Llandovery, Carmarthenshire \u2022 Gordon Brown\u2019s article is profoundly depressing as it confirms how illusory our democracy really is. The House of Lords might not be perfect, or totally representative in its current form, but only in this chamber is there enough resistance to power-grabbing legislation, such as the original schools bill that would have handed over unprecedented control to Whitehall.

            "content": "The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is planning to make it harder to succeed in judicial reviews against the government, a leaked document suggests. But what is judicial review and why is the government determined to reform it? What is judicial review? A judicial review is a court proceeding in which a judge examines the lawfulness of an action or a decision of a public body such as the government, a local council, police force or NHS trust. It involves a claimant challenging the way a decision has been reached by an official or minister and determining whether that person made a mistake in law in reaching the decision. Why is the government unhappy about judicial review? Ministers have not taken kindly to losing cases or even to being challenged. There have been attacks on \u201clefty lawyers\u201d and allegations that judges have overreached. Two of the most notorious judicial reviews to go against the government were related to Brexit, on whether it could trigger article 50 and the prorogation of parliament respectively. More recently, it has been angry about the challenge to its policy to send some migrants to Rwanda. What has it sought to do about it? In its last election manifesto the Conservative party pledged to end \u201cabuse\u201d of judicial review. The government handpicked a panel of six experts to conduct a review of it but was accused of distorting their findings. While the panel asserted the importance of judicial review and advised against \u201cfar-reaching legislation\u201d, when launching a public consultation after its publication the Ministry of Justice said the panel had found courts were increasingly \u201cmoving beyond the remit of judicial review\u201d. The language used by the MoJ prompted fears about what was coming but ultimately the changes contained in the Judicial Review and Courts Act, which came into effect on Friday 15 July, were generally considered to be modest in impact. That is not to say they were without controversy, with the end to \u201cCart\u201d judicial reviews \u2013 appeals against decisions of tribunals mainly relating to immigration/asylum and social security cases \u2013 criticised by the likes of Liberty and the Public Law Project. Why is it looking at further changes? There was a widely held perception that many in government did not feel that the judicial review reforms went far enough and that is why Robert Buckland QC was sacked as lord chancellor and justice secretary and replaced by Dominic Raab. The plans contained in the leaked document have a feel of unfinished business. Raab has already proposed scrapping the Human Rights Act and replacing it with a British bill of rights, which would also limit government accountability by denying some individuals hitherto universal protections. What do judges say? By convention, judges are prohibited from commenting on government policy or legislation. However, the all-party parliamentary group on democracy and the constitution (APPGDC) accused ministers of acting in a \u201cconstitutionally unhelpful and inappropriate manner\u201d by questioning the legitimacy of judges and had created an impression that recent supreme court decisions favourable to the government may have been a response to political pressure. The head of the judiciary in England and Wales, Lord Burnett, has urged Raab to protect the judiciary against attacks by his colleagues. Geraint Davies MP, APPGDC chair, said Raab was complicit, saying the role of lord chancellor had become \u201ca political stepping stone from which to take pot shots at the judiciary\u201d."

            "content": "Uber\u2019s push into patient transport has renewed calls to regulate the gig economy with minimum pay and conditions. On Friday the rideshare company launched Uber Health in Australia to provide non-emergency transport for medical appointments, competing with state-based taxi voucher schemes. The new service will allow doctors and medical centres to schedule, manage and pay for rides for patients and caregivers in one digital hub, allowing riders to access transport even without a smartphone. Sam Brown, head of Uber for business ANZ, said the services would \u201chelp streamline healthcare transport, reduce the strain missed appointments cause, and improve the overall patient experience\u201d. \u201cUber Health helps to reduce transportation as a barrier to care for those who may not otherwise have their own way to get to or from an important appointment, and is also just one of the ways we\u2019re working to create new earning opportunities for driver-partners.\u201d The expansion comes ahead of September\u2019s jobs and skills summit, at which the Albanese government will receive input into its policy to give the Fair Work Commission powers to order minimum conditions in the gig economy. Unions have sought to challenge gig economy companies\u2019 claims their workers are independent contractors, not employees. But a recent high court decision giving primacy to the form of the contract rather than patterns of work has left regulation the best chance to improve workers\u2019 conditions. In July the Transport Workers Union and Uber struck an in-principle deal recognising the need for minimum earnings for drivers to achieve cost recovery, and improved dispute resolution processes for drivers removed from the platform. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said Uber\u2019s expansion into patient transport makes \u201cclear the gig model of work will pervade every aspect of our lives, which is why it is so critical to get urgent reform in place and in the right way\u201d. \u201cThrough an absence of regulation in Australia, the gig economy has caused an erosion of workplace rights that has led to deaths, injuries, unfair sackings and workers ripped off the minimum wage,\u201d he said. In July Guardian Australia revealed Uber understood it was operating illegally when it launched in Australia and fiercely lobbied governments to legalise its local operations. In a jobs and skills summit issues paper, released on Wednesday, the Treasury noted in 2019 about 250,000 people worked in the gig economy. It said that although the gig economy \u201cshould offer greater options to both businesses and workers \u2026 there are pressing concerns about their impact on job security and wages\u201d. \u201cMany workers in Australia experience significant income variability and need to work multiple jobs to cover their cost of living,\u201d it said. \u201cThere are significant concerns that the current workplace arrangements underpinning the gig economy may be restricting the rights of some workers.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-09T05:00:17Z",
            "content": "The next prime minister needs to reinstate the role of minister for climate change, according to the head of the influential Conservative Net Zero Support Group. Chris Skidmore has become one of the leading voices in the Tory green movement. Along with Zac Goldsmith and Alok Sharma, he is part of a significant number of conservatives who are pressing hard for climate action, and who despair at the opinions of a small number of Tories, such as the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) who oppose swift action on climate breakdown. Skidmore, 41, has become an unlikely firebrand on green issues within the party. The MP, who grew up near Bristol, has held a number of junior ministerial positions and is not usually one to court controversy, but seeing the scale of the crisis during his stint as science minister radicalised him and he now spends his time campaigning on the climate emergency. He became minister for universities, science, research and innovation in the dying days of the Theresa May government and ended up signing the net zero by 2050 target into law. \u201cIf you asked me, when I first got elected in 2010, if I\u2019d be doing this and trying to defend something called net zero, I wouldn\u2019t have understood what you\u2019re talking about. But as science minister I ended up in a place where I could see the science, see climate change happening and how clear it is that we need to act.\u201d When the NZSG began to focus on disrupting climate action, Skidmore was stirred into action. \u201cOn the [climate] sceptical side, it doesn\u2019t matter what views they have, they have no solutions apart from to rubbish whatever is put in front of them, and that gets attention instantly. When I saw this group of people on the front page of the Guardian, I thought: \u2018Not in my name am I going to allow this group to dominate and claim that they represent the Conservative backbenches.\u2019 So I decided to set up my own rival group.\u201d That was the inception of the Net Zero Support Group, which has grown quickly and now dwarfs the other wing of the party. Since Boris Johnson\u2019s departure things have been even busier. Skidmore briefly considered running for leader himself to get the issue of net zero on the table, but \u201cdecided that if you don\u2019t attract significant support, you maybe do more damage to your cause\u201d. So instead he organised a climate hustings for the Conservative leadership candidates during the campaign, successfully getting most of them to sign a pledge to honour net zero. He said it was an uphill battle to convince his fellow green Tories to take action. \u201cThey said the risk is if we start mentioning net zero, and pushing candidates on it, other candidates may come up against it and we might backfire. But I stood up and said you can\u2019t stand there and think that you can just be quiet about what you want, and then hope that no one mentions it during the leadership contest, because then you\u2019ve lost all legitimacy.\u201d The final two, Liz Truss, and Rishi Sunak, have now both signed up to net zero, although both have largely avoided talking about the climate during the campaign. Skidmore has pledged his support to Sunak: \u201cI looked Rishi in the eyes and said do you support net zero, and he said yes.\u201d Knowing that Goldsmith was supporting Truss, Skidmore decided the most sensible thing to do would be to throw in his lot with Sunak, so green interests would be represented no matter which candidate won. Skidmore says the new prime minister must reinstate the role of climate change minister. The Department for Energy and Climate Change was abolished under Theresa May\u2019s government in 2016, and moved into the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Labour has a separate climate change shadow minister, Ed Miliband. \u201cClimate change and the energy transition sits across several departments and there is no one person tackling it. My wish is that one of the leaders would create a minister who attends cabinet and tackles this crucial issue. When the department was abolished it just sent the wrong message,\u201d Skidmore said. He is also outspoken about his party\u2019s record on climate change and the legacy it is threatening to leave: \u201cThose who think they\u2019re playing tactically, by trying to get either newspaper headlines or quick wins, will be remembered as having failed a generation.\u201d He cites former Conservative prime minister David Cameron as an example. \u201cCameron made that disastrous decision to \u2018cut the green crap\u2019 and put a moratorium on windfarms, and we\u2019ve seen potentially huge losses, not only in terms of British jobs, investment and the British economy, but also our bills could have been slashed. Every single person could have lower bills by now if we made a more strategic decision to invest in renewables.\u201d Seeing the same questions about wind, fracking and climate breakdown return again fills him with frustration. Skidmore is clear that if the party goes backwards on net zero it could have global implications. \u201cI\u2019ve just kept on thinking if we as the UK delayed net zero, or we went back and revisited legislation, that would be a domino effect in the opposite direction. India and China and everyone else would say: \u2018Well, if the UK can\u2019t stick to its legislation and it\u2019s going to break its promises then we\u2019ll do the same.\u2019\u201d Skidmore\u2019s outspoken critique of his colleagues, as well as support for the underdog in the race, could rule him out of a cabinet position should Truss win. But he hopes she would not follow Johnson\u2019s example and fill the cabinet only with those who agree with her. \u201cThis is the big challenge for Liz if she becomes prime minister. I\u2019d ask her: \u2018Do you create a broad-based party that is an Abraham Lincoln-type team of rivals, or are you creating a faction with patronage?\u2019 \u201cThis is what Boris Johnson did, a faction of patronage, and it ended up being a disastrous strategy. He kept rewarding his supporters and turning against anyone who opposed him. Margaret Thatcher never did that. The future of the Conservative party in government depends on them creating a cabinet of talented people and not rewarding a nodding group of yes men and women.\u201d"

            "content": "China\u2019s decision to halt cooperation with the US over the climate crisis has provoked alarm, with seasoned climate diplomats urging a swift resumption of talks to help stave off worsening global heating. On Friday, Beijing announced a series of measures aimed at retaliating against the US for the \u201cegregious provocation\u201d of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, visiting Taiwan. China, which considers Taiwan its territory and has launched large-scale military exercises near the island, said it will stop working with the US on climate change, along with other key issues. While the extent of China\u2019s withdrawal from climate discussions is still not clear, the move threatens to derail the often fragile cooperation between the world\u2019s two largest carbon emitters, with only a few months to go before the crucial UN Cop27 in Egypt this autumn. Experts say there is little hope of avoiding disastrous global heating without strong action by the US and China, which are together responsible for about 40% of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. The rupture in relations has occurred amid a summer of climate change-fuelled disasters, with record heatwaves and wildfires sweeping the US and Europe, punishingly high temperatures scorching India and China, and ruinous flooding affecting the US, south Asia and Africa. The US is on the brink of passing landmark climate legislation at home, but collectively the world\u2019s governments are still not doing enough to avoid breaching agreed temperature goals. The goal of limiting heating to 1.5C is \u201con life support\u201d with a weakening pulse, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, warned last month. \u201cUS-China relations have always been a rollercoaster and we often witness flare-ups, but while you can freeze talks, you cannot freeze climate impacts,\u201d said Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation and a key architect of the Paris climate accords. \u201cIt\u2019s in the self-interest of China and the US to act on climate and start talking. Indeed, China recognizes its own self-interest to act; it is still committed to Paris and is moving forward on domestic pledges around methane and coal phasedown.\u201d The US and China have accused each other of not doing enough to cut planet-heating emissions at various points in recent years. China attacked US \u201cselfishness\u201d when then-president Donald Trump rolled back various environmental protections in 2017, while Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s successor, last year claimed the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had made a \u201cbig mistake\u201d by not attending the Cop26 climate summit in Scotland. However, the two powers achieved a breakthrough at the same talks in Glasgow in November, agreeing a surprise plan to work together \u201cwith urgency\u201d on slashing emissions. Xie Zhenhua, the head of China\u2019s delegation, said both countries must \u201caccelerate a green and low carbon transition\u201d. John Kerry, the US climate envoy, acknowledged that the nations have \u201cno shortage of differences\u201d but that \u201ccooperation is the only way to get this job done. This is about science, about physics.\u201d This rapprochement on climate has helped foster collaboration between US and Chinese organizations, as well as providing leadership to other countries, according to Nate Hultman, a former aide to Kerry and now director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland. \u201cThe US and China working together is an important dimension of addressing climate change, it has the potential to motivate others to do more,\u201d said Hultman. \u201cThe broader relationship is very complex but both countries understand this is not just a bilateral issue, there is a global dimension to this. That is what I hope will bring them back together. Hopefully this suspension is brief and they can get back to the table as soon as possible.\u201d Hultman said that while high-level climate talks could now be curtailed, other bilateral collaboration may continue, although details on this are still scant. Regardless of the situation between the US and China, progress could still be made at the Cop27 talks in Egypt, he insisted. \u201cThis has been challenging and at times we are going to stall out,\u201d Hultman said. \u201cBut Cop27 won\u2019t just crash out if the US and China don\u2019t iron out their differences. We would have to focus on what else can be done as an international community.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-04T17:30:22Z",
            "content": "The Australian House of Representatives has passed the country\u2019s first climate change legislation in more than a decade. The main part of the previous bill \u2013 an emissions trading scheme, introduced by the Gillard government with the support of Greens and independents \u2013 was repealed by the Coalition under Tony Abbott in 2014. Here\u2019s what we know about what the bill means for climate action, and what happens once the country has legislated emissions targets. What does the climate bill do? The climate bill enshrines into law two national greenhouse gas emissions targets: a 43% cut below 2005 levels by 2030, and a reduction to \u201cnet zero\u201d by 2050. The bill emphasises that the 2030 target is a floor not a ceiling, which means it is the minimum cut that can happen but there is nothing to legally prevent deeper cuts. The legislation requires several government agencies to consider the targets \u2013 that is, factor in climate change \u2013 when making investment decisions. The legislation beefs up the role played by the Climate Change Authority, a decade-old agency responsible for giving policy advice. The authority was cut back and largely ignored under the Coalition after it failed to abolish it. It will now be expected to give annual advice on progress towards meeting Australia\u2019s climate targets and to advise later this parliamentary term on a new target for 2035. The government will have to release the advice and publicly explain why if it doesn\u2019t follow it. The bill requires the climate change minister, currently Chris Bowen, to give an annual statement to parliament on progress towards the targets. Bowen has likened it to the annual Closing the Gap statement. What doesn\u2019t the climate bill do? It doesn\u2019t include a mechanism or funding to cut emissions from electricity, industry, transport, agriculture or other parts of the economy. What happens now? The bill has to clear the Senate when parliament next sits in September, but that\u2019s now a formality. Before then, a Senate committee will hold an inquiry. The Greens want it to address whether new coal and gas developments are consistent with Australia\u2019s climate commitments. There is no shortage of evidence and rhetoric \u2013 from climate scientists, the United Nations secretary general and the International Energy Agency, among others \u2013 to say they aren\u2019t. But the inquiry won\u2019t change the text of the bill. The fight over stopping new fossil fuels \u2013 the Greens\u2019 primary climate policy goal \u2013 will continue independently of that. How will we meet the 43% target? Labor\u2019s climate plan, called Powering Australia, includes two main policies plus a few add-ons. Bowen says he commissioned modelling from consultants at RepuTex to estimate what cut in emissions the policies could deliver, and they came up with 43%. But the details of the policies are still to be fleshed out. The first is to use the safeguard mechanism, which was introduced by the Abbott government to stop increases in pollution from major industrial sites, including fossil fuel mines. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It has failed to achieve this \u2013 polluters have routinely been allowed to just increase emissions. Labor says it will work with companies to reduce their emissions baselines (think: limits) \u201cpredictably and gradually over time\u201d, while \u201csupporting international competitiveness and economic growth\u201d. No detail has been released \u2013 Bowen has flagged there will be a discussion paper later this month \u2013 but RepuTex suggested improvements to the safeguard would reduce annual emissions by 24m tonnes by 2030. There are big questions to be answered before then. How will baselines be set? What will be the relative responsibility of different industries and facilities to make cuts? What steps will be taken to ensure the cuts are real (given facilities largely report their own emissions)? Will there be limits on the number of carbon credits that businesses can buy to claim as their own cuts so they have to actually cut emissions onsite (given, as the truism goes, you can\u2019t just offset your way to zero)? There is a proposal to grant companies that cut emissions more than they have to \u2013 so, below their limit \u2013 credits they can sell, creating a carbon trading scheme. How will that work? And \u2013 crucially \u2013 how will new fossil fuel developments that would increase total industrial emissions be treated? As they say in the classics, it\u2019s complicated. The second major policy is called Rewiring the nation. It\u2019s a promise to spend $20bn accelerating new electricity transmission links \u2013 in oversimplified terms, poles and wires \u2013 between different regions and from new renewable energy zones to cities. Labor says this will lead to 82% of electricity on the east coast being from renewable sources by 2030, up from about 33%. RepuTex says this should help reduce annual emissions from electricity by 37m tonnes compared with today. Another 33m tonnes of annual emissions cuts are promised from a new national reconstruction fund. The government says up to $3bn of spending from the fund will \u201csupport renewables manufacturing and the deployment of low-emissions technologies\u201d. And there is some support for electric vehicles, but it is not a full transport climate policy, and RepuTex expects it will cut annual emissions by just 4m tonnes by the end of the decade. Are these ambitious policies? Not really. Negotiating the changes to the safeguard mechanism is likely to be challenging, and they will be consequential if well designed, but the emissions cuts expected from Labor\u2019s policies are modest. Official government projections found even under the Coalition\u2019s policies \u2013 which did little to cut emissions and funnelled billions of dollars into fossil fuel industries \u2013 emissions in 2030 would be at least 30% below 2005 levels. Why? Because emissions from electricity are falling anyway due to cost \u2013 cheaper renewable energy is squeezing out ageing coal plants \u2013 and support from state governments. Analysts have found the official projections did not fully reflect all state government targets, and that we might be on track for a cut in the mid-30s before the Albanese government does anything. They have also said it would be possible to make deeper cuts that reflect what Australia should be doing to play its part in addressing the climate crisis and living up to the Paris agreement \u2013 a more than 50% cut by 2030 \u2013 while setting up, rather than damaging, the economy. How will the net zero target be met? The policies outlined above would help get there, but Labor has not released a full net zero plan. What about the future of coal and gas? It will play out in negotiations over the design of the safeguard mechanism, and in a promised revamp of national environment laws by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, next year. The Greens and others want a \u201cclimate trigger\u201d inserted in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act, which would allow new development proposals to be refused on emissions grounds. Logic says there should be one. The government hasn\u2019t supported one, but neither has it ruled it out. This argument has a long way to run."

            "date": "2022-08-02T04:53:29Z",
            "content": "Peter Dutton has rebuffed moderates wanting a change to the opposition\u2019s plan to vote against Labor\u2019s climate change legislation at a meeting of shadow cabinet on Monday night. Guardian Australia understands that the former finance minister and now shadow foreign affairs minister, Simon Birmingham, advocated an alternative approach to voting against the government\u2019s legislation, suggesting the opposition should either vote for the bill or not oppose it. This would allow the legislation to pass through the House of Representatives on the voices, without the need for a division. Sources said Birmingham advocated that the opposition put forward a further amendment that would require publication of energy price projections and energy security alongside reporting of how Australia was tracking to meet its emissions targets. This would keep parliament informed of the impact the emissions reduction target was having across the economy. Dutton\u2019s rejection of the moderates comes as the Greens are yet to land a final position on Labor\u2019s climate bill. The Greens party room met in Canberra on Tuesday morning and will meet again in the evening to try to reach consensus. The deputy leader of the Liberals, Sussan Ley, backed Dutton\u2019s position, but on Monday night repeated a view she has expressed publicly that there would be an opportunity over this parliamentary term for the Coalition to develop a new climate policy to put to voters at the next federal election. Guardian Australia understands while Ley favours opposing Labor\u2019s legislation now, she told colleagues on Monday night the Coalition should not get bogged down blasting Labor\u2019s policy while considering what the future policy stance should be. In a subsequent party room meeting on Tuesday, moderates James Stevens, Andrew Bragg and Bridget Archer spoke on the need for the opposition to increase its ambition on its medium term targets, with concerns raised that voting against Labor\u2019s bill would give the impression that the Liberals and Nationals did not support action on climate change. Archer is understood to have spoken most strongly against the position presented to MPs by the shadow climate change minister, Ted O\u2019Brien, after previously telling Guardian Australia she was prepared to cross the floor to support Labor\u2019s bill. She told her colleagues that voting against the legislation would appear to her constituents that she was voting against action on climate change. Stevens is understood to have expressed the view that he was prepared to support the position based on the proviso that a more ambitious medium-term target was taken to the next election, and expressed the importance of the Coalition remaining united on the issue. Stevens came close to losing his suburban Adelaide-based seat of Sturt at the May election, suffering a 7% swing against him, which was mostly gained by the Greens. Bragg reminded MPs that the federal director, Andrew Hirst, had indicated that the party\u2019s position on climate change had been a factor in losing metropolitan seats to teal independents, Labor and the Greens, and more ambition was needed. Dutton has given MPs an undertaking that the opposition will take time to develop new and \u201ccredible\u201d medium-term emissions reduction targets, that will also consider how nuclear energy could be included into the mix. He assured MPs that he understood there was a broad range of views within the party room, and opposing the legislation did not mean it opposed targets. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sources said there was a \u201crespectful\u201d discussion about the opposition\u2019s position at Monday\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting, with most members speaking on the legislation, and overwhelming support for Dutton\u2019s already stated view to oppose legislating the 43% emissions reduction target, if not the target itself. There was a general consensus that the opposition would reserve its position on a new medium-term target until closer to the next election, in the same way that Labor had done in opposition. Labor has the numbers to pass the legislation in the lower house, although it may accept amendments moved during the chamber debate. But the government will need the support of the Greens and one other crossbencher in the Senate to pass the legislation. Some Liberals believe Dutton has refused to pass the target legislation in order to force Labor into a position of having to do a deal with the Greens to pass the legislation. The Greens have been concerned that Labor\u2019s 43% emissions reduction target isn\u2019t ambitious enough, and the party has been lobbying for a moratorium on oil and gas developments. Labor has made it clear it will not support a moratorium, but it has left open the prospect of elevating the importance of climate change in future environmental assessments. In an effort to respond to specific concerns from the Greens and the crossbench, the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has made it clear the 43% is a floor not a ceiling, and he has been more explicit about the role the Climate Change Authority will play in advising the government and how he will respond to that advice. The Greens are yet to consider the threshold question about whether or not the bill should pass or be rejected. There has been a diversity of views expressed about the specific propositions the Greens party room has considered to strengthen the bill. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, was given additional propositions by the party room to put to Bowen on Tuesday morning. If the Greens fail to reach consensus at Tuesday night\u2019s meeting, the party rules allow for issues to be put to a vote. The majority position will then determine the landing point the party reaches."

            "date": "2022-08-06T14:00:16Z",
            "content": "Ben Green doesn\u2019t have to worry that Vladimir Putin might cut off Europe\u2019s gas this winter, fret about a seasonal revival of Covid-19, or panic about a looming global food crisis. Green weaned himself off gas when he purchased the five-hectare (12-acre) grounds of a derelict East German army barracks three years ago: the previous owner, who used it as an outdoor museum for vintage tanks, had gutted the building of water and gas pipes. Green patched up the roof of the refectory and insulated the windows so that temperatures inside don\u2019t drop below 5C at night. He bathes by pouring a bucket of cold water over his head and cooks on a wood-burning stove. A 49-year-old Englishman with a greying ginger beard and the word \u201cVegan!\u201d tattooed on his left upper arm, Green is unaffected by fraying supply chains because he lives almost entirely off the vegetables and fruit he grows on his land. If, as Green hopes, friends give him an oil press for his 50th birthday, he will soon be able to cut out the occasional four-mile cycle to the nearest village for cooking oil. On those trips he does stock up on tea, coffee and chocolate, but they are luxuries he could dispense with in the case of a systemic breakdown of supply chains. The fact his food miles are still measurable at all is due to the bottomless appetite of Fat Tony, Brunhilde Demagogue and Marilyn Monroe, his three Mangalica pigs. Coronavirus is not a cause for concern \u2013 partly because Green is twice vaccinated, in spite of one what one may assume from his enthusiasm for herbal remedies, but mainly because he lives on his own in the middle of a remote spruce forest in Saxony, whose exact coordinates he keeps secret, and rarely receives visitors. Green does worry about this year\u2019s extreme heat and drought, which is endangering his race to fill his cellar with 100 pots of tomato stew, 180kg of potatoes and 22kg of dried beans in order to survive the winter. But this summer\u2019s soaring temperatures may also lead more people to recognise Green\u2019s experiment in self-sufficiency as a model to emulate in preparation for a climate catastrophe. A catastrophe, Green believes, which is inevitable and imminent. \u201cWhen I was born, we were at 324 parts of carbon dioxide in one million parts of air. This year, we hit 420. Change is coming, and if you\u2019re not prepared for it, it\u2019s going to be fairly awful. \u201cWhat we are looking at isn\u2019t the end of humanity but the end of capitalism,\u201d he said, describing climate breakdown as the common denominator behind the various political, food, energy and health crises that have started to converge in recent years. \u201cThe collapse is going to happen, and this is the year when people will notice.\u201d Living in expectation of the apocalypse is no longer a minority position. A YouGov survey carried out at the start of the coronavirus pandemic found almost a third of respondents in the US anticipate a life-changing disaster in their lifetime. A separate poll of five countries in 2019 found that more than half of respondents in France, Italy, the UK and the US think civilisation as they know it will collapse in years to come. In America, anxiety about a systemic breakdown has fed a trend of \u201cpreppers\u201d stocking up on food supplies and arms to look after themselves and their families. During the pandemic, US sellers of underground shelters reported surging demand. Green, who chronicles his hermit existence on his Instagram account, The Pirate Ben, sees himself in the vanguard of a more positive and less selfish European counter-movement: \u201chappy doomerism\u201d. \u201cThe problem with preppers is: what do they do when the baked beans run out? I don\u2019t want any fear here \u2013 that\u2019s where all the white power stuff comes from.\u201d He doesn\u2019t believe in the need for population reduction, as do some on the fringes where the far right and eco-activism overlap. If people can keep or relearn their knowledge of how to sustainably work the land, Green argues, there should be enough food for everyone: \u201cWhat I am trying to do is preserve the best of our society for when we come out at the other end.\u201d There is more of The Good Life than Extinction Rebellion to his decision to rescue his pigs from a butcher \u2013 an act of \u201ceffective altruism\u201d the three huge pigs are evidently unwilling to repay. Their never-ending hunger for horse muesli mixed with hay pellets, and stale bread rolls from the nearest village bakery, is what still stops him from living a 100% self-sufficient and climate-neutral existence. \u201cThe pigs were the worst decision in my life,\u201d he said, as he gives Tony a doting pat on his muddied back. \u201cIt was stupid, and clearly detrimental to my goals.\u201d Eating them would be the logical conclusion, he admits. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d To call Green a humanist would be one step too far, he said. Building a self-sufficient post-climate change community requires discipline: he rises at 6am, feeds the pigs, tends to his crops, mows grass, feeds the pigs a second time, and then goes to bed at around 10pm. And such discipline requires a strong belief in right and wrong. He places the blame for climate change not just with a few powerful individuals, he wrote on one recent blog entry, but all of those who participated in a world-destroying economy: \u201cEvery person who works for a fossil fuel company in any capacity should be tried for genocide. From the kids in the post-room to the CEOs.\u201d Green reiterated the point when asked about the blog entry. \u201cA few show trials for genocide would go a hell of a long way.\u201d What would be the punishment for genocide? \u201cI think that\u2019s fairly well established.\u201d Before he moved to the barracks in the Saxon woods three years ago, the native Brummie pursued a successful career as an IT engineer. Spells in Austria, Spain, London and Berlin ended when he was fired from his last job in Zurich in 2018. With the severance payment and his savings, he bought the former barracks of the East German National People\u2019s Army. Though he speaks fluent German, the choice of location was the result of a rational cost-benefit analysis rather than any strong affection for the eastern German state bordering the Czech Republic. \u201cYou want to be as far north as you can be for the heat, but also as far south as you can be because of the sunlight for the growing season.\u201d Seekers of self-sufficient lifestyles setting up communes in Spain or Portugal, he said, were \u201cinsane\u201d because they would struggle to work the land amid rising temperatures. Preppers look after themselves. Green wants to set an example for others to follow, but for now happy doomerism remains a movement of one. After starting out with occasional volunteers who helped him work the land, he currently runs the project solo. A strict no-drugs policy at the barracks is designed to put off half-hearted dropouts. \u201cThe first follower will have to be very special,\u201d he said, sitting down in the refectory to escape the midday sun. \u201cThey will have to believe in the project in the way even I don\u2019t.\u201d Anyone seriously interested in joining Green in the event of a climate-induced famine can pay \u20ac3,500 (\u00a32,950) to be put on a waiting list, though he gives no guarantees that will automatically secure a place. One person has already made the payment."

            "content": "Google has been accused of airbrushing aviation emissions, after the company changed its flight search engine to halve the CO2 emissions attributed to any given trip. The change, first noted by the BBC, affects a feature on Google Flights that shows the estimated carbon emissions of each route. The company flags routes with higher or lower than typical emissions, and also reports the total CO2 emitted per passenger on any given journey. But in July this year, Google pushed through a change that halved the total emission figures it reported. The company had previously reported emissions in kilograms of \u201ccarbon dioxide equivalent\u201d (CO2e), a measure that includes the damage to the climate from other aviation emissions, such as water vapour emitted at high altitudes as part of the plane\u2019s contrails, which can have a significantly higher warming effect per tonne than pure CO2. After the change, Google began reporting just the CO2 emitted on each journey, effectively halving the stated environmental impact of any given flight. The company argues that it is impossible to precisely estimate CO2e for a given flight, since the effect of water vapour on warming differs depending on time of day and location of emissions, and that until its models improve, it would be more accurate to simply report CO2. In a statement, the company said: \u201cWe strongly believe that non-CO2 effects should be included in the model, but not at the expense of accuracy for individual flight estimates. To address this issue, we\u2019re working closely with leading academics on soon-to-be-published research to better understand how the impact of contrails varies based on critical factors like time of day and region, which will in turn help us more accurately reflect that information to consumers.\u201d But when the change was pushed through, Google made no public acknowledgement of its new figures, save for a single note published to a developer account on codesharing site Github. Critics, such as Greenpeace UK\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, say that is not good enough, and that even if estimating the total environmental impact is hard, there are better solutions than simply \u201cairbrushing\u201d the damage. \u201cThe last thing it should do is quietly greenwash the planetary impacts of one of the world\u2019s most stubborn polluters,\u201d said Parr. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a full-blown climate emergency that airlines continue to fuel \u2013 it\u2019s absolutely vital that the world\u2019s biggest search engine gives decent information about this industry\u2019s climate footprint.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-29T12:55:18Z",
            "content": "Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, will complete a plan to lower its carbon emissions by more than 99% in the next month, the foundation that controls the platform has confirmed. The project, called \u201cthe merge\u201d, will result in ethereum switching the underlying technology it uses for validating crypto transactions to a new process that requires less energy to manage. Once complete, the merge will end the role of \u201cminers\u201d in the ethereum ecosystem, helping to dramatically reduce electricity usage. These users run huge quantities of powerful, purpose-built technology all day, every day, to generate random numbers that affect the security of the overall network. The energy consumption of ethereum mining is currently estimated at about 72 terawatt-hours a year, according to Alex de Vries, a Dutch economist who runs the Digiconomist website. That is comparable with the power consumption of Colombia, with a carbon footprint equivalent to that of Switzerland. The changeover will lead to the platform moving away from a \u201cproof of work\u201d process, which requires cryptocurrency miners to generate random numbers to verify records stored on the blockchain \u2013 the technology underpinning digital currencies such as ethereum and the more popular bitcoin. Ethereum will instead use a \u201cproof of stake\u201d process, in which the network will be secured by users who \u201cstake\u201d sums of the cryptocurrency, committing themselves to acting honestly at the risk of losing it. De Vries said the switchover would eliminate the majority of electricity usage. \u201cThey could cut off a huge chunk of their power demand. I will be working on quantifying that more accurately but at least 99% (probably even 99.9%) reduction should be achievable. This translates to something like the electricity consumption of a country like Portugal (a quarter of all data centres in the world combined) vanishing overnight.\u201d The proof-of-stake model is currently being used on an experimental \u201cbeacon\u201d blockchain, where it has been tested to ensure that the theoretical security it provides is sufficient for the multibillion-dollar economy that sits on top of the ethereum network. Now the experimental blockchain will take over the work of the main network. \u201cImagine ethereum is a spaceship that isn\u2019t quite ready for an interstellar voyage,\u201d the ethereum foundation said, explaining the merge. \u201cWith the beacon chain, the community has built a new engine and a hardened hull. After significant testing, it\u2019s almost time to hot-swap the new engine for the old midflight. This will merge the new, more efficient engine into the existing ship, ready to put in some serious lightyears and take on the universe.\u201d There are still potential problems ahead. The foundation said users needed to watch out for an increase in scam activity because hackers could take advantage of the confusion around the switchover to try to trick users into giving up their passwords, their funds or both. \u201cYou should be on high alert for scams trying to take advantage of users during this transition,\u201d the organisation said. \u201cDo not send your ETH anywhere in an attempt to \u2018upgrade to ETH2\u2019. There is no ETH2 token, and there is nothing more you need to do for your funds to remain safe.\u201d The final stages of the merge are expected to begin on 6 September, the foundation said, with the old blockchain switched off at some point between 10 and 20 September. Ethereum will not be the first network to use proof of stake, and others including cardano and solana have demonstrated the technology at a smaller scale. But its switchover will leave bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, facing renewed criticism for its continued reliance on proof of work. The bitcoin network uses 130TWh of electricity a year, De Vries estimates, a sum that will be increasingly difficult to defend if the ethereum blockchain demonstrates that the same capabilities can be achieved in an environmentally friendly manner."

            "date": "2022-08-17T17:30:24Z",
            "content": "Australia\u2019s big polluting industries are likely to have to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by between 3.5% and 6% a year under the Albanese government\u2019s plan to respond to the climate crisis. The government has released a consultation paper setting out how it could reform the safeguard mechanism, a policy that was introduced by the Coalition under Tony Abbott in 2016 to prevent increases in industrial emissions. In practice, companies have been allowed to increase pollution without penalty and industrial emissions have continued to rise. Under Labor\u2019s proposed changes to start next July, the 215 major polluting facilities covered by the scheme will have to either cut emissions onsite or buy carbon credits (meant to represent emissions cuts made elsewhere) to help reach the soon-to-be-legislated national emissions targets \u2013 a 43% cut by 2030 and net zero by 2030. Facilities covered include coalmines, gas production sites, aluminium smelters, steel plants, manufacturing sites and airlines. The consultation paper says the annual rate of emissions cuts could not be settled until all policy settings had been finalised, but was expected to be between 3.5% and 6%. Each facility under the scheme has an emissions limit, known as a baseline. The paper proposes a path that would turn the safeguard mechanism into a form of carbon trading scheme. Companies that emitted less than their baselines would be issued with safeguard mechanism credits, effectively as a reward for cutting pollution faster than required. Those companies could sell these credits to businesses that did not stay within their limits and needed to pay for their extra pollution. Other Australian carbon credits \u2013 currently the focus of a separate government review \u2013 could also be used in the scheme, but international carbon credits could not initially. The proposed changes have been broadly supported by major business and industry groups but \u2013 as the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has acknowledged \u2013 the challenge would be reaching agreement on the details, particularly on where to set baselines and the pace of emissions cuts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The paper seeks industry and community feedback on several thorny issues, including: How to reset and reduce baselines so they reflect companies\u2019 emissions and are not set so high that they could lead to credits being handed out without pollution actually being cut. Questions to be resolved include whether different baselines should be set for each facility or if they should be averaged across industries. Whether baselines should limit a facility\u2019s total emissions or be based on emissions intensity \u2013 how much is released for each unit of production. The latter could initially allow a growing business to expand production \u2013 and its total emissions \u2013 without penalty. How to deal with new polluting facilities that open while bringing total industrial pollution down. How to ensure trade-exposed polluters are not disadvantaged compared to offshore competitors. Should they receive government funding to help move to low emissions technology? What share of the national 2030 target should be delivered by the facilities under the safeguard mechanism. In a statement, Bowen said the government intended to build on the existing architecture of the scheme so it would cut emissions \u201cwhile supporting industry competitiveness\u201d. He described the climate emergency as \u201cAustralia\u2019s jobs opportunity\u201d.\u201cA revamped safeguard mechanism will help Australian industry cut emissions and remain competitive in a decarbonising global economy,\u201d he said. Tony Wood, the energy and climate change program director with the Grattan Institute, said the changes to the safeguard would be the government\u2019s biggest political challenge on climate this term. \u201cThere will be some tricky choices and there will be losers and winners,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will need to come up with a model that actually reduces emissions and seriously road test it before it is introduced.\u201d Scientists have recommended Australia should be cutting emissions by more than 50% by 2030 for the country to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement, including pursuing efforts to limit global heating since pre-industrial times to 1.5C."

            "content": "On 15 September, the ethereum blockchain is planning to switch off its mining rigs. If it happens, it should reduce the carbon emissions of the entire ethereum ecosystem by orders of magnitude overnight, leaving bitcoin as the only major cryptocurrency to be built on the destructive proof-of-work concept. But the switchover could also throw some of the largest institutions in the sector into chaos, and seems likely to evolve into a cold war between the new version of ethereum and the diehard followers of the old. And that\u2019s if it happens at all. A brief refresher on cryptocurrencies. The two biggest in the world, ethereum and bitcoin, are based on an idea called proof of work. This \u2013 and I\u2019m simplifying \u2013 involves the networks outsourcing their security to a decentralised network of miners, who compete to burn ludicrous amounts of electrical energy to generate lottery tickets. Each time a winning lottery ticket is generated, the miner who did so gets a reward (for bitcoin, that is currently 6.25BTC \u2013 about \u00a3110,000), and gets to verify all the transactions that have happened since the last winner, packaging them up into a neat block, and adding them on to the chain made up of all previous blocks. They stamp the block with their lottery number and the process begins again. Nearly all of the above paragraph is false, so please do not write to me. It is true enough for what follows: this proof-of-work model is at the root of everything you\u2019ve heard about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. And ethereum is planning to drop it. The replacement is called proof of stake. Conceptually, it is more complex, but with the same broad brushstrokes we can describe it like this: rather than burning electricity to generate lottery tickets, you instead use your ethereum to buy premium bonds, and the system picks a winner in proportion to the amount of bonds they\u2019ve bought, who then gets to do all the validation stuff as normal. You can cash out of your premium bonds, but the process is slow, so you are motivated not to abuse your validation privileges. A version of ethereum has been running on those principles for a while. It\u2019s had different names over the years, from testnet to Eth2, but on 15 September it\u2019s going to become simply ethereum. This switchover, dubbed \u201cthe merge\u201d \u2013 because the old and the new networks will be merged together \u2013 has a good shot at being the single largest technological event ever to happen in the crypto space. Which means it has a good shot at being messy as hell. To start, there\u2019s the date. If you\u2019ve noticed a soup\u00e7on of scepticism, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been burned before. I wrote about the forthcoming merge being \u201cmonths away\u201d \u2013 in May 2021: The switch to proof of stake has been planned for several years, with a host of problems, both technical and organisational, delaying implementation. But now, according to Carl Beekhuizen, a research and development staffer at the Ethereum Foundation \u2026 the change will be complete \u201cin the upcoming months\u201d. It was not. But this time, the switch is rather more final. For one thing, there\u2019s an actual hard date; for another, the preparation for the merge is now live in the code that runs the ethereum network. It could still be delayed, but the default case, if no further action is taken, is that the merge will happen as planned. What\u2019s at stake That doesn\u2019t mean the merge will be smooth. The first stumbling block will be the forks: clones of the old version of ethereum, spun up to keep the proof of work system alive. This won\u2019t be the first time this has happened. There\u2019s untold bitcoin forks, with names like bitcoin cash, bitcoin satoshi vision, bitcoin classic and bitcoin gold, but none have ever toppled the original\u2019s dominance. So why might the ethereum fork have more of a chance? Because it will almost certainly have the backing of a powerful constituency: ethereum miners. After years at the centre of ethereum infrastructure, the miners face their industry being simply switched off overnight, and many of them aren\u2019t happy with that proposal. They have real, physical assets invested in the continuation of a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, from expensive graphics cards to electrical hookups, and it\u2019s not easy to repurpose it for something else. Due to the open-source nature of cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s easy enough for the miners to simply pick up where they left off, and carry on running Nu-thereum, or whatever it gets called, on 16 September as though the merge had never happened. The question is, what happens next? Everyone who has a balance of ETH will suddenly find that they have two balances, one on each blockchain. And everyone who has a smart contract running on ETH will suddenly find they have two of them, as well: there will be the proof-of-work version of the Bored Ape NFTs, and the proof-of-stake version, and so on. Some of those duplicates may happily coexist. Others might try to talk down the forked version, but never quite kill it \u2013 how much would someone who wants to own a killer NFT pay for an \u201cunofficial\u201d version on the forked chain? If it\u2019s not zero, then the trade could continue for some time, even if the developers of the Apes disown the forks. But for other projects, there can only be one. Each USDC token is backed by $1 of hard assets held by Circle, the company that develops the stablecoin. If there are suddenly twice as many USDCs because of the fork, Circle doesn\u2019t have twice as much cash, and it will have to choose one network to support and the other to reject. It seems unlikely that the big stablecoins, like USDC and Tether, will back the rebel chain. And that, in turn, means the entire rebel ecosystem will come into existence in a slow-motion collapse, as forked projects fail one by one. But it will still provide a base for new creation, and one that is ultimately more similar to the ethereum developers know and love than the environmentally friendly version it is about to morph into. What\u2019s next The upstart miners aren\u2019t solely acting out of self-interest. There is a point of principle at stake, as well, which is the decentralisation that underpins the crypto economy. That decentralisation is, at heart, the only real reason for cryptocurrencies to exist: a centralised conventional database is faster, cheaper and safer to run, but requires you to trust whoever is running it. A decentralised cryptocurrency can\u2019t be interfered with by big business, or big government, which makes them great for \u2013 well, crime and evasion of government regulations, in the main, but also loftier concepts like \u201cpermissionless innovation\u201d and \u201cuncensorable speech\u201d. Some of the backers of the proof-of-work (PoW) concept \u2013 including the bitcoin \u201cmaximalists\u201d who look down even on upstarts like ethereum \u2013 worry that proof of stake (PoS) ultimately results in Dino: decentralisation in name only. The nature of the system involves handing control of the network to those with the most money held within the network. Worse, it hands extra power to those who look after other people\u2019s money: centralised exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, and centralised notbanks like Celsius or Voyager, if they\u2019d survived that long. Those exchanges can offer \u201cstaking\u201d services where they do the hard technical bit of making proof of stake work (buying the premium bonds, in the terms of my fantastic analogy), and their customers get the rewards. The rise of the Dinos is more than just a theoretical concern. In a post-Tornado Cash world \u2013 still dealing with the fallout of North Korea\u2019s favourite decentralised app being accused of money laundering and sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) \u2013 it isn\u2019t at all clear whether it is legal under US law for a \u201cvalidator\u201d, the PoS replacement for miners, to approve a block that contains a transaction to or from a sanctioned address. Ethereum\u2019s developers are trying to force the matter, proposing a \u201ccredible commitment to punish censors\u201d. What that means is not yet clear, but the hope is that it doesn\u2019t have to be \u2013 that the credible commitment means that organisations who have to comply with OFAC simply do not stake ethereum in the first place. It is not entirely clear what an ethereum with no validators who are trying to remain in compliance with US sanctions would look like. But that is the world we\u2019re heading to.

            "date": "2022-08-09T12:16:49Z",
            "content": "The mercenary spyware industry represents \u201cone of the greatest contemporary threats to civil society, human rights and democracy\u201d, a leading cybersecurity expert warns, as countries grapple with the unregulated spread of powerful and invasive surveillance tools. Ron Deibert, a political science professor at the university of Toronto and head of Citizen Lab, will testify in front of a Canadian parliamentary committee on Tuesday afternoon about the growing threat he and others believe the technology poses to citizens and democracies. In prepared remarks shared with the Guardian ahead of his testimony to a Canadian parliamentary committee, Deibert cautioned that the software used by law enforcement agencies and autocratic regimes was akin to a \u201cwiretap on steroids\u201d, with little formal oversight. In June, Canada\u2019s federal police agency admitted it uses powerful spyware technology. The tools, which have been used on at least 10 investigations between 2018 and 2020, give the police access to text messages, email, photos, videos, audio files, calendar entries and financial records. The software can also remotely turn on the camera and microphone of a suspect\u2019s phone or laptop. Civil rights groups condemned the police use of the technology as \u201cprofoundly dangerous\u201d and the disclosure prompted the House of Commons ethics and privacy committee to call for summer study of the issue. Deibert has previously briefed senior government officials in Canada and other democracies about the risks posed by the technology and the need for safeguards to regulate its use. Last year, a collaborative investigation between the Guardian and other major international outlets, called the Pegasus project, revealed that spyware licensed by the Israeli firm NSO Group had been used to hack smartphones belonging to journalists, lawyers and human rights activists. On Monday, the RCMP told the committee it has never used the Pegasus software. The brazen targeting of activists and journalists, as well as the unanswered questions about possible national security risks, have prompted some governments to begin curtailing the spread of the technology. In 2021 the commerce department in the United States announced it had placed mercenary spyware companies like NSO on the country\u2019s Entity List, effectively blacklisting them for their \u201cmalicious cyber activities\u201d amid growing concern from US officials that the software posed a grave risk to national security. In contrast, Canadian authorities have shown little appetite to take similar action, said Deibert, who has briefed senior Canadian officials within successive governments. \u201cDespite the nuclear-level capabilities of such spyware, it is remarkable that there has been zero public debate in Canada prior to the RCMP\u2019s (or other [law enforcement] agencies) use of this type of technology,\u201d he wrote in his notes. Deibert, who will speak at 3pm EST, is expected to make a series of recommendations, including regulatory penalties on firms that are known to facilitate human rights abuses abroad, lifetime bans from working with mercenary spyware firms for former employees of Canadian intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and developing clear procurement guidelines. The hearings are scheduled to last two days. On Monday, public safety minister Marco Mendicino defended the use of the spyware. \u201cThere are stringent requirements in the Criminal Code that require accountability, including what facts the RCMP will be relying on prior to judicial authorization of this sort of technique. There are other safeguards that ensure that only designated agents put those applications to the court,\u201d he told parliament."

            "content": "The Conservative party should not use online voting to pick its leader and next prime minister, cybersecurity experts have warned, as the technology is not proven for such a \u201chigh stakes\u201d use. For the first time, the next UK prime minister will be selected by online voters, as well as those sending paper ballots. The 160,000 Conservative party members who have a vote were offered the choice of filling in their postal ballots and returning them, or of voting online instead, using a code contained on the form. It is only the second time in history such a small number of party members have been in a position to directly decide who will be the UK leader. In an effort to ease the count, the party \u201crecommends\u201d members vote online where possible. But Peter Ryan, a professor of applied security at the University of Luxembourg, was among those warning the technology was not ready. \u201cWe do not have the technology to conduct voting securely online and so it should not be deployed for high-stakes elections,\u201d Ryan told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cAnd I count this as rather high stakes \u2026 For the moment, short of a major conceptual breakthrough, I don\u2019t see how it can be done.\u201d The decision to offer members an online vote received technical support from the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which intervened in early August to delay the posting of ballots. An email received by party members earlier this month said: \u201cYour ballot is now on the way \u2013 but it will arrive with you a little later than we originally said. Please do not worry. This is because we have taken some time to add some additional security to our ballot process, which has delayed us slightly.\u201d The NCSC, a branch of GCHQ, said: \u201cWe work closely with all parliamentary political parties, local authorities and MPs to provide cybersecurity guidance and support. \u201cAs you would expect from the UK\u2019s national cybersecurity authority we provided advice to the Conservative party on security considerations for online leadership voting.\u201d Online voting is regularly criticised by security experts because of the lack of any physical paper trail. In contrast to in-person electronic voting, where voters can be issued with a receipt to demonstrate how their vote was recorded and where paper records can be checked after the fact, a purely online vote leaves no record other than the electronic database of how many votes were recorded for each candidate. The option to vote online was planned in the 2019 Conservative leadership election but not implemented, and Boris Johnson was elected with 92,000 paper votes versus Jeremy Hunt\u2019s 47,000."

            "content": "\u201cEx-Twitter exec blows the whistle, alleging reckless and negligent cybersecurity policies,\u201d said the CNN headline. My initial reaction? Yawn\u2026 so what\u2019s new: a social media company playing fast and loose with its users\u2019 data? And who\u2019s this whistleblower, anyway? A guy called Peiter Zatko. Never heard of him. Probably another tech bro who\u2019s discovered his conscience\u2026 But what\u2019s this? He has a nickname \u2013 \u201cMudge\u201d. (Cue audio of pennies dropping.) The mainstream media calls him a \u201chacker\u201d, which is their usual way of undermining a gifted software expert. Which this Mudge certainly is. In fact, in that line of business, he has blue-chip status. He was the highest-profile member of a famous hacker thinktank, the L0pht (pronounced \u201cloft\u201d) and a member of the well-known cooperative Cult of the Dead Cow. In that sense, he was a pioneer of \u201chacktivism\u201d who has spent much of his life trying to educate the world on cybersecurity and has a long list of discovered vulnerabilities to his credit. During the Clinton administration, he was apparently sometimes involved in national security council briefings of the president. In 2010, he was recruited by Darpa, the Pentagon\u2019s tech thinktank, where he oversaw cybersecurity research funded by the agency. After that, he worked at Google in its advanced technology and projects division and then for Stripe, a leading payment processing company. In 2020, he was hired by Twitter\u2019s founder, Jack Dorsey, as the company\u2019s head of security. It is said that the incoming Biden administration tried to hire Zatko as the country\u2019s cybersecurity chief, but he decided to go to Twitter. In July, he filed a complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission accusing Twitter of violating its 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to maintain safe security practices. Somehow, the Washington Post got its hands on a copy and has made it available on the web. It\u2019s 84 pages long, and heavily censored, but it makes for riveting reading. It\u2019s basically a devastating critique of Twitter\u2019s management and security practices. In 2011, the FTC found that it was trivially easy for its employees to gain total access to all of its systems and that this poor security had been exploited by hackers, including those who had sent tweets from then President Obama\u2019s account. Ten years on, Zatko says that thousands of employees still have wide-ranging and poorly tracked internal access to core company systems. He also claims that half of the company\u2019s servers are running out-of-date and vulnerable software and that senior executives had withheld from the board of directors information about the number of security breaches and lack of protection of user data. The same executives, he says, had consistently prioritised the growth of the number of users over data security. \u201cSenior management had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bot [automated] accounts because\u2026 they were concerned that if accurate measurements ever became public, it would harm the image and valuation of the company.\u201d He also describes how on various occasions in 2021 he \u201cwitnessed senior executives engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting board members, users and shareholders\u201d. In the end, the tensions between him and the chief executive became acute and he was sacked on 19 January. \u201cMr Zatko was fired from Twitter more than six months ago for poor performance and leadership,\u201d said Rebecca Hahn, Twitter\u2019s global vice-president of communications, the other day. \u201cAnd he now appears to be opportunistically seeking to inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders.\u201d All this is doubtless music to the ears of Elon Musk\u2019s lawyers as they struggle to find a way for their client to escape from his expensively misguided bid to buy Twitter. His excuse for changing his mind on the purchase is that he was misled by Twitter\u2019s executives about the prevalence of spam bots on the platform and Zatko\u2019s submission to the SEC seems to support that proposition, though doubtless the Delaware court hearing the arguments on both sides may conclude that one shouldn\u2019t make $44bn takeover bids without doing your own due diligence. Whatever happens in Delaware, Zatko\u2019s submission is likely to be a big headache for whoever winds up owning Twitter. Violating an FTC settlement is rarely a good career move. In 2011, for example, Facebook also had a brush with the commission after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company signed a consent decree promising to make the necessary reforms. It didn\u2019t and in 2019 it was back before the commission for failing to comply and was fined $5bn. So wouldn\u2019t it be entertaining if Elon Musk were eventually obliged to shell out the promised $44bn for Twitter and then find himself up before the FTC to receive a $5bn fine for the previous owners\u2019 non-compliance. What I\u2019ve been reading Picture this The Approaching Tsunami of Addictive AI-created Content Will Overwhelm Us is a sobering Substack post by Charles Arthur on the upsides and downsides of text-to-graphics engines such as Dall-E. Eye in the sky How Capitalism \u2013 Not a Few Bad Actors \u2013 Destroyed the Internet is a perceptive essay by Matthew Crain in the Boston Review about the rise of surveillance capitalism.

The postal ballot packs were due to be sent out from Monday to about 160,000 Tory members to choose between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. However, members have been informed the ballot papers will arrive later than scheduled and could arrive as late as 11 August. An email on Tuesday evening said: \u201cYour ballot is now on the way \u2013 but it will arrive with you a little later than we originally said. \u201cPlease do not worry.

The decision to delay the sending out of the ballots follows advice from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the UK\u2019s GCHQ listening post. An NCSC spokesperson said: \u201cDefending UK democratic and electoral processes is a priority for the NCSC and we work closely with all parliamentary political parties, local authorities and MPs to provide cybersecurity guidance and support. \u201cAs you would expect from the UK\u2019s national cybersecurity authority we provided advice to the Conservative party on security considerations for online leadership voting.\u201d The government communications headquarters, known as GCHQ, apparently warned of a security risk in which hackers could change Conservative members\u2019 ballots, according to the Daily Telegraph, which first reported the story. The email to Conservative party members states they will have the option to vote by post or online, with codes to be deactivated once the vote has been received for the latter option to reduce the \u201crisk of fraud\u201d. It adds: \u201cTo vote online, simply input the unique one-use codes printed on your ballot paper and fill in the security questions. Once used, your codes are invalid and you won\u2019t be able to re-enter the site. \u201cIf you decide to vote by post \u2026 once received by the ballot company we will deactivate your online codes.\u201d Sunak trails Truss in Tory membership polls, and while some recent polls have shown the gap to be narrowing a YouGov survey for the Times on Tuesday gave the foreign secretary 60% support with the former chancellor on 26%."

            "content": "Ofwat is not a complete patsy and is in the business of holding companies to account, the chief executive of the water regulator argued on the Today programme on Tuesday. David Black even waved a metaphorical big stick at a couple of firms. \u201cI think that companies like Thames and Southern really need to up their game,\u201d he said. He described Thames as \u201ca repeated poor performer\u201d. And he said Ofwat\u2019s \u00a3126m penalty on Southern in 2019 for wastewater and reporting breaches was instrumental in forcing a change of ownership last year. \u201cThat\u2019s an example of a company that performed poorly, that was held to account by Ofwat and the investors lost their shirt,\u201d argued Black. \u201cThat is exactly as it should be.\u201d What this breezy accounted omitted to mention, however, was that the Ofwat-approved rescuer of Southern Water was none other than Macquarie, the giant Australian financial outfit whose ownership of Thames from 2006 to 2017 was characterised by supercharged debt financing, heavy dividend extraction, missed leakage targets and a major sewage-dumping prosecution. Even Ofwat seemed to cheer when Macquarie left the capital; its chairman at the time called on the new owners to make \u201ca step-change\u201d in the way Thames \u201coperates and behaves\u201d. The decision to welcome back Macquarie at Southern, which serves 4.7 million people in Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight was therefore mystifying. The justification given was that Macquarie came bearing good intentions and a much-needed capital injection of \u00a31.07bn. Possible translation: Southern was in such a financial mess that any rescuer, whatever its previous record in the sector, was better than none. If so, that is not what most observers would describe as life proceeding \u201cexactly as it should be\u201d. Cut-price retailer Back in March, the board of Ted Baker rejected takeover proposals at 130p and 137.5p a share, saying they \u201csignificantly undervalued\u201d the fashion retailer. Five months later, and after laborious on-off talks with various parties, the directors are rolling over at 110p and declaring that \u201cfair value\u201d has been achieved for shareholders by submitting to a bid from US firm Authentic Brands. As a piece of negotiation, it\u2019s a shocker. It may also be a pragmatic concession. If half the shareholder base, including founder Ray Kelvin with his 11.5% stake, wish to take the cash, the board is in no position to resist. Besides there\u2019s the small matter of \u201cthe uncertain economic environment\u201d, as chair Helena Feltham put it. Yes, the consumer weather has taken a turn for the worse since March. All the same, submitting to a lowball \u00a3211m offer from a US turnaround merchant is a lacklustre way to bow out. Ted Baker was never a retailing powerhouse, but, in his day, Kelvin had carved out an interesting niche in the market. Profits warnings, accounting tangles and the \u201cforced hugs\u201d affair that forced his exit in 2019 changed the picture obviously, and then Covid arrived. But a recovery of sorts seemed to be under way. One can only assume the big shareholders, led by Toscafund and Schroders, are terrified about the possible impact of those economic uncertainties. They may be right to be so. Another net gain for the US? Farewell Darktrace, then? We hardly knew you, let alone understood how those cybersecurity tools work. Well, the takeover approach from US private equity firm Thoma Bravo isn\u2019t yet a formal offer, so it\u2019s too soon to say Darktrace\u2019s 15 months as a quoted company in London are drawing to a close. But the 24% leap in the share price says the market is betting the way. At 515p, producing a value of \u00a33.4bn, the share price has doubled since flotation. On the other hand, the peak was almost \u00a310, which shows how hard it is to value high-growth, loss-making firms in whizzy fields like cybersecurity. The other complication, of course, is Darktrace\u2019s links to shareholder and early backer Mike Lynch, the Autonomy founder fighting extradition to the US on fraud charges, which he denies. The company\u2019s listing in London seemed to be partly driven by a desire to demonstrate independence from Lynch but has never fully achieved that goal. As a multiple of revenues, Darktrace\u2019s value lags foreign peers\u2019. Therein lies a possible opportunity for a bidder to benefit from a clean break. Assuming, that is, UK ministers don\u2019t throw a few obstacles in the path of yet another US tech takeover. One assumes they won\u2019t, but it\u2019s not impossible."

            "date": "2022-08-10T07:00:45Z",
            "content": "Over the weekend, US Democrats overcame months of political struggle to pass the Inflation Reduction Act in the Senate, marking a major victory for the president, Joe Biden, and for \u201cBidenomics\u201d before the US midterms. The bill makes the single largest climate investment in US history, with $369bn for climate and clean energy. It is expected to enable the US to get two-thirds of the way towards its Paris agreement commitments while reducing energy costs. It lowers health costs for millions of Americans. It seeks to tackle inflation by directly reducing costs for individuals and by reducing the deficit through closing tax loopholes and increasing tax on corporates and the wealthy. The act is far from perfect. It is the diminished descendant of the failed Build Back Better Act, a $2tn package that would have radically extended childcare, free community college and subsidised health insurance, but which ultimately failed to secure the support of the Democrat senator Joe Manchin (a necessity given the evenly divided Senate). Winning political support for the act has required rowing back on climate ambition and more extensive plans to reduce costs for families; allowing further drilling for fossil fuels; and carve-outs to protect private equity profits from the corporation tax element of the act. For this reason, the act will and already has come under intense criticism from activists and climate groups. However, in the face of fierce political opposition it is a major \u2013 even landmark \u2013 achievement. It is also a win for the activists and economists who have been persistently pushing and providing ideas for the Biden administration to pursue an alternative approach to the economy and environment: market-shaping green industrial strategy to create good, green jobs; social investment; worker power and incentives for employers to offer decent pay, apprenticeships and profit-sharing with communities; higher taxes on the wealthy to reduce inflation and contribute to the costs, including through a new tax on share buybacks which only serve to boost investors\u2019 incomes. These ideas are no longer stuck on the bench. Historically the US and UK have taken a shared, leading role in the intellectual development and political implementation of new ideas and policy paradigms. Whether we think about the postwar Keynesian consensus, the neoliberal revolution of Thatcher and Reagan or the third way politics of Clinton and Blair, both countries have tended to move in lockstep. Yet right now, in the context of the Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the Conservative party leadership race in the UK, our policy paths are diverging. The US has further to go than the UK when it comes to reducing climate emissions and building economic justice. The US has significantly higher levels of emissions (on an absolute and per capita basis) than the UK and the US is also the world\u2019s biggest producer of fossil fuels. Similarly, inequality in the US is starker, and poverty deeper than in the UK. Put simply: the land of opportunity is not delivering for too many American citizens. But Democrat leaders are pushing through a bold agenda to break through deep political polarisation and reset the shape and direction of what US economic success looks like. The irony when we compare this with the UK is that the conditions are far more favourable here for action commensurate to the scale of the climate and nature crisis, an economic strategy that prioritises everyday people and places over wealth and profits, and for extending collective provision of the things and services we all rely on. We have a head start in terms of the social democracy basics. In sharp contrast to the US, there is more consensus across parties on the need for the government to take action on the climate and nature crises. Action taken now would be far less likely to be wiped away by an opposition win than the fragile progressive gains in the US. The Conservatives, who have held power for more than a decade, have in recent years flirted with some of those ideas \u2013 from May\u2019s mission-oriented industrial strategy to Johnson\u2019s net zero and levelling up pledges \u2013 recognising the electoral benefits of doing so. Yet at this moment, the Conservatives are plunging in the opposite direction to their US counterparts, and debating \u2013 in the middle of sharply rising inflation and a cost-of-living emergency \u2013 policies that are catnip for the Tory membership such as grammar schools and corporation tax cuts, rather than looking around the world or at the evidence on how to address the pressing problems of our time. Truss, widely seen as the frontrunner, has fallen back on outdated tropes of financial support as handouts and has virtually nothing to say on how she would achieve net zero, both for its own sake and as a response to the cost-of-living crisis. Nothing of substance is being suggested to address the creeping, real privatisation of the NHS as those who can go private rather than languish on a waiting list. It would be wrong to point at the US and claim it has its house in order or that lessons can be read in a simplistic way. But Biden and the activists and researchers around him are ambitiously forging a new kind of economic policymaking that seeks to rapidly decarbonise, reduce pressures on family purses through collective provision, and tax wealth and profits to fund this and quell inflationary pressures. The UK government \u2013 whoever it is headed by \u2013 should take note of the new economics rather than be left behind.

Financial markets have responded relatively calmly to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit and the military exercises that Beijing has ordered in response. The assumption is that China will put on a show of strength and leave it at that. However, its president, Xi Jinping, also has economic and financial weapons at his disposal and may choose to use them. At the milder end of the spectrum, China could make it more difficult for US companies to access its market. It will be in no hurry, for example, to allow Boeing to resume sales of its 737 Max planes. This would accelerate the decoupling of the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 a trend that began when Donald Trump was in the White House and has continued under Joe Biden. Hostility towards Beijing is one of the few things Republicans and Democrats agree on. There is the risk, though, that China could go further and exploit Taiwan\u2019s dependence on imported fuel by imposing a blockade on the island. As Mark Williams, the chief Asia analyst for Capital Economics, notes, this would soon cripple Taiwan\u2019s industry and cause \u201chuge global economic disruption\u201d. That is because the island manufactures roughly half the world\u2019s semiconductors, used in everything from mobile phones to cars and already running short. Restricting the export of chips would lead to supply bottlenecks, higher inflation and weaker growth. Inevitably, there would also be pressure on the US not only to impose economic sanctions and asset freezes but to intervene militarily as well. Financial markets are probably underestimating the risks posed by Taiwan. At the very least, business confidence is going to take a fresh hit. The chances of tit-for-tat trade restrictions have increased. There will be more pressure for national self-sufficiency to reduce dependency on global supply chains. And that\u2019s a relatively optimistic reading of events. There is clearly a risk \u2013 low but non-negligible \u2013 of this increasingly tense cold war turning hot. Oil prices appear to have further to fall There was a time when meetings of the oil cartel Opec were front-page news. When Sheikh Ahmed Yamani died last year, the obituaries made much of how, as Saudi Arabia\u2019s petroleum minister, he was a pivotal figure in determining the global price of crude. But that was all a long time ago. Opec is now Opec+ thanks to the addition of some new members, including Russia, but it no longer wields the influence over global energy markets it had in the 1970s and 80s. Oil prices are now well down on the levels they reached in the immediate aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and will probably fall further in the coming months. That has nothing to do with Wednesday\u2019s meaningless decision by Opec+ to increase the supply of crude by 100,000 barrels a day and everything to do with global demand. As the International Monetary Fund noted last week, all three of the world\u2019s major economies \u2013 the US, the eurozone and China \u2013 are stalling. Oil is trading at about $100 a barrel \u2013 a price consistent with strong global growth rather than the recession that is looming this winter. Whether or not Opec+ adds to the downward pressure by increasing production, oil prices look to have further to fall. That will be good news for UK motorists, provided of course the lower costs are passed on to them by the petrol retailers. Why regional pay for public sector workers is a duff idea Setting up regional pay boards to match the pay of public sector workers to local labour market conditions is the sort of proposal Liz Truss might have dreamed up when she was cutting her political teeth as the deputy director of the centre-right thinktank Reform. Nothing wrong in that. Thinktanks are there to come up with radical new proposals. Politicians, though, have to separate the good ideas from the duff ones, and regional pay for public sector workers falls squarely into the latter category. There are reasons for that. One is that cutting public sector pay would reduce spending power in parts of the country that suffer from low levels of demand. Another is the need to provide incentives for the brightest and the best to take up jobs outside London and the south-east. The proposal is bad economics and bad politics, which jars with the government\u2019s levelling up agenda. No wonder Truss dropped the idea within 24 hours of announcing it."

            "date": "2022-08-01T08:59:45Z",
            "content": "The Tory leadership candidate Rishi Sunak has rejected accusations from his successor as chancellor of being a \u201cdoomster\u201d on the economy, as he pushed his plan to cut income tax by 20% by the end of the decade. \u201cAs chancellor I was very keen to make sure that I started cutting taxes,\u201d Sunak told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve announced today builds on that, and that\u2019s because I believe in rewarding work and the best way for the government to signal that is to cut people\u2019s income tax.\u201d The current chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, announcing his support for Sunak\u2019s rival, Liz Truss, in the Daily Telegraph on Monday, said: \u201cLiz understands that the status quo isn\u2019t an option in times of crisis. \u201cTo quote the excellent economist Sam Bowman, we need a \u2018booster\u2019 attitude to the economy, not a \u2018doomster\u2019 one, in order to address cost of living woes and the challenges on the world stage. Liz will overturn the stale economic orthodoxy and run our economy in a Conservative way.\u201d When asked to respond to Zahawi\u2019s remarks, Sunak laughed and said: \u201cAs you can tell, I find it rather amusing.\u201d He pointed to his pro-Brexit credentials and economic assistance package during the Covid pandemic, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s my opponent in this contest who wants to stick with the failed orthodoxy of having these ultra-low corporation tax rates and, you know what, they don\u2019t work in increasing business investment in this country \u2013 we\u2019ve tried it for a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely different to doing things right now that would make the situation far worse and endanger people\u2019s mortgages,\u201d Sunak said, in an attack on Truss\u2019s ambitions to cut taxes immediately. Sunak is under pressure to make inroads into the lead opinion polls suggest Truss enjoys among the Tory members who will decide the next prime minister, as postal ballots begin dropping on Conservative doormats. In the latest YouGov poll, Truss holds the lead among Tory members, while the broader public favour Sunak at 28% to Truss\u2019s 25%, with 47% undecided. Sunak\u2019s proposed plan to cut income tax to 16p by the end of the next parliament would cost about \u00a36bn a year. As prime minister he said he wanted to cut income tax in a way that was \u201cresponsible\u201d by making sure it could be paid for, and is done so alongside economic growth. \u201cI don\u2019t think embarking on a spree of excessive borrowing at a time when inflation and interest rates are already on a rise would be wise,\u201d he added. It is the latest policy pledge called \u201canother U-turn\u201d by a Truss campaign source, after Sunak recently promised to cut VAT on energy bills, a policy he rejected in office. And the UK is projected to experience the lowest growth in the G20 \u2013 apart from Russia \u2013 and have the worst growth in the G7 at about 0.5%. \u201cThe public and Conservative party members can see through these flip-flops and U-turns,\u201d said the source. When asked to name another country that had raised taxes amid a cost of living squeeze, Sunak said \u201cevery country is going to be slightly different in how they deal with it\u201d, while emphasising the UK\u2019s publicly funded healthcare system through tax, and its growing backlogs. \u201cWhat she\u2019s suggesting is entirely sticking with the failed orthodoxy of the last 10 years,\u201d Sunak said of Truss\u2019s policy, adding that people were looking at the last months of Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership through rose-tinted spectacles. Addressing Johnson\u2019s behaviour and citing his resignation along with 60 MPs, Sunak said the government found itself on the \u201cwrong side of an ethical issue\u201d. In an attempt to regain public momentum, Sunak said: \u201cToday what you saw from me is an exciting, radical but realistic vision to cut taxes over the coming years.\u201d He pledged to address NHS backlogs, confront \u201cwoke culture\u201d, tackle illegal migration and take advantage of Brexit."

            "content": "Liz Truss will plunge the economy into an \u201cinflation spiral\u201d if she does not choose between her unfunded \u00a350bn tax cuts and providing cost of living support, her Conservative party leadership opponent, Rishi Sunak, has claimed. Sunak\u2019s leadership campaign said Truss would increase borrowing to \u201chistoric and dangerous levels\u201d and place public finances into \u201cserious jeopardy\u201d if she attempted to do both. The comments came after Truss, the frontrunner to be the next prime minister, signalled another U-turn with direct support for companies and households amid soaring energy bills this winter. In a statement, Sunak\u2019s campaign said: \u201cFollowing weeks of rejecting direct support payments as \u2018handouts\u2019, Truss supporters have slowly woken up to the reality of what winter brings. They now say that they will provide people with help \u2013 but what help, for who, when and how it will be paid for remains a mystery. \u201cThe reality is that Truss cannot deliver a support package as well as come good on \u00a350bn worth of unfunded, permanent tax cuts in one go. To do so would mean increasing borrowing to historic and dangerous levels, putting the public finances in serious jeopardy and plunging the economy into an inflation spiral.\u201d An ally of Sunak\u2019s, Kevin Hollinrake, also suggested people would be homeless \u201con the streets\u201d without further help to pay energy bills this winter. The MP for Thirsk and Malton told Sky News that promises by Truss\u2019s campaign to cut taxes would provide only an extra \u201cpound a week\u201d to the poorest households, whereas it would provide \u201cto the tune of about 30 a week\u201d to a household like his. \u201cIt is simply not right,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people are going to be on the streets. Things are going to be that bad for some households.\u201d The row comes before Ofgem\u2019s announcement on Friday when the regulator is expected to increase the cap on energy bills from \u00a31,971 to about \u00a33,600. The former chancellor\u2019s team also commented on reports that Truss was not planning to ask the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for a forecast ahead of the emergency budget she is planning for next month. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder they want to avoid independent scrutiny of the OBR in their emergency budget \u2013 they know you can\u2019t do both and it\u2019s time they came clean about that now,\u201d Sunak\u2019s campaign said. Another Sunak supporter, Mel Stride, said Truss\u2019s plans for an emergency budget needed to be transparent and affordable so ministers were not \u201cflying blind\u201d. The Commons Treasury committee chair told LBC: \u201cAt the moment the Liz camp are saying I believe that there will not be any OBR forecast produced at that time and that is kind of like flying blind. \u201cIt means that you do all these dramatic things on tax etc but you don\u2019t actually know what the independent forecaster believes the impact will be on the public finances and I think that is quite a serious situation were that to come about.\u201d Sunak\u2019s attack on Truss\u2019s policies came after Michael Gove said in an article for the Times that Truss was on a \u201choliday from reality\u201d with her plans for tax cuts during an economic crisis as he endorsed Sunak. Gove, who was levelling up secretary until being sacked by Boris Johnson before his resignation as Tory leader, said Truss\u2019s vision put the \u201cstock options of FTSE 100 executives\u201d before the country\u2019s poorest. By contrast, the business secretary came to Truss\u2019s defence, saying there would be support for the poorest households regarding the cost of living crisis. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Kwasi Kwarteng said: \u201cI understand the deep anxiety this is causing. As winter approaches, millions of families will be concerned about how they are going to make ends meet. But I want to reassure the British people that help is coming.\u201d Truss expressed optimism for the economy, saying there was \u201ctoo much talk that there\u2019s going to be a recession\u201d as she insisted an economic slump was not inevitable despite the Bank of England\u2019s forecast. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday, she said she was looking at help \u201cacross the board\u201d in a hint that there could be more support for businesses and households. So far she has focused on cutting taxes, such as an immediate reversal of the national insurance increase, while Sunak has focused on trying to bring down soaring inflation."

            "content": "Uber\u2019s push into patient transport has renewed calls to regulate the gig economy with minimum pay and conditions. On Friday the rideshare company launched Uber Health in Australia to provide non-emergency transport for medical appointments, competing with state-based taxi voucher schemes. The new service will allow doctors and medical centres to schedule, manage and pay for rides for patients and caregivers in one digital hub, allowing riders to access transport even without a smartphone. Sam Brown, head of Uber for business ANZ, said the services would \u201chelp streamline healthcare transport, reduce the strain missed appointments cause, and improve the overall patient experience\u201d. \u201cUber Health helps to reduce transportation as a barrier to care for those who may not otherwise have their own way to get to or from an important appointment, and is also just one of the ways we\u2019re working to create new earning opportunities for driver-partners.\u201d The expansion comes ahead of September\u2019s jobs and skills summit, at which the Albanese government will receive input into its policy to give the Fair Work Commission powers to order minimum conditions in the gig economy. Unions have sought to challenge gig economy companies\u2019 claims their workers are independent contractors, not employees. But a recent high court decision giving primacy to the form of the contract rather than patterns of work has left regulation the best chance to improve workers\u2019 conditions. In July the Transport Workers Union and Uber struck an in-principle deal recognising the need for minimum earnings for drivers to achieve cost recovery, and improved dispute resolution processes for drivers removed from the platform. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said Uber\u2019s expansion into patient transport makes \u201cclear the gig model of work will pervade every aspect of our lives, which is why it is so critical to get urgent reform in place and in the right way\u201d. \u201cThrough an absence of regulation in Australia, the gig economy has caused an erosion of workplace rights that has led to deaths, injuries, unfair sackings and workers ripped off the minimum wage,\u201d he said. In July Guardian Australia revealed Uber understood it was operating illegally when it launched in Australia and fiercely lobbied governments to legalise its local operations. In a jobs and skills summit issues paper, released on Wednesday, the Treasury noted in 2019 about 250,000 people worked in the gig economy. It said that although the gig economy \u201cshould offer greater options to both businesses and workers \u2026 there are pressing concerns about their impact on job security and wages\u201d. \u201cMany workers in Australia experience significant income variability and need to work multiple jobs to cover their cost of living,\u201d it said. \u201cThere are significant concerns that the current workplace arrangements underpinning the gig economy may be restricting the rights of some workers.\u201d"

            "date": "2022-08-17T05:38:40Z",
            "content": "Good morning. Like Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson, I\u2019ve had a lovely summer holiday; unlike them, nobody seems to have been that bothered by my absence. With apologies to those who were hoping for more from Nimo, I\u2019m writing to you this morning with news breaking in the US state of Wyoming, where Representative Liz Cheney, one of the few Republicans to hold Donald Trump accountable for the January 6 insurrection, has been handed an absolute drubbing. In the last couple of hours, Cheney conceded defeat in the primary contest for her seat in the US House of Representatives to Trump\u2019s preferred revenge candidate, standing 37 points behind Harriet Hageman with 95% of precincts reporting. Two years ago, Cheney won her primary with 73% of the vote. Hageman will go forward to the midterm elections in November \u2013 and with Democrats nowhere in Wyoming, she will be returned as the state\u2019s sole congressional representative. Cheney\u2019s defeat means that Washington DC will lose its most authoritative and best-known Republican critic of Trump \u2013 and yet some Democrats are willing to bet that the more extreme their opponents, the better they will do. Today\u2019s newsletter, with the help of David Smith reporting from Wyoming, is about Liz Cheney \u2013 and what her result tells us about Trump\u2019s continuing influence over the Republican party and American politics. That\u2019s right after the headlines. Five big stories Conservatives | An audio recording leaked to the Guardian has revealed that Liz Truss said British workers lacked the \u201cskill and application\u201d of their overseas counterparts and needed \u201cmore graft\u201d. Her campaign claimed the recording of Truss \u2013 who has accused her critics of \u201ctalking Britain down\u201d \u2013 \u201clacked context\u201d. Farming | UK food tsar Henry Dimbleby has said reducing the consumption of meat and dairy is the only way to sustainably farm in England and avoid ecological breakdown. Ukraine | Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating \u201cchaos within Russian forces\u201d by striking at supply lines deep into occupied territories, a key adviser to Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Guardian. Inflation | The real value of wages in the UK dropped by 3% in June, the fastest fall in 20 years, as inflation continues to outpace average pay. Culture | The former Pop Idol contestant and theatre star Darius Campbell Danesh has died at the age of 41. His family said Danesh died at his apartment in Rochester, Minnesota and that the cause of death was as yet unknown. In depth: What went down in Wyoming Liz Cheney is, by almost any measure, as conservative as they come. She opposes abortion rights, denies that human activity is responsible for the climate crisis and supports tax cuts for the wealthy. When Trump was president, she voted with him 93% of the time. All of which would appear to make her a solid match for Wyoming, which last elected a Democrat to her congressional seat in 1976. But Cheney differed from what now counts as the GOP mainstream on one crucial subject: the result of the 2020 presidential election, and in particular Donald Trump\u2019s responsibility for the events that followed on January 6. She went on to be vice-chair and the most prominent voice of the House January 6 select committee, and, in the face of credible and numerous death threats, become an unlikely hero for Democrats nostalgic for a bygone age of (some) principled, bipartisan politics. But close to 70% of Wyoming voters went for Trump in 2020, and 70% of Republicans across the US believe his false claim that the election was stolen. As a direct result, Cheney will be out of a job on 3 January next year. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much of a note of sadness or disappointment in her concession speech,\u201d said David Smith, speaking shortly after attending Cheney\u2019s campaign event in Jackson, Wyoming. \u201cShe knew this was coming.\u201d Even so, \u201cit\u2019s worth remembering how unthinkable this would have been a couple of years ago. It\u2019s another symbolic indicator of how Trump has transformed his party.\u201d *** What happened last night? The margin against Cheney, even bigger than polls had suggested, represents an \u201cabsolutely crushing victory for Trump,\u201d David said. \u201cThere\u2019s no two ways about it. We\u2019ve talked about what these primaries show us about Trump\u2019s influence all year, but Wyoming was always the most watched.\u201d For a sense of how deeply Cheney is opposed in her state, see David\u2019s dispatch published on Saturday, and this line from one critic: \u201cShe\u2019s going to \u2018educate\u2019 us in the constitution and how \u2018we\u2019re wrong and she\u2019s right.\u2019 Well ... She\u2019s gonna find out if she educated us or not.\u201d While Trump\u2019s false claims about the election and his role in the January 6 riot were clearly a crucial factor here, David also notes that Cheney\u2019s opponents sought to argue that she was \u201cinterested in Washington over Wyoming, and had forgotten her constituents. And to some extent she leaned into that \u2013 she wasn\u2019t discussing Wyoming policy at her concession speech, she was talking about the big national picture.\u201d *** How does the result in Wyoming fit into the wider story? One measure of the big picture for Republican critics of Trump, and of his enduring influence, might be an analysis of the fates of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol riot. Of those 10, four including Cheney have lost their primaries, four have retired and just two have survived. As David wrote last week, Cheney\u2019s result can be seen as \u201ca final national pivot away from the Bush-era establishment to the Make America Great Again movement \u2013 from old school conservatism to far-right populism.\u201d Symbolically enough, David pointed out, Cheney\u2019s father Dick, \u201cDarth Vader of the Bush era himself,\u201d was present last night \u201cto see his daughter crushed by the MAGA movement. If you were looking for symbols, that\u2019s pretty on-the-nose.\u201d Trump hasn\u2019t had it all his own way in 2022, David added, and the different outcomes are indicative of the contrasting political landscapes in deep red states like Wyoming and other more balanced races. \u201cIn Georgia, for example, the candidates he endorsed flopped,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he\u2019s had a surge in congressional primaries recently. After some speculation that his grip is weakening, he\u2019s reasserted himself.\u201d *** Where does that leave Democrats? Grim as the depth of Republicans\u2019 commitment to Trumpism is for American democracy, it isn\u2019t necessarily the worst news for Joe Biden \u2013 or, at least, that\u2019s what Democrats appear to think. One notable feature of this primary season (in races more likely to be competitive in November than Wyoming) has been Democratic funding of ads designed to elevate the chances of the most extreme Republican candidates, in the hope of ensuring unelectable opponents. The jury\u2019s out on whether that\u2019s a good idea. In a piece on that strategy last week, Lauren Gambino quoted Richard Hasen, director of the Safeguarding Democracy project, who said that at a moment when the stolen election myth is such a potent force in American politics, the Democrats\u2019 approach is \u201cimmoral and dangerous\u201d. While Biden has endured dismal poll ratings, the picture has gotten a little better in recent weeks, with many on his own side appearing newly motivated by the supreme court\u2019s ruling to overturn Roe v Wade and the unexpected passage of a $739bn healthcare and climate bill. That has changed the political weather: polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight still expects Republicans to win the House, but it now views Democrats as slight favourites to keep control of the Senate. (One reason why, as Adam Gabbatt lays out here, is the calibre of some of the celebrity candidates the GOP has chosen.) Even if this helps in November, though, Cheney\u2019s result and the Democratic strategy still point to the looming threat in 2024: a national election where Republican positions are defined by their most extreme anti-democratic voices \u2013 with Trump himself at the top of the ticket. *** What will Cheney do next? Cheney appeared to have accepted the inevitably of her defeat some time ago. An ad featuring her father excoriating Trump appeared more likely to appeal to a national audience than the party faithful at home. She has stayed in Washington when she might have been expected to be campaigning on the ground in Wyoming. And she has held back much of her considerable war chest. Cheney will keep her role on the January 6 committee for the rest of the year. Many suspect that one reason she kept some money back is a larger ambition in the future: a run at the presidency. In her concession speech, she dropped a clear hint about that prospect, saying: \u201cAbraham Lincoln was defeated in elections for the Senate and House before he won the most important election of all.\u201d Most analysts believe that she would be a long-shot candidate \u2013 and, as this Washington Post piece reports, she is herself \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about her prospects. Instead, she may see her possible role as a spoiler for Trump should he run again. But as David also noted: \u201cThe Cheneys always play a very long game. Her father was chief of staff to Gerald Ford decades before he was vice president. I assume Liz Cheney will view this as one setback in a very long story.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading Oliver Wainwright spoke to the architects who believe that \u201cdemolition is an act of violence\u201d and are breathing new life into old buildings instead.

The person who bought the CD made it their mission to find out who was behind the album. Thus began Panchiko\u2019s journey into the cultural zeitgeist. For years, internet sleuths looked for Panchiko \u2013 and eventually found them. The former bandmates were shocked that, after all these years, they had, without their knowledge, acquired a dedicated fanbase. Now in their 40s, the band have come together for a US tour that is already partly sold out. Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday Bored at work?

            "title": "Billions in \u2018dark money\u2019 is influencing US politics. We need disclosure laws | David Sirota and Joel Warner",
            "date": "2022-08-29T10:19:23Z",
            "content": "This week, the Lever, ProPublica and the New York Times discovered the largest known political advocacy donation in American history. We exposed a reclusive billionaire\u2019s secret transfer of $1.6bn to a political group controlled by the Republican operative Leonard Leo, who spearheaded the construction of a conservative supreme court supermajority to end abortion, block government regulations, stymie the fight against climate change and limit voting rights. This anonymous donation \u2013 which flowed to a tax-exempt trust that was never disclosed in any public record or database \u2013 was probably completely legal. Whether you support or abhor Leo\u2019s crusade, we should be able to agree on one larger non-partisan principle: such enormous sums of money should not be able to influence elections, lawmakers, judicial nominations and public policy in secret. And we should not have to rely on a rare leak to learn basic campaign finance facts that should be freely available to anyone. Unfortunately, thanks to our outdated laws, those facts are now hidden behind anonymity, shell companies and shadowy political groups. America is long overdue for an overhaul of its political disclosure laws \u2013 and news organizations in particular should be leading the charge for reform. In the early 1970s, leaks and shoe-leather reporting by news organizations uncovered the Watergate scandal \u2013 the modern era\u2019s foundational dark money expos\u00e9. That debacle birthed the original federal disclosure laws and a golden age of journalism. For a time, the new statutes allowed campaign finance reporting to become systematic, methodical and based on required disclosures, rather than sporadic, random and reliant on the goodwill of courageous whistleblowers. A half-century later, however, the dark money practices of 50 years ago have again become normalized. In 2020 alone, more than $1bn worth of dark money flooded around weak disclosure rules and into America\u2019s elections, financing Super Pacs, ad blitzes, mailers and door-knocking campaigns. As millions of votes were swayed, reporters and the public had no knowledge of the money sources, or what policies they were buying. Heading into the 2022 election, the situation is getting worse. The two parties\u2019 major Senate and House Super Pacs are all being funded by anonymous dark money groups that are not required to disclose their donors. These problems aren\u2019t unique to the campaign arena. Front groups are also shaping public policy, leaving reporters unable to tell voters who exactly is funding what. In the last few years, an anonymously funded group used post-election ads to successfully pressure lawmakers to water down landmark healthcare legislation designed to eliminate so-called \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills. Similarly, Leo\u2019s anonymously funded network spent tens of millions to boost the nomination campaigns of three conservative supreme court justices, after leading a campaign supporting Republicans\u2019 refusal to hold a vote on Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 high court nominee, Merrick Garland. To be sure, news outlets can still cover the shrinking portion of the political finance system that still discloses some money flows to politicians, lobbyists and advocacy groups. And thankfully, there are occasionally disclosures like the Leo leak, which provide a fleeting glimpse into the real forces influencing sweeping policy decisions. But for every sporadic leak, there are scores of secret donors systematically funneling ever more dark money into elections and legislative campaigns without ever being exposed \u2013 and they are reaping the rewards of corrupted public policy. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is there is already a legislative blueprint for reform. The Disclose Act, sponsored by the Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse, would force dark money groups to disclose any of their donors who give more than $10,000, require shell companies spending money on elections to disclose their owners, and mandate that election ads list their sponsors\u2019 major contributors. These requirements would extend not only to election-related activity, but also to campaigns to influence governmental decisions \u2013 including judicial nominations. A separate Whitehouse bill would additionally require donor disclosure from shadowy groups lobbying the supreme court through amicus briefs designed to tilt judicial rulings without letting the public know which billionaire or CEO\u2019s thumb is on the scale. And other pending legislation would finally allow the Securities and Exchange Commission to require major corporations to more fully disclose their political spending. Journalists should proudly advocate for laws like these, which allow us to tell the public what its government is doing. Our industry has done that before in defending open records laws, and we must do it now in advocating for new campaign finance disclosure rules. In practice, that means reporters elevating the transparency issue and demanding answers from politicians about where they stand on disclosure laws \u2013 rather than ignoring or downplaying the rising tide of dark money now shaping every public policy in America. It means newspaper editorial boards advocating for campaign finance reform. It means media organizations lobbying for stronger disclosure laws at the federal, state and local levels. It means the journalism industry participating in \u2013 and at times leading \u2013 this fight, rather than using objectivity as a cop-out. This battle to update campaign finance disclosure laws and bring sunlight to the darkest of dark money already faces powerful opponents. In recent years, the US Chamber of Commerce and Koch Industries \u2013 which represent some of America\u2019s biggest dark money spenders \u2013 have been lobbying against the Disclose Act, preventing it from advancing for more than a decade. The Koch network recently convinced the supreme court\u2019s conservative bloc to strike down a California law requiring non-profit dark money groups to at least disclose their major donors to state tax regulators, after spending to back some of those justices\u2019 confirmations to the court. Most recently, conservative groups and Republican state attorneys general have been trying to block a proposal to force companies to disclose greenhouse gas emissions by arguing that it is unlawful \u201ccompelled speech\u201d \u2013 a preview of the argument they might use against new campaign finance transparency legislation. Just as alarming, segments of the journalism industry itself have opposed transparency efforts. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) \u2014 which represents the major media outlets making huge profits off of dark money ads \u2014 tried to block a rule at the Federal Election Commission a decade ago to require TV and radio stations to disclose ad buys from political groups, arguing it would cost them advertising revenue. The NAB has recently successfully opposed the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s requirements that broadcasters disclose when foreign governments sponsor material. NAB is right now lobbying on the Disclose Act. But this week\u2019s revelations about history\u2019s largest dark-money donation should be an alarm telling us that the status quo must change \u2013 and indeed it can change, even within the confines of the supreme court\u2019s own precedents. In the landmark Citizens United ruling that unleashed the modern era of big money politics, the majority noted that while it was unwilling to permit political spending restrictions, it still held that \u201cgovernment may regulate corporate political speech through disclaimer and disclosure requirements\u201d. Those requirements are so desperately needed now \u2013 for the free press to play its vital role, and for voters to make informed decisions when they go to the polls. But the only chance it will happen is if news outlets and reporters get off the sidelines and enter the battle to secure what they need to do their jobs \u2013 and what we all need to preserve our democracy.

            "title": "US political violence is surging, but talk of a civil war is exaggerated \u2013 isn\u2019t it?",
            "date": "2022-08-20T06:05:31Z",
            "content": "Dr Garen Wintemute used to laugh off warnings of a civil war coming to America as \u201ccrazy talk\u201d. Then the emergency room doctor in California saw the figures for gun sales. Wintemute, who founded a centre to research firearms violence after years of treating gunshot wounds, had long observed that the rush to buy weapons came in waves, often around a presidential election. Always it fell back again. \u201cThen in January of 2020 gun sales took off. Just an unprecedented surge in purchasing and that surge continued,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were aware that, contrary to prior surges, this one wasn\u2019t ending. People are still buying guns like crazy.\u201d Many were buying a weapon for the first time. Wintemute wanted answers and they stunned him. A survey for his California Firearm Violence Research Center released last month showed that half of Americans expect a civil war in the United States in the next few years. One in five thought political violence was justified in some circumstances. In addition, while almost everyone said it was important for the US to remain a democracy, about 40% said that having a strong leader was more important. \u201cCoupled with prior research, these findings suggest a continuing alienation from and mistrust of American democratic society and its institutions. Substantial minorities of the population endorse violence, including lethal violence, to obtain political objectives,\u201d the report concluded. Suddenly Wintemute didn\u2019t think talk of a violent civil conflict was so crazy any more. The doctor is quick to note that large numbers of those people expecting a civil war say it is only \u201csomewhat likely\u201d. But half of the population even considering such a possibility reflects the failing confidence of large numbers of Americans in a system of government under assault by Donald Trump and a good part of the Republican party. The FBI\u2019s search of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence earlier this month for classified documents removed from the White House unleashed the latest barrage of threats of violence, this time directed at an institution widely regarded as a bastion of establishment conservatism. The Florida senator Rick Scott likened the FBI to the Gestapo. In Ohio, the police killed an armed US navy veteran who attacked an FBI office. In Pennsylvania, a man with a history of vaccine denial was charged with threatening to \u201cslaughter\u201d federal agents he described as \u201cpolice state scum\u201d, and compared to the Nazi SS and the Soviet secret police. In the days after the search of Mar-a-Lago, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned of a surge in threats of violence against federal agents, their families and the judge who issued the search warrant. The FBI said these included calls for \u201ccivil war\u201d and \u201carmed rebellion\u201d. That comes on top of a wave of threats against election workers since Trump alleged he was robbed of victory by fraud in 2020, and a sharp increase in intimidation of others in public service from school board members to librarians as well as elected politicians. Wintemute said that the surge in violent threats is made more potent by rising weapons sales. \u201cWhat happens when you take a society that is increasingly fearful for its future, increasingly polarised, increasingly angry at itself, and throw a bunch of guns into the mix?\u201d he said. \u2018Willing to harm other Americans for their political beliefs\u2019 Many Americans flinch at talk of civil war because it recalls the bloodiest conflict in their history. The threat of violent conflict in the US also looks very different from the wars once fought by guerrillas in Latin America and Africa, or during the breakup of Yugoslavia. But Rachel Kleinfeld, a specialist in civil conflict at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that does not mean it cannot happen. \u201cCountries with democracies and governments as strong as America\u2019s do not fall into civil war. But if our institutions weaken, the story could be different,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat most worries me right now is polling that suggests somewhere between 20% and 40% of Americans would like a strongman leader who doesn\u2019t have to follow the democratic rules. That would allow institutions to weaken and an insurgency like the Troubles in Northern Ireland could break out.\u201d The parallel with Northern Ireland may jar but recent polling suggests it is not unwarranted. In 1973, in the midst of some of the worst years of the Troubles, one in five people in Northern Ireland agreed that \u201cviolence is a legitimate way to achieve one\u2019s goals\u201d. Half a century later, a similar proportion of Republican voters in the US say that it is \u201cjustified to use political violence to accomplish political goals\u201d. A more complex picture emerges when the numbers are broken down, including over whether such violence is targeted against people or property. But even then Kleinfeld said the results are disturbing. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at 3 to 5 million Americans willing to harm other Americans for their political beliefs,\u201d she said. \u2018Politicians\u2019 attacks on the system\u2019 The US has a long history of political violence and killings, including bombing campaigns by radical leftwing organisations in the 1970s and more recent attacks from the right by anti-abortion groups and white nationalists. The country\u2019s deadliest domestic terrorist attack, the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, was perpetrated by members of an anti-government militia. But now the greatest threat to political stability comes from within the power structure including Republican politicians subverting the electoral system and further eroding trust in democracy. Trump\u2019s allegation that the 2020 presidential election was stolen unleashed actual and threatened violence from the storming of the Capitol to the barrage of threats to kill election workers. The justice department set up a special taskforce to protect election officials after more than 1,000 were directly threatened over their unwillingness to declare Trump the winner in 2020. Many have quit or intend to do so before the 2024 presidential election because of \u201cpoliticians\u2019 attacks on the system and stress\u201d. Wintemute said that with the attack on election workers has come a parallel effort by Republican leaders to weight the electoral system in their favour through gerrymandering and obstacles to voting in swing states that further undermines confidence in democracy. \u201cOne of the great ironies is that there is the false narrative that the election was rigged which is being used in order to set up a rigged election in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats see democracy is under threat because of authoritarianism from the right and the prospect of stolen midterms and the infrastructure that\u2019s been setting up for a stolen presidential election in 2024. For the right, it already happened. Many people in our survey say 2020 was stolen. So their point of view is that the threat has been realised. It\u2019s hard to see a good way out.\u201d To Kleinfeld that in part explains the significant numbers of Democrats also prepared to justify political violence in certain circumstances \u2013 13% compared with 20% of Republicans. She said that, nonetheless, actual acts of violence are almost entirely from one side. \u201cWhat that suggests is that the American people are very frustrated with our democracy, and don\u2019t think it\u2019s working. But Republicans think they can get away with violence, and it\u2019s being normalised by their leaders, whereas Democratic leaders are keeping a check on their side. But that\u2019s not to say that will be forever,\u201d she said. Underpinning all of this are America\u2019s changing demographics and the diminishing of white political power. Wintemute\u2019s survey showed that one in three people buys into the far right \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory that white Americans are being supplanted by minorities \u2013 cited by the murderers of dozens of people in recent massacres from Texas to New York state. The \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory is also regularly aired on Fox News. Lilliana Mason, the author of Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity, said the election of the US\u2019s first black president, Barack Obama, in 2008 made race \u201ca really salient issue\u201d for many white voters. \u201cThen Trump said the quiet part out loud. He started using overtly racist and misogynistic language and creating a permission structure for his supporters to become much more aggressive and intentionally offensive in their rhetoric. That really encouraged not just uncivil behaviour but broke all of these social norms that we had previously considered to be sacred,\u201d she said. Trump\u2019s embrace of white nationalist groups, such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, also brought armed militias into mainstream politics, helping them to infiltrate local police forces and the military. In December, three retired US generals said that Trumpism has infected parts of the armed forces and noted the \u201cdisturbing number of veterans and active-duty members of the military\u201d who took part in the attack on the Capitol. They warned of the \u201cpotential for lethal chaos inside our military\u201d if the result of 2024 presidential election is disputed. \u201cThe potential for a total breakdown of the chain of command along partisan lines \u2013 from the top of the chain to squad level \u2013 is significant should another insurrection occur. The idea of rogue units organizing among themselves to support the \u2018rightful\u2019 commander in chief cannot be dismissed,\u201d they wrote \u201cIt really does feel a pivotal moment in in American democracy,\u201d says Mason. \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to see more violence. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see less in the immediate future. But, ultimately, the way Americans respond to that violence will determine whether it can be calmed down or whether it spirals out of control.\u201d Kleinfeld said she is not optimistic. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where if the Trumpist faction wins, I think we\u2019ll see sustained extremely high levels of violence for the foreseeable future. And if they lose, I think it\u2019ll be worse,\u201d she said."

            "title": "Election denialism remains powerful in Republican politics | The fight to vote",
            "date": "2022-08-04T10:00:05Z",
            "content": "Hello, and Happy Thursday, I\u2019m writing this as we\u2019re still digesting the results of Tuesday\u2019s primary elections in several states, the latest test of whether Republican candidates who have embraced lies about the 2020 election can get the backing of GOP voters. So far, the results only add to the considerable evidence showing election denialism remains remarkably powerful in Republican politics. One of the most consequential results on Tuesday was in Arizona, where Mark Finchem, a state lawmaker, easily won the Republican nomination to run for secretary of state, a position from which he would oversee elections. Few people in Arizona have fought as aggressively to overturn the 2020 election as Finchem has \u2013 he first tried to block Congress from recognizing Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate victory in the state, and has since sought to spread misinformation and decertify the election, which is not possible. Finchem now joins Kristina Karamo in Michigan, Jim Marchant in Nevada, and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania as Republican nominees on the verge of claiming offices where they would have enormous power over elections (Karamo and Marchant are running for secretary of state, Mastriano is running for governor, where he would get to appoint the secretary of state). So far, three of the four secretary of state candidates Trump has endorsed have won (the one exception came in Georgia\u2019s primary). \u201cHaving even one election denier in a statewide office would be a five-alarm fire for our elections,\u201d Joanna Lydgate, CEO of States United Action, which is tracking election deniers running for office, said in a statement. \u201cRecent primaries \u2013 particularly in Arizona and Michigan \u2013 should worry all of us as Americans. But voters have the power here. They can slow this trend in the primaries to come, and they can stop it in its tracks in the general election.\u201d Before Tuesday\u2019s vote, Finchem, who was endorsed by Trump, encouraged supporters to congregate at voting sites to watch for wrongdoing. \u201cStand 75ft away from the entrance of the polls,\u201d Finchem told a crowd recently, according to the Arizona Mirror. \u201cThe mere fact that you are there watching scares the hell out of them.\u201d \u201cIf Mark Finchem is victorious this November, it could jeopardize the integrity of the 2024 presidential election and possibly could subvert the will of the people for years to come,\u201d Ellen Kurtz, the founder and president of iVote, a liberal group focused on voting rights and elections, said in a statement. \u201cNo one who attempts to stop the peaceful transfer of power by attending a violent, deadly attack on our Capitol deserves to be on any ballot.\u201d There\u2019s deep concern that these officials, if elected, could use the power of their office to attempt to overturn the results of a valid election. Last week, I asked Chuck Coughlin, a Republican consultant in Arizona, what he thought Finchem would do if he was in charge of a future election and the result was in doubt. \u201cHe would not fall in line. He would follow the Donald Trump script of doing everything possible to be a disrupter if the election outcome is anything but what he wanted. I don\u2019t see any go-along-to-get-along in Mark Finchem,\u201d he told me. Kari Lake, a Republican who made election denialism a pillar of her campaign, also is leading in the Arizona governor\u2019s race. Votes are still being counted, but if she wins, it would place election denialism front and center in a state where top Republicans have aggressively embraced it. There was one other big victory for Trump on Tuesday. Rusty Bowers, the term-limited GOP speaker of the Arizona House, lost his primary to a Trump-backed challenger in a state senate race. Bowers played a central role in rebuffing Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election in his state and was censured by the state GOP after he testified in front of the panel investigating the January 6 attack. Acknowledging the headwinds he faced for going against the former president, Bowers told NBC before the primary it would be a \u201cmiracle\u201d if he won. Also worth watching \u2026 Arizona\u2019s attorney general debunked a claim from Cyber Ninjas that nearly 300 dead people could have voted in the 2020 election in Arizona Some voters were stealing pens from voting sites in Arizona, egged on by a conspiracy theory A retired supreme court justice hired by Wisconsin Republicans to review the 2020 race publicly said in March lawmakers should consider decertifying the race. Privately, he said doing so was \u201ca practical impossibility\u201d."

            "date": "2022-08-28T16:35:00Z",
            "content": "You report that the Tories are now in \u201cdisarray\u201d over their response to the energy crisis (Tories in disarray over energy crisis as Truss urged to spell out plans to help, 26 August). On reading this, I found myself reflecting on the frenzy of media and public hostility to the socialist policies of the would-be Corbyn government in the run-up to the 2019 election: nationalisation of essential utilities (water and energy come to mind), provision of much-needed funding for care and the NHS (now on its knees), a building programme of much-needed truly affordable housing. I wonder how many people who were persuaded that those socialist proposals were an affront to their liberty are now wishing they had an opportunity of a rerun. I for one would be delighted to see a government in power now that would indeed support \u201cthe many, not the few\u201d, as opposed to a corrupt and self-seeking shambles of a government who are only interested in seeing more and more wealth accruing to the few. Dr Fiona McMillan Spaxton, Somerset \u2022 The chancellor of the exchequer, Nadim Zahawi, says: \u201cThe reality is that we should all look at our energy consumption. It is a difficult time.\u201d I\u2019d just like to remind your readers that Zahawi has an estimated wealth of up to \u00a3100m, and is so concerned about energy consumption that he once claimed taxpayers\u2019 money in expenses to heat the stables for his little horsies (although he later said that this was a mistake and that he would repay the money). If you believe in any way that he includes himself in the \u201cwe\u201d in that statement about energy consumption, or that this time will be at all difficult for him, you might be interested in this delightful garden bridge I have for sale, only one previous owner. Iain Rowan Sunderland \u2022 Could you please be meticulous in ensuring that language such as Liz Truss\u2019s favourite term \u201chandouts\u201d is set within quotation marks when referring to people\u2019s entitlements or the government\u2019s obligations? Recently, with increasing frequency, \u201chandouts\u201d appears without quotation marks (Rising energy bills put millions of UK households at risk of winter catastrophe, 26 August; These are energy bills many Britons simply can\u2019t afford. Some will pay with their lives, 26 August). Our social contract requires our government to support people in hard times. This is a duty, not \u201chandouts\u201d. One of the many worrying things about the current Conservative leadership campaign is that the extensive media coverage of it risks making some very rightwing ideas seem like the new normal, tilting common parlance to the right. The Guardian shouldn\u2019t enable this. Marcia Saunders London \u2022 The government is likely to give financial support to help people to pay their bills. Good. But where does this money come from and where does it go? It comes, of course, from the taxpayer, and it goes to the energy companies \u2013 so their massive profits are subsidised by us. The solution surely is not to give in to these companies, but stand up to them \u2013 as the French are doing. Liz Truss says she is against handouts \u2013 but isn\u2019t she proposing the biggest handouts in history to these privatised companies? Leonard Freeman Cambridge \u2022 You note what might happen in an ideal world in respect of energy prices (Editorial, 26 August). In such a world, socialist rather than capitalist priorities would apply and people would come before profit. However, before we get there, a moral economy \u2013 a popular practice in the 18th century, where there are fair prices and just wages \u2013 would be a step forward.

            "title": "Liz Cheney considers run for president after Republican primary defeat",
            "date": "2022-08-17T13:43:36Z",
            "content": "Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney has announced she is considering her own run for the White House in an all-out effort to prevent Donald Trump from winning another term as US president. Cheney decisively lost her Republican primary race on Tuesday night and will lose her seat in the US Congress. The Trump-backed challenger, Harriet Hageman, beat Cheney by almost 40 points as Wyoming voters took revenge for her vote to impeach Trump and for focusing on her role on the January 6 House select committee. The panel, of which Cheney is vice-chair and one of only two Republicans, is investigating Trump\u2019s role in fomenting the insurrection at the US Capitol by his supporters on 6 January 2021, in a vain attempt to stay in office following his defeat by Joe Biden. Cheney was asked on NBC\u2019s Today show on Wednesday morning whether she was thinking of running for president. She did not respond to the question directly but, when pressed a second time, admitted she was. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019m thinking about, and I\u2019ll make a decision in the coming months,\u201d she said. On Tuesday night she said she would \u201cdo whatever it takes to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office\u201d. After her loss to Hageman by almost 60,000 votes was confirmed, aides revealed the former House number three planned to set up her own political action committee. \u201cIn coming weeks, Liz will be launching an organization to educate the American people about the ongoing threat to our republic, and to mobilize a unified effort to oppose any Donald Trump campaign for president,\u201d Cheney spokesperson Jeremy Adler told Politico Playbook. NBC confirmed on Wednesday that it will be named The Great Task, which was the title of Cheney\u2019s final pitch to Wyoming voters, and features in the closing sentence of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address. On Wednesday, Cheney laid out her priorities for the next few months before leaving the House in January. Beyond \u201crepresenting the people of Wyoming\u201d, she said: \u201cWe have a tremendous amount of work left to do on the January 6 committee. And also, though, I\u2019m going to be making sure that people all around this country understand the stakes of what we\u2019re facing, understand the extent to which we\u2019ve now got one major political party, my party, which has really become a cult of personality. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get this party back to a place where we\u2019re embracing the values and the principles on which it was founded. And talking about fundamental issues of civics, fundamental issues of what does it mean to be a constitutional republic.\u201d Cheney, daughter of former Republican vice-president Dick Cheney, attacked both Trump and the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, the architect of her ousting from the party\u2019s House leadership in May 2021 after she denounced the former president\u2019s false claims of a stolen election. She expressed her belief that \u201cthe Republican party today is in very bad shape\u201d. \u201cDonald Trump has betrayed Republican voters. He\u2019s lied to them. Those who support him have lied to them and and they\u2019re using people\u2019s patriotism against them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re preying on people\u2019s patriotism. Kevin McCarthy made his decision a few weeks after January 6, knowing what he knew about Donald Trump\u2019s role in the assault on the Capitol, when he went to Mar-a-Lago and said we\u2019re going to welcome him back into the party. To me, that\u2019s indefensible. \u201cI believe that Donald Trump continues to pose a very grave threat, a risk to our republic, and I think defeating him is going to require a broad and united front of Republicans, Democrats and independents. That\u2019s what I intend to be a part of.\u201d To some in the crowd of supporters on Tuesday night \u2013 gathered in an open field beside a red vintage Chevrolet truck, four US national flags, a dozen hay bales and a hospitality tent \u2013 it already sounded like the launch of a presidential campaign. They welcomed the prospect out of both principle and pragmatism: Cheney would have little chance of winning but could peel crucial votes away from Trump. Heath Mayo, 32, a lawyer, said: \u201cThere are few people making an argument counter to the prevailing Trumpism argument. She\u2019s the only one that can make it. I certainly hope she\u2019s not done. I hope she runs for president in 2024.\u201d Carol Adelman, who hired a 22-year-old Cheney for the US Agency for International Development, noted that the congresswoman received a John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award from the JFK Library earlier this year. \u201cWe need that, not the profiles in cowardice that the Republican party has today. Ultimately, they will go.\u201d Alan Reid, 60, who works in finance, said of a possible presidential run: \u201cWho else? Who\u2019s better? I don\u2019t see anybody from any party that shows the leadership that Liz shows.\u201d But a Cheney candidacy could pose a dilemma for Democrats who recall that she voted in line with Trump\u2019s position 93% of the time during his presidency, according to the FiveThirtyEight website. Marci Shaver, a registered Democrat, switched to Republican in 2016 so she could vote against Cheney; this time she switched to Republican so she could vote for Cheney. She explained: \u201cI was so impressed with her integrity on the committee and the way she has stood firm, knowing damn well she was going to lose this election. I was born and raised here and this is the kind of integrity that Wyomingites, when I was growing, totally respected. For them to dismiss that in this election just breaks my heart.\u201d Bill Sniffin, publisher emeritus of the Cowboy State Daily news site in Wyoming, wrote in a blogpost: \u201cLiz Cheney\u2019s concession speech sounds a lot more like the announcement of someone planning to run for president in 2024 than an admission of defeat back here in 2022.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is not the end of Liz Cheney. This is the beginning. Stay tuned.\u201d Trump remains the favorite among Republicans for the party\u2019s 2024 presidential nomination."

            "date": "2022-08-31T16:56:27Z",
            "content": "An internet prankster has hijacked a website long used to glorify Brazil\u2019s far-right president and turned it into a devastating online excoriation of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cclownish\u201d, \u201cneo-fascist\u201d government. Bolsonaro and his three politician sons have reportedly used the bolsonaro.com.br domain as an official mouthpiece since the early 2000s. But earlier this month a Brazilian objector with rather less affection for the populist clan managed to commandeer the URL, apparently after the Bolsonaros failed to pay for its renewal. The result was a public relations fiasco for the South American rabble-rouser, as Bolsonaro\u2019s former propaganda outlet began portraying him as a cretinous, subservient, incompetent, duplicitous, corrupt and tyrannical hate-filled liar. One cartoon shows a snake emerging from the Brazilian president\u2019s blood-stained jaws alongside an excerpt from Psalm 140: \u201cRescue me, O Lord, from evil men \u2026 the poison of vipers is on their lips.\u201d A second parody shows Bolsonaro behind bars, where many angry voters believe he belongs because of his internationally condemned response to a Covid outbreak that has killed more than 680,000 Brazilians. \u201cBolsonaro is weak and pathetic,\u201d proclaims one text on the dissident website decrying the Brazilian leader\u2019s servility to his US ally Donald Trump. \u201cBolsonaro is a court jester,\u201d announces another scathing critique alongside a caricature in which Brazil\u2019s 67-year-old leader appears as a neck ruffle-wearing clown. Elsewhere on the website Bolsonaro is likened to a milkmaid, the Grim Reaper, a mythological faun, a feathered chicken, Satan and Adolf Hitler. \u201cThis website is not administered by nor does it belong to the Bolsonaro family,\u201d says a disclaimer at the foot of the page. The expropriated URL comes at a sensitive time for Bolsonaro, who polls suggest will fail to win re-election when 156 million Brazilians choose their next leader in just over a month. The ex-president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva currently leads in the polls by a 12-point margin and retains control of the website bearing his name. On Sunday, Bolsonaro lost his cool during a televised presidential debate, lashing out at a prominent female journalist who he labelled \u201can embarrassment to Brazilian journalism\u201d. On Wednesday the embarrassment was Bolsonaro\u2019s as reports that his website had been captured prompted a tsunami of sniggering and contempt. \u201cI want to see more people stand up to the fascist,\u201d the activist supposedly responsible for the stunt wrote on Twitter. \u201cNow is not the time to remain silent.\u201d"

            "title": "Biden\u2019s chief of staff says president is comparable to historic predecessors",
            "date": "2022-08-19T14:51:27Z",
            "content": "In a bullish interview, the White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, compared Joe Biden\u2019s achievements in his first two years in office to historic successes under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson. Speaking to Politico, Klain said: \u201cThe president has delivered the largest economic recovery plan since Roosevelt, the largest infrastructure plan since [Dwight D] Eisenhower, the most judges confirmed since Kennedy, the second-largest healthcare bill since Johnson, and the largest climate change bill in history.\u201d Klain\u2019s comments, aimed at voters contemplating the midterm elections, are an indication that Democrats plan to campaign heavily on their accomplishments in the less than two years they have been in power. He also pointed to \u201cthe first time we\u2019ve done gun control since President Clinton was here, the first time ever an African American woman [Ketanji Brown Jackson] has been put on the US supreme court. \u201cI think it\u2019s a record to take to the American people.\u201d Klain\u2019s references to historical figures chimes with Biden\u2019s own interests. The president has regularly consulted historians, among them Doris Kearns Goodwin, Michael Beschloss and Eddie Glaude Jr, while Jon Meacham, a biographer of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and George HW Bush, has been a close adviser in shaping Biden\u2019s effort to restore \u201cthe soul of the nation\u201d after the presidency of Donald Trump. Democrats control Congress by narrow margins. Opposition parties commonly do well in the first elections of a presidential term, and Republicans remain favoured to take control of one or both chambers. But legislative successes, most recently the passage of a major domestic and climate crisis spending plan, the Inflation Reduction Act, have given Democrats hope. One senator, Brian Schatz of Hawaii, pointed to the need to communicate better, writing: \u201cI feel like the media is having a hard time metabolising the fact that this Congress has been historically productive. And acknowledging the size of these accomplishments, and the degree of difficultly \u2013 it\u2019s just hard to do accurately without sounding a bit left-leaning.\u201d There is some indication that Democrats are becoming more popular. They have established polling leads in key Senate races including Arizona, Pennsylvania and Ohio, against Trump-endorsed Republicans who are struggling to attract moderates and independents. In Kentucky on Thursday, Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, seemed to downplay expectations. McConnell said: \u201cI think there\u2019s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different \u2013 they\u2019re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome. \u201cRight now, we have a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 country, but I think when all is said and done this fall, we\u2019re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly.\u201d In his Politico interview, Klain said: \u201cElections are choices, and the choice just couldn\u2019t be any clearer right now. \u201cDemocrats have stood up to the big special interests. They stood up to the big corporations and insisted that all corporations pay minimum taxes, stood up to the big oil companies and passed climate change legislation. They stood up to Big Pharma and passed prescription drug legislation. They stood up to the gun industry and passed gun control legislation. \u201cThings that [Washington DC was] unable to deliver on for decades because the special interests had things locked down, Joe Biden and his allies in Congress have been able to deliver on.\u201d Asked about the Republican counter-offer, he cited issues Democrats hope can galvanise voters, prominently including attacks on abortion access after the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the ruling which protected the right. \u201cWe have an extreme Maga group in the Republican party that has no real plan to bring down inflation,\u201d Klain said, referring to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, Make America Great Again. \u201cThey obviously want to pass a nationwide ban on abortion. They sided with big pharma. They sided with the climate deniers \u2026 most of them sided with the gun lobby. \u201cAnd so I think that choice [is] between a party that\u2019s standing up to the special interests and delivering change and \u2026 an extreme party, a party that\u2019s talking about \u2026 abolishing social security and Medicare every five years. \u201cThe extreme nature of our opponents, whether it\u2019s with regard to democracy or social security, are all part of a movement that is just very different than we\u2019ve seen in recent years in this country.\u201d Klain said the worst day of the presidency was 26 August 2021, when 13 US service members were killed by a suicide bomb during the evacuation of Kabul. That, he said, was \u201cjust a terrible tragedy and certainly the darkest day\u201d. Questions have been raised, including by Democrats, about whether Biden is too old to run for a second term. Klain said Biden\u2019s experience \u2013 he will turn 80 in November \u2013 helped make him an effective leader. Biden, he said, has \u201ca personal history of tremendous, joyous successes and devastating tragedies. And I think that helps moderate his spirit at all times. \u201cThere is nothing I can ever walk into the Oval Office and tell him that\u2019s any bigger than the bigger things he\u2019s already experienced in life. And nothing I could ever tell him is any sadder than the saddest things he\u2019s already experienced in life. And I think that gives him a very level temperament as president.\u201d Klain was also asked about complaints, particularly from Republicans, that Biden does not maintain a high public profile. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s true he\u2019s out there less than his predecessors,\u201d Klain said. \u201cI just think Donald Trump created an expectation of a president creating a shitstorm every single day.\u201d"

            "title": "Chinese president Xi Jinping expected to visit Saudi Arabia next week",
            "date": "2022-08-11T06:00:35Z",
            "content": "The Chinese president Xi Jinping is expected to visit Saudi Arabia next week, where plans are under way for a gala reception to match that given to Donald Trump on his first trip abroad as president. The welcome being prepared for the Chinese leader is in stark contrast with that afforded to Joe Biden in June, when the US president received a low-key reception, reflecting strained ties between the two countries and personal distaste between Biden and the de facto Saudi leader, Mohammed bin Salman. Xi, however, is instead expected to receive a bells-and-whistles welcome intended to consolidate ties between Beijing and Riyadh and reinforce the image of China as an ally of Saudi Arabia, as ties with Washington continue to drift. China and Saudi Arabia have been growing closer over two decades, but ties have deepened as Prince Mohammed accumulated power in the kingdom from 2016 onwards. Riyadh has defended China\u2019s treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority and Hong Kong\u2019s draconian national security law, placing it at odds with the US on key human rights issues. Trade ties between the two countries have forged ahead at the same time as Washington has pivoted away from the Middle East. \u201cChina is Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest trade partner. It is the largest buyer of Saudi oil,\u201d said Mohammed Alyahya, a fellow at the Harvard Belfer Center\u2019s Middle East Institute and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \u201cChina is very important in the region geopolitically. It has been eyeing military bases in Africa and elsewhere. In the past its interests had been purely mercantilist, focused entirely on commerce. Now they\u2019re increasingly looking at things through a strategic lens. \u201cThey are particularly interested in ensuring the free flow of oil. This is the same for China as the US. The Americans say there is a diversion of bandwidth away from the region to focus on countering China in a \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d. The Chinese however seem to consider the region to be a primary theatre for great power competition. \u201cChina is America\u2019s primary competitor in the region. They\u2019ll clearly be watching very carefully.\u201d Xi was first invited to Riyadh in March. His visit is likely to be the most significant to the kingdom since Trump\u2019s arrival in May 2017, months after his inauguration, where he was received with silver swords, a glowing orb, extravagant gifts and a rollout of Saudi and Arab royalty. That visit set the tone for the Trump administration\u2019s disposition towards Riyadh, an era when the ambitious crown prince was given repeated cover by Trump and his senior officials and formed deep ties with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. China made no public comment about Saudi Arabia\u2019s invasion of Yemen, its boycott of Qatar, or the murder of dissident, Jamal Khashoggi, which led to strong condemnation in the US and Europe. China is increasingly seen as stepping into a regional vacuum created by waning US interest and power projection. Biden\u2019s June visit yielded few dividends, and did not succeed in convincing Prince Mohammed to boost oil supplies \u2013 a move that would have helped reduce bowser prices in the US in the run-up to mid-term elections. In preparation for the visit, which is expected to take in Riyadh, Jeddah and the planned megacity of Neom on the western Saudi coast, plans were under way to hoist thousands of Chinese banners and receive hundreds of dignitaries. Prince Mohammed has appeared emboldened by Biden\u2019s visit, telling allies that it succeeded in reasserting Riyadh\u2019s influence on a global stage, and displaying a sovereign footing. Critics of the visit have claimed that the US helped rehabilitate Prince Mohammed nearly four years after the Khashoggi killing \u2013 which was carried out by Prince Mohammed\u2019s security aides \u2013 while receiving little in return. \u201cSaudi has its swagger back,\u201d said one senior Saudi official. \u201cWe engage with our friends on equal terms. Friends don\u2019t just arrive here, demand things and give nothing back.\u201d Prince Mohammed recently travelled to Greece and France, ending years of isolation. \u201cThat visit was made possible by the Biden visit,\u201d said the Saudi official. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 August 2022 to add the word \u201cexpected\u201d to the headline and first paragraph."
