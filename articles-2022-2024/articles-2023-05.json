            "date": "2023-05-23T12:52:53Z",
            "content": "The favored metaphor on the left is to compare the trumped-up debt-ceiling crisis to hostage-taking by the House Republicans. But in a true hostage situation, both sides have something major to lose. The perpetrators risk not getting a payoff or, worse, spending decades in prison. For the families of the victims and the police, the danger is that the hostages will be killed during the negotiations or in the midst of a botched rescue mission. For Kevin McCarthy and the defaulters (which, incidentally, is a promising name for a band), there is no downside. If Joe Biden ultimately hands over his sword in surrender, the Republican incendiaries will be lionized as conquering heroes from the Fox News green room to the dining room at Mar-a-Lago. Sure, the reviled liberal media will grumble if Republican intransigence forces America into default, guaranteeing higher interest for years to come, and jeopardizing the world economy. But that crazed toughness would prove that the House speaker is not a \u201cRepublican In Name Only\u201d (Rino) squish like his deal-making predecessor John Boehner, who at the last minute helped avert default in 2011. Marching off the fiscal cliff like lemmings will also inoculate House Republicans against a rightwing primary challenge \u2013 which, in Republican circles, is a fate worse than death. And since members of Congress can trade stocks, every smart Republican can personally prosper during the coming cataclysmic economic downturn by adroitly shorting the Dow Jones Average. In contrast, the consequences of debt-ceiling brinkmanship are dire for Joe Biden. In the best conceivable case \u2013 one that will prompt dismay among liberals \u2013 the president would reluctantly agree to tight spending caps that will limit his domestic agenda and penalize the poor. But, at least, that option would avert default. At the end of his Sunday press conference in Hiroshima, Biden publicly acknowledged the devastating political consequences for him if America were unable to pay its bills. Channeling the thought process of House Republican zealots as they head towards the abyss, Biden said: \u201cBecause I am president, and presidents are responsible for everything, Biden would take the blame. And that\u2019s one way to make sure Biden is not re-elected.\u201d Sad, but true. A default might well mean that Biden would be running for reelection with the economy in a Republican-created tailspin. And it wouldn\u2019t matter politically that, as Biden said, \u201cOn the merits, based on what I\u2019ve offered, I would be blameless.\u201d But if Democrats believe that they can win the messaging wars about a default, they\u2019re deluding themselves. An Associated Press/NORC poll, released last week, found that only 20% of Americans say that they understand the debate over the debt ceiling \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery well.\u201d That number is significant because it is often hard for political insiders to remember that most Americans do not watch cable TV news or obsessively follow political machinations in Washington. The danger for Democrats is that many of these low-information voters will be persuaded by the implicit one-sentence Republican message: America defaulted because Biden wouldn\u2019t agree to cut government spending to deal with the national debt. In order to appreciate the folly of that glib Republican argument, a voter both has to understand the draconian nature of the Republican budget proposals and to grasp that raising the debt ceiling merely authorizes borrowing rather than new spending. Good luck making that complex case to anyone who doesn\u2019t devotedly read the New York Times or listen to National Public Radio. In an era of streaming and thousands of channels, Biden does not have the option of commanding national attention with an old-fashioned Oval Office address. Moreover, there is no guarantee that Biden, with his rambling asides and workmanlike delivery, would convince anyone with a televised speech. To illustrate that point, here is the awkward way Biden highlighted the dangers of the Republican budget plan in his Sunday press conference: \u201cI\u2019m not going to agree to a deal that protects, for example, a $30bn tax break for the oil industry, which made $200bn last year \u2013 they don\u2019t need an incentive of another $30bn \u2013 while putting healthcare of 21 million Americans at risk by going after Medicaid.\u201d The harsh reality is that Biden has little choice but to grub for the best deal he can. While there is a strong legal argument that the debt ceiling is unconstitutional under the 14th amendment, no one at the treasury department or anywhere else knows how the global markets would react if Biden thumbed his nose at Kevin McCarthy and his wingnut caucus. With the continuing danger that Donald Trump\u2019s comeback tour will end in the Oval Office, there are more important matters on the table than punishing Kevin McCarthy for his hostage-taking. In fact, the best revenge would be a sweeping Biden reelection that brings with it a Democratic House majority. Then, in 2025, without a presidential election on the horizon, Biden would be free to blow up the dangerously irrational debt-ceiling law.

            "title": "Turkey election 2023 live: Erdo\u011fan declared victor in presidential election \u2013 as it happened",
            "date": "2023-05-28T23:10:32Z",
            "content": "In case you missed anything, here\u2019s a rundown of all the latest developments from the presidential election in Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who has led Turkey for 20 years, has been announced as the winner of a run-off. With 99.43% of ballot boxes opened, Erdo\u011fan has secured 52.14% of the vote, while his opponent, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, has received 47.86%. The run-off came after neither candidate proved able to secure more than 50% of the vote in the first round earlier this month. Thousands of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s supporters have gathered on the streets of Ankara this evening to celebrate his victory. Addressing a victory rally, Erdo\u011fan thanked \u201cevery single one of our people who once again gave us the responsibility to govern the country five more years\u201d and called for \u201cunity and solidarity\u201d. In a brief concession statement, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu said he felt \u201creal sadness about the big difficulties awaiting the country\u201d. Rishi Sunak has phoned Erdo\u011fan to congratulate him. A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had \u201creiterated the strong relationship between the United Kingdom and Turkey\u201d and that the two had \u201cagreed to continue working closely together to address shared challenges\u201d. In a tweet offering his own congratulations, US President Joe Biden told Erdo\u011fan he looked forward to \u201ccontinuing to work together as Nato Allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges\u201d. Other world leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have also offered their congratulations. We are now closing this blog, thanks for following along with us. Western capitals remained silent through Turkey\u2019s presidential campaign \u2013 privately hoping Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s erratic 20-year rule would come to a surprise close \u2013 but now he has been handed a decisive mandate to serve a third term, the west is caught between fear and hope. It fears he will exploit the result to take this Nato founder member further from the liberal secular west, but hopes against hope that, not being eligible to run again and thus freed from the need to pander to a nationalist electorate for the rest of his political life, he may at least be open to persuasion and base his foreign policy on something other than self-preservation. Either way, the choices Erdo\u011fan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. Read the full analysis from our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, here: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have each offered congratulations to President Erdo\u011fan. In a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin called Erdo\u011fan a \u201cdear friend\u201d and praised his \u201cpersonal contribution to the strengthening of friendly Russian-Turkish relations\u201d. \u201cThe election victory was a natural result of your selfless work as the head of the Republic of Turkey, clear evidence of the support of the Turkish people for your efforts to strengthen state sovereignty and conduct an independent foreign policy,\u201d it said. Writing on Twitter, Zelenskiy congratulated Erdo\u011fan and said he hoped for the \u201cfurther strengthening of the strategic partnership for the benefit of our countries, as well as the strengthening of cooperation for the security and stability of Europe\u201d. Turkey is a member of Nato, and has been broadly supportive of Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion last year, but has sought to maintain economic and diplomatic ties with Russia. The country has also acted as a mediator in negotiations over issues like the export of grain from Ukraine\u2019s ports on the Black Sea. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s opponent in the election, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, has made a brief concession statement. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, who secured 47.86% of the vote, said he felt \u201creal sadness about the big difficulties awaiting the country\u201d. President Erdo\u011fan has called for \u201cunity and solidarity\u201d in a victory speech outside the presidential palace in Ankara. Addressing a crowd of supporters, he said: \u201cI thank every single one of our people who once again gave us the responsibility to govern the country five more years. \u201cWe should come together in unity and solidarity. We call for this with all our heart.\u201d He pledged to focus on building stability and confidence in the Turkish economy and bringing down inflation, which according to World Bank figures stood at 72.3% in 2022. He also said he would secure the return of one million of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently hosted by Turkey. Rishi Sunak has spoken with President Erdo\u011fan to reiterate the \u201cstrong relationship\u201d between the UK and Turkey as \u201ceconomic partners and close Nato allies\u201d, Downing Street has said. \u201cPrime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan this evening to congratulate him on his re-election,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe prime minister reiterated the strong relationship between the United Kingdom and Turkey, as economic partners and close Nato allies. \u201cHe reflected on Turkey\u2019s ongoing recovery from the devastating earthquakes earlier this year and pledged the UK\u2019s continued solidarity with the Turkish people. \u201cThe leaders agreed to continue working closely together to address shared challenges.\u201d President Biden has joined leaders from around the world in sending congratulations to Erdo\u011fan on his re-election. In a tweet, he said he looked forward to \u201ccontinuing to work together as Nato Allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges\u201d. With an initial count confirmed by the country\u2019s supreme election authority, which announced a victory for Erdo\u011fan, we are already starting to see the beginning of what another term for Turkey\u2019s longest-serving leader might look like. The Turkish lira, already in crisis, slipped below 20 to the dollar as the votes were counted this evening, in a sign of further crisis to come. Economists from Bloomberg previously estimated that the Turkish central bank has spent more than $177bn supporting the lira since December 2021. While the opposition were defeated in the second round vote, the conditions challenging Erdo\u011fan\u2019s control and prompting one of the most concerted challenges to his rule in decades appear set to remain. Turkey remains a fiercely polarised country, where the opposition secured just under 48% of the vote. Erdo\u011fan also appears happy to stoke culture war forces to shore up support from his base, once again inviting his supporters to brand every opposition party as \u201cLGBT\u201d in a call and response during his victory speech atop a car in Istanbul. A victorious Erdo\u011fan also received congratulations from many international leaders whom he was previously happy to spar with in order to project power at home, notably the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, also congratulated Erdo\u011fan, telling him \u201cour common security is the future priority\u201d, a clear reference to his country\u2019s bid for Nato accession, which has been held up by the Turkish president for over a year. Those congratulations will no doubt be well received by Erdo\u011fan, who is likely to view them as an endorsement that his often combative and bombastic methods on the international stage have brought results in his favour at home and abroad. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has sent his congratulations to Erdo\u011fan on his victory. In a tweet, he said he looked forward to continuing collaborations on issues including trade and shared security threats. It is slightly past midnight in Turkey where incumbent president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has been declared the winner of the presidency. Here is where things stand: The chairman of Turkey\u2019s supreme election council, Ahmet Yener, announced that incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has won Turkey\u2019s presidency in a runoff election with 52.14% of the votes, Reuters reports. With 99.43% of ballot boxes opened, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu received 47.86% of the votes, Yener said. The two candidates have a gap of over 2 million votes and the remainder of the uncounted votes will not affect the result, said Yener. Speaking to supporters on top of a bus on Sunday evening, the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, thanked voters for giving him the responsibility to rule for an additional five years. Erdo\u011fan, who has ruled the country for two decades, thanked Turks for voting and declared Turkey as the only winner in the runoff presidential election. \u201cWe have completed the second round of the presidential elections with the favour of our people,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. Turkey\u2019s opposition candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu vowed to continue to lead his struggle following early results that showed him trailing behind and losing to incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in what he called was the \u201cthe most unfair election in years\u201d. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, who received around 47.9% of votes in the country\u2019s runoff election, said the results showed people\u2019s will to change an authoritarian government. He is saddened by the \u201ctroubles\u201d awaiting Turkey, he added, according to Reuters. Somalia\u2019s president has also congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The two countries developed close ties after Erdo\u011fan became the first head of state outside Africa to visit the country in almost two decades in 2011. The bilateral relationship between the countries initially started out with humanitarian support but has developed a military component where the Turkish army trains Somali soldiers in their fight against the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabaab, as well as a burgeoning trade relationship and state-building support. The Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, have congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Al-Thani tweeted: \u201cMy dear brother Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, congratulations on your victory, and I wish you success in your new term, and that you achieve in it what the brotherly Turkish people aspire to in terms of progress and prosperity, and for the strong relations of our two countries to further development and growth.\u201d Orb\u00e1n echoed the sentiments, writing: \u201cCongratulations to President @RTErdogan on his unquestionable election victory!\u201d It has not been lost on analysts in Greece that President Erdo\u011fan will begin his new five-year stint in power exactly 100 years after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. \u201cHe will lead his country for the next five years and he begins his new term precisely in the year that he wanted, that is a century after the creation of the Republic of Turkey,\u201d noted Giorgos Tsogopoulos, a senior fellow at the Athens-based think tank Eliamep. Meral Ak\u015fener, leader of the opposition alliance member IYI Party, congratulated Erdo\u011fan at a press conference she held in Ankara. \u201cI hope that our nation\u2019s decision will benefit our country\u201d Ak\u015fener said. Due to disagreements over Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s candidacy, Ak\u015fener had quit the opposition alliance. She later rejoined after securing concessions over her preferred candidates both running as vice presidential candidates. It has not been lost on analysts in Greece that President Erdo\u011fan will begin his new five-year stint in power exactly 100 years after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. \u201cHe will lead his country for the next five years and he begins his new term precisely in the year that he wanted, that is a century after the creation of the Republic of Turkey,\u201d noted Giorgos Tsogopoulos, a senior fellow at the Athens-based think tank Eliamep. \u201cHis political success is undisputed. Not only has he not lost the elections, he has endured even when his political opponents rally to dethrone him,\u201d he added. Greece\u2019s political leadership has yet to congratulate the newly elected Erdogan. Following its own inconclusive general election on May 21, Turkey\u2019s neighbour and historic Nato rival has a caretaker government. Led by a senior judge, Ioannis Sarmas, the interim administration will lead the country to repeat polls on June 25. Former prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose centre right New Democracy party triumphed in the election but failed under a system of proportional representation to win a parliamentary majority, has said he will extend a \u201chand of friendship\u201d towards Turkey if he is voted back into office. \u201cBut I\u2019m not naive. I know that foreign policies of countries don\u2019t change from one day to the next,\u201d he told AP in an interview ahead of the 21 May vote. \u201cI would hope that the next Turkish government would overall reconsider its approach towards the West, not just towards Greece, towards Europe, towards Nato, and towards the United States. But again I have to be a realist and not be too naive, and that is why we will continue with \u2026 our firm foreign policy. That means we will continue to strengthen our deterrence capabilities and our defense capabilities.\u201d Meral Ak\u015fener, leader of the opposition alliance member IYI Party, congratulated Erdo\u011fan at a press conference she held in Ankara. \u201cI hope that our nation\u2019s decision will benefit our country\u201d Ak\u015fener said. Due to disagreements over Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s candidacy, Ak\u015fener had quit the opposition alliance. She later rejoined after securing concessions over her preferred candidates both running as vice presidential candidates. \u201cWe did not allow any power, ambition, or personal greed to stand in the way of our nation\u2019s demands and wishes. For this reason, we have received harsh criticism from time to time and paid the price for this,\u201d Ak\u015fener said. More world leaders have congratulated Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, with French president Emmanuel Macron and Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan hailing further cooperation between their countries and Turkey. \u201cThere are great challenges that France and Turkey will overcome together. The return of peace to Europe, the future of our Eurasian Alliance, the Mediterranean sea. We will continue to move forward together with President Erdo\u011fan, to whom I convey my congratulations on his re-election,\u201d wrote Macron. Meanwhile, Pashinyan wrote: \u201cCongratulations to President @RTErdogan on his re-election. Looking forward to continuing working together towards full normalisation of relations between our countries.\u201d Currently, Turkey and Armenia have almost no diplomatic relations as a result of a tumultuous history between the two countries including Armenian genocide and the ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Opposition presidential candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s gave a speech intended to console his supporters from the Ankara headquarters of his Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP). \u201cIn this election, the will of the people to change an authoritarian government has clearly emerged, despite all the pressures. We have experienced the most unfair election process of recent years...despite this climate of fear, I would like to thank all the leaders of our alliance and our citizens. The Republican People\u2019s Party and the Nation\u2019s Alliance will continue to struggle with all of their members. We will continue to be the pioneer in this struggle, until real democracy comes to our country. My biggest sadness is the trouble waiting for this country,\u201d he said. The 74-year-old longtime CHP leader also gave few suggestions that he might step down following his defeat, despite his candidacy previously causing a rift among his opposition alliance amid allegations that other opposition figures stood a better chance of beating Erdo\u011fan. \u201cI want to see our 25 million citizens who have voted for me standing tall and proud, our march continues and we remain here,\u201d he added. \u201cI have always fought for your rights, for the law, so that no one can oppress you...So that you can live in peace and plenty, and I will continue to do so.\u201d Former prime minister of Turkey Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, who also served as President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s foreign minister, hailed the election results which has so far shown Erdogan significantly ahead of his rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. In a tweet on Sunday, Davuto\u011flu wrote: \u201cI wish the election results to be good for our country and our nation. I congratulate our citizens who showed high participation in the elections with great democratic maturity.\u201d He went on to add, \u201cAfter the final results are announced by the YSK, I will share the comprehensive assessment with the public,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s supreme election council. Jailed opposition leader Selahattin Demirta\u015f has released his first statement on the Turkish polls. In a string of tweets he congratulated his supporters for managing to get as many votes as they did despite the fact that they were up against \u201ca huge operational force that has taken over the state.\u201d Demirta\u015f wrote that the election was \u201cfull of inequalities, oppression, incredible lies, slander and smears.\u201d He added: \u201cEven reaching this rate of votes with a principled and moral election campaign against a huge operational force that has taken over the state is considered a miracle.\u201d Signing off, he urged his supporters to \u201cKeep fighting\u201d. Demirta\u015f was co-chair of the pro-Kurdish HDP party. He was jailed on terror charges in 2016 due to alleged links between his party and the PKK, a Kurdish militant group considered a terrorist organisation in Ankara and the EU. Demirta\u015f says arrest was politically motivated. In 2020, the grand chamber of the European court of human rights also ruled that Turkey\u2019s detention of Demirta\u015f was politically motivated. The chairman of Turkey\u2019s supreme election council, Ahmet Yener, announced that incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has won Turkey\u2019s presidency in a runoff election with 52.14% of the votes, Reuters reports. With 99.43% of ballot boxes opened, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu received 47.86% of the votes, Yener said. The two candidates have a gap of over 2 million votes and the remainder of the uncounted votes will not affect the result, said Yener. Turkey\u2019s opposition candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu vowed to continue to lead his struggle following early results that showed him trailing behind and losing to incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in what he called was the \u201cthe most unfair election in years\u201d. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, who received around 47.9% of votes in the country\u2019s runoff election, said the results showed people\u2019s will to change an authoritarian government. He is saddened by the \u201ctroubles\u201d awaiting Turkey, he added, according to Reuters. \u201cI ask my 25 million voters. Stand up, and walk proudly\u201d he continued. \u201cI did everything I could to make sure you could live in a fair nation and I will continue to lead that fight,\u201d he added. Kosovo\u2019s president has also congratulated Erdo\u011fan The Turkish text reads: \u201cMay the partnership between us continue to get stronger!\u201d Following Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s victory speech, Sinan O\u011fan, who came third in the first election round, tweeted on Sunday that the \u201cpresidential election process has been completed\u201d and went on to declare \u201cTurkish nationalists, Kemalists, the Turkish nation\u201d as winners. \u201cThe presidential election process has been completed. According to this result, our voters, who did not spare their support in the first round, continued to support us in the second round and voted for the stability of Turkey. \u201cOur voters abandoned the enthusiasm of those who said that these votes were not given to Sinan O\u011fan, they trusted us and to a great extent chose where we are. \u201cFrom here, I would like to express my gratitude to all my citizens who have remained loyal to the plan. Now a new era begins. \u201cThe winners were Turkish nationalists, Kemalists, the Turkish nation and the Turkish world, the losers were the lynching culture and the terror-affiliated parties and those who trusted them.\u201d Opposition areas see voter turnout drop Voter turnout was lower in this election overall but the stats show that turnout dropped quite heavily in big cities where K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu would have hoped to have stronger support, and in the south-eastern Kurdish-populated regions. Provinces won by Erdo\u011fan didn\u2019t see such a dramatic drop. Here are some figures through Anadolu: Istanbul: Round 1: 90.5% Round 2: 87.2% Izmir: Round 1: 90.2% Round 2: 87.19% Ankara: Round 1: 91.2% Round 2: 87.9% In the Kurdish region, where numbers for voter turnout are generally lower than other parts of the country, there was also a notable decrease. Speculation was rife about whether K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu would be able to retain the Kurdish vote if he courted the nationalist voters by working with far-right politician \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f. After the first round, Sinan O\u011fan, who finished third, endorsed Erdo\u011fan. O\u011fan led the ATA alliance, which consisted of a small group of marginal far-right parties, including \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f\u2019s Victory party. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu attempted to flank himself from the right and tap into some of those votes but that strategy appears to have caused voter apathy in the south-east. Speaking to Reuters, Reha Ruhavioglu, director of the Diyarbakir-based Kurdish Studies Center, said Kurdish voters lost interest in the opposition alliance as K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu drifted right. Demotivation stems from the CHP\u2019s political discourse, which shifted from reconciliation to security politics. Here are some numbers: Diyarbakir: Round 1: 81.7% Round 2: 75.9% A\u011fr\u0131: Round 1: 72.8% Round 2: 65.8% Mardin: Round 1: 82.7% Round 2: 78.7% Van: Round 1: 78.6% Round 2: 72.2% Siirt: Round 1: 83.3% Round 2: 78.6% Speaking to supporters on top of a bus on Sunday evening, the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, thanked voters for giving him the responsibility to rule for an additional five years. Erdo\u011fan, who has ruled the country for two decades, thanked Turks for voting and declared Turkey as the only winner in the runoff presidential election. According to data from the majority of ballot boxes that have been counted, Erdogan is leading with roughly 52% support. Official results have yet to be released. \u201cWe have completed the second round of the presidential elections with the favour of our people,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. He went on to thank voters, saying that \u201ceach and every member of the nation \u2026 once again conveyed to us responsibility for governing Turkey for the next five years\u201d. \u201cWe will be ruling the country for the coming five years \u2026 God willing, we will be deserving of your trust,\u201d he added. Somalia\u2019s president has also congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The two countries developed close ties after Erdo\u011fan became the first head of state outside Africa to visit the country in almost two decades in 2011. The bilateral relationship between the countries initially started out with humanitarian support but has developed a military component where the Turkish army trains Somali soldiers in their fight against the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabaab, as well as a burgeoning trade relationship and state-building support. Last year, Erdo\u011fan announced that Turkey-Somalia trade reached $363m in 2021, a significant increase from $2m in 2003. Moreover, Turkey\u2019s largest embassy building in the world is located in Mogadishu, a further sign of the two countries\u2019 close ties. Earlier this month, Somalia\u2019s defence minister hailed Turkey as an \u201cirreplaceable partner\u201d for Somalia, citing Turkey\u2019s sprawling state-rebuilding investments in the country. Congratulations to our friend and brother T\u00fcrkiye! Turkey\u2019s supreme election council (YSK) has announced that 75.42% votes have been counted, with Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan receiving 53.41% of votes and his opponent, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, receiving 46.59%. The Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, have congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Al-Thani tweeted: \u201cMy dear brother Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, congratulations on your victory, and I wish you success in your new term, and that you achieve in it what the brotherly Turkish people aspire to in terms of progress and prosperity, and for the strong relations of our two countries to further development and growth.\u201d Orb\u00e1n echoed the sentiments, writing: \u201cCongratulations to President @RTErdogan on his unquestionable election victory!\u201d adding: \u201cTebrikler, Say\u0131n Cumhurba\u015fkan\u0131!\u201d, meaning: \u201cCongratulations, Mr President\u201d in Turkish. Losing Turkey\u2019s major cities hasn\u2019t proved much of a setback for Erdo\u011fan More than 90% of ballot boxes are now opened, according to state news agency Anadolu, so we\u2019ve got a bit of an idea of which candidate won votes and in which regions. The voting patterns in the second round look very similar to the first round. Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has performed strongly again in Turkish Thrace, and leads in all provinces along the Mediterranean coast, including the major city of Izmir. These are all regions where his party has traditionally had a strong presence. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu also appears to have won a greater share of the vote in Turkey\u2019s largest city, Istanbul, and the capital, Ankara, suggesting he\u2019s the more popular candidate in Turkey\u2019s three largest cities. The old maxim \u201che who rules Istanbul rules Turkey\u201d no longer appears to hold though, as he falls behind Erdo\u011fan in the final straight. In Turkey\u2019s fourth and fifth largest cities, Bursa and Konya respectively, which are AKP strongholds, Erdo\u011fan is expectedly leading. The south-east of the country has also produced interesting final results. Our colleagues Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Bar\u0131\u015f Narl\u0131 headed to areas impacted by the earthquake where they reported strong support for Erdo\u011fan despite the government\u2019s lacklustre initial response to the disaster. With the exception of Diyabakir, where K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu is leading, Erdo\u011fan has retained support across much of the region. He also appears to have expanded his support. Results so far suggest that Hatay, one of the worst-hit regions, has swung to Erdo\u011fan and away from K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, who won the province in the first round by an extremely narrow margin. Farther east, in the Kurdish populated region, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s informal alliance with the pro-Kurdish Ye\u015fil Sol party appears to have held up despite his alliance with the controversial far-right nationalist politician \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f for the second round. From the north-eastern region of Ardahan, which borders Georgia, down as far as Mardin, which borders Syria, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has a strong lead. These are all regions where the Ye\u015fil Sol party dominated in the parliamentary elections. Throughout central Anatolia, however, Erdo\u011fan has an overwhelming lead, where K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s tally has been much lower. According to Ahmet Yener, the chairman of the YSK, the country\u2019s supreme election council, 54% of the ballots have been counted, with Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan receiving 54.57% of the votes, and his rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu on 45.53%. \u00d6mer \u00c7elik, the spokesperson for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party, has hit back at statements from the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) spokesperson. We are lurching towards another war of narratives around the vote count, with both sides alleging that the other is presenting inaccurate data. \u201cNow they are trying to present their own data as the data of the whole of Turkey. They are trying to present this other data to muddy the waters,\u201d \u00c7elik said, in reference to statements from CHP spokesperson Faik \u00d6ztrak, who claimed that Erdo\u011fan and his rival were neck and neck. \u201cHere\u2019s what he needs to know: the only statement that muddied the waters in this whole process came from two mayors on the night of 14 May. They acted in an extremely irresponsible manner,\u201d \u00c7elik said, in reference to public statements given by the Ankara and Istanbul mayors on the night of the first round, where they claimed that the opposition was in the lead. \u201cWe have a political tradition that would respect the results until the final vote is counted. We will wait respectfully until the final vote is counted and the result will emerge,\u201d he said. \u00c7elik added: \u201cWe will wait for the last vote to be counted.\u201d The statement from the opposition Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) came a little ahead of schedule, with spokesperson Faik \u00d6ztrak once again telling opposition supporters to continue observing the count at the ballot boxes. \u201cAccording to our results, there is a head-to-head race. Keep doing your duty until this process is finished,\u201d he said. In a salvo at Erdo\u011fan\u2019s decision to give a victorious speech to his supporters from the balcony of his Justice and Development party (AKP) headquarters in Ankara, \u00d6ztrak added: \u201cNo one should try to muddy the waters with balcony speeches. Our nation continues to receive information from us moment by moment. It looks like we have got one vote from every two voters in Turkey.\u201d Initial vote counts are coming in thick and fast from both the state news agency Anadolu and opposition-leaning ANKA. Anadolu said that Erdo\u011fan currently has 55% of the vote, compared with K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu on 44%, with 61% of \u201cballot boxes opened\u201d, a somewhat mysterious turn of phrase that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate as votes counted. ANKA on the other hand has 50.99% to K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and 49.01% to Erdo\u011fan, with 59% of \u201cballot boxes opened\u201d. During the first round, both ANKA and Anadolu gave differing counts until late in the evening, leading to conflicting narratives about whether Erdo\u011fan or the opposition were in the lead, fuelled in part by statements from leading opposition officials. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and several leading officials also lashed out at Anadolu, but did not provide data to evidence their claims of a lead. The CHP have said they will speak at 19.00 local time here in Turkey, although we have already seen that CHP party spokesperson Faik \u00d6ztrak has already repeated some of the same claims about Anadolu. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in the past how the results were manipulated by state-owned Anadolu Agency. That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t leave the ballot boxes,\u201d he told opposition supporters. The head of Turkey\u2019s electoral authority, Ahmet Yener, has just announced that only 25% of the votes have been entered into their system for the official count. Voter turnout drops to 84% in the second round Turkey\u2019s election board has now lifted the broadcast ban on results from the elections. Early numbers have begun pouring in and just over half the ballots have been opened. One thing to note so far is that turnout has dropped in the second round compared with the first round. In the first round, turnout was over 88%, according to Turkey\u2019s Anadolu Agency, but this round has seen a slight drop to 84.2%, which is still remarkably high. It is also important to keep in mind that these elections were also for Turkey\u2019s 600-seat parliament, the shape of which is now clear. That will be the most important statistic for whoever comes out of this election on top, especially for opposition candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, whose party is the second largest in Turkey\u2019s parliament. The AKP-led People\u2019s Alliance \u2013 which includes the nationalist MHP \u2013 retained the largest number of deputies, even though their block shrank compared with 2018\u2019s election. They command 323 seats. Trailing them by just over a hundred deputies is the CHP-led Nation Alliance, which includes another nationalist party \u2013 the Iyi party, which has 212 parliamentarians in their block. The leftwing Labour and Freedom Alliance, which includes the pro-Kurdish Ye\u015fil Sol party (a successor to the HDP) and the Turkish Workers party, got just over 10% and have 65 deputies. Despite the fact that Turkey switched to an executive presidential system after a 2017 referendum, the country\u2019s parliament retains extensive powers, from the ratification of treaties to the passing of budgets and, crucially, the ability to amend the constitution. One of K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s key campaign pledges was to revert Turkey to a parliamentary democracy \u2013 which he will struggle to see through without a parliamentary majority. Although Erdo\u011fan would not face significant obstacles as he can count on MPs from his alliance to approve legislation, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu would have a bit of a tricky wicket with a hostile parliament. Even if he relied on the Labour and Freedom Alliance deputies, he would still lack the necessary majorities to enact law. Merve Dizdar, who won the best actress award yesterday at the 76th Cannes film festival for her teacher role in Nuri Bilge Ceylan\u2019s About Dry Grasses, returned to Istanbul to vote today. In footage on social media, Dizdar was applauded at the school where she went to vote. Dizdar\u2019s award speech went viral on social media in Turkey after she dedicated her award to \u201call her sisters who take action to strengthen the struggle of women\u201d and \u201call fighting spirits waiting to see the good days they deserve in Turkey\u201d. The mood at the polls today wasn\u2019t quite the busy and energetic atmosphere we witnessed a couple of weeks ago during the first round, in part because today\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t require the electorate to fill out long ballot sheets for the parliamentary election, and maybe a little of Istanbul\u2019s gloomy weather. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll actually go this time,\u201d said voter and election observer Ilhan Pekg\u00f6z, in reference to president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. After a bruising first round for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, whose coalition failed to win a predicted majority in parliament and who trailed the incumbent president by around five percentage points heading into the second round, few opposition supporters were feeling confident of an opposition victory. But what stuck out most among those at the polls today was a combination of wanting to vote anyway to show their objections to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s policies, particularly on the economy, as well as a lingering resentment about the ballot and the fairness of the count. The first round saw the opposition initially claim victory before accepting the results, as well as a storm of concerns about irregularities in the count that K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) later said they contested. Days later, CHP officials clarified that although they disputed the vote-count in 2,269 ballot boxes, these would not have changed the overall result. Observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also said the first round was \u201cwell-managed and offered voters a choice between genuine political alternatives, but the current president and the ruling parties enjoyed an unjustified advantage.\u201d Despite the fairness of the vote itself, opposition supporters have often expressed discomfort with the feeling that the election has not been held in a fair context, where Erdo\u011fan has received disproportionately more coverage in the domestic media compared to his rival and the head of a major Kurdish political party remains in prison. \u201cNobody believes the first round was fair. If our votes don\u2019t get stolen, there\u2019s a high chance we could win,\u201d said Pekg\u00f6z. Polls are just about to close here, at 17.00 local time. The announcement of the unofficial final results of the last election was delayed until the next day. This time, it is estimated that the count will end sooner, as there are only two candidates. Turnout is expected to be decisive in the second round while both candidates repeatedly asked their followers to go voting during the runoff campaign period. In Turkey, the election turnout has been generally high in the past, reaching 88,92 percent in the first round. Candidates especially aim to convince around 8 million voters who did not go to the polls in the previous round. Opposition presidential candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu tweeted two hours before the polls closed: \u201cMy brothers and sisters who haven\u2019t voted yet, go to the ballot box, don\u2019t be lazy, vote! Your future is as close as walking distance.\u201d Turkish opposition has been stirring up anti-immigrant sentiments in attempt to win the presidency, the Guardian\u2019s Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Bar\u0131\u015f Narl\u0131 report. On the dock next to Istanbul\u2019s Kadik\u00f6y ferry port, a large screen displays the opposition\u2019s campaign videos on a loop, with presidential candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s voice booming out through the speakers. Interspersed with soft rock soundtracking footage of the campaign trail are speeches in which he promises to deport the roughly 4 million refugees currently in Turkey. \u201cYou brought more than 10 million refugees in,\u201d he shouts, addressing President Erdo\u011fan, over footage of young people climbing through barbed wire and through dusty tracks next to grassland. \u201cI hereby declare that I will send all refugees back as soon as I come to power.\u201d Campaigners from K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) hand out Turkish flags and leaflets bearing his campaign promises, including a flyer bearing the words \u201crefugees will return home\u201d, showing a figure scaling a wire fence at sunset. CHP voter \u00c7isel Onat tapped her foot to the music as she watched. \u201cWe have to do this, unfortunately,\u201d she said of the promises to expel refugees. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who thinks everyone should just live in their own country in suitable conditions.\u201d While K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and his party have described themselves as democratic challengers to Erdo\u011fan, their campaign before the second-round poll has focused on an anti-immigrant message in an attempt to attract votes. For more, click here: A video of a woman taking her lamb to a polling station in Turkey has gone viral. In the video, the lamb, clad in a a striped sweater, can be seen following the woman into the station, much to the amusement of onlookers. The woman is then seen handing in her ballot before she and the lamb head back out onto the streets. Reuters has this report from Ankara, as voting continues: Voting started at 8am (5am GMT) and will finish at 5pm (2pm GMT). The outcome is expected to start becoming clear by early evening local time. Polling stations were reportedly quieter in many places than two weeks ago, when turnout was 89%. The election will decide not only who leads Turkey, a Nato-member country of 85 million people, but also how it is governed, where its economy is headed after its currency plunged to one-tenth of its value against the dollar in a decade, and the shape of its foreign policy, which has seen Turkey anger the west by cultivating ties with Russia and Gulf states. Erdogan supporters gathered at a school near his home on the Asian side of Istanbul where he voted at about midday, before shaking hands and talking with the crowd. \u201cWith God\u2019s permission, he will win. The country has many problems but if anyone can solve them, he can,\u201d said Nuran, who came to vote with her three-year-old daughter. In Ankara, 32-year-old Gulcan Demiroz said she hoped the vote would bring change and that her friends would otherwise go abroad, as she was considering doing, for a better life. \u201cThis country deserves better. We need a collective of minds, not a powerful, cold, distant man who rules single handedly,\u201d said Gulcan, who works in the textile industry, after voting for K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, 74, voted in Ankara. He is the candidate of a six-party opposition alliance, and leads the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) created by Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. His camp has struggled to regain momentum after trailing Erdo\u011fan in the first round. The incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was pictured handing out money \u2013 banknotes worth 200 lira (\u00a38) \u2013 at the polling station where he cast his ballot today. Archie Bland and Ruth Michaelson explain why voters have returned to the polls just two weeks after the previous election. What happened in the first vote? Parliamentary and presidential elections took place in Turkey on Sunday. In the 600-seat parliament, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party (AKP) and its allies secured by far the most seats, 321, while the opposition won 213, and the 66 remaining seats went to a pro-Kurdish alliance. In the presidential vote, Turkey\u2019s supreme election council had Erdo\u011fan at 49.51% and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu at 44.88%. A third candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan O\u011fan, took a vital 5.17% that appears to have kept both K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu or Erdo\u011fan from getting over the 50% line. Why was it close? While Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on the levers of power has brought Turkey close to autocracy, he has made serious economic missteps recently. He has increased his control of the theoretically independent central bank and steadfastly refused to increase interest rates despite inflation that officially touched 80% last year and which independent analysts say could, in reality, have surpassed 100%. Turkish people are far poorer and more uncertain of their futures as a result. The government response to the devastating recent earthquake was widely viewed as inadequate. In February, Erdo\u011fan made the tone-deaf comment that \u201cwhatever happens, happens, this is part of fate\u2019s plan\u201d. However, he has outperformed expectations and appears to be further ahead than was previously predicted. How will the runoff go? Erdo\u011fan clearly has the advantage. But the question of which side is able to successfully spin a story about its own success \u2013 and thereby either create a sense of momentum for the opposition or stymie it \u2013 will be central. The fight over the interpretation of the vote is really a symbol of how divided the country is. It is a question of whether K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu can plausibly say: \u201cJust a little further. We can do this.\u201d One question is where the votes for the ultranationalist third-place candidate, O\u011fan, will go. Voting for him was seen as a protest vote. It is possible his voters will be accepting of K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu because there are nationalists in his coalition. The second round of voting in the Turkish presidential election is under way, as my colleagues Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Bar\u0131\u015f Narl\u0131 report from Istanbul: Turkish voters are heading back to the polls for an unprecedented second round of a presidential election in which Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan hopes to see off a faltering challenge from rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. In the first round earlier this month, Erdo\u011fan upended expectations and many pollsters\u2019 predictions by coming out ahead with 49.5% of the vote, forcing his rival into second place with 44.5%. A further upset occurred in the parliamentary vote, where Erdo\u011fan\u2019s coalition won a comfortable majority. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has offered voters a chance to end Erdo\u011fan\u2019s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey\u2019s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. Both candidates have sought to harness support from voters who opted for the third-place presidential candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan O\u011fan of the Victory party, who obtained roughly 5% of the presidential vote in the first round. We will be covering all the developments in the live blog ahead of polls closing at 5pm in Turkey (3pm BST, 10am EDT) and an expected result at around midnight local time."

            "date": "2023-05-30T14:57:31Z",
            "content": "Predicting two terms in the White House should he defeat Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination next year, Ron DeSantis said he would go on to \u201cdestroy leftism in this country\u201d. \u201cI will be able to destroy leftism in this country and leave woke ideology in the dustbin of history,\u201d the Florida governor told Fox News. DeSantis declared his long-expected run last week, in a glitch-filled appearance on Twitter with its owner, Elon Musk. The widely panned launch followed a long phony war period in which DeSantis toured early voting states and launched a campaign-oriented book but nonetheless fell further and further behind the former president in primary polling. Trump faces unprecedented legal jeopardy, including criminal charges over a hush money payment to a porn star; being found liable for sexual assault and defamation; and facing indictment for his election subversion and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress and for his retention of classified records. Nonetheless, Trump maintains big leads over the rest of the field. Most polling averages put Trump more than 30 points ahead of his nearest challenger: DeSantis. Undaunted, the governor told Fox &amp; Friends on Monday: \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019ve shown in Florida an ability to win huge swaths of voters that Republicans typically can\u2019t win \u2013 while also delivering the boldest agenda anywhere in the country.\u201d Democrats and many political observers suggest that hardline record, including attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, moves to control teaching in public schools, loosened gun control laws and a six-week abortion ban, will cost DeSantis in a general election. The governor\u2019s high-profile fight with Disney, a major employer in his state, over its opposition to his so-called \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law prohibiting discussion of sexuality and gender identity in public classrooms, has also cost him support among some major donors. Speaking to Fox News, DeSantis said the fight with Disney was about \u201cstanding for parents \u2026 standing for children. And I think a multibillion-dollar company that sexualises children is not consistent with the values of Florida or the values of a place like Iowa\u201d, which will hold the first Republican contest next year. DeSantis, 44, has amassed a significant campaign war chest and remains the clear strongest challenger to Trump, ahead of candidates including the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the South Carolina senator Tim Scott and Asa Hutchinson, a former governor of Arkansas. Polling concerning a hypothetical general election between DeSantis and Joe Biden puts the governor and the president neck-and-neck. Speaking to Fox News, DeSantis said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a reason why the legacy media is attacking me more than they\u2019re attacking anybody else, because I think they realise that if I\u2019m successful in winning the Republican nomination, we\u2019re going to bring it home in the general election. \u201cAnd I pledge to Republican voters if you nominate me, I will be taking the oath of office on January 20, 2025, on the west side of the Capitol. No more excuses about why we can\u2019t get it done. We need to get it done, and I will get it done.\u201d"

            "content": "It claims to be the most trusted name in news. But on Wednesday it will devote an hour of prime time to a serial liar who sought to overthrow American democracy. CNN\u2019s live town hall with Donald Trump, the former US president, has been condemned by critics as a marriage of convenience: an ailing network looking to boost ratings and a disgraced 76-year-old candidate seeking rehabilitation. For millions of voters not yet paying attention to the 2024 election, the show is likely to be a wake-up call: Trump is back and the current favourite for the Republican party nomination, despite two impeachments and one criminal indictment. And for the US media, it could be a warning from recent history: will Trump exploit cable news\u2019s insatiable thirst for spectacle and outrage, dominate political discourse and surf a wave of free publicity all the way to the White House? \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that CNN and many other mainstream media outlets have not learned their lessons from covering Trump in 2016,\u201d said Tara Setmayer, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump and pro-democracy group. \u201cThis, in my opinion, is once again giving him legitimacy at a time when he is more extreme, more out of control and his lies are more dangerous than ever.\u201d She added: \u201cIt seems as though the political media cannot quit him. Treating Donald Trump as though he is just like any other regular political candidate is a huge strategic mistake. It normalises his crazy and that\u2019s partially how we got here in the first place. It is 2016 political Groundhog Day.\u201d Trump has always bragged, with some justification, that he is great for \u201cratings\u201d. In 2015 Leslie Moonves, then head of CBS, infamously said the ascent of Trump \u201cmay not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS\u201d. Confronted with a choice between screening Republican candidates such as Jeb Bush and John Kasich, or Trump rallies with their inherent sense of anything-could-happen danger, TV producers went for thrills and eyeballs. They were criticised for training cameras on an empty podium as they waited for the businessman and reality TV star to speak. The Hillary Clinton campaign grew frustrated as the candidate was constantly asked to respond to Trump\u2019s latest shocking remark. By the end of the election campaign, Trump had been the beneficiary of the equivalent of $5bn in free advertising, according to the media tracking firm mediaQuant. There was soul searching over whether journalists had been unwitting accomplices in his upset victory. Four years later, even as incumbent president, his campaign speeches received less coverage and more fact checking. Whereas his allegations about Clinton\u2019s home email server gained traction in 2016, his conspiracy theories about Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s laptop fell flat in 2020. Now, as America braces for a 2024 election that Trump has branded \u201cthe final battle\u201d, the media faces its ultimate test. How should it cover a man who made more than 30,000 false or misleading claims during his four years in the White House, according to a Washington Post count, and whose \u201cbig lie\u201d spurred a mob of his supporters to assail the US Capitol on 6 January 2021? Dan Cassino, a government and politics professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, New Jersey, said: \u201cI would hope that there are lessons to be learned about not carrying non-news events live, not treating every speech from a candidate as being important. Fact checking is impossible if you\u2019re showing fully live; showing it in pieces where there\u2019s something newsworthy, and fact checking the spot, is certainly a better idea. \u201cThe news doesn\u2019t have to always report every allegation that comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth. The biggest disservice that the news organisations did to the country in 2016 was to report breathlessly about the investigation of Hillary Clinton that turned out wasn\u2019t anything. It takes a little to do proper fact checking or to put things in context. Cassino added: \u201cIt\u2019s not maybe about de-platforming so much as being circumspect and choosing what to cover. We talk about bias oftentimes in terms of how people cover things but the more important bias is in what you cover and I would hope that news organisations have learned something from that.\u201d There was an early glimpse of how approaches may vary after Trump, accused of making a hush money payment to an adult film star, last month became the first former US president in history to face a criminal charge. When he returned from court in New York to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, Fox News and CNN aired most of his address live but MSNBC declined to show it. Host Rachel Maddow explained: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider that necessarily newsworthy and there is a cost to us as a news organization of knowingly broadcasting untrue things.\u201d Now CNN will come under scrutiny for its ability to challenge Trump with tough questions and fact check him in short order. The event, at St Anselm\u2019s College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, will be televised at 9pm on Wednesday and moderated by morning show anchor Kaitlan Collins. Trump will take questions from Republicans and undeclared voters who are planning to vote in the 2024 primary. The town hall comes at a difficult moment for CNN after staff redundancies, the firing of longtime host Don Lemon and record low ratings. Chris Licht, its chairman and chief executive, told the Guardian at last week\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in Washington that he had no regrets about taking up the job a year ago. But Setmayer, a former Republicans communications director on Capitol Hill, said she is not holding her breath for rigorous fact checking during Trump\u2019s town hall \u201cwithin the absolute dumpster fire CNN has become in the Chris Licht era. It\u2019s clear that the new ownership of CNN has an agenda to appeal to Trump voters at the expense of quality journalism.\u201d CNN declined to comment for this article but its political director, David Chalian, told Vanity Fair magazine: \u201cWe obviously can\u2019t control what Donald Trump says \u2013 that\u2019s up to him. What we can do is prod, ask questions, follow up and try to get as revealing answers as possible.\u201d Collins gained a reputation for sharp questioning of Trump during her time as a White House correspondent. Some media observers are determined to keep an open mind and judge CNN\u2019s performance on its merits. David Brock, president of Facts First USA, a bipartisan watchdog, commented: \u201cSo long as the the interview process is sufficiently tough and there is a fact check, at least on the back end, the more scrutiny of Trump the better. \u201cThe danger is obviously that you have a repeat of 2016 where studies showed after the fact that a lot of the free air time that Trump got where he was not challenged clearly helped the campaign and helped elect him. Provided we don\u2019t see a repeat of that kind of treatment, it\u2019s fine and healthy. The public may see what they see and reach their own conclusions, provided that there\u2019s sufficient scrutiny.\u201d Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: \u201cHe is going to have a platform regardless of who gives it to him and so, in my mind, it\u2019s probably better if it is a journalist or a media institution that is committed to actually asking tough questions than one that\u2019s not. \u201cI don\u2019t subscribe to the general point of view that you don\u2019t want to platform Donald Trump. It\u2019s silly because he\u2019s going to have a platform regardless.\u201d Trump\u2019s love-hate relationship with CNN is second in its complexity only to his love-hate relationship with the New York Times newspaper. He never gave an interview to a CNN journalist while he was president but tweeted about its output often. He denounced the network as \u201cfake news\u201d and the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and chafed under tough questioning by reporters such as Collins and Jim Acosta. He derided Licht\u2019s predecessor, Jeff Zucker, and encouraged his supporters to chant \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d at rallies. Although Trump has been interviewed by Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson in recent weeks on Fox News, holding first town hall-style event of the 2024 campaign on CNN could be an attempt to draw a contrast with Florida governor Ron DeSantis, his chief rival for the Republican nomination, who has eschewed the mainstream media in favour of rightwing echo chambers. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cIt\u2019s kind of amazing because one of the things about [Trump] is that he never, ever tried to expand his base. Going to CNN would certainly be expanding his base and the question is, boy, what does he do on that town hall? Does he do his usual crazy stuff or does he try to look more like a serious presidential candidate?\u201d She added: \u201cThe ratings, I suspect, will be through the roof just because of the curiosity of it. Which Donald Trump shows up? Is it the crazy conspiracy theorist or is it somebody who\u2019s trying to actually run for president?\u201d Even if Trump makes an obvious blunder that can be seized on by Biden, DeSantis and other rivals, it might cause panic among his campaign team but is unlikely to elicit any regrets from a man who has been called a \u201cworld class narcissist\u201d. \u201cYou know the old saying no publicity is bad publicity: Trump surely believes that,\u201d said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington."

            "date": "2023-05-28T22:29:40Z",
            "content": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has extended his two decades in power, securing victory over his rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu after an unprecedented presidential runoff election, in a vote that reflected Turkey\u2019s stark and persistent political polarisation. With 99.43% of the vote counted, Turkey\u2019s supreme election authority announced late on Sunday that Erdo\u011fan had won 52.14% of the votes, while K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu received 47.86%. With a gap of more than 2m votes between candidates, the votes yet to be counted would not change the result, said Ahmet Yener, the head of the election board. Even before the result was called, a triumphant Erdo\u011fan stood on top of a bus near his residence in Istanbul to once again sing a campaign song to his adherents and pronounce victory. \u201cLook at this scene. It\u2019s magnificent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have completed the second round of the presidential elections with the favour of our nation.\u201d He added: \u201cElections come and go, the flood goes away but the sand remains. The main thing is that our country does not deviate from its goals, and our nation takes care to remain united. This is the biggest message of today\u2019s elections.\u201d Both candidates encouraged their supporters to show up and vote in a run-off election where turnout was high. The victory for Turkey\u2019s longest-serving leader affords him both another term in office as president, and an endorsement of his populist style of politics after he emerged victorious in an election that challenged his rule. The Turkish leader has spent two decades reshaping the country in his own image, concentrating power on his office, detaining opponents and instituting increasingly unorthodox economic policies. Despite this, he gained support in many of the areas of Turkey worst hit by the country\u2019s financial troubles, as well as areas levelled in twin deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in south-east Turkey. \u201cWe are not the only ones who have won, Turkey has won \u2026 our democracy has won,\u201d Erdo\u011fan later told his supporters from the balcony of the presidential palace. The Turkish president went on to boast of Turkey\u2019s economic independence despite a financial crisis linked to his policies, one sparking a rising cost of living crisis among his citizens. \u201cWe will wait for the last vote to be counted,\u201d said \u00d6mer \u00c7elik, the spokesperson for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party (AKP), shortly before congratulations for the incumbent president arrived from leaders in Pakistan, Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary, and the emir of Qatar. Further congratulations later arrived from the US president, Joe Biden; the Russian president, Vladimir Putin; the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak; the French president, Emmanuel Macron; Brazil\u2019s president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva; and even Erdo\u011fan\u2019s former geopolitical rival the president of Egypt, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. At the headquarters of his Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) in the Turkish capital, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu attempted to console his supporters, but made no suggestion he could stand down as opposition leader. \u201cIn this election, the will of the people to change an authoritarian government has clearly emerged, despite all the pressures. We have experienced the most unfair election process of recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite this climate of fear, I would like to thank all the leaders of our alliance and our citizens. The Republican People\u2019s party and the Nation\u2019s Alliance will continue to struggle with all of their members. We will continue to be the pioneer in this struggle, until real democracy comes to our country. My biggest sadness is the trouble waiting for this country.\u201d Erdo\u011fan entered the second round in the lead, after a first round race where he received 49.5% of the overall vote compared with K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s 44.5%, while his AKP along with their nationalist coalition partners won a majority in parliament. The opposition had succeeded in forcing Erdo\u011fan into a run-off vote \u2013 an unprecedented event in the presidential system that Erdo\u011fan introduced \u2013 but was ultimately unable to clinch the majority of votes needed to secure victory. \u201cNo one should despair over the election results. No one should feel pessimistic, or feel defeated. If you believe in democracy, we should not forget that elections are the most fundamental function of any democracy,\u201d said Meral Ak\u015fener, leader of the opposition IYI (Good) party. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and his opposition coalition campaigned on the promise of returning Turkey to parliamentary democracy, pledging to reverse many of the changes that have marked Erdo\u011fan\u2019s two decades of rule, including concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. In an interview with CNN, Erdo\u011fan laughed off the suggestion he was seeking increasing authoritarian control. \u201cHow could someone going into a runoff election, instead of completing the election in the first round, be a dictator? That is the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of dictator is that?\u201d After initially promising a more subdued campaign in response to the earthquakes, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s campaign focused on assuring voters that only he is capable of solving problems that include a worsening economic crisis. \u201cPeople who were responsible after the earthquake didn\u2019t do their jobs, but our leader did everything for us,\u201d said Meliha Karab\u00f6k, in the town of Kahramanmara\u015f, part of a region that encompasses the epicentre of both earthquakes, and where Erdo\u011fan won comfortably despite criticism of his government\u2019s earthquake response. While the opposition holds mayorships in Turkey\u2019s six largest cities, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s campaign appeared to run aground outside his party\u2019s traditional enclaves on the Aegean coast and in metropolitan centres. In the Turkish provinces where Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rule previously catapulted many into the middle class, voters said they were unconvinced by the opposition\u2019s campaign. \u201cThe government cites this idea a lot, that we owe Erdo\u011fan for where Turkey now stands, that Turkey is now a very powerful country and we have done a lot thanks to his leadership, but our country is going through hardship and he should be given enough to time to recover as he\u2019s the only one who can manage this,\u201d said Evren Balta, a political scientist at \u00d6zye\u011fin university. After a setback for their campaign in the first round vote, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and the CHP encouraged their supporters to turn out a second time amid heightened concern among the opposition concerning the security of the vote and the count. CHP officials raised concerns that examples of violence towards their election observers in the south-east city of \u015eanl\u0131urfa and in Istanbul, where one electoral observer suffered broken ribs, amounted to interference in the voting process."

            "content": "Since no candidate won more than 50% of the first round in Turkey\u2019s presidential election on 14 May, a second round runoff was held between the two leading candidates on 28 May. The incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who polled 49.5% in the first round, was standing for the AK party and its allies. He has been at the pinnacle of Turkish politics for 20 years, first as prime minister and then as president. Since becoming president he has brought through constitutional changes to vastly increase the power of the office. Erdo\u011fan has also moved away from the strict secularist foundations of the Turkish republic, in favour of policies more in tune with Islam-friendly conservatism. His opponent in the runoff was Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the unity candidate of six opposition parties, who polled 44.9% in the first round. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu had promised to reverse some of Erdogan\u2019s constitutional innovations. A would-be kingmaker in the second round was Sinan O\u011fan, a rightwing candidate who gained 5.2% in the first round; seemingly inconsequential, but enough to tip the scales in favour of either of the leading pair. His major policy position was opposition to the continued presence in Turkey of refugees from regional conflicts, notably Syria. Reported results from Turkish elections are often controversial; early results from rural areas usually favour Erdo\u011fan and other conservatives, while the more populous big cities that lean toward secularists and reformists usually declare late. But the official election authority, the YSK, has confirmed the final result will not now change."

            "content": "In case you missed anything, here\u2019s a rundown of all the latest developments from the presidential election in Turkey. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who has led Turkey for 20 years, has been announced as the winner of a run-off. With 99.43% of ballot boxes opened, Erdo\u011fan has secured 52.14% of the vote, while his opponent, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, has received 47.86%. The run-off came after neither candidate proved able to secure more than 50% of the vote in the first round earlier this month. Thousands of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s supporters have gathered on the streets of Ankara this evening to celebrate his victory. Addressing a victory rally, Erdo\u011fan thanked \u201cevery single one of our people who once again gave us the responsibility to govern the country five more years\u201d and called for \u201cunity and solidarity\u201d. In a brief concession statement, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu said he felt \u201creal sadness about the big difficulties awaiting the country\u201d. Rishi Sunak has phoned Erdo\u011fan to congratulate him. A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had \u201creiterated the strong relationship between the United Kingdom and Turkey\u201d and that the two had \u201cagreed to continue working closely together to address shared challenges\u201d. In a tweet offering his own congratulations, US President Joe Biden told Erdo\u011fan he looked forward to \u201ccontinuing to work together as Nato Allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges\u201d. Other world leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have also offered their congratulations. We are now closing this blog, thanks for following along with us. Western capitals remained silent through Turkey\u2019s presidential campaign \u2013 privately hoping Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s erratic 20-year rule would come to a surprise close \u2013 but now he has been handed a decisive mandate to serve a third term, the west is caught between fear and hope. It fears he will exploit the result to take this Nato founder member further from the liberal secular west, but hopes against hope that, not being eligible to run again and thus freed from the need to pander to a nationalist electorate for the rest of his political life, he may at least be open to persuasion and base his foreign policy on something other than self-preservation. Either way, the choices Erdo\u011fan unbound makes matter not just for Turkey, Nato, and whatever order that emerges at the end of the war in Ukraine. Read the full analysis from our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, here: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have each offered congratulations to President Erdo\u011fan. In a statement released by the Kremlin, Putin called Erdo\u011fan a \u201cdear friend\u201d and praised his \u201cpersonal contribution to the strengthening of friendly Russian-Turkish relations\u201d. \u201cThe election victory was a natural result of your selfless work as the head of the Republic of Turkey, clear evidence of the support of the Turkish people for your efforts to strengthen state sovereignty and conduct an independent foreign policy,\u201d it said. Writing on Twitter, Zelenskiy congratulated Erdo\u011fan and said he hoped for the \u201cfurther strengthening of the strategic partnership for the benefit of our countries, as well as the strengthening of cooperation for the security and stability of Europe\u201d. Turkey is a member of Nato, and has been broadly supportive of Ukraine since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion last year, but has sought to maintain economic and diplomatic ties with Russia. The country has also acted as a mediator in negotiations over issues like the export of grain from Ukraine\u2019s ports on the Black Sea. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s opponent in the election, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, has made a brief concession statement. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, who secured 47.86% of the vote, said he felt \u201creal sadness about the big difficulties awaiting the country\u201d. President Erdo\u011fan has called for \u201cunity and solidarity\u201d in a victory speech outside the presidential palace in Ankara. Addressing a crowd of supporters, he said: \u201cI thank every single one of our people who once again gave us the responsibility to govern the country five more years. \u201cWe should come together in unity and solidarity. We call for this with all our heart.\u201d He pledged to focus on building stability and confidence in the Turkish economy and bringing down inflation, which according to World Bank figures stood at 72.3% in 2022. He also said he would secure the return of one million of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees currently hosted by Turkey. Rishi Sunak has spoken with President Erdo\u011fan to reiterate the \u201cstrong relationship\u201d between the UK and Turkey as \u201ceconomic partners and close Nato allies\u201d, Downing Street has said. \u201cPrime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan this evening to congratulate him on his re-election,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThe prime minister reiterated the strong relationship between the United Kingdom and Turkey, as economic partners and close Nato allies. \u201cHe reflected on Turkey\u2019s ongoing recovery from the devastating earthquakes earlier this year and pledged the UK\u2019s continued solidarity with the Turkish people. \u201cThe leaders agreed to continue working closely together to address shared challenges.\u201d President Biden has joined leaders from around the world in sending congratulations to Erdo\u011fan on his re-election. In a tweet, he said he looked forward to \u201ccontinuing to work together as Nato Allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges\u201d. With an initial count confirmed by the country\u2019s supreme election authority, which announced a victory for Erdo\u011fan, we are already starting to see the beginning of what another term for Turkey\u2019s longest-serving leader might look like. The Turkish lira, already in crisis, slipped below 20 to the dollar as the votes were counted this evening, in a sign of further crisis to come. Economists from Bloomberg previously estimated that the Turkish central bank has spent more than $177bn supporting the lira since December 2021. While the opposition were defeated in the second round vote, the conditions challenging Erdo\u011fan\u2019s control and prompting one of the most concerted challenges to his rule in decades appear set to remain. Turkey remains a fiercely polarised country, where the opposition secured just under 48% of the vote. Erdo\u011fan also appears happy to stoke culture war forces to shore up support from his base, once again inviting his supporters to brand every opposition party as \u201cLGBT\u201d in a call and response during his victory speech atop a car in Istanbul. A victorious Erdo\u011fan also received congratulations from many international leaders whom he was previously happy to spar with in order to project power at home, notably the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, also congratulated Erdo\u011fan, telling him \u201cour common security is the future priority\u201d, a clear reference to his country\u2019s bid for Nato accession, which has been held up by the Turkish president for over a year. Those congratulations will no doubt be well received by Erdo\u011fan, who is likely to view them as an endorsement that his often combative and bombastic methods on the international stage have brought results in his favour at home and abroad. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has sent his congratulations to Erdo\u011fan on his victory. In a tweet, he said he looked forward to continuing collaborations on issues including trade and shared security threats. It is slightly past midnight in Turkey where incumbent president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has been declared the winner of the presidency. Here is where things stand: The chairman of Turkey\u2019s supreme election council, Ahmet Yener, announced that incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has won Turkey\u2019s presidency in a runoff election with 52.14% of the votes, Reuters reports. With 99.43% of ballot boxes opened, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu received 47.86% of the votes, Yener said. The two candidates have a gap of over 2 million votes and the remainder of the uncounted votes will not affect the result, said Yener. Speaking to supporters on top of a bus on Sunday evening, the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, thanked voters for giving him the responsibility to rule for an additional five years. Erdo\u011fan, who has ruled the country for two decades, thanked Turks for voting and declared Turkey as the only winner in the runoff presidential election. \u201cWe have completed the second round of the presidential elections with the favour of our people,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. Turkey\u2019s opposition candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu vowed to continue to lead his struggle following early results that showed him trailing behind and losing to incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in what he called was the \u201cthe most unfair election in years\u201d. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, who received around 47.9% of votes in the country\u2019s runoff election, said the results showed people\u2019s will to change an authoritarian government. He is saddened by the \u201ctroubles\u201d awaiting Turkey, he added, according to Reuters. Somalia\u2019s president has also congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The two countries developed close ties after Erdo\u011fan became the first head of state outside Africa to visit the country in almost two decades in 2011. The bilateral relationship between the countries initially started out with humanitarian support but has developed a military component where the Turkish army trains Somali soldiers in their fight against the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabaab, as well as a burgeoning trade relationship and state-building support. The Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, have congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Al-Thani tweeted: \u201cMy dear brother Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, congratulations on your victory, and I wish you success in your new term, and that you achieve in it what the brotherly Turkish people aspire to in terms of progress and prosperity, and for the strong relations of our two countries to further development and growth.\u201d Orb\u00e1n echoed the sentiments, writing: \u201cCongratulations to President @RTErdogan on his unquestionable election victory!\u201d It has not been lost on analysts in Greece that President Erdo\u011fan will begin his new five-year stint in power exactly 100 years after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. \u201cHe will lead his country for the next five years and he begins his new term precisely in the year that he wanted, that is a century after the creation of the Republic of Turkey,\u201d noted Giorgos Tsogopoulos, a senior fellow at the Athens-based think tank Eliamep. Meral Ak\u015fener, leader of the opposition alliance member IYI Party, congratulated Erdo\u011fan at a press conference she held in Ankara. \u201cI hope that our nation\u2019s decision will benefit our country\u201d Ak\u015fener said. Due to disagreements over Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s candidacy, Ak\u015fener had quit the opposition alliance. She later rejoined after securing concessions over her preferred candidates both running as vice presidential candidates. It has not been lost on analysts in Greece that President Erdo\u011fan will begin his new five-year stint in power exactly 100 years after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. \u201cHe will lead his country for the next five years and he begins his new term precisely in the year that he wanted, that is a century after the creation of the Republic of Turkey,\u201d noted Giorgos Tsogopoulos, a senior fellow at the Athens-based think tank Eliamep. \u201cHis political success is undisputed. Not only has he not lost the elections, he has endured even when his political opponents rally to dethrone him,\u201d he added. Greece\u2019s political leadership has yet to congratulate the newly elected Erdogan. Following its own inconclusive general election on May 21, Turkey\u2019s neighbour and historic Nato rival has a caretaker government. Led by a senior judge, Ioannis Sarmas, the interim administration will lead the country to repeat polls on June 25. Former prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose centre right New Democracy party triumphed in the election but failed under a system of proportional representation to win a parliamentary majority, has said he will extend a \u201chand of friendship\u201d towards Turkey if he is voted back into office. \u201cBut I\u2019m not naive. I know that foreign policies of countries don\u2019t change from one day to the next,\u201d he told AP in an interview ahead of the 21 May vote. \u201cI would hope that the next Turkish government would overall reconsider its approach towards the West, not just towards Greece, towards Europe, towards Nato, and towards the United States. But again I have to be a realist and not be too naive, and that is why we will continue with \u2026 our firm foreign policy. That means we will continue to strengthen our deterrence capabilities and our defense capabilities.\u201d Meral Ak\u015fener, leader of the opposition alliance member IYI Party, congratulated Erdo\u011fan at a press conference she held in Ankara. \u201cI hope that our nation\u2019s decision will benefit our country\u201d Ak\u015fener said. Due to disagreements over Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s candidacy, Ak\u015fener had quit the opposition alliance. She later rejoined after securing concessions over her preferred candidates both running as vice presidential candidates. \u201cWe did not allow any power, ambition, or personal greed to stand in the way of our nation\u2019s demands and wishes. For this reason, we have received harsh criticism from time to time and paid the price for this,\u201d Ak\u015fener said. More world leaders have congratulated Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, with French president Emmanuel Macron and Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan hailing further cooperation between their countries and Turkey. \u201cThere are great challenges that France and Turkey will overcome together. The return of peace to Europe, the future of our Eurasian Alliance, the Mediterranean sea. We will continue to move forward together with President Erdo\u011fan, to whom I convey my congratulations on his re-election,\u201d wrote Macron. Meanwhile, Pashinyan wrote: \u201cCongratulations to President @RTErdogan on his re-election. Looking forward to continuing working together towards full normalisation of relations between our countries.\u201d Currently, Turkey and Armenia have almost no diplomatic relations as a result of a tumultuous history between the two countries including Armenian genocide and the ethnic and territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Opposition presidential candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s gave a speech intended to console his supporters from the Ankara headquarters of his Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP). \u201cIn this election, the will of the people to change an authoritarian government has clearly emerged, despite all the pressures. We have experienced the most unfair election process of recent years...despite this climate of fear, I would like to thank all the leaders of our alliance and our citizens. The Republican People\u2019s Party and the Nation\u2019s Alliance will continue to struggle with all of their members. We will continue to be the pioneer in this struggle, until real democracy comes to our country. My biggest sadness is the trouble waiting for this country,\u201d he said. The 74-year-old longtime CHP leader also gave few suggestions that he might step down following his defeat, despite his candidacy previously causing a rift among his opposition alliance amid allegations that other opposition figures stood a better chance of beating Erdo\u011fan. \u201cI want to see our 25 million citizens who have voted for me standing tall and proud, our march continues and we remain here,\u201d he added. \u201cI have always fought for your rights, for the law, so that no one can oppress you...So that you can live in peace and plenty, and I will continue to do so.\u201d Former prime minister of Turkey Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, who also served as President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s foreign minister, hailed the election results which has so far shown Erdogan significantly ahead of his rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. In a tweet on Sunday, Davuto\u011flu wrote: \u201cI wish the election results to be good for our country and our nation. I congratulate our citizens who showed high participation in the elections with great democratic maturity.\u201d He went on to add, \u201cAfter the final results are announced by the YSK, I will share the comprehensive assessment with the public,\u201d referring to the country\u2019s supreme election council. Jailed opposition leader Selahattin Demirta\u015f has released his first statement on the Turkish polls. In a string of tweets he congratulated his supporters for managing to get as many votes as they did despite the fact that they were up against \u201ca huge operational force that has taken over the state.\u201d Demirta\u015f wrote that the election was \u201cfull of inequalities, oppression, incredible lies, slander and smears.\u201d He added: \u201cEven reaching this rate of votes with a principled and moral election campaign against a huge operational force that has taken over the state is considered a miracle.\u201d Signing off, he urged his supporters to \u201cKeep fighting\u201d. Demirta\u015f was co-chair of the pro-Kurdish HDP party. He was jailed on terror charges in 2016 due to alleged links between his party and the PKK, a Kurdish militant group considered a terrorist organisation in Ankara and the EU. Demirta\u015f says arrest was politically motivated. In 2020, the grand chamber of the European court of human rights also ruled that Turkey\u2019s detention of Demirta\u015f was politically motivated. The chairman of Turkey\u2019s supreme election council, Ahmet Yener, announced that incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has won Turkey\u2019s presidency in a runoff election with 52.14% of the votes, Reuters reports. With 99.43% of ballot boxes opened, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu received 47.86% of the votes, Yener said. The two candidates have a gap of over 2 million votes and the remainder of the uncounted votes will not affect the result, said Yener. Turkey\u2019s opposition candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu vowed to continue to lead his struggle following early results that showed him trailing behind and losing to incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in what he called was the \u201cthe most unfair election in years\u201d. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, who received around 47.9% of votes in the country\u2019s runoff election, said the results showed people\u2019s will to change an authoritarian government. He is saddened by the \u201ctroubles\u201d awaiting Turkey, he added, according to Reuters. \u201cI ask my 25 million voters. Stand up, and walk proudly\u201d he continued. \u201cI did everything I could to make sure you could live in a fair nation and I will continue to lead that fight,\u201d he added. Kosovo\u2019s president has also congratulated Erdo\u011fan The Turkish text reads: \u201cMay the partnership between us continue to get stronger!\u201d Following Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s victory speech, Sinan O\u011fan, who came third in the first election round, tweeted on Sunday that the \u201cpresidential election process has been completed\u201d and went on to declare \u201cTurkish nationalists, Kemalists, the Turkish nation\u201d as winners. \u201cThe presidential election process has been completed. According to this result, our voters, who did not spare their support in the first round, continued to support us in the second round and voted for the stability of Turkey. \u201cOur voters abandoned the enthusiasm of those who said that these votes were not given to Sinan O\u011fan, they trusted us and to a great extent chose where we are. \u201cFrom here, I would like to express my gratitude to all my citizens who have remained loyal to the plan. Now a new era begins. \u201cThe winners were Turkish nationalists, Kemalists, the Turkish nation and the Turkish world, the losers were the lynching culture and the terror-affiliated parties and those who trusted them.\u201d Opposition areas see voter turnout drop Voter turnout was lower in this election overall but the stats show that turnout dropped quite heavily in big cities where K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu would have hoped to have stronger support, and in the south-eastern Kurdish-populated regions. Provinces won by Erdo\u011fan didn\u2019t see such a dramatic drop. Here are some figures through Anadolu: Istanbul: Round 1: 90.5% Round 2: 87.2% Izmir: Round 1: 90.2% Round 2: 87.19% Ankara: Round 1: 91.2% Round 2: 87.9% In the Kurdish region, where numbers for voter turnout are generally lower than other parts of the country, there was also a notable decrease. Speculation was rife about whether K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu would be able to retain the Kurdish vote if he courted the nationalist voters by working with far-right politician \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f. After the first round, Sinan O\u011fan, who finished third, endorsed Erdo\u011fan. O\u011fan led the ATA alliance, which consisted of a small group of marginal far-right parties, including \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f\u2019s Victory party. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu attempted to flank himself from the right and tap into some of those votes but that strategy appears to have caused voter apathy in the south-east. Speaking to Reuters, Reha Ruhavioglu, director of the Diyarbakir-based Kurdish Studies Center, said Kurdish voters lost interest in the opposition alliance as K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu drifted right. Demotivation stems from the CHP\u2019s political discourse, which shifted from reconciliation to security politics. Here are some numbers: Diyarbakir: Round 1: 81.7% Round 2: 75.9% A\u011fr\u0131: Round 1: 72.8% Round 2: 65.8% Mardin: Round 1: 82.7% Round 2: 78.7% Van: Round 1: 78.6% Round 2: 72.2% Siirt: Round 1: 83.3% Round 2: 78.6% Speaking to supporters on top of a bus on Sunday evening, the incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, thanked voters for giving him the responsibility to rule for an additional five years. Erdo\u011fan, who has ruled the country for two decades, thanked Turks for voting and declared Turkey as the only winner in the runoff presidential election. According to data from the majority of ballot boxes that have been counted, Erdogan is leading with roughly 52% support. Official results have yet to be released. \u201cWe have completed the second round of the presidential elections with the favour of our people,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said. He went on to thank voters, saying that \u201ceach and every member of the nation \u2026 once again conveyed to us responsibility for governing Turkey for the next five years\u201d. \u201cWe will be ruling the country for the coming five years \u2026 God willing, we will be deserving of your trust,\u201d he added. Somalia\u2019s president has also congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. The two countries developed close ties after Erdo\u011fan became the first head of state outside Africa to visit the country in almost two decades in 2011. The bilateral relationship between the countries initially started out with humanitarian support but has developed a military component where the Turkish army trains Somali soldiers in their fight against the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Shabaab, as well as a burgeoning trade relationship and state-building support. Last year, Erdo\u011fan announced that Turkey-Somalia trade reached $363m in 2021, a significant increase from $2m in 2003. Moreover, Turkey\u2019s largest embassy building in the world is located in Mogadishu, a further sign of the two countries\u2019 close ties. Earlier this month, Somalia\u2019s defence minister hailed Turkey as an \u201cirreplaceable partner\u201d for Somalia, citing Turkey\u2019s sprawling state-rebuilding investments in the country. Congratulations to our friend and brother T\u00fcrkiye! Turkey\u2019s supreme election council (YSK) has announced that 75.42% votes have been counted, with Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan receiving 53.41% of votes and his opponent, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, receiving 46.59%. The Qatari emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, have congratulated Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Al-Thani tweeted: \u201cMy dear brother Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, congratulations on your victory, and I wish you success in your new term, and that you achieve in it what the brotherly Turkish people aspire to in terms of progress and prosperity, and for the strong relations of our two countries to further development and growth.\u201d Orb\u00e1n echoed the sentiments, writing: \u201cCongratulations to President @RTErdogan on his unquestionable election victory!\u201d adding: \u201cTebrikler, Say\u0131n Cumhurba\u015fkan\u0131!\u201d, meaning: \u201cCongratulations, Mr President\u201d in Turkish. Losing Turkey\u2019s major cities hasn\u2019t proved much of a setback for Erdo\u011fan More than 90% of ballot boxes are now opened, according to state news agency Anadolu, so we\u2019ve got a bit of an idea of which candidate won votes and in which regions. The voting patterns in the second round look very similar to the first round. Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has performed strongly again in Turkish Thrace, and leads in all provinces along the Mediterranean coast, including the major city of Izmir. These are all regions where his party has traditionally had a strong presence. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu also appears to have won a greater share of the vote in Turkey\u2019s largest city, Istanbul, and the capital, Ankara, suggesting he\u2019s the more popular candidate in Turkey\u2019s three largest cities. The old maxim \u201che who rules Istanbul rules Turkey\u201d no longer appears to hold though, as he falls behind Erdo\u011fan in the final straight. In Turkey\u2019s fourth and fifth largest cities, Bursa and Konya respectively, which are AKP strongholds, Erdo\u011fan is expectedly leading. The south-east of the country has also produced interesting final results. Our colleagues Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Bar\u0131\u015f Narl\u0131 headed to areas impacted by the earthquake where they reported strong support for Erdo\u011fan despite the government\u2019s lacklustre initial response to the disaster. With the exception of Diyabakir, where K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu is leading, Erdo\u011fan has retained support across much of the region. He also appears to have expanded his support. Results so far suggest that Hatay, one of the worst-hit regions, has swung to Erdo\u011fan and away from K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, who won the province in the first round by an extremely narrow margin. Farther east, in the Kurdish populated region, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s informal alliance with the pro-Kurdish Ye\u015fil Sol party appears to have held up despite his alliance with the controversial far-right nationalist politician \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f for the second round. From the north-eastern region of Ardahan, which borders Georgia, down as far as Mardin, which borders Syria, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has a strong lead. These are all regions where the Ye\u015fil Sol party dominated in the parliamentary elections. Throughout central Anatolia, however, Erdo\u011fan has an overwhelming lead, where K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s tally has been much lower. According to Ahmet Yener, the chairman of the YSK, the country\u2019s supreme election council, 54% of the ballots have been counted, with Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan receiving 54.57% of the votes, and his rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu on 45.53%. \u00d6mer \u00c7elik, the spokesperson for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party, has hit back at statements from the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) spokesperson. We are lurching towards another war of narratives around the vote count, with both sides alleging that the other is presenting inaccurate data. \u201cNow they are trying to present their own data as the data of the whole of Turkey. They are trying to present this other data to muddy the waters,\u201d \u00c7elik said, in reference to statements from CHP spokesperson Faik \u00d6ztrak, who claimed that Erdo\u011fan and his rival were neck and neck. \u201cHere\u2019s what he needs to know: the only statement that muddied the waters in this whole process came from two mayors on the night of 14 May. They acted in an extremely irresponsible manner,\u201d \u00c7elik said, in reference to public statements given by the Ankara and Istanbul mayors on the night of the first round, where they claimed that the opposition was in the lead. \u201cWe have a political tradition that would respect the results until the final vote is counted. We will wait respectfully until the final vote is counted and the result will emerge,\u201d he said. \u00c7elik added: \u201cWe will wait for the last vote to be counted.\u201d The statement from the opposition Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) came a little ahead of schedule, with spokesperson Faik \u00d6ztrak once again telling opposition supporters to continue observing the count at the ballot boxes. \u201cAccording to our results, there is a head-to-head race. Keep doing your duty until this process is finished,\u201d he said. In a salvo at Erdo\u011fan\u2019s decision to give a victorious speech to his supporters from the balcony of his Justice and Development party (AKP) headquarters in Ankara, \u00d6ztrak added: \u201cNo one should try to muddy the waters with balcony speeches. Our nation continues to receive information from us moment by moment. It looks like we have got one vote from every two voters in Turkey.\u201d Initial vote counts are coming in thick and fast from both the state news agency Anadolu and opposition-leaning ANKA. Anadolu said that Erdo\u011fan currently has 55% of the vote, compared with K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu on 44%, with 61% of \u201cballot boxes opened\u201d, a somewhat mysterious turn of phrase that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate as votes counted. ANKA on the other hand has 50.99% to K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and 49.01% to Erdo\u011fan, with 59% of \u201cballot boxes opened\u201d. During the first round, both ANKA and Anadolu gave differing counts until late in the evening, leading to conflicting narratives about whether Erdo\u011fan or the opposition were in the lead, fuelled in part by statements from leading opposition officials. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and several leading officials also lashed out at Anadolu, but did not provide data to evidence their claims of a lead. The CHP have said they will speak at 19.00 local time here in Turkey, although we have already seen that CHP party spokesperson Faik \u00d6ztrak has already repeated some of the same claims about Anadolu. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in the past how the results were manipulated by state-owned Anadolu Agency. That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t leave the ballot boxes,\u201d he told opposition supporters. The head of Turkey\u2019s electoral authority, Ahmet Yener, has just announced that only 25% of the votes have been entered into their system for the official count. Voter turnout drops to 84% in the second round Turkey\u2019s election board has now lifted the broadcast ban on results from the elections. Early numbers have begun pouring in and just over half the ballots have been opened. One thing to note so far is that turnout has dropped in the second round compared with the first round. In the first round, turnout was over 88%, according to Turkey\u2019s Anadolu Agency, but this round has seen a slight drop to 84.2%, which is still remarkably high. It is also important to keep in mind that these elections were also for Turkey\u2019s 600-seat parliament, the shape of which is now clear. That will be the most important statistic for whoever comes out of this election on top, especially for opposition candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, whose party is the second largest in Turkey\u2019s parliament. The AKP-led People\u2019s Alliance \u2013 which includes the nationalist MHP \u2013 retained the largest number of deputies, even though their block shrank compared with 2018\u2019s election. They command 323 seats. Trailing them by just over a hundred deputies is the CHP-led Nation Alliance, which includes another nationalist party \u2013 the Iyi party, which has 212 parliamentarians in their block. The leftwing Labour and Freedom Alliance, which includes the pro-Kurdish Ye\u015fil Sol party (a successor to the HDP) and the Turkish Workers party, got just over 10% and have 65 deputies. Despite the fact that Turkey switched to an executive presidential system after a 2017 referendum, the country\u2019s parliament retains extensive powers, from the ratification of treaties to the passing of budgets and, crucially, the ability to amend the constitution. One of K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s key campaign pledges was to revert Turkey to a parliamentary democracy \u2013 which he will struggle to see through without a parliamentary majority. Although Erdo\u011fan would not face significant obstacles as he can count on MPs from his alliance to approve legislation, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu would have a bit of a tricky wicket with a hostile parliament. Even if he relied on the Labour and Freedom Alliance deputies, he would still lack the necessary majorities to enact law. Merve Dizdar, who won the best actress award yesterday at the 76th Cannes film festival for her teacher role in Nuri Bilge Ceylan\u2019s About Dry Grasses, returned to Istanbul to vote today. In footage on social media, Dizdar was applauded at the school where she went to vote. Dizdar\u2019s award speech went viral on social media in Turkey after she dedicated her award to \u201call her sisters who take action to strengthen the struggle of women\u201d and \u201call fighting spirits waiting to see the good days they deserve in Turkey\u201d. The mood at the polls today wasn\u2019t quite the busy and energetic atmosphere we witnessed a couple of weeks ago during the first round, in part because today\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t require the electorate to fill out long ballot sheets for the parliamentary election, and maybe a little of Istanbul\u2019s gloomy weather. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll actually go this time,\u201d said voter and election observer Ilhan Pekg\u00f6z, in reference to president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. After a bruising first round for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, whose coalition failed to win a predicted majority in parliament and who trailed the incumbent president by around five percentage points heading into the second round, few opposition supporters were feeling confident of an opposition victory. But what stuck out most among those at the polls today was a combination of wanting to vote anyway to show their objections to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s policies, particularly on the economy, as well as a lingering resentment about the ballot and the fairness of the count. The first round saw the opposition initially claim victory before accepting the results, as well as a storm of concerns about irregularities in the count that K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP) later said they contested. Days later, CHP officials clarified that although they disputed the vote-count in 2,269 ballot boxes, these would not have changed the overall result. Observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also said the first round was \u201cwell-managed and offered voters a choice between genuine political alternatives, but the current president and the ruling parties enjoyed an unjustified advantage.\u201d Despite the fairness of the vote itself, opposition supporters have often expressed discomfort with the feeling that the election has not been held in a fair context, where Erdo\u011fan has received disproportionately more coverage in the domestic media compared to his rival and the head of a major Kurdish political party remains in prison. \u201cNobody believes the first round was fair. If our votes don\u2019t get stolen, there\u2019s a high chance we could win,\u201d said Pekg\u00f6z. Polls are just about to close here, at 17.00 local time. The announcement of the unofficial final results of the last election was delayed until the next day. This time, it is estimated that the count will end sooner, as there are only two candidates. Turnout is expected to be decisive in the second round while both candidates repeatedly asked their followers to go voting during the runoff campaign period. In Turkey, the election turnout has been generally high in the past, reaching 88,92 percent in the first round. Candidates especially aim to convince around 8 million voters who did not go to the polls in the previous round. Opposition presidential candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu tweeted two hours before the polls closed: \u201cMy brothers and sisters who haven\u2019t voted yet, go to the ballot box, don\u2019t be lazy, vote! Your future is as close as walking distance.\u201d Turkish opposition has been stirring up anti-immigrant sentiments in attempt to win the presidency, the Guardian\u2019s Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Bar\u0131\u015f Narl\u0131 report. On the dock next to Istanbul\u2019s Kadik\u00f6y ferry port, a large screen displays the opposition\u2019s campaign videos on a loop, with presidential candidate Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s voice booming out through the speakers. Interspersed with soft rock soundtracking footage of the campaign trail are speeches in which he promises to deport the roughly 4 million refugees currently in Turkey. \u201cYou brought more than 10 million refugees in,\u201d he shouts, addressing President Erdo\u011fan, over footage of young people climbing through barbed wire and through dusty tracks next to grassland. \u201cI hereby declare that I will send all refugees back as soon as I come to power.\u201d Campaigners from K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) hand out Turkish flags and leaflets bearing his campaign promises, including a flyer bearing the words \u201crefugees will return home\u201d, showing a figure scaling a wire fence at sunset. CHP voter \u00c7isel Onat tapped her foot to the music as she watched. \u201cWe have to do this, unfortunately,\u201d she said of the promises to expel refugees. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who thinks everyone should just live in their own country in suitable conditions.\u201d While K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and his party have described themselves as democratic challengers to Erdo\u011fan, their campaign before the second-round poll has focused on an anti-immigrant message in an attempt to attract votes.

In the video, the lamb, clad in a a striped sweater, can be seen following the woman into the station, much to the amusement of onlookers. The woman is then seen handing in her ballot before she and the lamb head back out onto the streets. Reuters has this report from Ankara, as voting continues: Voting started at 8am (5am GMT) and will finish at 5pm (2pm GMT). The outcome is expected to start becoming clear by early evening local time. Polling stations were reportedly quieter in many places than two weeks ago, when turnout was 89%. The election will decide not only who leads Turkey, a Nato-member country of 85 million people, but also how it is governed, where its economy is headed after its currency plunged to one-tenth of its value against the dollar in a decade, and the shape of its foreign policy, which has seen Turkey anger the west by cultivating ties with Russia and Gulf states. Erdogan supporters gathered at a school near his home on the Asian side of Istanbul where he voted at about midday, before shaking hands and talking with the crowd. \u201cWith God\u2019s permission, he will win. The country has many problems but if anyone can solve them, he can,\u201d said Nuran, who came to vote with her three-year-old daughter. In Ankara, 32-year-old Gulcan Demiroz said she hoped the vote would bring change and that her friends would otherwise go abroad, as she was considering doing, for a better life. \u201cThis country deserves better. We need a collective of minds, not a powerful, cold, distant man who rules single handedly,\u201d said Gulcan, who works in the textile industry, after voting for K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, 74, voted in Ankara. He is the candidate of a six-party opposition alliance, and leads the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) created by Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. His camp has struggled to regain momentum after trailing Erdo\u011fan in the first round. The incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was pictured handing out money \u2013 banknotes worth 200 lira (\u00a38) \u2013 at the polling station where he cast his ballot today. Archie Bland and Ruth Michaelson explain why voters have returned to the polls just two weeks after the previous election. What happened in the first vote? Parliamentary and presidential elections took place in Turkey on Sunday. In the 600-seat parliament, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Justice and Development party (AKP) and its allies secured by far the most seats, 321, while the opposition won 213, and the 66 remaining seats went to a pro-Kurdish alliance. In the presidential vote, Turkey\u2019s supreme election council had Erdo\u011fan at 49.51% and K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu at 44.88%. A third candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan O\u011fan, took a vital 5.17% that appears to have kept both K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu or Erdo\u011fan from getting over the 50% line. Why was it close? While Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on the levers of power has brought Turkey close to autocracy, he has made serious economic missteps recently. He has increased his control of the theoretically independent central bank and steadfastly refused to increase interest rates despite inflation that officially touched 80% last year and which independent analysts say could, in reality, have surpassed 100%. Turkish people are far poorer and more uncertain of their futures as a result. The government response to the devastating recent earthquake was widely viewed as inadequate. In February, Erdo\u011fan made the tone-deaf comment that \u201cwhatever happens, happens, this is part of fate\u2019s plan\u201d. However, he has outperformed expectations and appears to be further ahead than was previously predicted. How will the runoff go? Erdo\u011fan clearly has the advantage. But the question of which side is able to successfully spin a story about its own success \u2013 and thereby either create a sense of momentum for the opposition or stymie it \u2013 will be central. The fight over the interpretation of the vote is really a symbol of how divided the country is. It is a question of whether K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu can plausibly say: \u201cJust a little further. We can do this.\u201d One question is where the votes for the ultranationalist third-place candidate, O\u011fan, will go. Voting for him was seen as a protest vote. It is possible his voters will be accepting of K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu because there are nationalists in his coalition. The second round of voting in the Turkish presidential election is under way, as my colleagues Ruth Michaelson and Deniz Bar\u0131\u015f Narl\u0131 report from Istanbul: Turkish voters are heading back to the polls for an unprecedented second round of a presidential election in which Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan hopes to see off a faltering challenge from rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. In the first round earlier this month, Erdo\u011fan upended expectations and many pollsters\u2019 predictions by coming out ahead with 49.5% of the vote, forcing his rival into second place with 44.5%. A further upset occurred in the parliamentary vote, where Erdo\u011fan\u2019s coalition won a comfortable majority. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has offered voters a chance to end Erdo\u011fan\u2019s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey\u2019s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. Both candidates have sought to harness support from voters who opted for the third-place presidential candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan O\u011fan of the Victory party, who obtained roughly 5% of the presidential vote in the first round. We will be covering all the developments in the live blog ahead of polls closing at 5pm in Turkey (3pm BST, 10am EDT) and an expected result at around midnight local time."

            "date": "2023-05-19T15:26:21Z",
            "content": "The rightwing governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, reportedly told top donors only he, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are \u201ccredible\u201d candidates for president in 2024 \u2013 and he is the only Republican who can beat the incumbent Democrat. \u201cYou have basically three people at this point that are credible in this whole thing,\u201d DeSantis said during a call on Thursday run by a fundraising committee, the New York Times said, adding that a reporter was listening. \u201cBiden, Trump and me. And I think of those three, two have a chance to get elected president \u2013 Biden and me, based on all the data in the swing states, which is not great for the former president and probably insurmountable because people aren\u2019t going to change their view of him,\u201d DeSantis said. DeSantis has long been expected to run but reports indicate he will make it official on Wednesday, filing documents with the Federal Election Commission and releasing an announcement video. A meeting of donors is reportedly scheduled for Miami the same day, with a rally to follow in DeSantis\u2019s home town, Dunedin, between 30 May and 1 June, according to Bloomberg and the Miami Herald. Trump faces unprecedented legal jeopardy, from criminal and civil cases arising from his treatment of women to investigations of his business affairs, his retention of classified documents and his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, culminating in the January 6 attack on Congress. A decision on indictments in the investigation of election subversion in Georgia is expected in August, sources told the Guardian and other outlets. Nonetheless, by presenting himself as the victim of political witch-hunts, Trump has established big polling leads. DeSantis lags by more than 30 points in polling averages but is way ahead of other candidates, declared or not, the former vice-president Mike Pence and the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley chief among them. The South Carolina senator Tim Scott is expected to announce his campaign on Monday. Polling pitting DeSantis against Biden produces narrow wins for either man. DeSantis\u2019s bold words on Thursday also reflected his formidable fundraising. Groups including the Super Pac Never Back Down, which organised the call, and Empower Parents (previously Friends of Ron DeSantis) have amassed big war chests. The name change of the latter group indicates DeSantis\u2019s pitch to voters: as the champion of culture-war attacks on progressive values, including restrictions on the teaching of LGBTQ+ issues and a six-week abortion ban, one of the toughest in any state. But a battle the Times said DeSantis did not mention on his call could cast a pall over his campaign. On Thursday, Disney, one of the biggest employers in Florida, pulled out of a $1bn office development in Orlando. DeSantis is battling the entertainment giant over its opposition to his so-called \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d public education law, a fight that has cost him donor support. Progressives, Democrats and many observers think DeSantis may have marched too far right to win a general election. On the Thursday call, the Times said, DeSantis said many Republicans thought \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win this time\u201d, a veiled jab at Trump\u2019s defeat in 2020 and bad results in midterm elections either side of that contest. He also claimed: \u201cThe corporate media wants Trump to be the nominee.\u201d Quoting a voter he said he spoke to in Iowa, he said: \u201cYou know, Trump was somebody, we liked his policies but we didn\u2019t like his values. And with you, we like your policies but also know that you share our values.\u201d Of his hardline legislative record, DeSantis said: \u201cWhen we say we\u2019re going to do something, we \u2026 get it done.\u201d The governor also boasted about sales of his book, The Courage to be Free, which he said outpaced similar volumes by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The Times said that claim was \u201croughly in line with the true totals\u201d. DeSantis said: \u201cI think the voters want to move on from Biden. They just want a vehicle they can get behind [but] there\u2019s just too many voters that don\u2019t view Trump as that vehicle.\u201d"

            "content": "Who\u2019s who and how it works Latest figures from the state-owned Anadolu Agency show no candidate in the presidential first round having won 50%; as such the race will go to a run-off in two weeks time between Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the incumbent, and Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, backed by several opposition parties. The official election authority, the YSK, agreed that a run-off will be needed, as things stand. It says that with a slightly lower proportion of ballot boxes opened, Erdo\u011fan had 49.49%, with K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu on 44.49%. Both the AA and the YSK were criticised by opposition parties overnight for giving a misleading impression of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s lead. Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has been at the pinnacle of Turkish politics for more than two decades. He was prime minister from 2003 to 2014 and has been president since. In the meantime he has ensured that the role of president has become the pre-eminent office of state. His Justice and Development party (AKP) is populist and conservative and leans away from Turkey\u2019s secularist past and toward Islamism. Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, a 74-year-old retired civil servant, has been Turkey\u2019s main opposition leader for more than a decade, leading his Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) to major victories in a string of big-city municipalities including Istanbul, Ankara and \u0130zmir. The rightwing Sinan O\u011fan, a former Nationalist Movement party (MHP) member, is running as an independent. In an 11th-hour twist, the final candidate, Muharrem \u0130nce, a rightwing nationalist, withdrew from the race days before polling day after the release of a sex tape that he said was a deepfake. The presidential election runs on the same basis as the French or Brazilian presidential elections; if a candidate exceeds 50% of the vote in the first round, they are elected. If not, the top two candidates go to a runoff in two weeks\u2019 time. At the same time as the presidential election, Turkish voters are choosing a new parliament. Seats are allotted by strict proportionality to any party or alliance that exceeds 7% of the popular vote. The parliament has taken a back seat in recent years, but could become significant again if K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu wins the presidency and keeps his promise to restrict its powers. The data here is from the state-run Anadolu Agency; full results are expected from the official election authority later today."

            "date": "2023-05-28T20:13:55Z",
            "content": "Since no candidate won more than 50% of the first round in Turkey\u2019s presidential election on 14 May, a second round runoff was held between the two leading candidates on 28 May. The incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who polled 49.5% in the first round, was standing for the AK party and its allies. He has been at the pinnacle of Turkish politics for 20 years, first as prime minister and then as president. Since becoming president he has brought through constitutional changes to vastly increase the power of the office. Erdo\u011fan has also moved away from the strict secularist foundations of the Turkish republic, in favour of policies more in tune with Islam-friendly conservatism. His opponent in the runoff was Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, the unity candidate of six opposition parties, who polled 44.9% in the first round. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu had promised to reverse some of Erdogan\u2019s constitutional innovations. A would-be kingmaker in the second round was Sinan O\u011fan, a rightwing candidate who gained 5.2% in the first round; seemingly inconsequential, but enough to tip the scales in favour of either of the leading pair. His major policy position was opposition to the continued presence in Turkey of refugees from regional conflicts, notably Syria. Reported results from Turkish elections are often controversial; early results from rural areas usually favour Erdo\u011fan and other conservatives, while the more populous big cities that lean toward secularists and reformists usually declare late. But the official election authority, the YSK, has confirmed the final result will not now change."

The president scored 49.51% against K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s 44.88%, with a small number of overseas votes left to count. The head of the supreme electoral board said even when the remaining 35,874 uncounted overseas votes were distributed, no one would secure the majority needed to win the elections outright.

It\u2019s local election night in England, an occasion best summarised by putting the TV on at 3.14am to hear Jonathan Ashworth MP say \u201cTamworth, Redditch, Ashby-de-la-Zouch\u201d. The first thing to say is that it\u2019s much too soon to draw firm conclusions about how the vote has gone, with only a quarter of councils declaring overnight. But the early read, as the Tories lose control in places like Tamworth and Plymouth, is: this looks like a very bad night for them, and a fairly good one for Labour, who are on course to take the lead in the total number of councillors for the first time in 20 years \u2013 though the Liberal Democrats are also playing a key role in the Conservative decline. For the very latest, head to the live blog. You can search for results in your area here. For a summary of what we know so far, read on after the headlines. Five big stories Serbia | At least eight people have been killed and 13 injured in Serbia in a series of shootings south of Belgrade, state-run media has reported, just one day after a school shooting saw nine killed in the capital. A 21-year-old suspect is believed to be in hiding. Artificial intelligence | The UK and US have intervened in the race to develop ever more powerful artificial intelligence technology, as the British competition watchdog launched a review of the sector and the White House advised tech firms of their duty to create safe products. The news capped a week of warnings about the speed of advances in the field. Russia | The White House has dismissed as \u201cludicrous\u201d claims by Russia that Washington orchestrated drone strikes on Moscow, saying the US was not involved in the attack and accusing Russia of lying. Russia said the US had \u201cdictated\u201d the plan of an attack it claimed was intended to kill Vladimir Putin. Slavery | The prime minister of Belize, Johnny Brice\u00f1o, has criticised Rishi Sunak\u2019s refusal to apologise for Britain\u2019s role in the transatlantic slave trade, and told the Guardian that it was \u201cquite likely\u201d Belize would soon become a republic. Brice\u00f1o argued that the British government had a moral responsibility to apologise for the atrocities of slavery. Music | A jury in New York has ruled that Ed Sheeran is not liable for copyright infringement in a case that has been closely watched by the global entertainment industry. The case centred on whether Sheeran ripped off Marvin Gaye\u2019s Let\u2019s Get It On and will be seen as a major victory for recording artists. In depth: Key takeaways from the results so far *** Key results | Tories losing councils from Medway to Stoke-on-Trent So far, 57 out of 230 councils have been called, with the majority to be confirmed later on Friday. (All of yesterday\u2019s ballots were in England, with none across the rest of the UK.) As of a few minutes ago, the Tories has lost seven councils, while Labour had gained three, with one going to independent control and three to no overall control (NOC). Overall, Labour have so far gained 110 seats, the Lib Dems 53, the Greens 28, and the Conservatives losing 196. After 23 years, Medway council became the first to flip directly from Conservative to Labour. Local leader Alan Jarrett said that it was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d and said that \u201cit\u2019s not the best grounding for the general election to come\u201d. He blamed \u201cthe relative unpopularity of some of the government\u2019s decisions\u201d, in particular \u201chousing targets that we\u2019ve seen centrally imposed\u201d. Labour have gained Plymouth from minority Conservative control, an important battleground for any future Westminster contest, in part because of the council\u2019s controversial felling of 110 trees in the city centre against overwhelming public objections. (A Tory candidate told the BBC: \u201cThey\u2019ve been drawing trees on the ballot papers, which makes a change from phallic symbols.\u201d) Labour\u2019s local MP Luke Pollard said that that result indicated his Conservative neighbour Johnny Mercer was \u201ctoast\u201d at the next general election. Labour took the symbolically significant council of Stoke-on-Trent back from NOC after eight years out of power, largely because of a big decline in independent councillors there. Labour\u2019s Ruth Smeeth told the BBC it was an \u201cincredible stepping stone\u201d, saying the result indicated the world \u201chas moved on\u201d from Brexit and that on the doorstep, \u201cfor the first time [people] are prepared to have a conversation with us about what the Labour party can offer.\u201d In a surprise result, the Conservatives lost Tamworth to NOC, with Labour picking up seven seats. It was a similar story in North West Leicestershire, which went to NOC after Labour gained ten seats, and where ousted local councillor Virge Richichi said that \u201con a national level, we have been let down\u201d. And it was a good night for the Lib Dems in Brentwood, which saw that formerly Tory council also move to no overall control. The Lib Dems and Labour both gained seats to push Hertsmere into NOC from Conservative control. There were also some good results for the Greens: for example, in Worcester, Conservative leader Chris Mitchell lost his seat to their local activist Tor Pingree, and the Tories slipped from largest party in NOC to third, behind Labour and the Greens \u2013 who gained four seats. *** Early indications | Possibility of 1,000 lost Conservative seats In advance of yesterday\u2019s vote, the Conservatives had been using the figure of 1,000 lost seats as a barometer of their expectations \u2013 but that appears to have been intended as a yardstick which they would have every chance of beating, so that they declare the night a success. They could still outperform that figure, to be clear. But shortly before 2am, the man whose name has presumably been changed by deed poll to Polling Expert John Curtice said that \u201cthe Conservatives cannot be sure they won\u2019t lose 1,000 seats\u201d. The early results showed that on the first 520 council wards, there was a 9.6% increase in Labour\u2019s share against the last time they were contested in 2019, and a 2.4% shift away from Conservatives. That would be enough to force Rishi Sunak out of office, but not enough for an overall Labour majority at a general election, Sky News\u2019 Sam Coates said. Another important measure is \u201cequivalent vote share\u201d, which seeks to give a sense of how these results would translate to a general election. \u201cExperts have been telling us that Labour needs a 10 point lead on that measure to be on course for a majority,\u201d said the Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Kiran Stacey. \u201cLabour are saying they\u2019re at about 8 points based on what we know so far and saying that\u2019s enough to win based on anticipated gains in Scotland. That tells you how close this is, because Scotland is up in the air.\u201d One really interesting finding from Professor Will Jennings of the University of Southampton: \u201cLabour is making its largest gains in areas that voted Leave in 2016, while the Conservatives are suffering their largest losses in areas that voted Remain\u201d. In other words, Brexit now looks like a less toxic issue among Leave voters who left Labour than it is for Remain voters who might otherwise back the Tories. Some big councils with lots of seats are due to report this morning, so it\u2019s too early to draw firm conclusions from these early signs. The overall reading of the results will depend, to a considerable extent, on results in Tory-Lib Dem contests coming later today. But Labour indicated ahead of yesterday that they hoped for their results to improve as the day went on, as well. While there is still work to do, Keir Starmer can say he is charting a plausible path to a Labour government - but not quite an inevitable one. \u201cIt\u2019s very on brand for Starmer,\u201d Kiran said. \u201cIt\u2019s solid, but unexciting \u2013 it might be enough, it might not.\u201d As for Rishi Sunak: \u201cTory MPs are all over broadcast this morning talking about how they\u2019ve heard from voters on the doorstep about Johnson and Truss. They\u2019d have liked to hear a bit more about Sunak. He can still say that he\u2019s stopped the bleeding and he has time to set his stall out for voters. But this is a warning that if the brand is so badly damaged, it will be very hard.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had the feeling for a while that this feels like 2009, when one party has lost energy but the other hasn\u2019t sealed the deal,\u201d Kiran said. \u201cNothing we\u2019ve seen tonight changes my mind on that.\u201d *** Voter ID | Anecdotal evidence of issues, but no clear picture of impact yet Around lunchtime yesterday, Peter Stanyon, the chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said there had been \u201cno reported incidents of any major concern\u201d as the UK rolled out new voter ID requirements for the first time. And Peter Walker and Jessica Murray report that fears of widespread chaos did not materialise. But by the end of the day, there were anecdotal reports of a number of people, many from marginalised groups, being unable to cast their ballots. The Electoral Reform Society said there were \u201ccountless examples\u201d. ITV News reported that polling station tellers in Oxfordshire estimated that 10-25% of would-be voters had been turned away. The Electoral Commission said that the election was \u201cwell run\u201d overall but \u201csome people were regrettably unable to vote\u201d. (Meanwhile, one voter issued her dog Ruby with a homemade ID card, pictured above. No word on whether she was allowed in.) A report on the change is due in September, with initial findings published in June. The Financial Times reported last night (\u00a3) that ministers plan to widen the forms of photo identification that will be valid in future if turnout is shown to have fallen \u2013 a U-turn in government policy.

            "title": "The Guardian view on Turkey\u2019s election results: a step towards autocracy? | Editorial",
            "date": "2023-05-15T18:20:56Z",
            "content": "In the lead-up to Turkey\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, there seemed to be good grounds to believe that voters were about to turn their back on Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authoritarian brand of nationalism. His assumption of quasi-monarchical presidential powers in 2018 had succeeded in uniting a perennially divided opposition against him. Polls suggested a close race, but placed the president\u2019s main rival for power, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, significantly ahead. Requiring a vote above 50% to win outright and avoid a runoff, Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s declared aspiration was to \u201cfinish it in the first round\u201d. That optimism has turned out to be sadly misplaced. As it transpired, it was Mr Erdo\u011fan who almost won at the first time of asking, winning over 49% of votes to Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s 45%. The coalition led by the president\u2019s Justice and Development party (AKP) is also set to win a surprise majority in the Grand National Assembly. That outcome will stymie opposition attempts to restore parliamentary democracy to Turkey, irrespective of the result of the presidential runoff in a fortnight\u2019s time. Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s race is not yet run. But a combination of incumbency advantage, and the momentum provided by the AKP\u2019s win in parliament, means that Mr Erdo\u011fan is now likely to extend his increasingly autocratic rule into a third decade. This despite an inflation rate running close to 50% as a result of his refusal to raise interest rates, and widespread disillusionment at the government\u2019s sluggish response to the devastating earthquakes three months ago. For Europe and the US, which had hoped an opposition victory would see Turkey turn more towards the west, five more years of Mr Erdo\u011fan would be a highly unwelcome development \u2013 particularly ahead of a decisive period in Ukraine. For those likely to suffer further erosion of their civil rights in Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s increasingly illiberal democracy, Sunday\u2019s setback is a bitter disappointment and an ominous portent. Turkey\u2019s Kurdish minority population, dissidents, journalists, women\u2019s rights campaigners and LGBTQ+ people have all been subject to political repression in recent years, as the president has shored up his popularity through culture wars and a focus on terrorism and security. If Mr Erdo\u011fan survives this, the most concerted and unified democratic challenge to his power to date, the temptation to move Turkey further down the road towards full-blown autocracy will be considerable. Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s deflated alliance has two weeks to shift the dial in a presidential race that has confounded its expectations. In the context of a hostile media overwhelmingly biased in favour of Mr Erdo\u011fan, that will be a very tall order. If the opposition is to succeed, it will need to make inroads among less well-off nationalist voters outside the cities, who appear to have responded to pre-election measures to mitigate the crisis caused by soaring inflation. Last week, Mr Erdo\u011fan announced a 45% pay hike for public sector workers, the latest in a series of moves including a reduction in electricity prices, and the offer of a month\u2019s free natural gas to households. Notwithstanding the economic pain caused by out-of-control inflation, Mr Erdo\u011fan persuaded the religious conservative working class that he remains the best leader to protect their interests. Unless Mr K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu can convince enough of them otherwise, the medium-term prospects for Turkish democracy look bleak."

            "title": "Local election watch: key results to look out for across England",
            "date": "2023-05-04T05:00:40Z",
            "content": "Voters have heard the pledges and promises of four Conservative prime ministers since the last time this set of authorities were up for election in May 2019. Theresa May faced enormous pressure to quit after a bad set of results and she resigned in June that year. Keir Starmer will be hoping to reap the rewards of Labour\u2019s 18-point lead over the Conservatives. The Tories, who launched their local election campaign with little fanfare, have been in heavy expectation-management mode, predicting losses of more than 1,000 seats. Commentators predict that Tory losses of even 500 seats would mean trouble for Rishi Sunak\u2019s authority. But Labour also has a lot to prove, with more than 8,000 council seats across 230 authorities in England up for election on Thursday. Here are the key seats and timings to look out for. Early hours of Friday 2am Results from Thurrock will begin to emerge, where the Conservatives hold a majority with 29 councillors, which they are desperate to keep. 3am North East Lincolnshire has emerged as a key battleground for Labour, as the council has been controlled by the Tories since 2019. As results flow in, Starmer\u2019s allies will be keen to see whether \u201cred wall\u201d voters are willing to really give Labour a chance. A number of issues could affect whether voters will lend the Tories their vote once more, including government plans to house asylum seekers in the RAF Scampton base within this council area, which has cropped up as a doorstep issue despite the base being outside the council area. 4am Labour will hope to steal an early victory as results emerge from Plymouth city council, one of its targets. It is led by a Conservative minority administration, after Richard Bingley was sacked after a row over tree-felling. Labour is confident it can make gains in the bellwether council, but an outright majority could be difficult given only a third of the council is up for grabs. Friday morning 6am Starmer has campaigned in the Conservative-run council of Medway twice in the run-up to polling day to insist the party is \u201cpositive and united\u201d and has a \u201cfighting chance\u201d. Labour will hope to win the unitary authority for the first time since its creation in 1998. The council is now made up of 33 Tory councillors and 20 from Labour. Results from Stoke-on-Trent, Tameside and South Gloucestershire will also start to emerge at around this time. Friday afternoon Noon Results from Solihull will arrive, where the Conservatives are defending a narrow majority which is under threat from the Green party and the Liberal Democrats. 2pm The Conservatives will be keeping a close eye on whether they can make gains in Torbay council, which is run by a coalition of the Lib Dems and independents. 4pm A single gain in Gravesham council would give Labour an outright majority. Labour would love to gain a toehold in Kent, where the Tories hold 16 out of 17 constituencies. The Greens will be hoping to become the largest party in Mid Suffolk. In the 2019 elections, the Greens managed to pick up 34% of the vote share, almost double their count in 2015. The Liberal Democrats hope to overturn several slim Tory majorities in the south-east council of Cherwell. Friday evening 5pm Results from Bolsover will show whether Starmer has boosted Labour. A failure to win this council, which has a mix of independent councillors, will be deemed a bad result for the party. Eyes will be on Leicester\u2019s mayoral election when results are due in from the traditionally Labour-held council, nicknamed \u201cRed Leicester\u201d. The party has held overall control of the city council since 2007 and it holds 47 of the 54 seats. Sir Peter Soulsby has held the mayoral role since 2011 but the party may struggle this year \u2013 with all of its council seats and mayoral role up for grabs \u2013 after 19 sitting councillors, the majority of them from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds, were deselected by Labour\u2019s national committee. 6pm In Cheshire West and Chester council, Labour is the single largest party and will be hoping to win an outright majority. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2023 to clarify a reference to RAF Scampton, which is outside the North East Lincolnshire council area. Also, this council has been controlled by the Tories only since 2019, not 2011 as a previous version said."

            "title": "Spain\u2019s conservative opposition heading for emphatic win in regional polls",
            "date": "2023-05-28T22:13:45Z",
            "content": "Spain\u2019s opposition conservative People\u2019s party (PP) is heading for an emphatic win in Sunday\u2019s key regional and municipal elections, winning an absolute majority in the city of Madrid and in the surrounding area. It is poised to wrest the regions of Valencia, Arag\u00f3n and the Balearic islands from the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE). The PP\u2019s triumph, which comes after a bitter and fractious campaign marred by a row over the defunct Basque terrorist organisation Eta and allegations of electoral fraud, will serve as a huge boost to the party ahead of December\u2019s general election. The results of the polls in 12 regions and more than 8,000 municipal councils also indicate a return to the traditional, two-party system that dominated Spanish politics before the eruption of the far-left, anti-austerity Podemos and the now moribund centre-right Citizens party. By 11.30pm local time, with more than 98% of the municipal votes counted, the PP had attracted 31.5% of the vote and won 23,248 council seats, while the PSOE had taken 28.1% of the vote and won 20,676 seats. The incumbent PP mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, secured an absolute majority in the capital, while his party also won the most seats on the city councils of Seville, Segovia, Valencia and Palma. With 60% of the votes counted in the Madrid region, the PP had won 69 seats in the 136-seat regional parliament, giving its rightwing populist regional president, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, an absolute majority. The party was also ahead in the regions of Arag\u00f3n, Valencia, the Balearics and La Rioja. In Barcelona, the city\u2019s leftwing mayor, Ada Colau, was relegated to third place after Xavier Trias, a former mayor who belongs to the centre-right Catalan pro-independence party Junts, finished first and Jaume Collboni, of the Catalan branch of the PSOE, came second. Cuca Gamarra, a spokesperson for the PP, said the results were irrefutable proof of Spain\u2019s desire for change. \u201cThe Spanish people have spoken and they have spoken clearly and forcefully \u2013 and what they have said today is that the People\u2019s party has won the municipal and regional elections,\u201d she said. The PSOE spokesperson, Pilar Alegr\u00eda, struck a penitent note, saying that the party had received the electorate\u2019s message, adding: \u201cThis isn\u2019t what we\u2019d been hoping for after these weeks of campaigning and obviously we will have to reflect [on what happened] over the coming months.\u201d But she also warned that the PP would only be able to take power in some of its newly won regions if it struck deals with the far-right Vox party. Although the PP already governs the Castilla and Le\u00f3n region with Vox, entering into any new regional pacts would allow the left to paint the PP as a party that is prepared to abandon the centre ground and make deals with the far right for the sake of winning power. Despite the elections\u2019 regional and local nature, the PP had sought to use the polls as a referendum on the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and his style of government, which it calls sanchismo and depicts as incompetent, over-reaching and hellbent on remaining in office. \u201cThese aren\u2019t just elections to choose a mayor or a regional government,\u201d the PP leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, said during an end-of-campaign rally on Friday. \u201cSanchismo has stained everything and I\u2019m afraid to have to say, respectfully but sadly, that the prime minister of my country has no limits. His party has been unable to stop him and so we must do so together as Spaniards.\u201d S\u00e1nchez struck a less combative note after casting his vote on Sunday morning, urging people to ignore the rows of recent days and to vote calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we all go and vote and that we do so in a positive way, forgetting this intolerance, this noise, this depreciation and these tensions that a minority are trying to stoke,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that the majority of citizens will vote positively, respectfully and thoughtfully.\u201d S\u00e1nchez began the campaign hoping to stress his coalition government\u2019s economic record, housing reforms and schemes to help young people. But the first week of the campaign descended into rancorous fights over the past, after it emerged that the Basque nationalist party EH Bildu \u2013 on whose support the minority government relies in Congress \u2013 was fielding 44 convicted Eta members, including seven people found guilty of violent crimes, as candidates. S\u00e1nchez criticised Bildu\u2019s decision \u2013 describing it as legal but \u201cobviously indecent\u201d \u2013 and the Basque party later announced that the seven candidates convicted for violence would not take up their seats, but the PP seized on the issue as further proof of the government\u2019s hunger to remain in power. Feij\u00f3o attacked S\u00e1nchez for his reliance on Bildu and Catalan pro-independence parties \u2013 and for the bungled sexual offences legislation, introduced by his junior coalition partners in Podemos, that has allowed more than 1,000 convicted sex offenders to have their sentences cut and more than 100 to win early release. \u201cYou\u2019re the great electoral hope for rapists and pederasts, for mutineers, squatters, corrupt people and now for those who used to go about in balaclavas with pistols,\u201d he told S\u00e1nchez. \u201cAnd I will never be that.\u201d Eta, which abandoned its armed campaign in 2011 and dissolved itself five years ago, murdered 829 people in its five-decade-long quest to bring about an independent Basque country. S\u00e1nchez said the PP\u2019s tired reliance on the spectre of a vanished terrorist group was proof of its lack of electoral initiatives. \u201cWhat\u2019s your proposal on housing?\u201d he asked the party. \u201cEta. In other words, nothing. On education? Eta. In other words, nothing. On the climate emergency? Eta. In other words, nothing. \u201cWhen Eta is nothing in Spain, it is still everything to you. Because, in your desperation, Eta is all you have, even though it doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Spats over Eta were followed by fears of electoral fraud after police in Spain\u2019s north African enclave of Melilla arrested 10 people suspected of participating in an alleged postal vote-buying fraud. Seven others were detained on suspicion of vote-buying in the Andaluc\u00edan town of Moj\u00e1car, while police were also investigating possible fraud in the Canary Islands and the Murcia region."

            "title": "Now Brexit brings a bitter Tory reckoning at the polls | William Keegan",
            "date": "2023-05-14T06:00:46Z",
            "content": "\u2018When one with honeyed words but evil mind persuades the mob, great woes befall the state.\u201d Euripides was not of course referring to Brexit in his play Orestes, but to the chaos caused by Clytemnestra\u2019s murder of Agamemnon and Orestes\u2019s dispatch, in turn, of Clytemnestra. The disastrous outcome for the Conservatives in the local elections may not lead to any physical violence, but all the signs are, as the recriminations begin, that the Tories are in for a metaphorical bloodbath. Let us face it: the Brexiters, led by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, conducted their referendum campaign with honeyed words; their minds may not have been intentionally evil, but you could have fooled me. Brexit has proved to be an unmitigated disaster. The evidence mounts that great woes have befallen the state. But this is only the beginning. Our imports from and exports to our nearest and most important trading partner, namely the EU, are already suffering from serious delays \u2013 in some cases coming to a halt as businesses decide to give up the ghost. The bureaucracy is going to become far worse at the end of the year, when the full impact of the trading limitations the government has imposed on itself is due to be felt. Meanwhile, our scientists are hampered by lack of access to the EU\u2019s Horizon programme, the young can no longer enjoy the educational benefits of Erasmus student exchanges, and freedom of movement is inhibited in all sorts of ways. Moreover, as the realities of modern economic diplomacy point to the wisdom of belonging to a European group that can hold its own in the face of US and Chinese influence, we are left hanging on the fringes with precious little bargaining power. And yet, and yet: the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, continues to rule out the chance to go down in history as the man who called the Brexiters\u2019 bluff, made a big issue of the hundreds-of-billions cost of Brexit, and demanded nothing less than re-entry to an organisation we never should have left. Starmer was riding high last week, basking in the pathetic performance of the Tories in the local elections and opinion polls. His Commons performances vis-a-vis the hapless Rishi Sunak are even beginning to remind people of the great days of Harold Wilson as opposition leader. But the truth is that the shadow of Brexit hangs over those election results. The Conservatives did badly partly as a result of the nation finally revolting against their abysmal 13-year record, but also because the spreading woes of Brexit are coming home to those who rightly feel they were hopelessly misled by honeyed words. The Lib Dems did well because they have made the right judgment on Brexit, and are not afraid to say so. Labour has not done as well as it should because many pro-European voters have made their feelings known by switching to the pro-European Lib Dems. And another thing: the persistently high level of inflation is much in the news, and being felt in many people\u2019s pockets. But there can be little doubt that this country\u2019s rate of inflation is higher than that in the US and EU. It is higher because of the dramatic impact of Brexit on import prices. The young are amazed that the Bank rate has been raised to 4.5%, but those with long memories recall that, years ago, a \u201ccrisis\u201d rate was 7%. The difference is that, in those days, the inflation rate was 3-4%, not 10% or more, as recently. Anyway, with good timing, the economist Stephen D King \u2013 senior adviser to HSBC, not the novelist \u2013 has written a fine guide on this subject entitled We Need To Talk About Inflation. Among other things, he is wary of the faith being placed in central banks. As he says: \u201cThe really tough policy decisions \u2013 most obviously the costs associated with squeezing excessive inflation out of the system \u2013 may ultimately require some form of political validation.\u201d He thinks that \u201cavoiding tough action may have contributed to further inflationary pressures\u201d, and draws an interesting contrast between the \u201cavoidance\u201d approach of the US Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns in the 1970s and the tough, indeed brutal, hoisting of interest rates to 20% by his successor, Paul Volcker, in the 1980s. These are deep political waters. But there can be no doubt whatsoever that the Bank of England\u2019s attempt to control inflation has not been helped by our departure from the EU. Nor that, when the figures for the annual rate of inflation do fall, the impact of previous rises will still be felt by a country that has been made poorer by Brexit."

            "date": "2023-05-29T10:38:51Z",
            "content": "Spain\u2019s socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has responded to the triumph of the rightwing opposition in Sunday\u2019s regional and municipal elections by calling a risky snap general election that will determine his political future and that of his minority coalition government. The conservative People\u2019s party (PP) \u2013 which used the votes as a de facto referendum on S\u00e1nchez\u2019s coalition with the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance \u2013 scored an emphatic win, far exceeding expectations and building on its momentum in the polls. As well as securing absolute majorities in the Madrid region and the city council, it took regions including Arag\u00f3n, Valencia and the Balearic islands from the prime minister\u2019s Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party (PSOE). The PP\u2019s failure to achieve the necessary majorities in many of the newly-won regions, however, means it will have to strike deals with the far-right Vox party, which also comfortably increased its showing on Sunday. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s high-stakes gamble, which he announced just hours after the results came in, is based on the hope that any such deals will help to galvanise and mobilise leftwing voters and prove distasteful to supporters on the PP\u2019s moderate wing. Speaking at the Moncloa palace in Madrid on Monday morning, S\u00e1nchez said he had informed King Felipe of his decision to dissolve parliament and call a general election on 23 July, five months before the poll had been scheduled to be held. \u201cI\u2019ve taken this decision in view of yesterday\u2019s election results,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first consequence of the results is that magnificent socialist regional presidents and mayors who have governed impeccably have lost despite the fact that many of them increased their support yesterday. The second consequence is that many, many institutions will be administered by new majorities comprising the People\u2019s party and Vox.\u201d S\u00e1nchez said that while Sunday\u2019s votes had been municipal and regional, they had \u201ctransmitted a message\u201d that transcended local considerations and demanded a democratic response. Announcing the election, he stressed Spain\u2019s economic recovery since the start of the pandemic and the country\u2019s forthcoming EU presidency, and said it would be for the Spanish people to decide what happened next. \u201cI think we need a clarification when it comes to what the Spanish people want, a clarification when it comes to the policies that the national government should offer, and a clarification when it comes to the political groups that should lead this phase,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one infallible method for resolving those doubts, and that method is democracy. As a result, I think the best thing is for Spanish men and women to have their say and to decide the country\u2019s political direction as soon as possible.\u201d The PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, welcomed the early election but suggested S\u00e1nchez had called it in an attempt to distract from the drubbing his government had received on Sunday. \u201cAnnouncing a snap election won\u2019t hide what happened yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cSpaniards have said enough is enough, and I\u2019m grateful that that sentiment has translated into a clear victory for the People\u2019s party. But, even more importantly, another way of doing politics has started to win.\u201d Feij\u00f3o has attempted to move the PP back to the political centre ground after the party lurched to the right under his predecessor, Pablo Casado, who embraced a harder line in an effort to stop the party being outflanked by Vox. Despite the fact that Casado once famously attacked the far-right party for practising politics based on \u201cfear, anger, resentment and revenge\u201d, the PP formed an often rocky coalition government with Vox in the Castile-Le\u00f3n region last year. Eyes will now turn to Podemos and Sumar, the new leftwing platform led by the labour minister and deputy prime minister, Yolanda D\u00edaz, to see whether the two groups join forces to fight the election. Podemos suffered disastrous results on Sunday as its support collapsed in key regions. The party\u2019s leader, Ione Belarra, went on the offensive on Monday, describing the PP and Vox as a \u201creactionary wave\u201d that would seek to cut public services, bring in privatisation and reverse the progress the coalition government had made on tackling the climate emergency, improving housing and protecting social rights. D\u00edaz, meanwhile, signalled that her movement was more than ready for the early election. \u201cWe have a project that can provide answers to our country\u2019s social, ecological and economic issues,\u201d she said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re heading out to win against Feij\u00f3o\u2019s black Spain. The people are waiting for us.\u201d S\u00e1nchez\u2019s decision to call an early election is not his first big gamble. After being defenestrated as party leader in 2016, he staged a triumphant comeback that culminated in the vote of no-confidence that cast the PP out of office in 2018. He also propelled the PSOE to two general election victories in 2019, although the party fell short of a majority on both occasions, leading to the coalition with Unidas Podemos. Antonio Barroso, an analyst at the political consultancy Teneo, said it remained unclear whether S\u00e1nchez\u2019s latest bet would pay off. \u201cThe PP has maintained its lead in opinion polls despite sharing power with Vox in the Castile-Le\u00f3n region since 2022,\u201d he said. \u201cThis creates some doubts about the effectiveness of a strategy centred on mobilising leftwing voters against a potential rightwing government. \u201cMoreover, Spain has never held a general election in the middle of the summer, which generates some uncertainty regarding whether the chosen date will have a negative effect on turnout.\u201d"

            "title": "Polls open in Turkish election runoff as Erdo\u011fan hopes to retain power",
            "date": "2023-05-28T09:03:43Z",
            "content": "Turkish voters are heading back to the polls for an unprecedented second round of a presidential election in which Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan hopes to see off a faltering challenge from rival Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. In the first round this month, Erdo\u011fan upended expectations and many pollsters\u2019 predictions by coming out ahead with 49.5% of the vote, as his rival took second place with 44.5%. A further upset occurred in the parliamentary vote, where Erdo\u011fan\u2019s coalition won a comfortable majority. A rejuvenated, jubilant Erdo\u011fan emerged on to the balcony at the Ankara headquarters of his Justice and Development party (AKP) after the first-round votes were tallied, singing one of his campaign songs to supporters. At a rally in Istanbul on Saturday, Erdo\u011fan urged his supporters not to be complacent after a record turnout in the first round. \u201cAre we running to the polls tomorrow? Will we cast our votes from the early hours of the morning?\u201d he asked a cheering crowd. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has offered voters a chance to end Erdo\u011fan\u2019s two decades in power and to prevent Turkey\u2019s longest-serving leader from extending his rule into a third decade. During Erdo\u011fan\u2019s tenure, first as prime minister then as president, the 69-year-old has overhauled Turkey\u2019s political system and reshaped it in his own image, introducing a presidential system, concentrating power around his office and jailing opponents. After initially focusing on how his candidacy offered voters a chance to reverse the changes introduced by Erdo\u011fan, including promises of a return to parliamentary democracy and messages of social inclusion, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s campaign pivoted firmly to the right in advance of the runoff. Both candidates have sought to harness support from voters who opted for the third-place presidential candidate, the ultranationalist Sinan O\u011fan of the Victory party, who obtained roughly 5% of the presidential vote in the first round. O\u011fan declared his support for Erdo\u011fan, while the head of the Victory party, \u00dcmit \u00d6zda\u011f, backed K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu, claiming he believed the opposition leader was more likely to follow through on his pledge to deport millions of refugees and crack down on immigration. K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu\u2019s messaging has focused largely on anti-immigrant sentiment in the days before the runoff, as well as signing an agreement with \u00d6zda\u011f including promises that represent a swipe at Kurdish voters in eastern Turkey whom he previously relied on for support in the first round. The 74-year-old opposition leader has dramatically hardened his rhetoric, doubling down on his promises to deport refugees from Turkey within a year of coming to power. When polled, those who voted for O\u011fan in the first round said they were more likely to back Erdo\u011fan. \u201cThis is the first time Turkey is experiencing a second-round vote in a presidential election. We have never done this before, so we don\u2019t know if the majority of voters will be more interested given that there are now two candidates. This is why it\u2019s not easy to say what we\u2019ll be witnessing. There may be surprises; K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu may win, but I agree his chances are not high compared to Erdo\u011fan,\u201d said Evren Balta, a political scientist at \u00d6zye\u011fin University. Many opposition supporters said they were determined to vote despite their candidate heading into the runoff in second place, searching for millions of votes in addition to the support he gained in the first round but with few obvious constituencies in which to find them. When asked what was driving him to vote despite the opposition\u2019s path to victory appearing uncertain, 24-year-old Emre G\u00f6ral replied with one word and a cautious smile: \u201cHope.\u201d Erdo\u011fan has focused on assuring voters by raising the minimum wage, providing free natural gas for the month of May and promoting growth in the country\u2019s defence industry under his rule. While the opposition has long posited that Turkey\u2019s deep financial crisis, including rising inflation and a high cost of living, would pry voters away from Erdo\u011fan, many instead said they felt he was the only one capable of solving such problems. Voters in the town of Kahramanmara\u015f, close to the epicentres of twin earthquakes that killed more than 60,000 people in Turkey and Syria in February, said Erdo\u011fan was a leader who has shown he is capable of solving problems, unlike his rival. \u201cK\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu can\u2019t handle a crisis,\u201d said 34-year-old Shukran Tutem as she arranged T-shirts on a market stall. \u201cIf we compare K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and Erdo\u011fan, it\u2019s easy to see that K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu wouldn\u2019t bring anything good for this country\u2019s future, but Erdo\u011fan could.\u201d During campaigning, misinformation was frequently deployed by both sides, including Erdo\u011fan\u2019s use of a deepfake video showing banned Kurdish militants declaring their support for K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. After a first round in which the opposition initially claimed victory before accepting Erdo\u011fan was in the lead, many opposition supporters have remained mistrustful of the result, despite the Republican People\u2019s party stating that although it challenged counts in about 2,269 ballot boxes, this would not have changed the overall outcome. Balta said: \u201cI think this has played out in an intense way in the Turkish election because the extent of polarisation in this country is so high. These two sides are so polarised that whatever their leader, group or supporters say, they have a tendency to believe it.\u201d In an interview with CNN after the first round, Erdo\u011fan said he was confident of victory: \u201cThe people will be the kingmaker, and when the people decide, I believe they will stand with those who successfully served the Turkish nation for the past 21 years. In the end, my people will choose stability and competence and they will cast their votes accordingly.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-04T21:00:03Z",
            "content": "Voting has closed in local elections which marked Rishi Sunak\u2019s debut as an electoral figurehead for the Conservatives, as well as for the full rollout of new rules obliging people to show photo identification at the polling booth. The ID regulations saw reports of dozens of people being turned away for lacking the necessary documents, but did not result in the chaos or potential disorder feared by some electoral officials. More information about how many voters were put off should come in an interim study by the Electoral Commission next month, although opposition parties have warned the total numbers disfranchised may never be known. The election results themselves will be closely scrutinised for how they reflect on the leadership of Sunak and Keir Starmer, although the limited geographic scope and a drawn-out counting process will make extrapolations difficult. The voting covered slightly more than 8,000 seats across 230 councils in England, including metropolitan, unitary and district authorities, plus four mayoral races. The seats were last contested in 2019, when Theresa May was weeks away from announcing her departure as prime minister, while Labour were struggling under Jeremy Corbyn, bringing big gains for the Liberal Democrats and Greens. The Tories lost 1,300 seats then, and are predicted to shed more on Thursday, although ministerial projections of losing a further 1,000 councillors are viewed as expectation management, with Sunak at pains to predict a \u201ctough night\u201d. A full picture is unlikely before Friday evening, given the number of councils delaying their counts. Some early signs for whether Starmer is seemingly able to open up a lead on the Tories in areas where Labour will need to take seats in a general election will come in the early hours of Friday in places like Plymouth, seen as one of the key bellwethers. Other closely watched Labour-Conservative battlegrounds will declare shortly afterwards, including Medway and Stoke-on-Trent. Results later on Friday will show the results of concerted Liberal Democrat campaigning in Conservative-held \u201cblue wall\u201d seats in areas such as Surrey and Oxfordshire, also seen as an important marker for the next election. Bad results for the Tories in commuter-belt areas represented in parliament by big-name MPs \u2013 including Dominic Raab, Michael Gove and John Redwood \u2013 could put Sunak under pressure from his backbenchers. Similarly, the loss of Wealden council could see the Tories without a single Sussex local authority. The Greens, who are also anticipating gains on top of their good results from 2019, could even win majority control of a council for the first time, in Mid Suffolk. While there will be inevitable premature declarations of joy or woe for various parties, many Labour and Conservative MPs will hold fire in advance of academic extrapolations of what the results would mean as a national vote share. A Labour voting share lead of 10 or more percentage points \u2013 and projections this would translate into a healthy general election majority for Starmer \u2013 would calm some party wobbles and provide him with a welcome boost. Conversely, failure to achieve this would create pressure for a more coherent case for what a Starmer government would seek to achieve. While many Conservative MPs are grimly accepting of a general election loss, some hope Sunak\u2019s steadying of the government ship after the mayhem of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss is creating a way back for their party, a narrative that could gain traction if Tory losses are in the low hundreds."

            "date": "2023-05-30T15:54:29Z",
            "content": "Alberta\u2019s United Conservatives have scraped a majority government, narrowly defeating the rival New Democrats in what proved to be the province\u2019s closest ever election. The triumph for incumbent premier Danielle Smith foreshadows more friction between the western province and Canada\u2019s federal government on environmental regulation, with Smith using her victory speech to attack the climate policies of the prime minister, Justin Trudeau. The United Conservative party won 49 of the province\u2019s 87 electoral districts in Monday\u2019s vote, a figure that includes one candidate whom Smith has barred from joining the party\u2019s caucus because of offensive remarks she made, comparing transgender students to feces. The New Democratic party, under leader Rachel Notley, won the remaining 38 seats. Even though the NDP picked up more than a dozen seats, it fell short by razor-thin margins in the key battlegrounds. Pollsters had predicted a tight race, but economist Blake Shaffer found voting results showed Notley\u2019s NDP needed only 2,611 votes across six electoral districts to form a government. More than 1 million registered voters did not vote in the election, Shaffer said. Taking the stage late on Monday, Smith told supporters she would fight Trudeau\u2019s climate policies, arguing they would be harmful to the province\u2019s largest industry and warning tens of thousands of jobs were at stake. Trudeau\u2019s government has pledged to cut carbon emissions by as much as 45% by 2030, a goal it is not yet on track to meet. To meet this goal, experts agree the oil industry would need to make steep cuts to its emissions. \u201cThis is not a road we can afford to go down. If [Trudeau] persists, he will be hurting Canadians from coast to coast and he will strain the patience and goodwill of Albertans in an unprecedented fashion,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHopefully the prime minister and his caucus are watching tonight \u2026 As premier, I cannot under any circumstances allow these contemplated federal policies to be inflicted upon Albertans. I simply can\u2019t and I won\u2019t.\u201d Smith has previously used the federal government as a useful political foe in the oil-rich province, where many residents are wary of aggressive climate goals. She and Trudeau have feuded over who is responsible for carbon capture and storage projects, as well as what a \u201cjust transition\u201d from fossil fuels to renewable energy might look like. Earlier this year, Smith\u2019s government passed a controversial \u201csovereignty act\u201d which allows the province to refuse to enforce federal laws it believes to be unconstitutional. Smith has previously warned it could be used on federal legislation that Alberta views as a potential threat to the province\u2019s oil and gas industry. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working together to deliver results for Albertans \u2013 let\u2019s create more good jobs, grow our economy, and continue to position Alberta as a leader in clean energy,\u201d Trudeau tweeted on Monday night, congratulating Smith for her win. The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, who endorsed Smith in the final days of the campaign, called it a \u201cresounding win\u201d and said Smith would help the province \u201cunleash the full potential of Alberta\u2019s economy\u201d. With such a narrow victory, Smith is likely to face internal challenges within her party. Her margin of victory was slim for a province where conservative premiers typically dominate general elections. Smith must also contend with a history of party mutiny: no conservative premier has been able to serve a full term in office since 2004. Instead, they fall victim to fierce infighting between factions of libertarians, populists and fiscal conservatives. Notley, who served as premier from 2015 until 2019, fell short in her goal of recapturing the province\u2019s leadership. Despite the loss, she vowed to lead her party into the next election. \u201cIt is my honour to serve as your leader,\u201d she said in her concession speech. \u201cAnd it is my privilege to continue to serve as leader of the official opposition.\u201d Notley, whose tenure as centrist leader has become enmeshed in the party\u2019s identity, will oversee the largest official opposition in Alberta\u2019s history, a feat of political manoeuvring that has seen her grow the NDP from an also-ran party into a contender to threaten the conservative lock on the province."

            "date": "2023-05-14T14:22:20Z",
            "content": "Pakistan\u2019s former prime minister Imran Khan has escalated his criticism of the country\u2019s powerful military, accusing the head of the army of harbouring a \u201cpersonal grudge\u201d against him and ordering his arrest and a crackdown on his party. \u201cIt is personal. It\u2019s got nothing to do with national interest,\u201d Khan told the Guardian in an interview at his home in Lahore, after a dramatic week in which he was arrested at Islamabad\u2019s high court by almost 100 paramilitary officers on Tuesday and held in police custody, in connection with a land corruption case. \u201cWithout any doubt, the military is behind my arrest,\u201d he said. \u201cPakistan is now being run by the army chief. The crackdown on us is by the army chief.\u201d Arrests of political rivals are nothing new in Pakistan \u2013 when Khan was prime minister, several senior opposition leaders were jailed, some for more than a year \u2013 but such anti-military rhetoric is unprecedented in Pakistan\u2019s politics, where the army has long been seen as the country\u2019s kingmaker and exerts enormous power. Khan was released from police custody on Friday evening, after supreme court judges ruled that his arrest was \u201cillegal and invalid\u201d and the high court granted him bail. Known for his populist politics and firebrand speeches, Khan, 70, fell out spectacularly with his former military allies after he accused them of orchestrating his removal from power in April last year. He has since accused them of two attempts on his life. Khan alleged his arrest, and that of seven senior members of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, was symptomatic of the unrivalled power wielded by the military. \u201cThe military is above law; the ISI [military intelligence agency] is above law,\u201d said Khan. \u201cAnd if you have anyone above the law, then you descend into the law of the jungle. They can pick up people, detain people, disappear people. They try and influence judges; they clamp down on the media. There\u2019s no accountability for the institution. It\u2019s not democratic.\u201d The military has taken control of Pakistan in three separate coups since independence and have maintained an iron grip on politics during civilian governments. Former politicians who have attempted to go up against the military using less stringent language have found themselves toppled, arrested, exiled or assassinated. The relationship between Khan and the current army chief, Gen Asim Munir, is regarded to be acrimonious after Khan sacked Munir from a top military intelligence post in 2019 when he was prime minister. Khan alleged that Munir and other senior military figures had a \u201cvested interest to ensure that I don\u2019t come back to power\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re petrified. They know that we will sweep the elections, so they\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to put me in jail,\u201d said Khan. Khan\u2019s political career has been inextricably entwined with the military establishment. Having been in the political opposition for more than a decade as leader of the PTI, it was not until he began to get the military\u2019s backing that Khan was seen as a viable leader. He was elected prime minister in 2018 amid allegations the military had rigged the poll in his favour \u2013 a charge Khan denies. For the first two years of his government, Khan and the military worked closely together in a \u201chybrid regime\u201d, with the military holding powerful posts and seen as largely calling the shots. However, Khan grew resentful of the army\u2019s control, accusing them of blackmailing his government, while Khan\u2019s erratic policies, his scuppering of a deal with the International Monetary Fund and repeated criticism of the US frustrated the military. Khan was toppled in a vote of no confidence, which he accused the then chief of the armed forces, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, of orchestrating. The former prime minister has made a number of explosive but often unsubstantiated accusations since he was removed from power, including alleging that the US government colluded with the military to bring him down. The US government vehemently denied these allegations and a leaked audio recording showed Khan allegedly discussing how to \u201cplay with\u201d a diplomatic communication to make it look like the US had interfered. Speaking to the Guardian, Khan further accused then-army chief Bajwa of hiring Pakistan\u2019s former ambassador to Washington, Hussain Haqqani, to lobby against Khan in the US. In response, Haqqani told the Guardian he had sent a legal notice to Khan for defamation, asking him to retract his \u201clies\u201d. \u201cImran Khan does not feel the need to offer any evidence of allegations he makes,\u201d said Haqqani. Khan\u2019s deep-rooted relationship with the military has left critics sceptical of his anti-military position, alleging it is instead a means to weaken the army\u2019s leadership and gain greater control over the institution, especially if he returns to power. Khan denied this. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any backing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want them to be neutral; we just want free and fair elections.\u201d Khan claims to be facing more than 100 legal cases. Among the most high profile is the Toshakhana case, in which Khan is alleged to have sold lavish state gifts presented by the Saudi crown prince worth millions of dollars and concealed the profits. The election commission recently found him guilty, and referred the case to the high court. Khan is also accused of concealing illegal foreign funding for the PTI, which he denies. He alleged that all the cases were politically motivated by the coalition government, led by Shehbaz Sharif, who does not want to face him in the next election. He said that though he feared imminent arrest again, he believed there was \u201cnothing they can do to disqualify me from politics or dissolve my party, which has mass public support\u201d. Khan said he was waiting for the government to agree to dates for provincial elections and the general election, which he is pushing to bring forward from its due date of October. On Sunday, his party held a nationwide \u201cfreedom protest\u201d. If no elections are announced soon, he said, \u201cthen we will have to go into the streets to defend our constitution\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 May 2023. The state gifts in the Toshakhana case are worth millions of dollars, not billions as stated in an earlier version."

            "date": "2023-05-02T04:15:52Z",
            "content": "Fears remain that Sudan \u2013 riven by fighting between the Sudanese army and its paramilitary rival, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) \u2013 could plunge into a protracted crisis, prompting a humanitarian disaster with broad geopolitical implications. A string of failed or divided states already exist on Europe\u2019s peripheries, a crescent of instability that stretches from the African Sahel, Libya, through to Yemen, Syria, and north into Ukraine, three countries where extended wars have been raging. After the disaster of Iraq and the chaotic Joe Biden-led retreat from Afghanistan, the days of significant direct western interventions are over, although arms are being supplied in volume to.Ukraine. In Sudan, the US has been notably reluctant to deploy its military even to rescue an estimated 16,000 of its civilians. Washington\u2019s efforts have been largely diplomatic, although its principal security concern has been to avoid a repeat of the 2012 Benghazi disaster, where US diplomatic buildings were attacked and the ambassador killed, by rescuing its embassy staff from Khartoum last weekend. Elsewhere, France and Britain retreated from Mali last November, where they had been trying to stabilise the country and prevent the spread of Islamist extremism, complaining that the west African country\u2019s government had chosen instead to align itself with Russia\u2019s mercenary and natural resource-hungry Wagner Group. Many Sudanese people have already begun fleeing the fighting, with vast queues at border points with Egypt, an estimated 20,000 people entering Chad; while the UN\u2019s refugee agency, the UNCHR, reporting at least 40,000 fleeing the capital, Khartoum, the scene of the some of the fiercest fighting between government and paramilitary forces. \u201cSudan has a sizeable population of 45 million,\u201d said Ahmed Soliman, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, \u201cso the potential for people leaving in larger numbers if there is a protracted conflict has to be considered. Most of the migration will be internal and to neighbouring countries.\u201d Inevitably, however, people will also try to go further into Europe as happened in Syria and Ukraine. People have long fled the conflict in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region, where paramilitaries have been accused of waging a genocide against local people \u2013 but a new feature of the outbreak of fighting has been to bring conflict to Khartoum. In the UK, however, the policy response was already, in the government\u2019s proposed illegal migration bill, to criminalise people making small boats and other irregular crossings to the UK. Yet Home Office figures for the year to September 2022 already show that people from Sudan represented the 8th largest country for asylum claims to the UK \u2013 and that 84% of them were granted. This week, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said the UK had no plans to introduce any safe route for Sudanese people to enter the country, in contrast to Ukraine and Afghanistan, where Britain sought to extend some help to people fleeing as fighting broke out. \u201cThe government\u2019s plans seems to criminalise individuals,\u201d fleeing from Sudan said Maddy Crowther, an executive director of NGO Waging Peace. It is also unclear whether it will be possible for Britain to completely export any migration problems to continental Europe, when Germany and France already receive triple and double the asylum applications of the UK. It is a long time since Osama bin Laden was based in Sudan (he spent five formative years in the country before being expelled 1996). Islamism in the government has been mostly in retreat since the fall of dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 and the RSF paramilitaries have sought to portray themselves as anti-Islamist. Experts believe there is little immediate prospect of an extended crisis creating an opportunity for terror groups to strengthen, but a long conflict creates unwanted uncertainties. \u201cIf this conflict continues, then we risk a whole generation becoming traumatised. That can lead to radicalisation,\u201d said May Darwich, an associate professor at Birmingham University. A more likely negative scenario is a Yemen or Syria-style situation, where an initial conflict deteriorates into increasingly protracted fighting, and a range of international powers pick sides and seek to exploit the country\u2019s weakness. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said he had \u201cdeep concern\u201d about Russia\u2019s Wagner group becoming embroiled in the conflict. For now the situation remains ambiguous, amid reports that Wagner has offered the RSF rebels weapons, but Hemedti has turned the mercenaries down. Wagner, through a subsidiary, is already involved in goldmining in the county, the EU said in February as it levied sanctions on subsidiaries of the group. \u201cWhat you have seen in the past in the region, is that as the US has gradually disengaged that other actors have sought to enter the space,\u201d Darwich said."

            "date": "2023-05-19T05:07:32Z",
            "content": "G7 leaders have laid flowers at a memorial to the victims of the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima in a sombre opening to a summit overshadowed by fears of a potential nuclear conflict in Ukraine. As the heavy early morning rain began to ease, the summit\u2019s host, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko, welcomed leaders and their spouses at the entrance to the city\u2019s Peace Memorial Museum, where they viewed graphic reminders of the attack on the city on 6 August 1945 and its gruesome aftermath. The Japanese leader \u2013 whose wife wore a gold pin shaped like an origami crane, a symbol of the city\u2019s nuclear legacy \u2013 has said that achieving a world free of nuclear weapons is his \u201clife\u2019s work\u201d. Joe Biden became the second sitting US president to visit Hiroshima, after Barack Obama in 2016, while Rishi Sunak is the first British prime minister to visit the site of the world\u2019s first nuclear attack. An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people died instantly, but by the end of the year, the death toll had risen to 140,000 as more succumbed to burns and illnesses caused by exposure to radiation. Media were barred from the museum for the length of the visit \u2013 amid speculation over whether the leaders would visit only the building\u2019s east wing, which describes the dangers of nuclear war, or also pass through the main building, which contains photos of victims with horrific injuries. The group emerged from the museum after about 30 minutes and, led by Kishida and Biden, made the short walk to a cenotaph honouring the 333,907 people whose deaths have been attributed to the atomic bombing almost eight decades ago. Together, the leaders stepped forward to lay wreaths \u2013 given to them by local schoolchildren \u2013 on podiums in front of the memorial, with its eternal flame and plaque that reads: \u201cLet all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil.\u201d The burned-out shell of the A-bomb Dome, one of the few buildings to have survived the attack, could be seen in the distance. After a moment of silence, there was a group ceremony to plant a cherry blossom sapling, propagated from a tree that survived the atomic blast. The leaders later met a hibakusha survivor of the bombing. On a morning steeped in symbolism, this was the first time the leaders of G7 countries \u2013 including three that possess nuclear weapons \u2013 had visited the museum together. US officials said Biden, in a repeat of the approach taken by Obama, did not plan to issue an apology \u2013 a move that would go down badly in the US, where the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and, three days later, Nagasaki are seen as bringing the Pacific war to a quick end. But he and the other leaders viewed some of the museum\u2019s harrowing exhibits, which included burned and ripped clothes, the charred contents of a child\u2019s lunch box and strands of human hair from people who suffered exposure to radiation. Kishida, who represents a constituency in Hiroshima, said agreements on the need to realise a world without nuclear weapons were among his goals during the three-day summit, which is expected to be dominated by the war in Ukraine and China\u2019s growing military and economic might. \u201cWe will once again confirm our resolve to work for a world without nuclear weapons and we hope to transmit to the world our strong determination to protect the free and open international order based on the rule of law,\u201d Kishida told reporters as he left for Hiroshima. \u201cI hope that here in Hiroshima, the G7 and leaders from elsewhere will show their commitment to peace, which will be remembered in history.\u201d In keeping with Kishida\u2019s desire to place nuclear weapons high on the agenda, the summits final communique is expected to criticise Russia for threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Obama, who won the Nobel peace prize for his vision of a world without nuclear weapons, gave a speech at the peace park in 2016 and embraced a hibakusha survivor of the atomic bombing. But he spent only 10 minutes in the museum\u2019s lobby, where he was shown a small number of symbolic exhibits. Kishida has tried to move nuclear disarmament up the agenda for this year\u2019s summit and reportedly insisted G7 leaders visit not only peace memorials but also the museum. \u201cI believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,\u201d he said ahead of the visit to the peace museum. There is little enthusiasm for reducing nuclear stockpiles, however, at a time when Russia has issued thinly veiled threats to use them against Ukraine, and while North Korea is raising fears of a new nuclear test after a series of long-range missile launches."

            "date": "2023-05-02T13:06:43Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s government has revised its conscription laws, allowing retired service people to re-enlist and increasing recruitment focused on expertise in space and cyberwarfare. The amended regulations, approved by the state council and the central military commission, came into force on Monday, and covered all aspects of China\u2019s military recruitment and personnel deployment processes, for domestic emergencies and wartime. The changes aim to provide \u201cinstitutional guarantees for consolidating national defence and building strong armed forces\u201d, state media reported. China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone a major overhaul and modernisation under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who has accelerated Beijing\u2019s expansionist activities in the region and long-held ambitions to annex Taiwan. US intelligence has reportedly said Xi has instructed the PLA to be capable of a full-scale invasion by 2027, although that does not suggest intention is on the same timeline. About 35% of China\u2019s 2 million military personnel are conscripts serving for two years. The new amendments include specific wartime provisions, including measures to quickly boost troop numbers. \u201cAccording to needs, retired soldiers can be recruited mainly to be supplemented by former active service units or similar posts,\u201d said one new wartime regulation. Returning soldiers will be prioritised in recruitment, and expected to rejoin their original unit or something similar, in order to take advantage of their experience, it outlined. \u201cYou are bringing back a degree of experience, and you fill in positions and posts that will free up younger manpower for positions towards the front,\u201d said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in east Asia at King\u2019s College London. The amendments also enhance the PLA\u2019s focus on recruiting people with skills relevant to space and cyberwarfare, two areas in which Xi has pushed for greater Chinese dominance. Recruits from top universities will be prioritised \u201cto help the PLA to increase overall quality and build a professionalized force\u201d, the Global Times said. In January, the administrator of Nasa, Bill Nelson, said the US and China were in a \u201cspace race\u201d which was intensifying. US and Japan defence figures have also expressed concern over potential Chinese attacks from and in space. Last month the Centre for Strategic and International Studies released its annual space threat assessment, warning China was making progress towards its goal of becoming the world leader in space, and that the lines were \u201cblurred\u201d between commercial and government/military endeavours. China\u2019s cyberwarfare capabilities are also increasing. In 2021 the office of the US director of national intelligence said China presented \u201ca prolific and effective cyber-espionage threat, possesses substantial cyber-attack capabilities and presents a growing influence threat\u201d. The changes are the latest in a series of updates to Chinese military recruitment processes. In 2021 recruitment intake periods were doubled to occur twice a year. Previous changes have sought to improve conditions for recruits, refocus promotions to performance instead of time served, and complement military skills with strategic assessment skills. However, the success of reforms \u2013 including the quality and retention of recruits \u2013 won\u2019t be seen \u201cuntil a generation from now\u201d, according to one recent military analysis. Patalano said in recent years the private sector \u2013 backed by a booming economy \u2013 had provided more enticing job prospects for young people than the PLA. \u201cWhat this law suggests is that domestic economic conditions in China are changing and the military might be actively becoming a more appealing line of job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut against that, what you really have is the sense that Chinese authorities feel that the job of a military that would be able to afford the higher standards is not quite finished yet. These laws feel very much like accelerating a process of transition towards a professional military force.\u201d The amendments allowed space for further changes, saying authorities could make adjustments to recruitment and conscription \u201cwithin the scope of law\u201d during wartime. The changes were first announced last month, around the same time that the PLA was staging major military drills in retaliation to Taiwan\u2019s president meeting the US speaker of the House in Los Angeles. It also coincided with a naval base tour by Xi, where he called on the PLA to \u201cstrengthen military training oriented towards actual combat\u201d."

            "date": "2023-05-13T19:56:53Z",
            "content": "An online fundraiser for Daniel Penny, who placed fellow subway rider Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold in a case that has come to symbolize fears over crime, racism and vigilantism, has raised more than $1m for his legal defense. The fundraiser for Daniel Penny, a white former marine, who was charged on Friday with second-degree manslaughter in the death of Neely, who is Black, is on GiveSendGo. The Christian fundraising website has also hosted drives for rightwing vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse and far-right groups, including January 6 insurrectionists. \u201cFunds are being raised to pay Mr Penny\u2019s legal fees incurred from any criminal charges filed and any future civil lawsuits that may arise, as well as expenses related to his defense. All contributions are greatly appreciated,\u201d the fundraising page said. The campaign, which is listed as being created by Penny\u2019s attorneys, Raiser &amp; Kenniff, PC, claims that any proceeds exceeding the costs of his legal expenses will be donated to a \u201cmental health advocacy program in New York City\u201d. The firm\u2019s co-founder, Steven M Raiser, confirmed that his company started the campaign. Neely\u2019s killing nearly two weeks ago spurred extensive anger across New York City and the US, with his death underscoring ongoing racial and economic inequality, and the country\u2019s lagging mental healthcare and social services. Moreover, Neely\u2019s death has renewed attention on crime \u2013 despite low crime rates in New York City \u2013 and vigilantism. Penny has attracted the support of a broad swathe of the US right, including senior Republicans like rightwing Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who called Penny a \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d for his actions. The fatal encounter unfolded when Neely \u2013 who had struggled with homelessness and mental illness \u2013 walked onto a Manhattan subway train car shouting that he was tired, hungry and ready to die. A video recorded by a freelance journalist captured riders holding Neely against the floor. Penny kept Neely in a chokehold long after Neely stopped moving and at least one rider implored him to release the man. Police officials found Neely unconscious, and he was pronounced dead at hospital. The city\u2019s medical examiner deemed Neely\u2019s death a homicide. While police officers detained Penny and questioned him following the incident, they quickly released him, spurring public outcry and intense scrutiny over that decision. The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, announced on Thursday that Penny would be arraigned on a second-degree manslaughter charge and he surrendered to police on Friday. He appeared in court shortly thereafter and was released on $100,000 bail."

            "date": "2023-05-09T00:26:29Z",
            "content": "Surplus Treasurer Jim Chalmers has revealed the budget is set to show a $4bn surplus this financial year. Higher commodity prices, low unemployment and wage growth will pump more money into the coffers, leading to the projection. If achieved, it will be the first budget surplus in 15 years. While it has prompted many jests about that time the Coalition prematurely ordered \u201cback in black\u201d mugs, Chalmers is unlikely to be that cocky about it, considering it won\u2019t be long before Australia is back in deficit. Welfare This is one of the trickiest areas for the Australian government, with many people pressuring it to move on raising the base rate for all working aged welfare payments, given Labor\u2019s rhetoric while in opposition. So far, the government has confirmed it will scrap the ParentsNext program, ending compulsory mutual obligations for about 100,000 parents who were placed in the program. The program was costed at $484m over the forward estimates but won\u2019t be scrapped entirely until the existing contracts end in the next financial year. Single parents will remain on the single parenting payment until their youngest child turns 14, up from the previous cutoff, which was eight years old. That will mean an extra $176.90 a fortnight compared to the jobseeker payment. (But it is still short of the original cutoff, which was 16.) Albanese confirmed the change on Monday morning, saying it would cost $1.9bn over four years and will kick in on 20 September, assuming the legislation passes parliament. Mutual obligation requirements will stay in place. The government is also expected to lower the threshold for older long-term unemployed people to receive a slightly higher base rate of jobseeker, moving it from 60 to 55. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has emphasised that the cost of living relief will not all be limited by age and there will be \u201cadditional measures\u201d for renters, meaning more rent assistance is on the table or even the base rate of jobseeker itself might be raised also for under 55s. Cost of living We know the total cost of the cost of living package is $14.6bn over four years. This includes previously announced energy relief for households and small businesses, investments in energy efficiency and cheaper medicines. The energy rebates of up $500 will go to 5.5m eligible households on government payments, and 1m small businesses. How big a discount you receive on your power bill will depend on what state you live in. Coupled with that is the low-income and rental household electrification package the Greens won as part of negotiations with the government on its energy price cap legislation. The changes to dispensing rules at pharmacies mean people will be able to buy two months of certain medications for the price of a single prescription. That is expected to save about $1.2bn, which the government has said it will reinvest in community pharmacies (although pharmacies are very much against the move). Taxes On Sunday the government announced a plan to collect $2.4bn more in petroleum resource rent tax over four years by capping the proportion of PRRT assessable income that can be offset by deductions to 90%. The Albanese government has agreed to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development push for a minimum 15% tax rate and limit on debt-related deductions. In April 2022 these measures were estimated to raise $1.89bn over four years, estimates that will be updated in the budget. The health minister, Mark Butler, has said the tax on tobacco will rise by 5% a year over the next three years, raising an additional $3.3bn over four years. From 1 July 2025, the tax rate applied to future earnings of superannuation balances above $3m will be 30%. The measure will raise $900m over the next four years and $3.2bn over the next five years. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Health There is a lot of pressure on the government to commit to more health funding to fix systemic problems with hospitals and general practice, but it is uncertain whether this will be the budget that delivers all that is needed. The government has committed to a $2.2bn primary health care services package, which will be the start of the Medicare reforms promised by Mark Butler and Labor, as well as to take pressure off the hospital system. GPs will have access to a $220m grant program to expand community primary health care and local services. The government has also announced a $234m war chest to combat vaping, which includes $63m for an information campaign. Childcare The implementation of the cheaper childcare package, passed in November, will see total spending on subsidies of $55.3bn in the four years from 2023-24, up by $9bn since the Coalition\u2019s March 2022 budget. Despite recommendations from the women\u2019s economic equality taskforce and economic inclusion advisory committee, this budget is not expected to abolish the activity test for childcare subsidies. The budget contains $72.4m over five years for skills and training of early childhood and care workers. Aged care There will be $11.3bn to fund a 15% pay rise for aged care workers. This will meet the ruling of the Fair Work Commission, which ordered the whole pay rise be delivered at once, overruling the government\u2019s plan to split the 15% over two years. The government hopes the pay rise will attract many thousands of workers to the sector, in an effort to get closer to its promise to staff aged care homes with nurses on a 24/7 basis. NDIS The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, has promised a fresh crackdown on providers price-gouging products and services for people with a disability, sharing information about companies putting big markups on simple products like chairs and walking sticks. National cabinet last week agreed to a cap on the growth of the scheme, to 8% a year, to keep a handle on rising costs in an effort to keep the system \u201csustainable\u201d. The NDIS was the fastest-growing expense in the October budget, outside interest payments on the national debt. Defence The government has estimated the cost of implementing the recently released defence strategic review\u2019s recommendations will be about $19bn over the initial four-year budget period. This includes $9bn towards the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine project and $4.1bn for missiles and manufacturing. But the task of making this all add up isn\u2019t a short-term problem for the treasurer and finance minister. That is because Labor argues the $19bn initial cost is fully funded, through a combination of existing budget allocations and $7.8bn in savings within the defence portfolio (such as scaling back the infantry fighting vehicle plans). The decade ahead, however, will start to see defence costs really ramp up. Meanwhile, the government is earmarking nearly $500m to take majority ownership of a Canberra-based contractor that makes radar systems. Foreign affairs and aid The government has signalled that the budget is likely to earmark funds for engagement in Asia and the Pacific, although it is unclear whether that means more diplomats, more foreign aid or both. While most of the headlines out of the defence strategic review were about military hardware, the document also called for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to be given the resources it needs to \u201clead a whole-of-government statecraft effort in the Indo-Pacific\u201d. Energy transition Anthony Albanese has promised \u201cfurther measures\u201d on energy transition, which has come in the form of a \u201cnet zero authority\u201d which will cost $23m in the first year. Initially, it will set up an agency to start work by 1 July that will advise the government on the final design of a national net zero authority that will be legislated. Chalmers has said the energy transition will be \u201cfront and centre\u201d as \u201cthe most important part\u201d of investments to drive growth and tackle inflationary pressures \u2013 specifically, electricity prices. There will also be $400m from the Powering the Regions Fund to be administered by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Education and training In April, the Albanese government announced it is prepared to invest an additional $3.7bn for a five-year national skills agreement to be negotiated with states and territories, in addition to $400m to support another 300,000 Tafe and vocational education and training fee-free places. Housing The budget will contain \u201cnew tax breaks for investment in build-to-rent housing\u201d, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told Guardian Australia on Saturday. Referendum The government will commit nearly $1.5m to the Museum of Australian Democracy and Constitution Education Fund Australia to spread awareness of referendum processes before the Indigenous voice campaign, through a \u201cgrassroots civics program\u201d with \u201cneutral and easy-to-understand information\u201d."

            "date": "2023-05-26T01:42:56Z",
            "content": "Joe Biden and Republican lawmakers on Thursday appeared to be nearing a deal to cut spending and raise the debt ceiling, with little time to spare to avoid a potential default that could wreak havoc on the economy and global markets. The deal under consideration by negotiators would raise the government\u2019s $31.4tn debt ceiling for two years while capping spending on most items, a US official told Reuters. It would also increase funding for discretionary spending on military and veterans while essentially holding non-defense discretionary spending at current year levels, the official said. The agreement would specify the total amount the government could spend on discretionary programs including housing and education, according to a person familiar with the talks. The two sides, who met virtually on Thursday, are just $70bn apart on a total figure that would be well over $1tn, according to another source. Republican negotiators have backed off plans to increase military spending while cutting non-defense spending and instead backed a White House push to treat both budget items more equally. Conversations are set to continue into the night. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House speaker, told reporters Thursday evening the two sides have not reached a deal. \u201cWe knew this would not be easy,\u201d he said. The US House adjourned on Thursday for the Memorial Day holiday weekend, but lawmakers have been told to be ready to come back to vote if a deal is reached. Lawmakers left Washington for their home districts as advisers to McCarthy, and members of the Biden administration continued to haggle over the details. \u201cSpeaker McCarthy and I have had several productive conversations, and our staffs continue to meet \u2013 as we speak, as a matter of fact \u2013 and they\u2019re making progress,\u201d Biden said on Thursday at the White House. \u201cThere will be no default, and it\u2019s time for Congress to act now.\u201d Emphasizing that default was not an option, Biden said the negotiations have focused on creating the outlines of a budget that can win bipartisan support, as the president and McCarthy have clashed over their \u201ccompeting visions for America\u201d. \u201cSpeaker McCarthy and I have a very different view of who should bear the burden of additional efforts to get our fiscal house in order,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the whole burden should fall on the backs of middle-class and working-class Americans. My House Republican friends disagree.\u201d With just one week left before the potential default deadline of 1 June, negotiators plan to continue their efforts to reach an agreement over the holiday weekend. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday, McCarthy said the previous day\u2019s talks continued well past midnight, and negotiators were meeting around the clock until a deal is reached. \u201cI thought we made some progress,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThere\u2019s still some outstanding issues, and I\u2019ve directed our teams to work 24/7.\u201d Congressman Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, one of the chief Republican negotiators in the talks, said he did not expect a deal to be announced on Thursday. \u201cEverything\u2019s sensitive at this moment,\u201d McHenry told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s a balance that has to be struck, and there\u2019s a lot more work that has to be done. But the work that we\u2019re doing centers in on a shorter and shorter array of issues.\u201d Defense spending has emerged as a key point of tension in the talks, as congressional Republicans have pushed to exempt the Pentagon from potential budget cuts. Democrats have flatly rejected that proposal, insisting they will not allow non-defense priorities like education and healthcare to bear all of the proposed cuts. According to the Associated Press, Republicans have expressed openness to the idea of keeping defense spending at the levels proposed by the Biden administration while redirecting some of the funding previously allocated to the Internal Revenue Service. As negotiators edged closer to a deal, some hard-right lawmakers complicated matters for McCarthy by adding additional demands to their budgetary wishlist. Members of the House Freedom Caucus sent a letter to McCarthy on Thursday calling on him to add border security provisions to the debt ceiling bill while cutting funding to build a new headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They also demanded that the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, provide evidence to substantiate the threat of a default as early as 1 June. \u201cThe power of an undivided Republican party guided by conservative principles cannot be overstated,\u201d the Republican members wrote to McCarthy. \u201cAs you navigate the debt limit debate, you are the steward of this unity and will determine whether it continues to strengthen and places a historic stamp on this Congress or evaporates.\u201d The letter underscored that McCarthy will probably need some Democratic support to get a debt ceiling compromise through the House, but his colleagues on the other side of the aisle voiced sharp criticism of Republicans\u2019 proposed spending cuts and their decision to leave Washington without a deal. \u201cRepublicans have decided to skip town,\u201d the progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said in a floor speech on Thursday. \u201cThey are accusing Democrats, saying we spend too much. For anyone that wants to entertain that thought, I ask you to think about the last time a person has said in this country that the government does too much for them, that their social security check was too high, that teachers are paid too much. When was the last time anyone has heard or seen that?\u201d"

Some of what Mike Bowers has had his eye on today: Jonathan Barrett has taken a closer look at the books: Here\u2019s what the budget papers say about one of the \u201cfiscal risks\u201d facing the government \u2013 the implementation of the nuclear-powered submarine program: On 14 March 2023, the Australian government, alongside the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, announced the optimal pathway for the nuclear-powered submarine program for Australia under the Aukus trilateral security partnership. The cost of the nuclear-powered submarine program is expected to be approximately $9bn over the forward estimates and between $50bn and $58bn over the medium term [10 years]. Overall, the cost of the nuclear-powered submarine program is expected to amount to around 0.15% of annual GDP per year, averaged out to 2054\u201355. In the 2023\u201324 budget, the Australian government has agreed a number of measures to support the initial implementation of the nuclear-powered submarine program, which are detailed in budget paper no. 2. The total costs associated with the program will not be known until design and production processes are settled and commercial and other arrangements are finalised between governments and delivery partners.

The fabulous Rafqa Touma has you covered: More on the treasurer\u2019s interview with Sky News: Chalmers says the government has considered in the budget the need for greater infrastructure from the substantial uptick in migration. He cites the tax breaks for build to rent properties, as well as the housing future fund. However, he emphasises in the grand scheme of things Australia still hasn\u2019t recovered the ground lost during Covid when it comes to migration numbers. On whether the budget has done enough to keep investments in Australia, Chalmers says the government wants to make the most of the transformational opportunities that come with net zero. He cites the Hyrdrogen Headstart announced in this budget as part of how Australia will fit into global supply chains: We\u2019re watching what the Americans are doing and we\u2019re working out how we can be beneficiaries, not victims of that massive amount of investment that\u2019s going in the US. Chalmers also said the $1.9bn committed over five years for Australia\u2019s Pacific neighbours will be a \u201ccrucial investment\u201d to get the relationships back on an even keel. \u201cWe want our near neighbourhood to be peaceful and prosperous and stable and secure. And we\u2019ve got a role to play in that. The budget reflects that.\u201d The treasurer ended the interview again defending why the budget will not be inflationary: The key reason why this budget is carefully calibrated to address cost of living pressures rather than add to inflation is because we\u2019ve worked out where the cost of impressions are the most acute - out of pocket health costs, energy and rent - and we\u2019ve provided some responsible assistance in each of those areas to put downward pressure on prices. Just in case you haven\u2019t got through all the budget papers yet (the Guardian Australia office has a towering pile), Rafqa Touma has taken a peek in the corners: Community and Public Sector Union welcomes budget measures In the closing stages of the stakeholder press conferences in the press gallery, Melissa Donnelly, the national secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union, said it was a good budget for the public sector. She said the budget added 10,800 public sector jobs, which would make a difference to people who depended on public services. Donnelly said additional resourcing for the National Disability Insurance Agency would help shorten waiting lines, while important biosecurity measures would be rolled out in the agriculture portfolio. Veterans\u2019 affairs would also get a boost to better provide services to veterans. But Donnelly said Services Australia urgently needed a resourcing increase, too. Kelly O\u2019Shanassy, head of the Australian Conservation Foundation, stepped reporters through \u201cthe good, the bad and the timid\u201d of the budget. On the timid front, she said the government wasn\u2019t investing enough in tackling the extinction crisis. O\u2019Shanassy said the ACF wanted the government to invest $2bn a year for 30 years, which she said may sound like a lot but was \u201csix times less than the government has committed to nuclear submarines\u201d. Too much budget barely enough? Feeling the firehose? Guardian Australia has a bespoke option for you: Choose the federal budget topics you\u2019re interested in to create a feed of budget news tailored for you\u2026 More reactions to budget from business, seniors and GPs AiGroup chief executive, Innes Willox, called the budget \u201cfiscally prudent\u201d, but wasn\u2019t too stoked about it for business. He claimed the budget \u201cmissed the mark\u201d on boosting business and investment, saying there was \u201cnothing of note\u201d on productivity, innovation or job growth. Willox noted many measures to assist households but \u201cnot much for business at all\u201d, critical of cuts to business investment and grants programs. Andrew McKellar, chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the budget gave a \u201ccredible way forward\u201d. He claimed the government had benefited from \u201ca considerable slice of good luck\u201d but spoke of \u201ctangible progress on budget repair\u201d. Ian Henschke, of Seniors Australia, spruiked \u201clot of good news\u201d from the budget for older people, noting boosts to rent assistance, jobseeker and energy bills that would help seniors. Henschke welcomed savings from supporting people to stay at home not go into aged care, which was one of the biggest savings in the budget. Henschke called for the government to further boost a program that lets pensioners work more hours without losing their pension payments, saying the government would actually make money by expanding that program. Nicole Higgins, president of the college of GPs, called the budget\u2019s Medicare updates \u201ca game changer for GPs\u201d. She said the measures further valued general practice, making it a more attractive career for doctors, and that GPs would use the incentives to offer more bulk billed appointments. There was surprisingly little about defence spending in the treasurer\u2019s budget speech, but Daniel Hurst took a \u2026 deep dive? Upped periscope? Anyway, here are some more details on the defence spend: Budget is a \u2018change of direction\u2019 from neoliberalism: expert Dr John Falzon, of the Per Capita thinktank, said it \u201ctakes a long time to turn neoliberalism around\u201d: But tonight we have seen a change of direction - modest in its making but let us hope bold in its trajectory. Falzon welcomed measures such as consigning the punitive ParentsNext program \u201cto the dustbin of history\u201d: All of these measures signal a turning away from neoliberal vandalism. We must encourage the government to continue on this path. Falzon said the \u201cgaping hole\u201d in the budget was the inadequate increase in jobseeker rates, which permitted the persistence of poverty and put young people \u201cat risk of losing hope\u201d. He added: Tonight we have seen a very modest and very inadequate step in the direction of addressing this urgent, desperate need. Some more from those earlier interviews with treasurer Jim Chalmers. Chalmers said the $159m dedicated for politicians\u2019 electorate staff came after the dispute between Sally Rugg and Monique Ryan \u201cshone a light\u201d on the heavy workload of political offices. This is in recognition of the really quite extraordinary workload that the offices are under. We have seen well publicised court cases,. Asked if the budget measure was in response to the Sally Rugg dispute Chalmers said \u201cnot entirely, but that really shone a light.\u201d The travel industry has blasted the government for hiking fees for travellers in the budget, suggesting the $10 hike per passenger will zap $520m from the tourism sector. From 1 July, the passenger movement charge will increase from $60 to $70 per passenger leaving Australia. The charge applies to foreign tourists and locals alike, regardless of their plans to return to Australia. Dean Long, Australian Federation of Travel Agents\u2019 chief executive, said the decision to increase the fee is \u201cextremely disappointing and will make it harder for Australians families to stay connected\u201d. He issued a joint statement with the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Australian Accommodation Association condemning the hike, saying: In the three years prior to the pandemic, the PMC collected on average $811m more than needed to fund the biosecurity requirements to keep the community and agriculture sector pest free. The government is now demanding an additional $200m for next year which is unwarranted and not appropriate especially in the current environment. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, told reporters the budget was \u201ca betrayal of renters, jobseekers and people doing it tough\u201d: Labor\u2019s budget leaves millions behind with people stuck in poverty while billionaires get tax cuts. (That\u2019s a reference to the stage-three tax cuts remaining in the budget.) Bandt said rent assistance wasn\u2019t rising as fast as rents were rising. He warned the government not to take the Greens\u2019 support for granted when the parliament considered the bill to amend the petroleum resource rent tax (which the Greens say is inadequate). As Bandt delivered one of his key lines \u2013 \u201ca surplus doesn\u2019t help you pay the rent\u201d \u2013 the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, happened to be walking past the press conference in the press gallery, racing from his ABC interview to his Sky News interview. The Greens\u2019 Treasury spokesperson, Nick McKim, added: You can\u2019t eat a surplus. Chalmers has brushed off the suggestion that he\u2019s missed an opportunity this budget to make bolder decisions on capital gains tax, trusts and the stage-three tax cuts, as economists Danielle Wood and Chris Richardson had urged. He said: We\u2019ve got a tax reform program in this budget which is a meaningful one. Multinationals, high superannuation balances. He says these will make a difference to the structural position of the budget: No government that I can remember has made such a big difference to the structural position of the budget than we did tonight. We banked that upward revenue surge. We had tax reform and we found $18bn of savings. You know how much savings were in Josh Frydenberg\u2019s last budget? Zero. $40bn over two budgets, remarkable spending restraint, meaningful tax reform has improved the structural position of the budget and it let us forecast the first surplus in 15 years.\u201d Want graphs? Greg Jericho has brought you the budget numbers in all their visual glory: Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been speaking with Sky News. We\u2019ve heard a lot of criticism from the Greens on the surplus not going to helping Australians in the cost-of-living crisis. Chalmers said the surplus eventually will mean the government can help those doing it tough: That\u2019s been a good thing, not as an end in itself. And not even just because we avoid a lot of debt and a lot of debt interest payments, but also because if we can get the budget in a much more sustainable position, then we\u2019ve got the room then to do the things that we want to do for people, especially people doing it tough, but also to invest in more and better opportunities for more people, and invest in the future of the economy. Michelle O\u2019Neil, the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, has welcomed boosts to wages as really important. She said the government was acting on its mandate to \u201cget wages moving\u201d, and also welcomed the cost of living package. O\u2019Neil said there had been a historic investment in Medicare and bulk-billing, and noting the energy bill relief, said there were many parts of the budget that were \u201cessential\u201d for working people. Patricia Sparrow, chief of older persons\u2019 advocacy network the Council on the Ageing, welcomed the rent assistance and jobseeker rises \u2013 especially for older Australians on those payments. She also backed the Medicare reform, including increasing incentives for bulk billing, saying many older people had reported they couldn\u2019t afford to go to the doctor. Steve Robson, president of the Australian Medical Association, was surprised but pleased at the bulk-billing changes \u2013 saying the AMA had only been calling for a doubling of the incentive, not the tripling they received. He said this \u201chad to be a healthcare budget\u201d, and that he was glad the government had listened. Robson said it would make it much easier for GPs to offer bulk-billing; he described the budget as having a number of \u201cgreat strong first steps\u201d, but said there was \u201ca long journey\u201d with \u201cplenty to do\u201d. Bailey Riley, president of the National Union of Students, said young people would be left extremely disappointed by the budget. She noted the rise to jobseeker and youth allowance, plus rnt assistance, but said it was \u201ccrumbs\u201d. Riley said young people on the payments were still \u201cliving far below the poverty line\u201d, and were \u201cbeing left to fend for themselves\u201d. Kylie Walker, chief executive officer of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, said the budget had a \u201cwelcome investment in infrastructure\u201d, especially around clean energy \u2013 but that there was a \u201cdisappointing drop\u201d in government research and development in clean energy tech. She said for Australia to become a green energy leader, there needed to be more R&amp;D funding, and warned of workforce shortages in that sector. Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst are bringing you despatches from the \u201cboxes\u201d \u2013 for those who are not unadulterated politico-nerds, the boxes used to be sort of post boxes for the press gallery, where you\u2019d get alerts and so on. Now it\u2019s where all the spokespeople and stakeholders gather to give their verdict on the budget. Chalmers tells the ABC\u2019s David Speers the $40 a fortnight raise to jobseeker is \u201clargely\u201d owing to the fact this is all the government can afford: We think we\u2019ve struck the right balance between what we can afford and taking into consideration the economic pressures in the economy. The budget stills suggests there will be further increases in electricity prices of more than 10% in the coming year. However, Chalmers is defending the government\u2019s intervention which he says otherwise would have been 36%. Some early reactions from Greens leader, Adam Bandt. Fair to say he\u2019s not a fan: Back to 7.30 again, and Chalmers says the eligibility for energy bill relief will be largely people who are on pensions and payments, people who are already eligible for state programs and people of family payments. However, he emphasises eligibility will differ depending on which state you are in because of the different deals with each governments: More than 5 million people will get money off their winter electricity bill. Chalmers says he will make sure the relief is provided on the bill level \u2013 working with retailers. Read more here: Tonight\u2019s budget has mixed reviews from the higher education sector. Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson said it \u201cstrikes a balance between cost-of-living relief and fiscal repair\u201d, welcoming modest increases to welfare payments for students struggling with financial pressures. Yet she noted research funding remains at its lowest level as a share of gross domestic product on record and now sits at 0.49% of GDP as Australia continues to slide down the international order: We welcome funding for new university places and additional clinical placements to support the education of the highly skilled workers our economy and communities can\u2019t function without. This is a good start, but greater support for universities would make the task of building a better economic future for all Australians easier because we are a good return on investment, and we drive the productivity the economy so desperately needs. The Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia (ITECA) says it wasn\u2019t surprising Chalmers has taken a \u201ccautious approach\u201d to higher education spending, with the Universities Accord review into the sector not being handed down until the end of the year. But chief executive officer, Troy Williams, says more could have been done to support students, noting the commitments to $127.3m for 4,000 additional commencing commonwealth supported places across sector are for courses that support the skilling requirements of the Aukus nuclear submarine program. Meanwhile, the National Union of Students has described it as a \u201cslap in the face\u201d for the 3 million struggling with student debt, noting it made no move to abolish indexation or raise the minimum repayment threshold: Students won\u2019t just stand by while Labor screws over ordinary people. We\u2019re going to fight this budget for the rich on the streets across Australia. The line of stakeholder groups responding to the budget one by one has begun in the press gallery hallway. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Service, is one of the first up. She says the budget includes some welcome measures, including support for single parents, increases to aged care wages and extra support for bulk-billing. Goldie also praises the support to retrofitting homes with energy upgrades such as solar panels, saying at present wealthier homeowners are the ones who have been able to afford such energy upgrades. But there is a big \u201chowever\u201d. Goldie says the jobseeker increase isn\u2019t enough, and the payment will keep people in poverty and is among the lowest in the OECD: Tonight we will still have over 1 million people who will not know if they can feed themselves three times a day. Goldie vows to continue to campaign for an adequate increase to keep people out of poverty. Asked whether she is concerned the increase in tonight\u2019s budget will be the last one, Goldie says she is not, because the adequacy of jobseeker remains a \u201clive\u201d issue within government ranks: I think within the government there are many people who want to see change and do want to see an adequate increase to jobseeker. Chalmers is continuing to defend the extra spending: Some that is unavoidable legacy spending left to us by our predecessors. Unfunded ongoing programs. Some of it is the cost-of-living package, but energy bill relief which will put downward pressure on the inflation forecast because it makes people\u2019s bills lower than they otherwise would be. The combination of our gas and coal caps with our energy bill relief is expected to take three-quarters of a per cent off the inflation forecast. Chalmers hails the government\u2019s \u201chistoric restraint\u201d for the surplus: This is an historic turnaround in the budget which wouldn\u2019t be possible were it not be for the historic restraint that we\u2019ve shown in banking 82% of the upward revision in revenue... We wouldn\u2019t be within cooee of a forecast surplus if it was not for the responsible economic management that we have shown. Back to 7.30 \u2013 Jim Chalmers has denied the budget is making the central bank\u2019s job harder: We\u2019re making the job of the independent Reserve Bank easier by taking seriously this inflation challenge. Big investments in the supply side of the economy, responsible economic management, banking 82% of the upward revision to revenue and also making sure the cost-of-living package is delivered over time and in the most responsible way. The reason why there is spending 2023-24, is because there are a whole bunch of ongoing programs that we had to fund and Covid liabilities as well. The structure of our small business package and a little bit of the cost-of-living package is in 2023-24. Warning: Depressingly, but unsurprisingly, there are already scams doing the rounds: Budget changes are \u2018modest but meaningful\u2019, Chalmers says Just wrapping up that earlier press conference: Paul Karp asked Chalmers how they decided that $40 a fortnight for jobseeker and bumping the over 55s into a higher band was the best approach. Chalmers said: We\u2019re trying to work out a way to provide cost-of-living relief \u2026 in a way that doesn\u2019t blow the budget. I think we\u2019ve struck a good balance here. Gallagher added that women over the age of 55 are now particularly vulnerable (to homelessness, poverty, and so on). Next, the treasurer was reminded that he had said he would have some tough conversations about the budget, and asked if he has avoided that. He said: It felt like a pretty serious conversation when I was changing the tax breaks on superannuation. It felt like a pretty serious conversation changing the arrangements for the PRRT. He described the changes as \u201cmodest but meaningful\u201d. Another question: will he have to take a bigger revenue agenda to the next election? I\u2019m here to hand out a budget with my mate here, not to announce an election policy. We\u2019ve made quite remarkable progress [but] we\u2019ll need to take difficult decisions in the future as well. On that 15% increase to rent assistance, Chalmers said he understands that people will be calling for more. He was also asked about the flow-on effect, whether it will just see landlords pushing up rents. \u201cWe have low vacancy rates and high rents for a whole bunch of reasons that don\u2019t include rent assistance,\u201d he said, adding that increased supply is the answer. Treasurer Jim Chalmers is up now on ABC\u2019s 7.30 with David Speers. We\u2019ll bring you the highlights as they happen. Those pesky stage-three tax cuts came up for the first time in the lockup presser. Treasurer Jim Chalmers was asked why they are \u201cVoldemort\u201d \u2013 that is, verboten to be talked about. He says that\u2019s not the case but that they\u2019re \u201can old decision, legislated some time ago\u201d (which will not stop them being discussed any time in the near future). They\u2019ll cost about $69bn over the forward estimates, he said: The way we\u2019ve approached this in the budget is entirely consistent with standard budget practice. They were legislated some time ago. They wouldn\u2019t ordinarily be itemised. Asked if it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d that the government will then have to borrow more to pay for the cuts, Chalmers said the deficits would now be smaller than previously expected: Our job is to try to get the budget on the most sustainable footing that we can. We\u2019re making really good progress but nobody here \u2026 pretends it\u2019s mission accomplished. I mentioned the women\u2019s budget statement earlier. Finance minister Katy Gallagher, who is also the minister for women, said many of the same issues have been brought up in the statement since the 80s, but that she \u201chas no doubt that the investments in this budget will change the lives of thousands of Australian women\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to go back and find a budget that tries to do more,\u201d she said. Just back to the speech for a sec, Natasha May captured this little moment: Another strong theme is how sensible they were to \u201cbank\u201d most of the extra revenue they pulled in through the rise in commodity prices, combining budget repair with budget restraint. They wouldn\u2019t have come \u201cwithin a cooee\u201d of a surplus if they hadn\u2019t, treasurer Jim Chalmers said. Chalmers has talked quite a bit about the balance between helping the vulnerable while not being inflationary \u2026 but there\u2019s another fine line he\u2019s treading. There were a few questions in that press conference about what\u2019s in the budget for middle Australia. His line is that there\u2019s a lot for them there, if you look at all the policies together such as cheaper childcare, more bulk-billing, cheaper medicines, and so on: I don\u2019t agree with the sense that there are swathes of middle Australia missing out here. There\u2019s a lot in there for middle Australia. Budget required \u2018a series of finer balances to be struck\u2019 So, while we were all cut off from the world, our phones cruelly detained and our internet cut off, we trundled in to a press conference with treasurer Jim Chalmers and finance minister, Katy Gallagher. Yes, there were PowerPoints. Yes, many of the points from his speech were repeated. But it\u2019s also the first change the members of the press gallery get to, well, press. Chalmers started off saying people should think about the budget in five parts: cost of living; medicare and the care economy; inclusion and equality; the growth from industrial opportunities, energy, tech; responsible economic management. He said while their October budget \u201cmade a good start\u201d, this budget was \u201ca much harder task with a more complicated combination of challenges that has required a series of finer balances to be struck\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s still burdened by persistent structural pressures as well,\u201d he said. And Lenore Taylor has cast a steely eye over the budget, and the help within, which is \u201cspread widely and a bit thin\u201d: Paul Karp has pulled together all the highlights of today\u2019s budget: Jim Chalmers has announced a $5.7bn investment in Medicare and an increase in jobseeker and commonwealth rent assistance for all ages as the centrepieces of Labor\u2019s first full-year budget aimed at helping Australians \u201cunder the pump\u201d. As the treasurer heads to the ABC studios, I\u2019ll bring you some of the highlights from the Guardian Australia team. Elias Visontay has put together this neat summary of the winners and the not-so-winners: And he\u2019s done, lots of standing applause from the very friendly crowd. Now the grilling will begin. Questions will be asked, and sometimes ducked and sometimes answered. I\u2019ll bring you some highlights from the press conference that Chalmers held alongside finance minister Katy Gallagher while we were in lockup. We\u2019re also keeping an eye on him as he does the rounds of the ABC and other stations \u2013 first stop is the traditional 7.30 quizzing. And we\u2019ll keep digesting, interpreting and translating this 2023-24 budget for you. Treasurer Jim Chalmers is wrapping up his speech now with some soaring rhetoric: 122 years ago today, the federal parliament first met \u2026 called to serve a new nation on an ancient continent, created by a vote of the people. Today Australia is bigger, fairer, more diverse, more open to the world and more engaged with our region than anyone alive at federation could possibly have imagined. And yet what brought this country together was a belief that the future could belong to Australia and that we would be stronger, safer, and more prosperous if we worked to seize its opportunities and share its rewards. A commonwealth of common purpose. That optimism and resilience has sustained us \u2013 and carried us \u2013 through downturns and disaster, through recession and pandemic. And the belief in opportunity fairly shared has underpinned our greatest achievements \u2013 from Medicare to superannuation. The same spirit underpins constitutional recognition through a voice, it drives our government, and it shapes this budget. A determination to tackle the big challenges \u2013 and seize the big chances. A deep faith in our people, their skills, their smarts, their innovation and aspiration. A plan for security, for prosperity, for growth. An economic strategy to help with cost-of-living pressures now \u2013 And to maximise and extend the opportunities of the future to more of our people in more parts of our country. In the defining, decisive decade ahead. For all these reasons, I commend this bill \u2013 and this budget \u2013 to the house. The search for the \u2018savings\u2019 Part of the fun of the budget is ferreting out the \u201csavings\u201d (sometimes more accurately described as \u201ccuts\u201d). We already know about some \u2013 there\u2019s the tightening on superannuation tax concessions for those with balances of more than $3m, a 15% minimum tax for big multinationals, the toughening up of the petroleum resource rent tax, and an increase on cigarette tax. The team is now going through to find the sorts of \u201csavings\u201d that don\u2019t necessarily make it into the treasurer\u2019s speech or the media releases. Stay tuned. Chalmers says: [The] inescapable truth is that the federal government cannot put all the services that Australians expect and deserve on a more sustainable footing by ourselves. That\u2019s why the prime minister has brought together the states and territories to agree on a new, cooperative approach so, we can secure the future of essential services and programs that both levels of government support, and so we can make sure that the NDIS continues to provide life-changing outcomes for future generations of Australians with disability. Under Labor, the NDIS is here to stay. We are determined to make sure every dollar counts and every dollar goes to improving the lives of the participants the scheme was established for. Our changes are designed to put the interests of participants first, as we cooperate to moderate growth in costs. Now the treasurer is on fiscal strategy He says 82% of extra revenue windfall from \u201clower unemployment, stronger jobs and wages growth, and higher prices for key exports\u201d has been returned to the budget (rather than being spent), he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve also found $17.8bn in savings and redirected spending \u2026 and limited annual real spending growth to just 0.6% over 5 years,\u201d he says. Combined with their last budget, he says, they are now \u201cforecasting a small surplus\u201d (about $4bn) which would be \u201cthe first in 15 years\u201d. But don\u2019t get carried away. There\u2019ll be a $13.9bn deficit next year, although he says overall the deficits will be lower than previously thought, with a $125.9bn improvement over five years. Gross debt to GDP is now expected to peak at 36.5% of GDP in 2025-26, saving billions in interest on that enormous national debt. Chalmers says: We\u2019re expecting one of the biggest turnarounds on record while dealing with a whole host of programs and services that were left without ongoing funding. There\u2019s $1.9bn for First Nations health, housing, employment, and education, and a $250m for a package for central Australia. There\u2019s a bit here that will take a bit more digging, such as $200m for \u201cfunding place-based partnerships\u201d, better coordination for government and philanthropy, etc. More to come, as they say. Chalmers says: Alongside financial support for Australians in need, we\u2019re also investing in new programs to tackle entrenched disadvantage. Putting our trust in the knowledge and passion of locals to break the chains of intergenerational poverty. I see it in my own community: library programs unlocking the world of learning, sporting clubs building pride, community groups mentoring young people into apprenticeships. Breakthroughs and progress, driven by locals and leaders. The budget\u2019s women\u2019s statement The crowd erupts when Chalmers says: We\u2019re the first government in Australia\u2019s history with a majority of women in our ranks. There is a women\u2019s budget statement \u2013 it\u2019s a funny old thing that waxes and wanes and sometimes feels like a treasury boffin just made a salad with every policy that has to do with workforce participation and families. Chalmers says \u201cwe know equality for women is not an add-on, not a nice-to-have \u2013 it\u2019s crucial for our prosperity\u201d. He lists some previous policies, and says there is also a \u201cnew focus on workers in the care economy\u201d including cheaper early childhood education and better paid parental leave. There\u2019s $72.4m to retain and recruit more early childhood educators, $590m for the plan to end violence against women and children, and the abolition of the ParentsNet program in favour of a voluntary system to support mothers prepare for work. Aukus will deliver 20,000 high-skilled jobs: Chalmers While we\u2019re throwing billions about willy nilly, on to the Aukus agreement. Chalmers didn\u2019t actually mention the eye-watering cost could creep up to $368bn by the mid-2050s, but he had some other numbers. The program will provide 20,000 high skilled jobs, he says. The budget also has $3.7bn for skills agreements with the states and territories, and 300,000 fee-free TAFE spots. There will also be more government-supported uni places \u2013 we\u2019ll bring you more details on that in a bit. While we\u2019re on defence and foreign affairs, $1.9bn will go towards strengthening Australia\u2019s relationships in the Pacific, and there\u2019s $64.1m to get rid of the veterans\u2019 claims backlog. On small business, Chalmers says they\u2019ll increase the $20,000 instant asset write off, and help small businesses invest in power-saving assets and to adapt to digital technology. Boost for renewables tech, AI and creative sector Chalmers says there\u2019ll be \u201ctargeted investments in green industries, as well as in technology and other value-adding areas\u201d, including a new Powering Australia Industry Growth Centre to help Australian businesses manufacture renewable technologies, funding to support the growth of quantum computing and AI, and $286m of investment in our creative sector. Now we\u2019re on to \u2018making Australia a renewable energy superpower\u2019 The budget has $2bn for a \u201cHydrogen Headstart\u201d program \u201cso Australia can be a world leader in producing and exporting hydrogen power \u2013 while reducing our emissions in heavy industry here at home\u201d. Chalmers says: Hydrogen power means Wollongong, Gladstone and Whyalla can make and export everything from renewable energy to green steel. Seizing these kinds of industrial and economic opportunities will be the biggest driver and determinant of our future prosperity. Then there\u2019s $4bn to \u201crealise our future as a renewable energy superpower\u201d, a range of new funds, on top of the safeguard mechanism to \u201cencourage business to invest in the path to net zero\u201d. Biggest ever boost to bulk billing, Chalmers says GPs will be able to bulk bill about 11.6 million Australians thanks to a $3.5bn boost, tripling the bulk billing incentive. Chalmers says it\u2019s the biggest increase ever: [Right] now, too many people are finding it more and more difficult to see a doctor. The costs are too high, the wait times are too long, and the consultation is too short. Families are being forced into a lose-lose choice between getting the help they need or paying their bills. This robs parents of peace of mind; it puts families under strain. It means more problems go undiagnosed or untreated. And it means our workforce is not as healthy or productive as it could be \u2013 and should be. There\u2019ll be funding for urgent care clinics, better cooperation between doctors and other health practitioners, more scope for pharmacists to deliver vaccinations. Chalmers says: All of this will help take pressure off our public hospitals and emergency departments, still feeling the strain of a once-in-a-century pandemic. And it will ensure that for millions of people, the quality of your healthcare is guaranteed not by your credit card \u2013 but by your Medicare card. Chalmers is also talking about the government\u2019s social housing bill, which it is trying to shepherd through the parliament. You can read all about it here: The government has already announced an expansion to the single parent payment so people are eligible until the youngest child turns 14, instead of 8; giving them an extra $176.90 a fortnight \u2013 this overwhelmingly affects single mothers. And, Chalmers says, rent assistance will go up by 15%, meaning $31 a fortnight. There\u2019ll also be a new tax break for \u201cbuild-to-rent\u201d projects to help boost the existing plan to build 1m new houses over five years. And Chalmers is now talking about the boost for aged care wages: The prime minister has said it many times \u2013 the heroes of the pandemic deserve more than our thanks; they deserve fair pay for their vital work. I am proud our budget provides $11.3bn to fund a 15% increase in award wages, for more than 250,000 aged care workers. This pay rise will help retain, reward and recruit the hard-working people who care for our loved ones as they grow old. And the message from our government to the aged care workers of Australia is simple: you deserve every cent. All people, not just over-55s, to get welfare boost Chalmers is now announcing the $40 a fortnight jobseeker increase. At a cost of $4.9bn, it will also help those on youth allowance, Austudy and other payments. There was somewhat of a brouhaha over a leak suggesting those over 55 would get a boost, while younger people would miss out. That\u2019s not quite the case, but there is an extra perk for those aged 55 to 59 \u2013 if they\u2019ve been unemployed for more than nine months they\u2019ll get an extra $92.10 a fortnight to bring them into line with those aged 60 and older. Chalmers says: Until now, people aged 60 and over and on payments for a long time have received a higher rate, in recognition of the additional barriers they face finding work. But the truth is, it gets more difficult earlier than that. The majority of people aged 55 and over on JobSeeker are women, many with little to no savings or superannuation, and who are at risk of homelessness. So tonight, we\u2019re extending the extra support for those aged 60 and over to include Australians aged 55 and over \u2013 more help for some of the most vulnerable in our community. And now on to the cost-of-living package, the centrepiece of this budget. That $14.6bn package over four years has to do a lot of work; bringing down power costs, health costs, and housing costs, while boosting wages. Chalmers says there will be up to $3bn to help households and small businesses with power bills \u2013 more than 5m households will get up to $500 off next financial year. There\u2019s that $1bn to help \u201cprovide low-cost loans for double-glazing, solar panels and other improvements that will make homes easier \u2013 and cheaper \u2013 to keep cool in summer and warm in winter\u201d. In health, $2.2bn will help people access cheaper medicines, in many cases getting two months\u2019 worth for the price of one. The Treasurer chooses to foreground health, disadvantage, and clean energy: [The budget] delivers historic investments in Medicare and the care economy, making it easier and cheaper for Australians to see their doctor. It broadens opportunity by breaking down the barriers of disadvantage and exclusion. It lays the foundations for growth by embracing clean energy and investing in value-adding industries, people, skills, technology and small business. And it strengthens the budget, with a surplus forecast for this year with less debt and smaller deficits compared with recent budgets. His opening remarks are met by \u201chear hears\u201d from his Labor colleagues. Chalmers says budget is \u2018carefully calibrated to alleviate inflationary pressures\u2019 Chalmers is outlining the (by now familiar) economic headwinds \u2013 soaring inflation is at the top of the list. Australia\u2019s economic growth will drop from 3.25% this year to 1.5% next year. Although unemployment will remain historically low, it will rise from 4.25% next year to 4.5% the year after. He says the budget is \u201ccarefully calibrated to alleviate inflationary pressures, not add to them\u201d and will knock .75% off inflation next year, while wages growth will go up .25% to 4%. The treasurer says: This combination of lower than expected inflation and higher wages, means that an earlier and stronger return to real wages growth is forecast for 2023\u201324. The papers have been tabled, the embargo lifted, and treasurer Jim Chalmers has just started his budget speech in the house. As always, while there is much ado about the lock up and the need to keep everything secret until this specific moment, we did already know quite a bit. We knew about the $14.6bn cost of living package, the slender $4bn surplus, the extension of the single parenting payment until the youngest child turns. There has been a lot of pressure on the government to \u201craise the rate\u201d of JobSeeker, and Chalmers has, by $40 a fortnight. You could call that a burger and a milkshake raise, depending on where you live. There\u2019ll also be a 15% lift to rent assistance. Other new nuggets include: A $3.5bn boost to bulk billing that will help GPs provide free consultations to around 11.6 million eligible Australians. $2bn for a new hydrogen power program, so Australia can be a \u201cworld leader in producing and exporting hydrogen power\u201d. $1bn in \u201clow-cost loans for double-glazing, solar panels and other improvements that will make homes easier \u2013 and cheaper \u2013 to keep cool in summer and warm in winter\u201d, on top of direct energy bill relief of up to $500 for eligible households and up to $650 for small businesses. The Guardian Australia team will shortly let you know how that will work, and who will benefit. Chalmers says the government has sought to \u201cstrike a considered, methodical balance\u201d: Between spending restraint to keep the pressure off inflation, while doing what we can to help people struggling to make ends meet. Making sure vital services like Medicare and the National Disability Insurance Scheme are secure, reliable and sustainable. And dealing with immediate, near-term challenges, while investing in our long-term national success [and] seeing our people through the hard times, and setting our country up for a better future. In Canberra, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Daniel Hurst and Greg Jericho are fossicking through the papers for gold while Mike Bowers is out looking for gems of picture opportunities. In Sydney, editor Lenore Taylor is presiding over the crack team comprising Anne Davies, Adam Morton, Elias Visontay, Jonathan Barrett, Rafqa Touma and Peter Hannam. And of course all our behind-the-scenes gurus, who often save us from humiliating misadventures, are there. Read Paul Karp\u2019s full report here: The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has stepped up to speak in Canberra unveiling the Albanese government\u2019s first full-year budget. We do already know some of the budget measures which the government has previously announced. My colleagues in Canberra have summarised those here, if you need a refresher: We\u2019re so close now. So close. It\u2019s T-minus 10 minutes until the Treasurer emerges. Meanwhile the Greens continue to criticise the Albanese government for its surplus while so many are struggling at the moment. Dorinda Cox is taking a slightly more subtle approach than her colleague Penny Allman-Payne. (Allman-Payne\u2019s tweet for those who missed it earlier:) Scammers are attempting to take advantage of budget night with false offers of cash handouts from the government. Guardian Australia has seen the text message which pretends to be from MyGov and says: Eligible individuals can receive a one-time payment of $750 to help with their living expenses. It\u2019s less than an hour to go until the treasurer unveils the budget and my colleagues are let out of the lock up, and can share all the juicy budget details with you. If you\u2019re still slightly mystified by what exactly goes on in the budget lock up, Amy Remeikis takes you behind the scenes in this video: Although there\u2019s speculation there could be movement on commonwealth rent assistance in the budget, Bandt says \u201cat the moment, the government does not seem to understand how serious the housing and rental crisis is.\u201d Asked whether his party\u2019s negotiations with the government on the housing Australia future fund are ongoing or completely stalled, Bandt has accused Labor of \u201cplaying politics instead of seriously negotiating.\u201d The Prime Minister even said he is OK about the building voted down and he will go to the next election campaigning on it. That does not sound like a government that is serious about negotiating to improve its housing bill so that real money starts to flow now for housing, not after the next election. You\u2019ve seen the Greens in the parliament prepared to work with the government in good faith and negotiate on legislation and find a place to meet in the middle. At the moment, the Government is more interested in playing politics and they should not put this bill to a vote before those discussions have concluded. \u2018We are in a crisis and a surplus does not help you pay the rent\u2019: Adam Bandt The Greens leader does not believe the treasurer should be congratulated on the budget surplus. Instead, Bandt says the $4bn surplus should be redirected to helping Australians through the cost of living crisis: Under Labor, people are sleeping in their cars and tents but the budget is in surplus. One in six children in this country are in poverty but Labor is crowing about delivering a surplus. Every dollar of a surplus is a dollar less to lifting people out of poverty. We are in a crisis and a surplus does not help you pay the rent. A surplus does not put food on people\u2019s table. A dollar that goes to surplus is a dollar that should be spent lifting people out of poverty and deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Bandt says welfare payments won\u2019t drive inflation \u2013 \u2018massive profits\u2019 will Greens leader Adam Bandt is continuing to call on the government to use tonight\u2019s budget to lift the most vulnerable Australians out of poverty. He told Afternoon Briefing earlier that it\u2019s not welfare measures that are adding to inflation: Giving people who are doing it tough a bit of extra money so that you can put a banana in your kid\u2019s lunchbox is not what is driving inflation. If the government really wants to take inflation, tackle rising power bills. Tackle rising rent. Look at the massive profits the banks and these big corporations are making off the back of people\u2019s pain. What decisions would you make? It looks like David Pocock has been enjoying our interactive which allows everyone a chance to step into Jim Chalmers\u2019 shoes. If you\u2019re looking for a way to pass the hour and a half we still have to go before the budget is unveiled, be sure to have a go yourself: Aboriginal Legal Service: \u2018Locking up children causes ongoing harm for them and their families, and the whole community.\u2019 Karly Warner, CEO of the Aboriginal Legal Service (NSW/ACT), said in a statement locking up children in jails is harmful, does not work and disproportionately impacts Indigenous children. We have abundant evidence that locking up children causes ongoing harm for them and their families, and the whole community ... Let\u2019s be clear: by failing to raise the age to 14 urgently and without exception, the ACT government is failing Aboriginal children. The ACT imprisons Aboriginal children at 12 times the rate of non-Indigenous children. It\u2019s Aboriginal kids and families who will be most harmed by the government\u2019s refusal to fully accept the evidence. In a release yesterday, the ACT government said the tiered stages to raising the age will mean they can add further reforms and support for young people. The two-stage approach will allow the government to implement the reforms in relation to children aged 10-11 initially, allowing the alternative service system to be rolled out for all young people, before applying these reforms for 12 to 13-year-olds. The territory has tabled a bill today to lift the age from 10 to 12, before finally increasing the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 14 in July 2025. Currently children can be locked up from the age of 10, with the exception of the NT, which recently increased the age to 12. But Aboriginal legal groups and human rights organisations have expressed dismay at the staggered approach in increasing the age, saying experts agree that vulnerable children will still be caught up in the justice system. What will independent senator David Pocock be looking for in the budget? He\u2019s told Afternoon Briefing he will be particularly interested in whether the government prioritises cost-of-living relief. He is particularly concerned for the flow-on effects for young people in areas like mental health, with many unable to afford treatment. Pocock also says he\u2019ll be looking out for what\u2019s in the budget for small businesses. He says despite the news of the one-off surplus, he\u2019ll also be interested in how the government is addressing the long-term structural deficit. Cheating services complaints more than tripled in a year The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TESQA) annual compliance report, released on Monday, confirmed it received 432 concerns about commercial cheating services in 2022, a \u201csignificant increase\u201d on the 137 reported in 2021. TESQA said the jump reflected \u201cincreased engagement from the higher education sector on the threat posed by these services\u201d, commonly known as contract cheating. In addition to blocking 150 cheating websites last year, it also began two investigations to gather evidence for civil proceedings against two entities suspected of providing academic cheating services. These investigations are supported by detailed evidence collected by providers as part of their own investigations into academic integrity matters. This work will continue into 2023. TESQA also received an \u201cunprecedented\u201d number of notifications relating to cyber-security incidents, including serious data breaches leading to unauthorised disclosures of personal information and ransomware attacks, pinned to the \u201chighly valuable repositories\u201d of research and intellectual property in the higher education sector. University regulator received complaints about almost half of all registered higher education providers last year The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TESQA) annual compliance report, released on Monday, reported 305 concerns about registered higher education providers across 88 institutions, a jump on 289 reported in 2021. The most common complaints related to the delivery and teaching of courses, student services and student learning environments. Seven were related to sexual assault and harassment. Its review into academic integrity found a \u201cfailure to take adequate action\u201d when misconduct was identified, poor documentation and \u201copaque practices\u201d for adjusting marks, particularly from fail to pass grades, as well as a lack of systemic recording of academic integrity breaches. It also confirmed it had engaged with 22 universities over alleged underpayments of casual staff following TESQA\u2019s first concern about wage underpayments in the sector raised to the Fair Work Ombudsman in 2022. Most universities have now undertaken, or are undertaking, comprehensive reviews of their payroll practices, improving processes and implementing contemporaneous record-keeping systems. As a result of complaints, 13 conditions were imposed across seven providers last year, and 14 conditions were imposed on course accreditation. \u2018Budget will deliver for those most in need\u2019 Meanwhile, with just a little over two hours till showtime, the government is spruiking the budget, saying it will deliver for Australians most in need. Penny Allman-Payne: \u2018Every dollar of budget surplus is a dollar not spent on lifting people out of poverty.\u2019 Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne isn\u2019t on the same page as the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, who just said the surplus was a \u201cgood story for the country\u201d. Allman-Payne says the surplus money should be spent on lifting Australians out of poverty and she\u2019s made her thoughts about the surplus pretty clear in this tweet \u2026 Hume on what \u2018set this government up for the future\u2019 Circling back to Hume a moment, who is defending that premature 2019 decision to order the \u201cBack in Black\u201d mugs. It was there. I mean, it was there for all to see in the Myefo [mid-year economic and fiscal outlook] papers of 2019. And thank heavens it was because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have been able to tackle Covid the way we did, come out the other side with that growing economy, and very, very low unemployment. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s set this government up for the future. Hume says the problem is that the Albanese government is not capitalising on the winning position the Coalition has left them in, instead reverting to Labor\u2019s \u201cnatural instinct to tax and to spend\u201d. No one works harder in budget week than the treasurer\u2019s staff who do everything they can to eke out every single bit of good coverage for the budget they can possibly manage ahead of the budget embargo lifting, when journalists have access to all the information and they can no longer control the narrative. Like this embargoed release of information from the treasurer\u2019s office which was timed for 5pm when the first of the news bulletins goes to air. What\u2019s in it? Nothing much in terms of actual detail. The cost of living package which will become clear in just over two hours from now will contain assistance for renters, increases to jobseeker, Austudy and youth allowance and more eligibility for the single parenting payment, but we can\u2019t tell you how much or who. Inflation will be forecast to be lower than it was in the October budget, but again, no detail on what the forecast is. The only actual tidbit \u2013 gross debt is predicted to peak five years earlier and less than it was forecast in October because \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 of Jim Chalmers\u2019 plan to put money away rather than spend it. The budget will show because of the government\u2019s commitment to return most revenue upgrades to the budget, gross debt is projected to be almost $300 billion lower by the end of the medium term (2033-34), saving $83 billion in interest costs over that period. This scant level of detail is intentional \u2013 it means good headlines on the nightly news ahead of the budget\u2019s release which is after they go to air. We will have all the ACTUAL detail for you when the embargo lifts, including what is missing. Inflation the \u2018great thief in the night\u2019, Hume says Hume says the Coalition fears the expenditure side of the budget could be hijacked by \u201cthe great thief in the night\u201d \u2013 inflation. What we are afraid of now is that the expenditure side of the budget is not under control. What we want to see \u2013 the real test for Jim Chalmers \u2013 is not delivering a one-off surplus, but as a sustained surplus into the future. Because that is the way that you can grow the economy and also rein in inflation which is the great thief in the night right now \u2013 eroding people savings, eroding their purchasing power and reducing the standard of living. That needs to be the number one priority of this government bringing inflation back under control. Jane Hume: Coalition paved way for budget benefits The shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, is brushing off any suggestion the Coalition is jealous of the Albanese government\u2019s surplus. She\u2019s told Afternoon Briefing the government is benefiting from the legacy of the previous Morrison government: Let\u2019s face it, we have had soaring commodity prices, we have increasing inflation and it is creating bracket creep so the take from income tax has been so much higher than anticipated. And largely that is because of the very low unemployment that was the legacy of the last Coalition government that this government has been able to take advantage of. So we would expect to see a surplus from that soaring windfall revenue. Gallagher\u2019s three budget hopes Gallagher says she hopes Australians take three things from the budget: I hope people see they have a government that cares deeply about how we look after people who need an extra hand, how we invest in opportunities of the future and that we manage their money through the budget in the best interest of the country. If they are able to see that through all of these decisions \u2013 even though there will be bits people like and don\u2019t like and think we should have done more of, and think we should have done less of \u2013 those three things for me are really important and I hope that is reflected in people\u2019s views on the budget after they had the opportunity to read it. Asked how she would pre-empt any criticism from the opposition on unwinding the measures they fought for, Gallagher says: There is no world where you just say \u2018we continue doing everything and we load in new spending on top of that.\u2019 That is unsustainable. Taylor\u2019s comment \u2018reflects poorly on him\u2019, Gallagher says Gallagher has hit back at the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor\u2019s quip that a drover\u2019s dog could have delivered a budget surplus, saying the comment \u201creflects poorly on him\u201d considering his government did not deliver one out of nine. How does Gallagher think Australians will receive the news of the budget surplus when so many are feeling the cost-of-living crunch? I would hope that people see that the news of the budget being in better shape is welcome because I think that is good. We need to make sure we are a good spot when the next emergency comes at the budget is able to respond to it. Earlier the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told us the government isn\u2019t ordering any Back in Black mugs. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, also isn\u2019t getting ahead of herself despite the big news overnight of a predicted budget surplus. She\u2019s told ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a matter of celebrating,\u201d saying the government has its eye on the \u201clong term\u201d. The upward revisions to revenue and the improved bottom line is good. But it is a good story for the country because a budget is about investing in the future of our country and supporting people who are doing it tough. I think they expect their government to manage their budget responsibly and that is what we have sought at the outset to do with the budget where we can make sensible investments, we do that and also have our eye on the long-term. That it is about getting the budget on a better footing so we can create the opportunities and invest in people for the future. Good afternoon! Thanks to Amy for covering off such a big day in Canberra. Natasha May will take you through the next little bit and Tory Shepherd will guide you through the budget reaction on the blog. All the Guardian coverage will go live about 7.30 and will continue into the night and over the next few days. I\u2019ll be back very early tomorrow morning on the blog to report on all the fallout so looking forward to catching you then. Until then \u2013 take care of you x A moment of quiet Things in the parliament have quietened down as everyone starts to prepare for 7.30 when the treasurer takes to the floor to deliver the budget speech. There is no debate on the speech \u2013 it is delivered, there is a standing ovation from the government and the invited people in the public gallery. The treasurer\u2019s family is usually given a spot to watch from the sidelines and there are photos and congratulations and then Jim Chalmers will run to the ABC studios for his interview on 7.30. And ahead of all of us outside the budget lock-up learning what\u2019s in it for the fixed working age payments: Linda Burney used the last question in question time to welcome this decision: Paul Fletcher and Barnaby Joyce want to know why ministers haven\u2019t answered questions within the 60-day time frame. Milton Dick will get right on that. 28 questions and counting \u2026 \u201cAfter 28 questions I ask that further questions be placed on the notice paper,\u201d Anthony Albanese says. Not sure counting the questions when most of the questions don\u2019t count is the best practice, but here we are. Milton Dick reads the house the riot act about the budget proceedings, and inviting guests and to keep everyone in line for the 7.30 treasurer speech. Oh good Dolly, this is still going. PM: Bringing in right migrants for right jobs doesn\u2019t mean \u2018big Australia\u2019 There is now a question from Dan Tehan and it is 20 to four and what did we do to deserve this today? We already have to deal with the budget, do we also have to deal with this? With Australians facing record net overseas migration of 715,000 over the next two years, why is there no plan to address the further pressure this will put on cost of living with increase rents a worsening housing crisis, longer hospital wait times and increased congestion in capital cities? How much will Australians pay for Labor\u2019s biggest Australia policy? SIIIIGGGGHHHHHH (screams, sobs rocks under the desk) Siggggggghhhhh Anthony Albanese says \u201cthat was worth waiting for\u201d. I mean, was it? Albanese says that there was a spike because of the pandemic \u2013 people went out but they didn\u2019t come in, and now that the restrictions are lifted people have returned and that the plan announced by Clare O\u2019Neil is about bringing in the right migrants for the right jobs and that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cbig Australia\u201d. Labor asked about mortgage costs The Liberal MP for Hughes, Jenny Ware, asks a question about increased mortgage costs and Anthony Albanese and Julie Collins both respond speaking about the housing future fund. That fund is about building more social and affordable housing and doesn\u2019t address interest rates, but this isn\u2019t exactly answer time (nor are the questions asked wanting actual answers). Housing minister: \u2018Vulnerable Australians are relying on this bill\u2019 The housing minister, Julie Collins, uses a dixer to talk about the housing future fund bill which is being debated in the Senate and doesn\u2019t yet have the support it needs to pass the chamber: I say to the members opposite and to the Greens party. Talk to your senators. Tell your senators to support this bill. The time the political grandstanding and further games is over. There are vulnerable Australians out there today who are relying on this bill to get passed so we can get more social and affordable homes on the ground for those Australians that need it most. Chris Bowen took this question: Labor asks \u2018WHHHYYYYY\u2019 The Nationals MP for Cowper, Pat Conaghan, asks about his constituent Robert who has seen his electricity bill increase, even though his usage has decreased. So where is the promised $275 cut to power bills (the original commitment was for 2025 but anyway) and \u2018why do people always pay more under Labor\u2019. Anthony Albanese answers by asking why Conaghan and the Liberals voted against the $1.5bn power bill relief package and the entire Labor caucus have been prepped for this, because they all shout \u201cWHY?\u201d He asks a bunch more why questions, including why the Coalition didn\u2019t support: The change in the single parent payment The safeguard mechanism The housing future fund The manufacturing fund Increasing the minimum wage Cheaper medicines Fee-free tafe places And after each question the Labor MPs yell \u201cWHHHYYYYY\u201d until Allegra Spender rises to ask about conduct of the house. I don\u2019t see that this as orderly conduct for the parliament. The house settles and Albanese finishes with: Those opposite are so focused on themselves when they look at each other, they just ask themselves why indeed. Labor on how they fund infrastructure projects Catherine King is defending how the Labor government will fund infrastructure projects, saying \u201cwe want to make sure if we promised a project, we actually deliver the project. That is what our regions deserve. It\u2019s what our rural communities deserve. Our cities deserve.\u201d But first she has to get through interjections from the opposition and takes the opportunity to give Sussan Ley a serve. Ley\u2019s role as deputy leader is also to be the attacker-in-chief, particularly since Peter Dutton decided he needed to soften his image. So Dutton has taken a step back (you may have seen the new glasses and the attempts to be less hardman and more thoughtful man) and Ley has stepped up. Burke asked about wage increase for childcare workers Allegra Spender has the next crossbench question and it is for Tony Burke: One of your arguments for last year\u2019s IR reform was the need to increase wages for childcare workers. Six months later, no multi-employer bargains have been completed. Childcare workers don\u2019t have commitments to increase wages and some childcare centres in Wentworth like one I saw last week are only offering half the places are because of staff shortages. Minister, wouldn\u2019t have it been better to fix the awards and make a difference to families and workers now? Burke: I\u2019ll go through a couple of different issues that are raised. First of all, in terms of the award review which was something that the member for Wentworth fought for during the debate and was ultimately negotiated with the Senate as well as Senator Pocock. There will be there\u2019s further discussions that are happening now about the nature of that award review. So the review of the awards in particular in the context of the new objectives which are in the act, and those objectives go to both secure employment and to gender equality, which obviously is particularly significant for the rates of pay for people who are working as early childhood educators. In terms of multi employer bargaining, the different parts of the act commits on different dates. The multi employer provisions haven\u2019t started yet. So the reason why no multi employer agreements have been concluded for early childhood education is those sections of the act don\u2019t commence until June. What we have seen though is exactly what I predicted in the sense that immediately we have seen a whole lot of employers come back to the table on individual enterprise agreements with their workforce, workplace by workplace and that will result and our preference is always if you can get into if you can get individual workplaces, negotiating and having those agreements in place. That\u2019s always the best option, but the problem has been in a whole lot of feminized sectors. That hasn\u2019t worked. That\u2019s why we needed to open up the rules for multi employer bargaining. They commencing June. So right now we\u2019re in a phase where we\u2019re seeing a really serious acceleration in the number of negotiations that are happening for enterprise agreements. And I expect the moment that the laws start to open up in June, that\u2019s when we will logically see an increase in the engagement with multi employer bargaining. The ABC has moved away from the question time broadcast and onto normal news which is not particularly helpful when you are running a live blog, but we persist. PM asked about government\u2019s reliance on big consulting Zoe Daniel, the independent MP for Goldstein, has the next question from the crossbench: The government has been told consulting firms are tailoring advice to get more money instead of giving frank and fearless advice for the nation. What is your plan to address the inner conflicts of interest between government and big consulting to shut down this obscene use of billions in taxpayers money and enable public servants to be frank and fearless? Anthony Albanese: One of the things that we have done as a government is to reduce what we regarded as an over-reliance on consultants. We have made sure and you will see in tonight\u2019s budget, that contrast which is there and making sure that we have put on additional public servants to deal with the challenges that we have with the backlog in visas of 1 million people. To make sure that we deal with issues in government services, which of course were dropping off the shelf, if we had not have extended funding for services beyond the 30 June they were due to end. We make sure, as is reflected tonight as well that indicated to the public service by every single one of my ministers going not just talking to the secretary apartments but the whole departments. Encouraging ideas to come up, that frank and fearless advice, to come to government so as we go forward we maximise the respect and capacity of the public service. I do that personally as well, on any occasion when I visit the UK. We had a meeting with the high commissioner for all of the staff at the high commission, the staff who work in defence, who work in home affairs. The staff who work in immigration. The staff who work in trade. The staff who work in foreign affairs and a medic advice as well. It is to me, common \u2026 that if you treat people with respect you will get better outcomes. We also have the same approach towards their income and treating them with respect when it comes to proper negotiations between the government and public service through their union to make sure that that respect is shown as well. The former government did receive some advice about the issue that has come to light when it comes to the Tax Practitioners Board and indeed the measures that whether from a review into the tax practitioners board. It was given to the government of the day in 2019. Like so much else, nothing happened. My government is committed to implementing the recommendations of that review. UK free trade agreement will have deflationary effect on economy, PM says The UK free trade agreement will come into effect from 31 May. Anthony Albanese spoke a little more on that in a dixer: It also will make it easier for Australians to work in the UK. Raising the working holiday visa age from 30 to 35 and increasing the maximum stay to three years instead of two. It will eliminate tariffs on imports from the UK, this will reduce cost to households and businesses. It will of course therefore have a deflationary impact on our economy. Also Scott Morrison still hasn\u2019t announced his resignation. Mike Bowers delayed heading into lock up to capture Mary Doyle being sworn into the parliament: Plibersek responds to Littleproud\u2019s question on land-clearing The current leader of the National party, David Littleproud, breaks from the theme of the day to ask about land-clearing: How many hectares of remnant vegetation will be cleared for the \u2026 renewable projects which have received or are awaiting your ministerial approval? Which is lol-worthy because the Nationals want more coalmines opened and more coal fired power stations built (and also nuclear) and do they think that those projects float above the land with no land clearing? Tanya Plibersek takes the question and talks about renewable energy which upsets Littleproud, who just wants a number, but because he mentioned renewable energy, under the standing orders Plibersek can talk about the 101 renewable energy projects she has on her desk for every second of her three minutes (and she does). \u2018Just say, \u201cI wasn\u2019t here, it wasn\u2019t my fault, it all went wrong\u201d\u2019: PM\u2019s advice to LNP\u2019s Zoe McKenzie The LNP MP for Flinders, Zoe McKenzie, has the next non-government question, and it is the same as the others (you may be noticing a bit of a theme to today\u2019s questions from the opposition): A family with a $750,000 mortgage is now paying $1,723 more every month compared to May 2022 because this government hasn\u2019t taken any action to reduce inflation. Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor? Anthony Albanese: When it comes to pressure on inflation, one of the things that a government can do is to make sure that when it hands down a budget, it\u2019s fiscally responsible. And tonight, you will see the government that I am proud to lead and its response and compare it with what the Coalition. To be fair [to] the member for Flinders, she wasn\u2019t here to see, quite frankly, the debacle that occurred towards the end of their long office of the Morrison as well as Abbott and Turnbull governments, where we saw the law of diminishing returns, to use an economic term for the benefit of the deputy leader [Sussan Ley]. We saw that in place, absolutely. But of course, today, the cash rate is 3.85%. When this bloke [Peter Dutton] was assistant treasurer, it was 6.75%. What is larger? 6.75 or 3.85? You don\u2019t need an economics degree to work that out. What my government is doing on inflation is making sure, unlike those opposite, who of course poured fuel on the inflation fire in last year\u2019s budget, after inflation, I remind the member for Flinders that inflation[\u2019s] highest jump this century was in the last quarter of March 2022. \u2026 I will give the member for Flinders some unsolicited advice. Just say, \u201cI wasn\u2019t here, it wasn\u2019t my fault, it all went wrong.\u201d Because since then, it has gotten better. Because this government, when we had revenue bonuses come in last year, we saved, we saved 99%. We put it towards the bottom line. Those opposite, under the government of the law of diminishing returns, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, they saved 40%, which, to be fair, was more than the Howard government ever did, more than the Howard government ever did, and you will see tonight again what a responsible government looks like. PM highlights wage increase for care workers in response to cost-of-living question The LNP MP for Fisher, Andrew Wallace, asks Anthony Albanese: The cost of living crisis under this government is crippling Australian families. David from Meridan Plains in my electorate (Sunshine Coast) contacted me recently to say that he and his wife are trying to support their family of five by working five jobs between them. Working seven days a week. Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor? Albanese: I send my regards through him to David, his constituent. And his partner. And the many Australians who do work damn hard in this country \u2026 One of the things that you can do, of course, to improve people\u2019s situation is to get wages moving again. It\u2019s one of the things that we have been determined to do. And that was recognised by the RBA governor when he said wages growth is stronger than it was a few years ago which is a welcome development. \u2026 During the pandemic we spoke about people who were the heroes of the pandemic, looking after our older, vulnerable Australians \u2026 one of the things that we said we would do is not just give them our thanks, but we said they deserved a wage rise to be better off. And when the member for Lilley was giving that response about the more than $11 billion that will be in tonight\u2019s budget for people in the aged care sector \u2026 When we talk about people who are doing it tough, I can\u2019t think of any group who are more deserving in our society and aged care workers. The cleaners, the carers, the orderlies, the nurses. But increasing wages makes a difference. \u2026 Mike Baird, former New South Wales premier \u2026 said this: We are incredibly appreciative the federal government has contributed to the increase awarded by the Fair Work Commission and delivered on it. It\u2019s truly welcome. He of course is the chief executive of HammondCare. Monique Ryan asks about climate change security risk report The independent MP for Kooyong, Dr Monique Ryan, has the first of the crossbench questions: During the last election campaign you identified climate change as the greatest threat to our national security. In May 2022, your government committed to an urgent climate risk assessment by the Office of National Intelligence to help us understand the security risk of climate change. You have now had that report since November. Why hasn\u2019t it been released and when will we see it? Chris Bowen: Thank you very much and we thank the honourable member for her question and of course this government has brought a heightened degree of transparency when it comes to climate change to this parliament and to the country. One of the most important things we have done is enshrine in law in the Climate Change Act \u2026 the climate change minister must report annually to parliament on progress against targets on all of the matters relating to climate change and policies. This is something we are proud of having done; I delivered the first climate change statement and we will deliver the second later this year. This is a very important addition to transparency, in relation to national security. We do say that climate change is a very real and significant issue in our national security. That\u2019s why the prime minister wanted me [on] the national security committee of the cabinet, for example \u2013 to make sure that that it is represented at our national security table. In relation to the national security statement, of course matters that are classified information to advise to the prime minister and national security committee are treated accordingly. We brought that level of transparency and I\u2019m happy to provide further updates from the house accordingly. It is Sussan Ley time! Core inflation in Australia is higher than in countries like the US, UK and Canada and Australians are hurting. Can the prime minister, using his economics degree, explain why his government\u2019s only answer has been to announce a series of budget measures to spend more and tax more? Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor? SIIIGGGGHHHH. Albanese: I do have an economics degree, I encourage [the deputy leader of the opposition] to remind people at every opportunity. In case she was wondering, it was from the University of Sydney, and I can bring it in here and perhaps you can table it and frame it and put it up in your office. He continues: Because indeed, I do use it each and every day. I use it to know that indeed, inflation had taken off well before Labor took office. Indeed the largest quarterly rise this century was guess when? Guess when? March 2022. The largest rise of inflation in any quarter of the century March 2022. That was on their watch, the last quarter they were in office. It was the starting point that my government inherited \u2013 2.1% jump in one-quarter! If you do a bit of maths, you don\u2019t need an economics degree, 2.1 over a quarter, times four, equals a pretty high inflation rate. A pretty high inflation rate. And that is what they were dealing with. That is what we have had to deal with. After the election it emerged that the Morrison government had ignored Treasury warnings and it used its final budget to unleash a desperate vote buying spending spree. They added fuel to the inflation fire. A former government source described it as ordering the entree, main and the dessert. It was all there, all the one-off payments, the cash payments were there. Not worrying about the impact. And indeed, Australians always pay more under \u2026 The highest taxing government was the Howard government, and the second highest taxing government was Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison. Albanese\u2019s \u2018first question from the member for Aston\u2019 Mary Doyle gets the first dixer and she delivers it with a theatrical flourish, which bodes well for those of us hungry for more drama in the house. It\u2019s a setup for Anthony Albanese to be able to say \u201cmy first question from the member for Aston\u201d (because Alan Tudge never asked him a question). Question time is not a serious event. Peter Dutton is on his feet \u2013 for a moment \u2013 because Anthony Albanese forgot to say that Jim Chalmers would be absent from the chamber (because of the budget) and he will answer questions on the treasurer\u2019s behalf. Then Dutton is back on his feet. The prime minister promised Australians cheaper mortgages, but since the election interest rates have gone up 10 times, the fastest rise in history. The prime minister promised a $275 cut to your power bill each year before the election, but Labor\u2019s individual in the gas market is causing prices to skyrocket. The prime minister promised families would be better off, but the cost-of-living crisis has never been worse. Why do Australians always pay more under Labor? This just gives Anthony Albanese a chance to read a dixer answer a little earlier. And he does. Mary Doyle is in the chamber and is being welcomed with a speech from Anthony Albanese, who says she is \u201calready the best member for Aston in 30 years\u201d (the seat has been held by the Coalition since 1990). Commonwealth rent assistance has no effect on housing affordability, Anglicare says There is a lot of talk about an increase to commonwealth rental assistance in the budget \u2013 but it is not the fix some people think it is, as Steph Convery reports: An increase in commonwealth rent assistance has been mooted as a budget measure to ease the housing crisis for those on lower incomes, but Anglicare Australia has warned the payment is not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d and has no effect on affordability. As a result of the way the payment is designed, rental assistance payments for nearly 300,000 people may have fallen this year as a direct consequence of the cost of living going up. Anglicare Australia\u2019s chief executive Kasy Chambers said: This payment isn\u2019t really fit for purpose. Things have changed since it came in. It\u2019s not doing what it\u2019s designed to do. We\u2019re spending more and more on it, but it\u2019s not having any effect on affordability. Mary Doyle to be sworn in before question time OK, question time is about to get under way in the house. But first \u2013 Labor has to swear in its newest MP \u2013 Mary Doyle. LNP MPs Matt Canavan and Keith Pitt have been spotted in a parliamentary courtyard posing with lumps of coal. Pitt\u2019s is attached to a board like a prize for bad Santa. No sign of anyone dirtying up their faces yet, but stay tuned. The budget lock-up is under way. Six hours until you learn all. Delay vote on Deeming\u2019s expulsion or risk legal dispute, MP warns Pesutto Victorian Liberal MP, Richard Riordan, has written to the party\u2019s leader, John Pesutto, calling for a delay to Friday\u2019s vote to expel controversial MP Moira Deeming or \u201crisk a very messy legal dispute\u201d. The Polwarth MP also wrote the five MPs who put their names to the expulsion motion \u2013 Roma Britnell, former leader Matthew Guy, Wayne Farnham, Cindy McLeish and James Newbury \u2013 saying it would be invalid given they did not sign it. Riordan wrote in the letter, seen by Guardian Australia: As the member responsible for the reissuing of the parliamentary constitution to all elected members, I write to raise two issues that I think will force the cancellation of this Friday\u2019s meeting, or risk a very messy legal dispute. The notice of special meeting has no signatures. I have sought some independent legal advice \u2026 a motion of this gravity must still be signed by its proposers. The current notice of expulsion is therefore invalid. The constitution is quite clear, and the five proponents must reissue a compliant notice of expulsion with the requisite five clear days\u2019 notice. Therefore, this Friday\u2019s meeting should be cancelled as there is no valid motion to debate. However, a spokesperson for Pesutto said the meeting was going ahead as planned. The two main No campaigns in the Indigenous voice referendum are merging, in a bid to more efficiently use their resources. Guardian Australia has also confirmed that on the eve of the budget, one of the No campaigns has withdrawn its application for deductible gift recipient status, further delaying its bid to receive tax-deductible donations. Warren Mundine, chairman of the Recognise A Better Way group, said that his organisation would merge with the one run by conservative lobby group Advance. The new entity will be known as Australians For Unity. Mundine said he and senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price (the shadow Indigenous minister) would remain the spokespeople for the new campaign. He said the merger came in a bid to be more efficient with resources, to avoid \u201ccompeting\u201d with each other. Mundine said it was a \u201cvery happy conclusion\u201d to a period of negotiations, and there would be a launch event soon. We\u2019ve contacted Advance for comment. But another wrinkle \u2013 Recognise had applied for DGR status, which would let them get tax-deductible donations, and we understand it was close to being granted. But Mundine also said that Recognise had withdrawn its application, and would put another application in under the new entity\u2019s name. That could delay their bid to get tax-deductible donations for some time further. A Treasury department spokesperson confirmed the news to us in a statement today: The Voice No Case Committee (otherwise known as Recognise a Better Way) submitted a proposal for specific listing as a deductible gift recipient (DGR) in the tax law in March 2023. The Voice No Case Committee contacted Treasury on 8 May 2023 to advise that it wished to withdraw its proposal. As to whether tonight\u2019s budget would include the DGR status for the No side, Treasury said: \u201cDecisions by the Government on organisations that are to be specifically listed as DGRs in the tax law will be reflected in 2023-24 Budget (Budget Paper No.2).\u201d So we\u2019ll give you more when we hear more later tonight. Back in the Senate and the Greens bid to suspend standing orders to debate its private member\u2019s bill to abolish Hecs indexation has been defeated and the housing future fund debate has begun. A slight qualification on the Coalition\u2019s support for the nature repair market. We understand the Coalition will still seek some technical amendments and the bill is subject to a Senate inquiry, but they support it. Coalition party room previews budget At the Coalition party room meeting, Peter Dutton praised Stuart Robert for his service to the nation and that he was encouraged by the calibre of candidates coming forward to contest Fadden for the LNP. He also praised Susie Bower, the Liberal candidate for Lyons in Tasmania \u2013 they\u2019re starting early this cycle. Deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, said the budget won\u2019t do anything for grocery prices, mortgages or to \u201csustainably\u201d decrease energy prices. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, and shadow finance minister, Jane Hume, also previewed the budget, with Taylor repeating his lines that it will put a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. Keith Wolahan, the Liberal MP who is deputy chair of the inquiry on the constitutional alteration bill, revealed there is likely to be a majority report with the Coalition members in dissent, citing constitutional risks involved in the Indigenous Voice proposal. On legislation: The Coalition will support Labor\u2019s nature repair market bill, because of its similarity to the previous government\u2019s biodiversity stewardship bill. This means it is likely to sail through without Greens support. The Coalition has concerns that national security legislation will expand and change the membership of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. It also has concerns that the family law amendment bill goes further than the Australian law reform commission inquiry recommended. Budget lock-up to begin in less than an hour There is now less than an hour until the budget lock-up begins and things get a little quieter. I\u2019m staying out of lock-up this year to keep you updated on what is going on outside with the parliament and will rejoin the team a little later. We will have all the coverage as usual live from the moment the treasurer steps up to the dispatch box and the blog will continue as well. The house has moved on to condolence motions. The Senate is still debating whether or not to suspend standing orders (it won\u2019t). There are students in the gallery watching this. The Greens Janet Rice says the government needs to take responsibility for the student debt crisis and the Greens remain opposed to the housing bill, which Rice says is \u201cgambling on the stock market\u201d rather than investing what is needed to make a concrete change. Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese has accused the Greens of \u201cstunt after stunt\u201d to avoid debating the housing bill. Biden\u2019s visit later in May likely to highlight tensions over Assange case: Shoebridge The independent MP Andrew Wilkie said the recent Pentagon leaks may be \u201cunhelpful\u201d in resolving the Julian Assange matter, but he said the WikiLeaks founder \u201cdidn\u2019t leak anything\u201d but was reporting and publishing leaks from others. Wilkie noted that Chelsea Manning\u2019s sentence was commuted by Barack Obama. The Greens senator David Shoebridge added: The most recent leaks of Pentagon information clearly show a lack of security controls within the Pentagon. And to punish Julian Assange for that would be an extraordinary overstep, and a misstep by the United States. Julian Assange has never leaked a single document. Julian Assange has acted as a journalist and a publisher at each occasion. And he has committed no crime, if you can call it that, that hasn\u2019t been committed by the New York Times, the Guardian, or publications across the world, yet Julian Assange is continuing to be persecuted by Washington, aided and assisted by the United Kingdom. Asked if there was any chance the issue could be resolved by the time of Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Australia for the Quad meeting later this month, Shoebridge said: Well, I think you would be foolish not to see that there\u2019s going to be heightened tensions and heightened concerns amongst the Australian community on this issue with the visit from President Biden. And I would hope that the United States sees this as a very real opportunity to resolve this once and for all, so that that tension can be taken off the table when President Biden visits. The Coalition\u2019s joint party room briefing is under way: Julian Assange group was sometimes \u2018politely blunt\u2019 with US ambassador: Wilkie Asked what the group\u2019s specific request of the US ambassador was today \u2013 and whether Caroline Kennedy gave them any sense a breakthrough was imminent \u2013 Andrew Wilkie said: I wanted to make point that the Assange group is a very diverse group. It has not just the major parties, the Greens, independents, it also has a member of One Nation. It\u2019s a very, very broad church. And we have a range of views about Julian Assange. The few key points which unite us [are] a belief that Julian Assange is facing a terrible injustice, that the extradition should be dropped, and he should be allowed to return to Australia. So as a group, that was the message we took to Caroline Kennedy this morning, that this injustice must be brought to an end, it has gone on long enough \u2026 the extradition should be dropped, he should be released from jail and he should be allowed to return to Australia. Now, I will not breach any confidences as far as what was discussed. It was quite frankly, a very open, free-flowing discussion. And we were sometimes blunt, with the US ambassador \u2013 politely blunt \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to verbal her or speak for her. I will let her offer her own views about the meeting State funeral offer was made to Barry Humphries\u2019 family in \u2018good faith\u2019: Andrews The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says a state funeral offer for comedy giant Barry Humphries was made in \u201cgood faith\u201d after his family opted for the service to be held in Sydney instead. Humphries\u2019 state funeral will be held in Sydney after the Melbourne-born actor died last month. The Andrews government had offered a state service to his family. Speaking to reporters, Andrews said it was the family\u2019s decision: That\u2019s ultimately their call. There could be multiple opinions within that family. But that\u2019s a matter for them and we should respect their privacy. The Coalition is also not supporting the suspension, which means the Greens motion will fail. Penny Wong is speaking in the Senate in response to Mehreen Faruqi\u2019s motion to suspend standing orders to debate the bill to abolish Hecs indexation, and saying that the Greens could have brought its bill forward at any time but has chosen now to delay the housing bill. Her speech is focused on the Greens not agreeing with the government\u2019s housing fund and Wong accuses the Greens of \u2018voting with the Tories\u2019. So things have gotten off to a fairly fiery start in the senate chamber. We just got an ETS mention \u2013 so yes, fiery. Move from \u2018quiet diplomacy\u2019 to speaking up about Assange has \u2018elevated the issue\u2019, parliamentary group says [continued from last post] Greens senator David Shoebridge said there had been a move from \u201cquiet diplomacy\u201d to the government, opposition leader and more politicians \u201cspeaking up plainly and clearly about the need to bring Julian Assange home\u201d. Shoebridge said that increasingly public stance had \u201celevated the issue in our politics \u2013 and I think we saw an indication from the meeting we had today that it\u2019s elevated it in Washington too\u201d. Labor MP Josh Wilson said \u201cit was a good meeting and it certainly feels as if there\u2019s some momentum, moving towards what I think most people in the Australian community would like to see, which is an end to the persecution and incarceration of Julian Assange\u201d. His Labor colleague, Peter Khalil, broadened the discussion by adding: There are many Australians in this situation - I hope we can put this concerted effort in behind so many other Australians like Robert Pether in Iraq, like Cheng Lei who is in China and others, we\u2019ve had the success of Sean Turnell being released. But this is unfortunately, something that\u2019s happening globally. And it\u2019s great to have the Australian parliament working together across the board, across the partisan lines on something that really matters to us and to all Australians. Members of the Bring Julian Assange Home Parliamentary Group have held a press conference at Parliament House, after their meeting earlier today with the US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy. The independent MP Andrew Wilkie said the meeting at the embassy went for about 40 minutes. Wilkie said the group wanted the US to drop the extradition request. He said Kennedy gave the group \u201ca very good hearing\u201d and \u201callowed us to say everything we wanted to say\u201d: She now is much more, I think, alert to the concerns of the Australian community. She wasn\u2019t in a position to make any commitments on behalf of the Biden administration or speak for the US Justice Department, but we are confident that she is now very much alert to the concerns of many Australians. I hope she was quite affected by the fact that the Assange parliamentary group has members from right across the political spectrum. Liberal MP Bridget Archer said it was \u201ca very productive meeting\u201d and the ambassador was \u201cvery generous with her time\u201d. Pointing to recent comments from the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, Archer said: There\u2019s been a groundswell of support for this issue, even since the last parliament and the members of this committee that have grown. And we have seen even last week the opposition leader joining with the prime minister, in saying that this issue has gone on for far too long, it is time to bring this issue to a resolution and for Julian Assange to be freed from Belmarsh [prison] and to be brought back to Australia. Greens senator Faruqi\u2019s motion to abolish Hecs indexation set to fail Back in the senate, the Greens education spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, is moving a motion to suspend standing orders to bring about the debate on her private member\u2019s bill to abolish indexation of Hecs payments. That comes in from 1 June, so Faruqi says the matter is one of urgency. But without the government or Coalition\u2019s support, the motion will fail. And it doesn\u2019t look like either side are supporting this. The house is hearing from the prime minister and opposition leader on the king\u2019s coronation. The Senate is speaking on the violence in Sudan. Labor MP for Aston, Mary Doyle, will be sworn in ahead of question time, at 2pm. Parliament sitting begins The parliament sitting has begun. Anthony Albanese will start off with a congratulations to King Charles (after the prayers) and then things get up and running. What a sentence to write in 2023. The government\u2019s signature housing bill still remains in peril, with the Greens still deciding they cannot support the bill in its current form. The minor party had its regular meeting this morning, with the housing affordability future fund bill a major topic. The Greens want the bill to go much further in dealing with the housing crisis, including calling for the government to institute a national rent freeze and guarantee funding to build new social housing (the government\u2019s bill doesn\u2019t guarantee funding for new builds, only promising to use the interest payments from an investment into the future fund to build new properties). The Greens MPs say they cannot support the bill unless it is further amended. The party has more meetings with the government this week, and the housing bill is set to dominate the Senate agenda in coming days (yes, the parliament continues sitting, even despite the budget circus). BUT there is the possibility that the government tries to bring on the bill for a vote anyway, challenging the Greens to vote for or against it. The Greens reckon that would be unlikely, but it\u2019s unclear if they would vote against the bill \u2013 perhaps instead abstaining from the vote, as they did in the lower house when the bill was pushed through. Outside the housing bill, the Greens are also not happy with the PRRT resources tax changes, which they want to go much further as well. The Greens say the government shouldn\u2019t take their support for granted, and that they may not back the changes (on the grounds that they don\u2019t go far enough). Hecs indexation expected to hit students and former students hard The Hecs indexation is going to hit and hit hard for students and former students already struggling. There doesn\u2019t look like being any change to the indexation in the budget. Greens warn Labor not to ask Senate to vote on social housing bill The Greens housing spokesperson, Max Chandler Mather, has warned Labor not to ask for a vote on its housing Australia future fund bill, confirming there\u2019s been no progress in negotiations. He said The Greens have already made clear again and again that we will not support Labor\u2019s housing plan in its current form because it doesn\u2019t guarantee a cent in funding for housing and they\u2019re not doing anything for renters. You now are seeing a wave of housing organisations come out and say, it would be irresponsible and disastrous for Labor to try and force a vote on a housing bill where they have still not concluded negotiations or made any serious offer to fix a housing bill that right now will see the housing crisis get worse \u2026 We\u2019ve got every housing organisation under the sun saying Labor needs to commit to more funding for housing and guarantee it and do something for renters. It is remarkable that we have a situation where Labor are more willing to let their bill fail than invest billions of dollars in public and affordable housing or coordinate a national freeze on rent increases after they\u2019ve admitted it\u2019s possible, given the national cabinet is now finally discussing \u2026 harmonising renters\u2019 rights across the country, including rent controls. The outcome of that meeting is really crucial because that is a key element of our ask and for them to try and force that on before the national cabinet has reported back on that process is in itself an indication [that] it\u2019s not clear to us that they are willing to negotiate seriously or in good faith.\u201d The NRL has become the first major football code to commit its support to the Indigenous voice to parliament. In a statement on Tuesday morning, the NRL said it had been a proud supporter of the Uluru Statement from the Heart since 2017 and that it was \u201ccommitted to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice\u201d: First Nations communities have deep bonds with rugby league and are part of our fabric at all levels, from grassroots participants and fans to the Indigenous stars who light up the NRL and NRLW,. The NRL has had its own independent voice since the commencement of the Australian Rugby League Commission. The Australian Rugby League Indigenous Council (ARLIC) plays an integral role in making representations to the ARLC with ideas and views on behalf of Indigenous peoples across the game. True change comes through listening, learning and taking action \u2013 and we encourage everyone in the rugby league community to get informed by the facts, and use their voice, so that we can move forward together. Tennis Australia and the Australian Olympic Committee have already lent their backing to the voice. The other major sporting codes run by Rugby Australia, Football Australia, Netball Australia and Cricket Australia are yet to formalise a stance on the voice. The AFL last week reportedly sent a memo to its member clubs asking them for their position as it considers its own stance. Chalmers and Gallagher pay ritual visit to powerful, mystical budget tree The treasurer and the finance minister (Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher) are doing the traditional walk through the senate courtyard, to pay homage to the budget tree. Legend has it, if the treasurer does not make a worthy enough sacrifice to the budget tree ahead of each budget, they will never become prime minister. \u201cLooking forward to the big day,\u201d Chalmers says to Gallagher in what is one of the most staged conversations of all time, as they sit beneath the budget tree for a \u201ccandid\u201d conversation between themselves and half the gallery press pack. \u201cYeah,\u201d Gallagher says, and then remembers she is meant to sound enthusiastic. \u201cIt\u2019s a great budget, a great women\u2019s budget statement, always want to give that a plug. Month and months of work. A lot of collective effort in this and I think it\u2019s going to be a really [responsible budget]. Chalmers takes his prod: It\u2019\u2019s a really responsible budget and it does the right thing by people in the here and now, but it also invests in the future, and I think that\u2019s going to make it a budget in the best \u2013 not just traditions of Labor but the traditions of Australia, looking after the most vulnerable people at the same time as we invest in more opportunities and a better future for people. So it\u2019s a big day. \u201cCan I get you to look upwards?\u201d a member of the gallery asks. It\u2019s all theatre. All of it. Will the budget tree be appeased? Time will tell. You are about to be spared the thoughts and feelings of most of the press gallery \u2013 lock up is just over two hours away. What does that mean? Frannnndsss! The US embassy has officially acknowledged the meeting Daniel Hurst reported on between cross-party MPs and the ambassador about dropping the US\u2019s bid for Julian Assange\u2019s extradition. The teal independents are on a unity ticket when it comes to the PRRT changes not being enough: Why is gas getting a sweetheart deal under the resources rent tax? For a day or so, we were told the changes to the petroleum resources rent tax (PRRT) would deliver $2.4bn more into the government\u2019s coffers for the four years to 2027-28. What wasn\u2019t played out, though, was that the extra money looks like merely payments brought forward, rather than additional ones, as you can read here: It\u2019s possible there are other changes to the treatment of the deductions (such as the 15% plus government bond rate \u201cindexation\u201d of their rolling value) but we haven\u2019t seen them yet (and have asked treasurer Jim Chalmers\u2019 office a couple of times about them, without response). The bottom line is that offshore LNG exporters have a royalty rate below 5% compared with 7.5%, say, for iron ore, and as much as 20% for Queensland\u2019s export coal (at current high prices), according to energy analyst Tim Buckley. Australians have a right to wonder why gas gets such a sweetheart deal. The Minns government is sitting for the first time in NSW, which means TRADITION. Queensland government confirms new youth detention centre in Cairns The Queensland government has kicked off regional sitting week by confirming it will build a youth detention centre in Cairns to meet \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d. The deputy premier, Steven Miles, said planning is underway to build two new detention centres - one in Cairns and one in south-east Queensland. \u201cBoth new centres will include therapeutic design elements... to improve community safety,\u201d he said. \u201cThese facilities will support the government\u2019s goal to provide more regional detention services closer to where young people live, close to family and community relations.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Monday, the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the new detention centre would be \u201cmodest\u201d in size, with about 35 or 40 beds. \u201cIt will be wraparound services as well, working with the local community and looking very clearly how to get young people engaged with work and also to be closer to home,\u201d she said. The chief executive of Sisters Inside, Debbie Kilroy, has raised concerns that First Nations children will be disproportionately impacted by the construction of the detention centre. She believes community solutions are needed, not more prisons. The parliamentary sitting doesn\u2019t start until midday on Tuesday, to give time for the party room meetings. The new Labor MP for Aston, Mary Doyle, will be sworn when the parliament opens and there will be a question time as normal \u2013 though most of the gallery will be in the budget lock up. Allegra Spender: PRRT changes are \u2018tinkering around the edges\u2019 The independent Wentworth MP Allegra Spender is also disappointed with the government\u2019s PRRT changes. Spender has released this statement: Now that I\u2019ve seen the details of the PRRT changes I\u2019m very disappointed. Labor\u2019s proposal will collect a small amount of additional revenue a few years early \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t come close to giving Australians a fair share from the super-profits made from their resources being sold overseas. Last year our LNG exports increased by more than $40bn \u2013 this change is going to collect little more than 1% of that each year. It\u2019s going to bring in less each year than the modest changes Labor announced to super balances over $3m. This is tinkering around the edges \u2013 not a substantial reform. It\u2019s a big opportunity that\u2019s been missed by the government. (It is not unusual for the teal independents to include footnotes about where they are getting their information for their statements, which Spender\u2019s team did today. Just pointing out an interesting fact.) Outside of the budget Daniel Hurst reports there is a big cross party push to end the US extradition bid for Julian Assange. That comes after Peter Dutton publicly shifted the Coalition\u2019s message on Assange last week. (Anthony Albanese has been saying \u2018enough is enough\u2019 since he was opposition leader. There have been a LOT of pre-budget leaks in the lead up to this budget and quite a few of those leaks confirmed. We know there will be a forecast surplus. Wafer thin, but it\u2019s forecast to be there. That\u2019s confirmed. We know that there will be changes to the working age welfare payments. Looks like $40 a fortnight for under 55s and a little more \u2013 most likely lowering the threshold the already-in-existence, slightly-higher jobseeker rate \u2013 for long-term over-60s. The changes to the single parenting payment age threshold, where single parents move off that payment to jobseeker (from when their youngest child turns 14, up from 8), has been officially announced. Aged care workers are getting a pay rise. The electricity bill relief will be up to $500 depending on which state you live in. We know all of these things. Which means these are not the stories the government wants told from the budget. Jim Chalmers wants to restore Labor\u2019s \u201cgood economic manager\u201d reputation. Throughout history, Labor has had pretty bad luck \u2013 coming to power just before a major economic downturn, and then losing office as things start to turn around. Chalmers and Anthony Albanese have been embarking on a long term government project. Every change has been incremental and well telegraphed, they have stuck pretty close to the centre, and it\u2019s all about being \u201cresponsible\u201d. The issue will be whether that lives up to voters\u2019 expectations. Albanese: budget numbers \u2018much better\u2019 than predicted Anthony Albanese also went on Adelaide radio FIVEaa \u2013 a station he has a long affiliation with and used to do a weekly segment with Christopher Pyne on, before doing it by himself after Pyne retired. He still pops up from time to time and this morning he was asked about the forecast $4bn surplus in the budget: Well, I know they\u2019re reporting that but they\u2019ll have to wait until 7:30 for any confirmation of that. Certainly, the numbers [are] much better than were predicted. There has been a very significant effort on behalf of the government to turn around \u2026 some of the figures that we inherited that were substantially worse than what you\u2019ll see tonight. We inherited a budget that was predicting last year, under the Coalition, predicted this year a $77.9bn deficit. So I can assure you it\u2019s much better than that. Ahem. \u201cReporting\u201d, yes, because we HAVE confirmation of it. From the treasurer. For those wondering what the budget lock up is actually like, here is something prepared a little earlier: Chalmers: stage three tax cuts not a focus of discussion in this budget So what about the stage three tax cuts? Jim Chalmers: We will be helping the vulnerable in this budget this year. This has been our focus. The tax cuts that you raise, they don\u2019t come in \u2026 for more than a year now. They haven\u2019t been a focus of our discussions for this budget but we can help the most vulnerable people in our community and in our country this year at the same time as we lay the foundations for a stronger, more sustainable economy into the future. PM: \u2018Gas has an important role to play as a transition fuel\u2019 towards renewables Earlier this morning, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was interviewed by ABC Radio Sydney and was asked why the government wasn\u2019t going harder on the PRRT (gas extraction) reforms: We\u2019re saying that gas has an important role to play as a transition fuel. If you look at a company like Rio Tinto that is moving towards all of its refineries in alumina and activity in Gladstone, they have four substantial refineries that together result in direct and indirect employment of many, many thousands of Australians. What they are saying is they want to be powered by renewables, and whilst green hydrogen is something they\u2019re looking at as well, to be the stabilising fuel source, if you like, in that transition, gas has an important role to play. If it wasn\u2019t there, they wouldn\u2019t be able to move to renewables like they are. Treasurer: \u2018Angus Taylor is not a serious person\u2019 More on Chalmer\u2019s walk-in comments: We asked about the expected rise in the jobseeker unemployment payment. Chalmers wouldn\u2019t bite, but seemingly hinted that there would be an across-the-board raise in the rate, saying the cost of living relief wouldn\u2019t be limited. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for some time and you\u2019ll see tonight the cost of living relief in this budget is broader than what has been speculated on. It has a number of elements. It won\u2019t all be limited by age or other distinctions. There\u2019s help for the most vulnerable but also for middle Australia as we get through these difficult times together and lay the foundation for a much better future,\u201d he said. Chalmers also took a dig at the Nationals senator Matt Canavan for bringing in a lump of coal to Parliament House, and a dig at the shadow treasurer Angus Taylor\u2019s criticisms of the budget. \u201cAngus Taylor is not a serious person, he\u2019s not making a serious contribution and that\u2019s why no-one takes him seriously,\u201d he said. Despite the projected surplus, Chalmers said he wouldn\u2019t be following the former Coalition government\u2019s example and printing \u201cBack In Black\u201d merchandise (which, of course, became collectors\u2019 items after that surplus never materialised). \u201cIt\u2019s not my style to make back in black mugs like my predecessor did. I thought that was humiliating for the Liberals and Nationals frankly. I\u2019m taking a much more cautious and conservative approach,\u201d he said. Jim Chalmers confirms surplus (after PM says to wait and see) The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says the cost of living package in tonight\u2019s budget will be wider than speculated, as he talked up the benefits of the government\u2019s financial plan for both the most vulnerable people as well as \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d \u2013 as well as finally confirming the worst-kept secret in Canberra, that the budget will show a surplus. Labor or Liberal, budget day has a few standard traditions. On the day, the treasurer does a staged walk-in through the ministerial entrance of Parliament House, along a pond set into the stone floor, and holds a quick press conference. It\u2019s early May in Canberra, so it\u2019s usually chilly as heck (today was the first day your correspondent had to scrape ice off the car windscreen \u2013 an omen? We\u2019ll tell you after 7.30pm). Chalmers stuck to the tradition and in a few brief comments before walking in told waiting journalists that there would be a surplus projected in tonight\u2019s budget. Just minutes earlier, the PM, Anthony Albanese, told 5AA radio that he wouldn\u2019t confirm the surplus, and told the hosts to wait for the treasurer\u2019s speech tonight. \u201cThis is a responsible budget which helps people doing it tough and sets Australia up for the future. It\u2019s carefully calibrated to address cost of living pressures in our communities, rather than add to them,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a budget in Labor\u2019s best traditions but also Australia\u2019s best traditions, help for the vulnerable, broadening and extending more opportunities, and investing in the future of our country and its people.\u201d Taylor: task of budget is to \u2018help people into a job that raises their income\u2019 Who does Angus Taylor think are getting \u201chandouts\u201d? (I think you can guess) We\u2019ll see exactly who it is tonight. But you know, if I take jobseeker as an example. jobseeker is indexed, it goes up with inflation. There was a $50 a fortnight increase under our government during the pandemic at an appropriate time. But we have right now \u2026 more than 430,000 job vacancies. That\u2019s almost one job vacancy for every unemployed person in Australia. We haven\u2019t seen that sort of ratio in living memory. So the task here is simple. Help people into a job that raises their income and it takes pressure off inflation. That\u2019s the kind of policy we need to see. Not a policy where people are encouraged not to get into work. \u2026 we need to see a budget that\u2019s focused on the pressures that we are facing now. A budget that unites all Australians. A budget where more Australians are in a job. A budget where they earn higher pay because they\u2019re earning that pay. I mean, this is a very simple principle. It\u2019s a good, traditional, Liberal National principle. That\u2019s how you solve inflation. The problem with Labor governments is they\u2019ve never been able to solve these sorts of inflationary pressures because their natural instinct is to throw money around and that makes the situation worse. It shouldn\u2019t need to be said \u201cagain\u201d but it is not as simple as there are X amount of jobs and X amount of people on jobseeker and therefore there is a job for everyone. There are plenty of people on jobseeker who have chronic health issues, disabilities, caring responsibilities, issues with transport, different skill levels to what the market wants, language barriers \u2013 all sorts of things. \u2018A drover\u2019s dog could deliver a budget surplus this year,\u2019 Angus Taylor says This is a serious take from the shadow treasurer who seems to be hoping that people don\u2019t really know how budgets work and that it uses tax payments to help fund things and that includes things that might help different groups of people. You can actually see how much of your tax goes to different parts of the budget in your tax return. And you will see that most of it goes to things like health and education with a very small part going to social security. And it is how a progressive tax system is supposed to work \u2013 if you earn more, you should pay more tax to help those who do not earn as much. It\u2019s about fairness. Angus Taylor: [Australians] don\u2019t want to see a budget that divides between those who get a hand out and those who pay for it. That is not the budget that Australia needs right now. There are specific tests within that which are very important. We don\u2019t just need to see a budget surplus this year. A drover\u2019s dog could deliver a budget surplus this year. We need to see budget balance across the forwards and that will take pressure off inflation on a sustainable basis. The treasurer has completed the \u201cwalk into parliament on budget day holding the budget\u201d phase of the day. Jim Chalmers says the cost-of-living relief will go wider than what has been speculated \u2013 and will also help \u201cmiddle Australia\u201d. The backbencher poses with the \u201cfinance minister and treasurer ahead of the budget for social media content\u201d photos always has an element of \u201cwe paid for the meet and greet at Comic Con\u201d vibe to it. Matt Canavan brings lump of coal to work For \u201creasons\u201d, LNP senator Matt Canavan has brought a lump of coal to parliament and is showing it off on Sky News. So I guess the Nats are coping really well today (and in general). Very normal behaviour. And also \u2013 proof that there don\u2019t seem to be that many new tricks in that bag. Scott Morrison did his \u201cthis is coal, don\u2019t be afraid\u201d speech to the parliament in 2017. Angus Taylor has released a statement on what he wants out of the budget: A drover\u2019s dog could deliver a surplus with the record revenue being served up to Labor as part of this budget. Labor should focus on not just delivering one surplus but maintaining it over the forward estimates as well. The only way this government can do that is by putting the interests of Australians first and resisting traditional Labor principles of higher taxes and higher spending. The challenge of inflation is that spending more just makes it worse. Fighting inflation with handouts is like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. The government must address the source of inflation, not the symptoms. If the Labor government was serious about tackling inflation, it would build on the Coalition\u2019s strong economic management and restore the fiscal guardrails to the budget, including restoring the goal of budget balance into the budget and the tax-to-GDP cap. We have updated our \u201cyou be the treasurer\u201d tool because Nick Evershed and Andy Ball are geniuses. What would you spend money on? Commonwealth Bank has warned that customers are under strain from rising borrowing and living costs after recording a $2.6bn cash profit for the March quarter, up 10% from a year earlier. Australia\u2019s biggest lender said loan impairments were edging higher and that it was preparing for increasing customer stress. Many of our customers are feeling the strain of higher interest rates and the rising cost of living. We remain committed to supporting our customers through these challenges,\u201d CBA chief executive Matt Comyn said. As higher interest rates impact the Australian economy in the period ahead, we expect economic growth to continue to moderate. The period of rising interest rates dating to May last year has provided a powerful tailwind to bank profits, with Australia\u2019s biggest financial institutions cashing in on the difference between interest collected on loans and interest paid to fund them, primarily from deposits. CBA\u2019s quarterly results, however, show that its profit margins have started to decrease amid more competition in the mortgage market. The cash profit result is largely in line with analyst forecasts. Coalition call on China to release Cheng Lei Outside of budget news for a moment, and Peter Dutton and Simon Birmingham have released a statement calling for the Chinese government to bring \u201cclosure to the case of Australian citizen Ms Cheng Lei and released her from detention\u201d. Daniel Hurst has the latest here: Dutton and Birmingham says the Coalition will continue to provide bipartisan support to the government in working to end the detention. It is impossible for any of us outside this situation to imagine the physical and emotional trauma of being detained for such a long period of time. Most disturbing is Ms Cheng\u2019s continued separation from her children. Compassion, as well as justice, should see her allowed to return home to give a Mum\u2019s love to her children. The Coalition appreciates the sensitivity and complexity of a consular case such as this. We acknowledge that considerable effort has been applied under this government and the former government. The same applies to the case of Dr Yang Hengjun (Dr Yang Jun) who was \u201cdetained in China in circumstances similar to Ms Cheng. Dr Yang similarly deserves to have justice served and to be released.\u201d The Coalition continues to provide bipartisan support to the Albanese Government to do all that is possible to secure the release of both Ms Cheng and Dr Yang. We hold Ms Cheng, Dr Yang and their families in our thoughts during this difficult time. New South Wales Nationals MP Paul Toole has retained his position on the frontbench after being axed as party leader in favour of Dugald Saunders. The state Coalition has this morning unveiled its shadow ministry list after a long night of negotiations following the leadership change. Toole has retained the police portfolio and Saunders has picked up regional NSW. Kellie Sloane has been elevated to the frontbench and handed the environment portfolio just weeks after being elected into parliament for Vaucluse. The opposition leader, Mark Speakman, will hold a press conference at parliament this morning before the 58th parliament is opened later today. Greens accuse Labor of designing budget surplus \u2018for political reasons\u2019 Greens treasury spokesperson Nick McKim is next on ABC radio RN Breakfast and he is still not happy with the changes to the petroleum resource rent tax. And he\u2019s also not happy with the surplus: This surplus has been designed for political reasons, by Jim Chalmers. And again, what we are seeing in this budget is an acknowledgment rhetorically that the government needs to do more to help people who are doing it really tough, but they are not taking the action they need to actually deliver help at the extent that it is desperately needed. Tehan unforthcoming on single parent payment Dan Tehan also won\u2019t say whether the opposition will support the change to the single parent payment because he says it\u2019s \u201cspeculation\u201d. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s confirmed policy. But Tehan tries to link it to the Labor promise to lower electricity bills (by 2025) by $275 which he says hasn\u2019t happened (it\u2019s also not 2025). Tehan says he will wait and see what\u2019s actually in the budget. Dan Tehan accuses Labor of \u2018big taxing\u2019 agenda Over on ABC radio RN Liberal MP Dan Tehan is trying to explain why Labor\u2019s predicted $4bn surplus isn\u2019t actually a good thing. He says it\u2019s because of \u201ca big taxing, big spending, big Australia agenda\u201d. It\u2019s based on the highest tax take since Wayne Swan was treasurer. Under Labor, you\u2019re going to be taxed like you\u2019ve never been taxed before \u2026 \u201d Little bit of context. Yes, income tax has helped with this wafer-thin surplus \u2013 but it\u2019s because unemployment is so low. There\u2019s more people in the labour market, hence there is more income tax. Also, migration rebounded quicker than Treasury anticipated, which has also helped. The tax system has not changed in the year since the Coalition was in power. It\u2019s the same tax system Dan Tehan\u2019s government was using. So no, you\u2019re not being taxed more than ever before. It\u2019s exactly the same Shadow treasurer says federal budget will \u2018divide\u2019 Australian people Angus Taylor is speaking to ABC radio AM and the shadow treasurer says he thinks this is a budget which will \u201cdivide\u201d the Australian people because some people will receive more help than others (the budget\u2019s cost-of-living package is aimed at low- and fixed-income earners). I guess Taylor didn\u2019t pay attention to previous budgets his party handed down, because that tends to be how budgets work \u2013 some groups get more than others. It\u2019s just sometimes those groups are high-income earners receiving massive tax breaks that will mean the budget forgoes billions of dollars in revenue over a decade it really needs that revenue and other times it\u2019s low-income earners getting a little help with their electricity bill. The treasurer will hold a doorstop at 8am on his way into parliament. This is also part of the theatre \u2013 the treasurer is filmed/photographed by the media walking into parliament on the day of the budget. The doorstop is a very quick interview where most of the answers are \u201cresponsible\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ll have to wait for the budget\u201d and then he\u2019s on his way. These \u201ccandid\u201d staged budget photos of a prime minister and their treasurer are never quite right. But Grogs is right. It\u2019s not as bad as 2014. Happy budget day, to those who observe. A very big thank you to Martin for taking us through the overnight stories. We\u2019ll switch to politics now and I\u2019ll take you through all the parliament happenings as well as what we know about the budget and when, while lock-up gets underway at 1.30pm. You\u2019ve got Amy Remeikis for most of the day \u2013 I\u2019ve already had two coffees. The limit does not exist today. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it. Hundreds of students will gather outside Parliament House this morning to protest the growing intergenerational wealth gap ahead of tonight\u2019s federal budget. The National Union of Students (NUS) and Foundation for Young Australians are calling on the federal government to show support for 1.2 million tertiary students struggling with cost of living, student debt and rent rises. They\u2019re demanding Labor lower Centrelink\u2019s age of independence from 22 to 18 \u2013 allowing around 450,000 students to access Youth Allowance \u2013 raise welfare payments, wipe student debt and end unpaid work placements in the budget. President Bailey Riley said students are \u201cstruggling to live\u201d in the current climate. Each day thousands of students are making the tough decision to either show up to class or take a shift to keep a roof over their head. Every day I speak to students who have had to drop out of classes so that they can afford just to put food on the table. As a regional student from Bathurst who had to move to study I know this struggle too well. The students will mobilise from 10am in front of Parliament House, joined by speaker and Greens senator Dr Mehreen Faruqi. The high court will this morning consider whether Qantas\u2019s decision to outsource the jobs of 1,700 ground handlers was unlawful and whether it was designed to stymie the workers from taking industrial action. In July 2021, the federal court ruled that the airline\u2019s decision to lay off staff at 10 airports in 2020 was in part driven by the desire to avoid industrial action, which is a breach of the Fair Work Act. The ruling exposes Qantas to a significant compensation bill. The high court has agreed to hear Qantas\u2019s appeal in the matter. It will be held across today and tomorrow. Qantas argues the outsourcing was a necessary financial measure that could save it $100m annually and reduce future spending on ground-handling equipment such as tugs and baggage loaders. The airline also argues that the workers did not have the right to to take protected industrial action at the relevant time. Qantas said it should not be penalised \u201cfor taking adverse action to prevent an employee acquiring future rights, the exercise of which at the time of the adverse action would have been unlawful\u201d. The TWU is joined in responding to the appeal by federal workplace relations minister, Tony Burke, who is intervening in the case. TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said the case could \u201cseriously undermine the protective intention\u201d of the Fair Work Act, were Qantas to be successful. Good morning and welcome to our budget day blog. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll take you through a couple of overnight breaking stories before Amy Remeikis comes along for the main part of the day followed by tonight\u2019s big reveal. The main budget story overnight is that the budget is projected to record a $4bn surplus this financial year \u2013 the first in 15 years \u2013 thanks to soaring commodity prices and higher-than expected wage growth boosting tax revenues. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, made the announcement which is a big change from the projected $78bn deficit in the Coalition\u2019s March 2022 budget. We\u2019ve got lots more budget stories of course, including Amy\u2019s inside view of what it\u2019s like in the Canberra lockup and, for the completists, everything we know about the budget so far. We know already that there is a $14.6bn cost-of-living package over the next four years: but we don\u2019t know all the details. There\u2019s a great consumer story this morning, with news the consumer watchdog, Choice and legal advocates are all lobbying the government that airline passengers should be compensated if their flight schedules are changed. It\u2019s in response to growing public anger at their treatment by carriers and will bring Australia into line with practices overseas. Staying with aviation, and Qantas will launch its legal challenge in the high court in Canberra today in a bid to overturn a judgment relating to its controversial decision to outsource more than 1,600 workers during the Covid pandemic. Qantas is appealing two rulings by the federal court, which found the outsourcing of baggage handlers, cleaners and ground staff was illegal. We\u2019ll have the developments as they happen."

            "date": "2023-05-09T10:12:30Z",
            "content": "The Albanese government has trumpeted cost-of-living relief, housing, healthcare and clean energy measures in its budget, which it believes will deliver \u201ca stronger economy and a fairer society\u201d. As a result of its planned spending the government claims broad sections of society will be better off. However, the projected surplus will be funded by cracking down on certain areas and decisions not to increase spending in other areas. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 2023 federal budget winners and losers. Winners Low-income renters In what is the only immediate benefit specific to renters in the budget, recipients of commonwealth rent assistance (CRA) \u2013 an existing program for which about 1.1 million low-income Australians are eligible \u2013 will receive more financial support. The maximum rate of the CRA payment will increase by 15% from 20 September, subject to being passed in parliament. For a single CRA recipient with no dependants who does not share their rental home with anyone else, and who is receiving the maximum amount of assistance, their payment would increase from $157.20 a fortnight to $180.80. Small businesses The government will reward small business owners with a range of financial measures. The instant asset write-off threshold will be temporarily increased to $20,000 from 1 July for a year. This means small businesses with an annual turnover less than $10m will be able to instantly deduct the entire cost of certain assets that cost less than $20,000, which are first used between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024. The $20,000 threshold applies to each asset, so small businesses can take advantage of this measure to buy multiple assets. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Not only that, small and medium-sized businesses will be encouraged to buy energy-efficient fridges, electric cooling systems, batteries and other assets that \u201csupport electrification and more efficient use of energy\u201d. Companies with a turnover of less than $50m will be able to deduct an additional 20% of the cost of depreciating assets that are eligible under the small business energy incentive measure. Small businesses also get energy bill relief as part of a scheme primarily directed at welfare recipients. Welfare recipients \u2013 but not all Base rates of support payments including jobseeker, youth allowance, the partnered parenting payment and Austudy will rise by $40 a fortnight from 20 September. The government had already announced it would extend eligibility for the higher single jobseeker payment for recipients aged over 60 to those aged 55 who have been on the payment for more than nine months. Addressing rising household energy costs, the government will spend $3bn on direct bill relief \u2013 co-funded with state governments \u2013 to eligible households, including pensioners, seniors health card holders and family tax benefit A and B recipients. The government claims more than 5m households will have up to $500 deducted from their power bills next financial year. In another measure announced before budget day, single parents will be able to claim the single parenting payment until their youngest child turns 14, up from eight \u2013 a measure estimated to provide 57,000 families with an extra $176.90 a fortnight. Doctors, aged care workers and people needing healthcare The government will spend $3.5bn to triple the bulk-billing incentive that GPs receive, meaning there will be more common consultation types which doctors can choose to bulk bill. Eight new Medicare urgent care clinics will be established to open for longer hours with no out-of-pocket costs \u2013 bringing the total across Australia to 58. The government will also spend hundreds of millions to better coordinate healthcare, including on telehealth, the digitisation of records and increasing Medicare rebates for consults longer than 60 minutes. Aged care workers will also benefit from a 15% pay rise. Politicians The government will splash an additional $159m over the next four years, and about $40m a year going forward, on themselves. Every parliamentarian will receive \u201cadditional frontline electorate staff resources\u201d, as well as a boosted traveller expense allowance, which the government says will help politicians \u201cbe engaged and responsive to the increased needs of the community\u201d. Veterans Services for veterans will be better funded, including $64.1m over the coming financial year for additional resourcing to tackle the backlog of claims for supports, as well as increased demand for complex case management, rehabilitation, pharmacy and health approvals. Another $2m will be spent over two years to continue the Department of Veterans Affairs mental health literacy and suicide intervention training program for the ex-service community. Losers Travellers Leaving Australia? Whether you\u2019re going on holiday or moving for good, you\u2019ll have to pay an extra $10, as the government increases the passenger movement charge from 1 July 2024 from $60 to $70 a passenger. Smokers The tobacco excise will increase by 5% a year for three years from 1 September, as the government aims to encourage smokers to quit through this and other anti-smoking measures that will raise tax revenue by $3.3bn. Middle-income renters There\u2019s not a great deal of immediate relief specifically for those in the rental market who don\u2019t qualify for low income support payments but who are struggling to secure properties or facing rising rents. Incentives to boost the supply of build-to-rent schemes won\u2019t deliver new supply to the market for several years. Tax dodgers The government will continue to fund a crackdown on businesses not paying goods and service tax (GST). These compliance activities will cost just under $600m over four years, but could boost tax revenues by about $10bn over the same period. Commuters and train lovers Despite an election pledge to prioritise a high-speed train along the east coast of Australia starting with a Sydney to Newcastle section, the budget contained no new funding for that rail track in the coming three financial years, nor for any other significant commuter rail projects around Australia. Scammers A national anti-scam centre will be established from this coming financial year, at a cost of $58m, to respond to a spike in online scams and fraud. The centre will share scam data across government and private sector, and \u201cestablish public-private sector Fusion Cells to target specific scam issues\u201d. About $17m will be spent over four years to identify and take down phishing websites and investment scams. Scammers sending phoney text messages have also been put on notice, with $10m allocated for an SMS sender ID registry to stop criminals impersonating government and industry names."

            "date": "2023-05-28T12:52:10Z",
            "content": "The US is ready for conflict in outer space, according to a senior military official, after developing anti-satellite technologies to counter the threats posed by \u201cprovocative\u201d countries such as Russia and China. Brig Gen Jesse Morehouse at US Space Command, the arm of the military responsible for space operations, said Russian aggression and China\u2019s vision to become the dominant space power by mid-century, had left the US with \u201cno choice\u201d but to prepare for orbital skirmishes. \u201cThe United States of America is ready to fight tonight in space if we have to,\u201d Morehouse told reporters in a briefing at the US embassy in London. \u201cIf someone was to threaten the United States of America, or any of our interests, including those of our allies and partners with whom we have treaties of mutual defence support, we are ready to fight tonight.\u201d Satellites underpin great swathes of modern life, from banking systems to weather forecasting, and are crucial for military operations through intelligence gathering, communications, navigation and guidance. But an overreliance on satellites means that an attack on a country\u2019s orbital assets could have far-reaching consequences. Four countries, namely China, the US, India and Russia, have tested anti-satellite capabilities by destroying their own satellites with missiles from the ground. But such demonstrations, which the US unilaterally banned last year, create vast clouds of debris that put other satellites at risk for decades. When Russia shot down one of its own satellites in 2021, the explosion showered its orbit with more than 1,500 trackable fragments. \u201cWhen you create that debris cloud and it lingers on orbit for decades, it\u2019s almost like detonating a nuclear weapon in your own back yard,\u201d Morehouse said. \u201cYou pay the price too.\u201d Faced with a new space race, Morehouse said on Thursday the US would continue to develop anti-satellite technologies \u201cnot because we want to fight tonight, but because that\u2019s the best way to deter conflict from happening\u201d, adding it would do so \u201cwithout engaging in irresponsible tests\u201d. Russia and China are working on spacecraft capable of anti-satellite operations. In 2020, the US accused Russia of launching a projectile from one of two satellites that were trailing a US spy satellite. Meanwhile, China has launched a satellite with a robotic arm capable of grabbing other satellites, and has developed a way to place explosives in the thruster nozzles of adversary\u2019s satellites. The explosives are designed to go undetected for long periods and when detonated resemble an innocent engine malfunction. Beyond weapons that grab, crash into or shoot down their targets are other approaches that jam satellite broadcasts, or damage the hardware with lasers, chemical sprays or high-power microwaves. \u201cWe have a variety of capabilities we can bring to bear and we\u2019ll continue to develop capabilities that allow us to maintain a credible deterrence posture,\u201d Morehouse said. \u201cCan you develop a capability that can be used to counter satellites, that works very well, and validate that it works without having to create a debris cloud on orbit every time you do so? Absolutely.\u201d Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has threatened to target western commercial satellites it considers to be involved in the war. Shortly after the invasion began, Elon Musk agreed to supply Starlink constellation satellites to Ukraine, which rapidly became crucial to the country\u2019s military. But in February, Starlink said it would prevent the satellites from being used to control Ukrainian drones, saying it never intended the technology to be used for \u201coffensive purposes\u201d. Morehouse said one of the lessons from the conflict was how resilient Starlink proved to be. The communications network comprises thousands of small satellites in low Earth orbit which are easily replaced and updated to counter the threats they face. \u201cIt makes no sense for Russia to even try to shoot one down because there\u2019s thousands of them and they don\u2019t have thousands of anti-satellite missiles,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly the Ukrainians have no organic military space capabilities to attack in any way shape or form,\u201d he added. \u201cBut \u2026 they\u2019ve been very aggressive in trying to negate those commercial services, which I think is going to be a normal part of warfare in the future. Satellite communications are becoming more and more common across many militaries, and so countering them is something that many nations are interested in.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-21T08:26:29Z",
            "content": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit, as Russia claimed a battlefield victory in the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (\u00a3300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s defences in its war with Russia. Their meeting came as Zelenskiy attempted to win over the leaders of non-aligned countries, including India and Brazil, who have so far declined to condemn the Russian invasion. In a meeting with Zelenskiy on the sidelines of the summit in Hiroshima, Japan, Biden said the military aid package included ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training, days after giving the UK and other allies the go-ahead to transfer US-built F-16 jets to Ukraine. \u201cTogether with the entire G7 we have Ukraine\u2019s back and I promise we\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Biden said. Later, he said he had received a \u201cflat assurance\u201d from Zelenskiy that the jets would not go into Russian territory, but added that they would be used \u201cwherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area\u201d. Zelenskiy initially appeared to confirm the loss of Bakhmut, saying there was \u201cnothing left\u201d of the city. Asked if Ukrainian forces were holding on or if Russia had captured the city, Zelenskiy was not entirely clear, but said, \u201cYou have to understand there is nothing\u201d there. \u201cFor today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts.\u201d But at a press conference later on Sunday, he said Bakhmut was \u201cnot occupied\u201d by Russian forces, adding that Ukrainian troops remained in the city. \u201cWe are fighting thanks to the courage of our people, our warriors,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI clearly understand what has taken place in Bakhmut. I cannot share with you the tactical views of our military. Bakhmut is not occupied by the Russian Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of those words.\u201d The Russian military claimed on Saturday it had captured the city, the scene of the bloodiest battle so far of the 15-month conflict. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Sunday congratulated the Wagner mercenary force and the Russian army for what he called the \u201cliberation\u201d of Bakhmut. In a statement published on the Kremlin website, Putin said that the battle \u2013 the longest and bloodiest of the 15-month war \u2013 had ended in a Russian victory, and that all those who had excelled in it on Moscow\u2019s side would be given state awards. The G7 repeated its unswerving backing for Kyiv in its final communique, but the Ukrainian president had his work cut out to persuade the leaders of other countries to follow suit. They include the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who has accused the west of \u201cencouraging the war\u201d and has not confirmed that he will meet the Ukrainian leader in Hiroshima. Narendra Modi, who has called for a ceasefire in Ukraine but not condemned the Kremlin, was more forthcoming after meeting Zelenskiy on Saturday. The Indian prime minister told Zelenskiy: \u201cI understand your pain and the pain of Ukrainian citizens very well. I can assure you that to resolve this India and, me personally, will do whatever we can do.\u201d Zelenskiy appeared to have been encouraged by the talks, saying he believed India \u201cwill participate in the restoration of the rules-based international order that all free nations clearly need\u201d. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, described the summit as an opportunity to convince the emerging powers India and Brazil to back Ukraine, describing Zelenskiy\u2019s surprise visit to Hiroshima as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d. The G7 on Saturday vowed to intensify the pressure on Russia in its final communique, released a day early by the summit\u2019s hosts, apparently anticipating that Sunday would be dominated by Ukraine. \u201cRussia\u2019s brutal war of aggression represents a threat to the whole world in breach of fundamental norms, rules and principles of the international community,\u201d the communique said. \u201cWe reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes to bring a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the G7 of trying the isolate Russia and China. \u201cThe task has been set loudly and openly: to defeat Russia on the battlefield, but not to stop there, but to eliminate it as a geopolitical competitor,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a matter of fact, any other country that claims some kind of independent place in the world alignment will also be to suppress a competitor. Look at the decisions that are now being discussed and adopted in Hiroshima, at the G7 summit, and which are aimed at the double containment of Russia and China.\u201d Zelenskiy, who arrived in Hiroshima on Saturday amid heavy security, is seeking wider support for a 10-point peace plan that demands that Russian forces retreat from Ukraine before any negotiations can begin. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said the message from Ukraine and its G7 allies was clear: \u201cRussia must withdraw troops.\u201d Any peace plan, he said, \u201ccan\u2019t simply be linked to a freeze of the conflict. Russia should not bet that if it holds out long enough, it will end up weakening support for Ukraine.\u201d Zelenskiy\u2019s attendance at the G7 came a day after the White House dropped its opposition to allies supplying Kyiv with US-built F-16 fighter jets. While it will take time to train Ukrainian pilots to fly the sophisticated aircraft, Zelenskiy said the lifting of the ban was a \u201cgreat result\u201d. \u201cIt really will help our society, our people to save houses, families,\u201d he said. Writing on his official Telegram channel after meeting the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, Zelenskiy said the jets were essential to improve Ukraine\u2019s air defence capabilities."

            "date": "2023-05-14T14:22:20Z",
            "content": "Pakistan\u2019s former prime minister Imran Khan has escalated his criticism of the country\u2019s powerful military, accusing the head of the army of harbouring a \u201cpersonal grudge\u201d against him and ordering his arrest and a crackdown on his party. \u201cIt is personal. It\u2019s got nothing to do with national interest,\u201d Khan told the Guardian in an interview at his home in Lahore, after a dramatic week in which he was arrested at Islamabad\u2019s high court by almost 100 paramilitary officers on Tuesday and held in police custody, in connection with a land corruption case. \u201cWithout any doubt, the military is behind my arrest,\u201d he said. \u201cPakistan is now being run by the army chief. The crackdown on us is by the army chief.\u201d Arrests of political rivals are nothing new in Pakistan \u2013 when Khan was prime minister, several senior opposition leaders were jailed, some for more than a year \u2013 but such anti-military rhetoric is unprecedented in Pakistan\u2019s politics, where the army has long been seen as the country\u2019s kingmaker and exerts enormous power. Khan was released from police custody on Friday evening, after supreme court judges ruled that his arrest was \u201cillegal and invalid\u201d and the high court granted him bail. Known for his populist politics and firebrand speeches, Khan, 70, fell out spectacularly with his former military allies after he accused them of orchestrating his removal from power in April last year. He has since accused them of two attempts on his life. Khan alleged his arrest, and that of seven senior members of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, was symptomatic of the unrivalled power wielded by the military. \u201cThe military is above law; the ISI [military intelligence agency] is above law,\u201d said Khan. \u201cAnd if you have anyone above the law, then you descend into the law of the jungle. They can pick up people, detain people, disappear people. They try and influence judges; they clamp down on the media. There\u2019s no accountability for the institution. It\u2019s not democratic.\u201d The military has taken control of Pakistan in three separate coups since independence and have maintained an iron grip on politics during civilian governments. Former politicians who have attempted to go up against the military using less stringent language have found themselves toppled, arrested, exiled or assassinated. The relationship between Khan and the current army chief, Gen Asim Munir, is regarded to be acrimonious after Khan sacked Munir from a top military intelligence post in 2019 when he was prime minister. Khan alleged that Munir and other senior military figures had a \u201cvested interest to ensure that I don\u2019t come back to power\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re petrified. They know that we will sweep the elections, so they\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to put me in jail,\u201d said Khan. Khan\u2019s political career has been inextricably entwined with the military establishment. Having been in the political opposition for more than a decade as leader of the PTI, it was not until he began to get the military\u2019s backing that Khan was seen as a viable leader. He was elected prime minister in 2018 amid allegations the military had rigged the poll in his favour \u2013 a charge Khan denies. For the first two years of his government, Khan and the military worked closely together in a \u201chybrid regime\u201d, with the military holding powerful posts and seen as largely calling the shots. However, Khan grew resentful of the army\u2019s control, accusing them of blackmailing his government, while Khan\u2019s erratic policies, his scuppering of a deal with the International Monetary Fund and repeated criticism of the US frustrated the military. Khan was toppled in a vote of no confidence, which he accused the then chief of the armed forces, Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, of orchestrating. The former prime minister has made a number of explosive but often unsubstantiated accusations since he was removed from power, including alleging that the US government colluded with the military to bring him down. The US government vehemently denied these allegations and a leaked audio recording showed Khan allegedly discussing how to \u201cplay with\u201d a diplomatic communication to make it look like the US had interfered. Speaking to the Guardian, Khan further accused then-army chief Bajwa of hiring Pakistan\u2019s former ambassador to Washington, Hussain Haqqani, to lobby against Khan in the US. In response, Haqqani told the Guardian he had sent a legal notice to Khan for defamation, asking him to retract his \u201clies\u201d. \u201cImran Khan does not feel the need to offer any evidence of allegations he makes,\u201d said Haqqani. Khan\u2019s deep-rooted relationship with the military has left critics sceptical of his anti-military position, alleging it is instead a means to weaken the army\u2019s leadership and gain greater control over the institution, especially if he returns to power. Khan denied this. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any backing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want them to be neutral; we just want free and fair elections.\u201d Khan claims to be facing more than 100 legal cases. Among the most high profile is the Toshakhana case, in which Khan is alleged to have sold lavish state gifts presented by the Saudi crown prince worth millions of dollars and concealed the profits. The election commission recently found him guilty, and referred the case to the high court. Khan is also accused of concealing illegal foreign funding for the PTI, which he denies. He alleged that all the cases were politically motivated by the coalition government, led by Shehbaz Sharif, who does not want to face him in the next election. He said that though he feared imminent arrest again, he believed there was \u201cnothing they can do to disqualify me from politics or dissolve my party, which has mass public support\u201d. Khan said he was waiting for the government to agree to dates for provincial elections and the general election, which he is pushing to bring forward from its due date of October. On Sunday, his party held a nationwide \u201cfreedom protest\u201d. If no elections are announced soon, he said, \u201cthen we will have to go into the streets to defend our constitution\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 May 2023. The state gifts in the Toshakhana case are worth millions of dollars, not billions as stated in an earlier version."

            "date": "2023-05-02T13:06:43Z",
            "content": "China\u2019s government has revised its conscription laws, allowing retired service people to re-enlist and increasing recruitment focused on expertise in space and cyberwarfare. The amended regulations, approved by the state council and the central military commission, came into force on Monday, and covered all aspects of China\u2019s military recruitment and personnel deployment processes, for domestic emergencies and wartime. The changes aim to provide \u201cinstitutional guarantees for consolidating national defence and building strong armed forces\u201d, state media reported. China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone a major overhaul and modernisation under the leadership of Xi Jinping, who has accelerated Beijing\u2019s expansionist activities in the region and long-held ambitions to annex Taiwan. US intelligence has reportedly said Xi has instructed the PLA to be capable of a full-scale invasion by 2027, although that does not suggest intention is on the same timeline. About 35% of China\u2019s 2 million military personnel are conscripts serving for two years. The new amendments include specific wartime provisions, including measures to quickly boost troop numbers. \u201cAccording to needs, retired soldiers can be recruited mainly to be supplemented by former active service units or similar posts,\u201d said one new wartime regulation. Returning soldiers will be prioritised in recruitment, and expected to rejoin their original unit or something similar, in order to take advantage of their experience, it outlined. \u201cYou are bringing back a degree of experience, and you fill in positions and posts that will free up younger manpower for positions towards the front,\u201d said Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy in east Asia at King\u2019s College London. The amendments also enhance the PLA\u2019s focus on recruiting people with skills relevant to space and cyberwarfare, two areas in which Xi has pushed for greater Chinese dominance. Recruits from top universities will be prioritised \u201cto help the PLA to increase overall quality and build a professionalized force\u201d, the Global Times said. In January, the administrator of Nasa, Bill Nelson, said the US and China were in a \u201cspace race\u201d which was intensifying. US and Japan defence figures have also expressed concern over potential Chinese attacks from and in space. Last month the Centre for Strategic and International Studies released its annual space threat assessment, warning China was making progress towards its goal of becoming the world leader in space, and that the lines were \u201cblurred\u201d between commercial and government/military endeavours. China\u2019s cyberwarfare capabilities are also increasing. In 2021 the office of the US director of national intelligence said China presented \u201ca prolific and effective cyber-espionage threat, possesses substantial cyber-attack capabilities and presents a growing influence threat\u201d. The changes are the latest in a series of updates to Chinese military recruitment processes. In 2021 recruitment intake periods were doubled to occur twice a year. Previous changes have sought to improve conditions for recruits, refocus promotions to performance instead of time served, and complement military skills with strategic assessment skills. However, the success of reforms \u2013 including the quality and retention of recruits \u2013 won\u2019t be seen \u201cuntil a generation from now\u201d, according to one recent military analysis. Patalano said in recent years the private sector \u2013 backed by a booming economy \u2013 had provided more enticing job prospects for young people than the PLA. \u201cWhat this law suggests is that domestic economic conditions in China are changing and the military might be actively becoming a more appealing line of job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut against that, what you really have is the sense that Chinese authorities feel that the job of a military that would be able to afford the higher standards is not quite finished yet. These laws feel very much like accelerating a process of transition towards a professional military force.\u201d The amendments allowed space for further changes, saying authorities could make adjustments to recruitment and conscription \u201cwithin the scope of law\u201d during wartime. The changes were first announced last month, around the same time that the PLA was staging major military drills in retaliation to Taiwan\u2019s president meeting the US speaker of the House in Los Angeles. It also coincided with a naval base tour by Xi, where he called on the PLA to \u201cstrengthen military training oriented towards actual combat\u201d."

Shi\u2019s post was in reaction to the stiff punishment delivered to Li Haoshi, also known as House, over a joke about two dogs chasing a squirrel reminding him of one of Xi Jinping\u2019s military slogan. After an audio recording of the joke went viral, Beijing police launched an investigation under a 2021 law which criminalised insulting China\u2019s military, the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cWe will never allow any company or individual use the Chinese capital as a stage to wantonly slander the glorious image of the PLA,\u201d China\u2019s ministry of culture and tourism bureau said. His employer was fined \u00a31.68m. Related hashtags were viewed more than 2bn times, with some comments supportive of the comic. Li later apologised on Weibo, which is strictly monitored and censored, and said he felt \u201cdeeply guilty and regretful\u201d about the joke, before his account was suspended. On Tuesday, in a post that appears to have been taken down, Shi posted: \u201cWhy should HOUSE be banned? Aren\u2019t all soldier brothers just dog brothers?\u201d The Global Times reported she was put in administrative detention, which allows police to hold someone for up to 15 days without charge for a minor public order offence. On Weibo, news about Shi had been read about 4m times by Friday, with most comments generally angry at her for supporting Li. \u201cWithout the military, how could you have a stable life today? You are not grateful for your words, you are not a human being!\u201d said one. \u201cThey never thought that they would be insulted by some bad-minded youngsters years later for having defended the country,\u201d said another. The furore over Li\u2019s joke has prompted some comedy operators to cancel shows, and spread fear among performers about crossing government lines. One overseas Chinese comic said Li\u2019s joke had nothing to do with politics, and that the case made her feel \u201cshocked and desperate\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that the red line would be so easily crossed and that there would be no mercy when it was,\u201d said the comic, who requested anonymity. \u201cEven internet users, who have no public influence, are being pursued \u2026 The whole atmosphere has become not just official censorship, but [also] self-censorship and mutual censorship. For a long time, in this way, one thinks and creates with fear. I feel that all areas of creativity and expression have no room for survival.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-25T17:22:06Z",
            "content": "The Belarusian ruler, Alexander Lukashenko, has said that Russia has begun moving tactical nuclear warheads for storage to Belarus, adding that it was possible that the weapons had already arrived in his country. \u201cWe had to prepare storage facilities and the rest over there [in Belarus]. We\u2019ve done all of that. This is why the relocation of nuclear munitions began,\u201d Lukashenko said during a summit of the Eurasian Economic Forum in Moscow. Asked if the weapons had already arrived, he said: \u201cMaybe. I will go and take a look.\u201d The remarks came hours after Russian and Belarusian military officials signed a pact that provides for Moscow to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, marking a shift in the Kremlin\u2019s nuclear posture that could raise the stakes of any future instability in Belarus. The plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on foreign soil is Russia\u2019s first since 1991. The Kremlin has defended the decision saying that it is being provoked by western powers supporting Ukraine. Russia has said it will maintain control over the tactical nuclear weapons, which may be launched on Iskander-M missiles or from Su-25 planes, both of which Belarus has in its arsenal. Belarus borders three Nato countries and has missiles that could reach several capitals. The US also has about 100 such weapons stationed at bases around Europe. The transfer will further align Russia and Belarus\u2019 militaries as Russia seeks a closer alliance with Minsk, which some have predicted will lead to Belarus\u2019s loss of sovereignty. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the two countries would look for other ways to integrate their militaries. That decision came as Russia is bracing itself for a potential Ukrainian counterattack that could put Moscow on the defensive in its 15-month-old war. The head of the Wagner group said his Russian paramilitary organisation had begun to withdraw from the city of Bakhmut and would hand all its positions over to the regular Russian army by 1 June. Yevgeny Prigozhin, an ally of Vladimir Putin, made the announcement during a visit to the ruined city, telling tank crews and other commanders that they would receive new orders soon and should withdraw to the rear. \u201cWe\u2019ll hand over our positions, ammunition, everything including dry rations, to the troops,\u201d meaning the Russian army, he said. Then, relishing another chance to ridicule the military, he said he would leave them two of his fighters in case things get \u201ctoo hard\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s deputy defence minister said on Thursday that Russia had begun to replace Wagner units with regular troops on the outskirts of Bakhmut, but that Wagner fighters remained inside the city. Russia recently claimed to have finally captured the city after nearly 250 days of fighting \u2013 a statement Kyiv disputes. Most analysts expect Ukraine to launch a counterattack, potentially threatening the Russian military\u2019s hard-fought gains in Bakhmut and other areas of the front. Prigozhin has grown extremely critical of the Russian military, accusing Shoigu and other senior military officials of depriving his troops of shells and other ammunition. He said Wagner lost more than 20,000 men in the battle for Bakhmut. The mercenary group includes thousands of convicts recruited from Russian prisons. A Ukrainian official on Thursday suggested the counteroffensive would not mark a significant change shift of gear. \u201cThis is not a \u2018single event\u2019 that will begin at a specific hour of a specific day with a solemn cutting of the red ribbon,\u201d wrote the presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak. Russian militias aligned with Ukraine also launched a cross-border raid earlier this week, setting up chaotic battles in the Belgorod region in some of the first sustained fighting on Russian territory since the beginning of the war. Ukraine has denied any connection to the fighters. A Ukrainian official on Thursday told Reuters that Kyiv had no connection to a \u201cstrange and pointless\u201d drone attack against the Kremlin earlier this month. Video showed several unmanned aerial vehicles flying over the Kremlin walls before exploding in a flash of flight, causing damage to a building facade. The New York Times reported that assessments by US spy agencies showed the attack was probably orchestrated by one of Ukraine\u2019s special military or intelligence units. Moscow blames the attack on Ukraine."

Here is a wrap of the day\u2019s biggest stories: Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas handed down his ninth and \u201cmost difficult\u201d budget today. You can read the full details here. Included in the budget was the announcement that native forest logging will end across Victoria in December, six years earlier than previously planned. The federal government was pressed at Senate estimates as to why a public servant who held top jobs at two departments responsible for robodebt was given a plum $900,000-a-year job in June 2022 as an Aukus adviser. Penny Wong responded that evidence revealed during the robodebt royal commission went \u201cbeyond what [she] would\u2019ve anticipated\u201d The police officer who Tasered 95-year-old Claire Nowland at an aged care facility in Cooma last week has been suspended from duty with pay.

Affordable rental properties in Australian capital cities are at a \u201crecord low\u201d, with the number of properties listed for under $400 a week halving over the past year. Australian and Indian PMs set for India gala in Sydney A rally at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney to celebrate Australia\u2019s large and vibrant Indian community is kicking off shortly, with prime minister Anthony Albanese due to speak at around 6.45pm before introducing Indian PM Narendra Modi. It is the Indian leader\u2019s first visit to Australia since 2014 and the event is expected to draw around 20,000 people. Celebrations have already begun, with performers taking to the stage. Catch up on today\u2019s biggest headlines so far with this wrap from my colleague Antoun Issa: Moves in the ministries In a mini-shuffle to the Albanese ministry, Patrick Gorman will be appointed parliamentary secretary to the minister for public service, known as assistant minister for the public service. This is in addition to his current role of assistant minister to the prime minister. Meanwhile, Andrew Leigh has been appointed as parliamentary secretary to the minister for employment and workplace relations, known as assistant minister for employment. This is in addition to his current role of assistant minister for competition, charities and treasury. [continued from last post] Waters later asked questions about the threat the development may pose to Larrakia cultural heritage and whether satisfactory consultation with Larrakia people had occurred. The department agreed it was \u201copen to the minister\u201d (Tanya Plibersek) to conclude the Northern Territory government needed to provide more information if she was not satisfied adequate consultation had occurred. Waters also asked if the federal government should be taking a more \u201cproactive approach\u201d to cultural heritage in the wake of the Juukan Gorge inquiry and whether the strategic assessment of the Middle Arm development should be paused until national cultural heritage laws were reformed. The assistant climate change and energy minister, Jenny McAllister, said she could not comment about projects that were still under consideration. Darwin Harbour project scrutinised Another update on the proposed Middle Arm development from earlier today in the environment estimates hearing. The Albanese government is taking a $1.5bn stake in the project on Darwin Harbour. The Greens senator Larissa Waters pursued a long line of questioning about what industries will have facilities at the site and the standard of consultation with Darwin\u2019s traditional owners, the Larrakia people. This follows reporting by Guardian Australia that the precinct, dubbed a sustainable development hub, is seen as \u201ca key enabler\u201d for the export of gas from the Beetaloo Basin and would improve the feasibility of offshore carbon capture and storage projects. Waters read from another document \u2013 written during the previous term of government \u2013 released to Guardian Australia under freedom of information. That document says the precinct would provide a \u201cworld class hub for gas production and manufacturing\u201d by 2030. Waters wanted to know what aspect of the precinct that description is captured under. The department said: That would be captured under the low emissions petrochemicals where they\u2019re looking at potentially doing ethylene, urea, ammonia. \u2018The time to act is now\u2019, Stella Assange says Stella Assange was speaking after a meeting in Canberra with the Bring Julian Assange Home parliamentary group, a cross-party grouping whose co-chairs recently held talks with the US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy. Assange said that showed that the US realised the attempt to extradite Julian Assange was becoming a problem in the diplomatic relationship: I think that\u2019s encouraging that the Biden administration understands that this is a problem for Australia, and it\u2019s coming in the way of their relationship with Australia and that the Australian people want a resolution to this case. And of course, it is the Australian people who will be paying for the Aukus arrangement over the next 30 years, so this is not something that can be ignored. Stella Assange said there had been \u201ca sea change in the mood here in Australia\u201d. She called for ongoing constructive engagement between the Australian government and the US and the UK. The timing was \u201ccritical\u201d because the US was about to enter its election cycle and the UK high court could issue its final decision on extradition within months: So the time to act is now \u2026 and the Australian government is crucial to finding a path through which all parties can find a resolution to this. Stella Assange declined to criticise the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, for not meeting with her this week, after the independent MP Andrew Wilkie raised it in question time yesterday. She said it \u201cwasn\u2019t really on my agenda\u201d as she was in Canberra primarily to address the National Press Club, before tomorrow\u2019s rally in Sydney that had been timed to coincide with the now-cancelled Quad summit. Assange\u2019s wife says top Australian envoy set to visit him again at Belmarsh Stella Assange has confirmed that her husband, WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange, is likely to receive further visits in Belmarsh prison in London by the Australian high commissioner to the UK, Stephen Smith. She dropped by the Guardian Australia office in the press gallery at Parliament House today and said it was \u201csignificant that it was the high commissioner and not just a consular official who visited Julian\u201d in prison last month: The day that the high commissioner visited, Julian was supposed to receive a visit from the top two representatives of Reporters Without Borders and they were rejected by the prison. It\u2019s clear that what Julian needs from the Australian government is diplomatic support. It\u2019s not a question about, you know, the administrative situation within the prison, it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s in prison in the first place. Julian has done nothing wrong. He shouldn\u2019t have spent a single day in prison. He has been accused of acts of journalism \u2013 and if journalism is a crime, then there are a bunch of criminals in this press gallery \u2026 I think the signals are very clear. The high commissioner visited Julian and he\u2019s going to visit him again. Julian Assange, an Australian citizen, remains in Belmarsh prison as he fights a US attempt to extradite him to face charges in connection with the publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, as well as diplomatic cables. Cruise passenger dies while swimming on Mystery Island Carnival Cruise Line has confirmed that a passenger has died while swimming on Mystery Island in Vanuatu, during an apparent medical episode. In a statement, a spokesperson said: Carnival Cruise Line is deeply saddened by the death of a guest on Mystery Island, following what appears to be a medical situation whilst swimming. Our care team are supporting the guest\u2019s family along with other guests during this difficult time. The Carnival Splendour cruise ship departed from Sydney on May 15 and is due to arrive back in Sydney tomorrow. Voice debate should look beyond party politics, MP says On the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, NSW Liberal senator Holly Hughes is asked about opposition leader Peter Dutton\u2019s comments in parliament yesterday that an Indigenous voice to parliament is Orwellian and would divide Australians. She said the debate was already leading to division: Noel Pearson in particular, every time he comes out and speaks about it, he accuses anyone who asks the question \u2013 not even, not someone who is saying they object to it \u2013 they\u2019re a racist, they\u2019re a Judas. Labor MP Josh Burns responded: I don\u2019t think we should loose sight in the political comings and goings. It is not about the Labor party, or the Labor government or the Liberal party, it is about what are we doing for the first Australians. Burns also pointed to Stan Grant\u2019s speech on Q+A from last night as an indication of how people should conduct themselves: On the topic on the way in which we engage in political debates, [Stan Grant] last night gave a pretty powerful reminder of the way in which we need to be conducting ourselves. [He] gave us a moment where we can reflect on how we talk about issues, and how we interact with each other with respect. I think it\u2019s incumbent on all of us to make sure we are elevating this debate and doing it respectfully. Burgess on the \u2018hive of spies\u2019 Asio chief Mike Burgess is being asked about his infamous comments about disrupting a \u201chive of spies\u201d, and why those spies were not prosecuted. Greens senator David Shoebridge wonders why there are not criminal prosecutions, for example, when there are plots to lure Australians overseas and kill them. Burgess said sometimes the most effective solution is removal, not prosecution: One way that spying can occur in this country is there would be people posted to this country under diplomatic cover, who actually are not diplomats \u2013 they are spies. And when we discover that, we call it out and we remove them from this country by letting their visa lapse [expelling them] from this country. The key thing in the case of the hive of spies was the most effective way of reducing that harm was to have them removed from the country quietly and effectively. The outcome was achieved. Shoebridge is doing his best to get Burgess to comment on this story about Daniel Duggan, but Burgess is not having a bar of it. The Nationals\u2019 member for Gippsland, Darren Chester, has a spray at the Victorian government\u2019s plan to phase out native forest logging shortly before question time. He said: In my 15 years as a member of parliament I\u2019ve never been more disgusted in a government decision than I am today. The Dan Andrews government has kicked every hardworking native timber industry family in the guts today and not one of those opposite has raised a single word of protest. People and wildlife die in poorly managed forests. Dan Andrews has a plan to shut down the native timber industry in 2024. It\u2019s a plan to kill country towns, it\u2019s a plan to kill wildlife and a plan to kill Australian jobs. This is a Dan-made disaster which will devastate our communities and take a generation to recover from \u2026 If the Greens are cheering you\u2019ve made the wrong decision. Police arrest man after stabbing in Airport West, Melbourne Victorian Police have arrested a man after a woman was stabbed at Airport West in Melbourne this afternoon. Investigators have been told a man attacked a woman at a business on Louis Street around 1.30pm. A 55-year-old woman sustained suspected stab wounds and was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries. Investigators located a 34-year-old Essendon man nearby who was then arrested. He is currently assisting police with their enquiries. A crime scene has been set up while police work to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident. Anyone who witnessed the incident or has information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report online. The minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, is in Papua New Guinea for the US-Pacific Islands Dialogue and has shared some images on social media from his visit. Many thanks to Amy for taking us through the morning! I\u2019ll be with you for the remainder of the day, let\u2019s get into it. Emily Wind will take you through the evening \u2013 the house will sit late to continue the referendum legislation debate, so expect some tired MPs tomorrow morning. Thank you to everyone who joined along with me today \u2013 it was long and you were all troopers and I could not get through QT without you. I will be back early tomorrow morning for the third day of Politics Live \u2013 until then, please, take care of you. Ax Anthony Albanese is about to head to Sydney (if he hasn\u2019t already) for his 6pm community event with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. About 20,000 people are expected to attend. Modi has spent the day holding meetings with business leaders. He will hold his official bilateral with Albanese tomorrow morning. Union says Victorian logging decision could cost hundreds of jobs The union for timber industry workers has blasted the Andrews government for ending native forest logging earlier than expected. In Tuesday\u2019s budget, the Andrews government revealed it would bring forward the end date of native logging to the start of next year rather than the end of the decade. It comes after court decisions which found the state-owned timber agency VicForests had not adequately protected endangered species. Michael O\u2019Connnor, national secretary of the CFMEU, said it was a decision \u201cdriven by Spring Street\u201d that failed to consult the industry. It\u2019s a shame that he [premier Daniel Andrews] only governs for Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. If you\u2019re in any other part of the state, you don\u2019t get a look in. O\u2019Connor said hundreds of jobs could be lost from the decision. \u2018Big step forward\u2019 in bringing leadbeater\u2019s possum back from brink A small update from environment estimates about a very small possum. Every estimates hearing for years, the Greens senator Janet Rice has asked the department what has happened to the overdue recovery plan for the leadbeater\u2019s possum. This question is particularly relevant today given one of the main threats to the critically endangered possum has been native forest logging in Victoria, which the Andrews government has announced will end in January. Debate over forestry led to a plan to prevent the extinction of the leadbeater\u2019s possum stalling for years. Environment officials have come prepared today with an answer to this question and say they are pleased to report the draft plan is finally ready and has gone to the threatened species scientific committee for their review. A \u201cvery big step forward\u201d, they say. Australian extremists are \u201cinspired\u201d by mass shootings overseas and neo-Nazi attempts to recruit people have been \u201camplified\u201d, but the terrorism threat is lower, Asio\u2019s Mike Burgess has told Senate estimates. But it still means it\u2019s possible. He also explained that far right groups were \u201csmarter\u201d and not advocating terror attacks publicly, so fewer of them were listed as terrorist groups. After questions about connections between anti-trans activists and neo-Nazis, Liberal senator Alex Antic wanted to know if Asio was aware of threats from \u201cviolent\u201d trans activists. Burgess said: Not from my perspective. There was a question on this during question time from Andrew Wilkie \u2013 but it won\u2019t be the last one. As the indexation date approaches, more and more people are pushing for it to be scrapped. Asio weighs \u2018threat\u2019 to voice referendum Spy chief Mike Burgess said Asio was keeping an eye on the upcoming voice referendum: We look at all major things and minor things in society that actually could potentially represent a threat to security. [The voice referendum] is a significant event. And we continually look at that situation. We have done a recent assessment where we look at the possible threat to the referendum at this stage. We are not seeing indications of people planning a terrorist attack as part of that. That\u2019s something that we constantly look at, noting the terrorism threat level is still probable. Separately, Burgess said the visible increase in neo-Nazi activity (which I covered in the post below) was because they were more \u201cemboldened\u201d and also trying to recruit people. \u201cTheir actions are awful but lawful,\u201d he said, but added: There\u2019s a small element of that group that do and may well take action to accelerate the downfall of society as they see it, but it may well be they\u2019re looking to build their base so they can improve their influence and engage through normal political discourse and have an influence to their satisfaction through other means, which of course has happened in history. Greens senator David Shoebridge is trying to draw Burgess out on a connection between anti-trans activists and neo Nazis, but not having much luck. So the ministry doesn\u2019t expand, but some of the responsibilities of ministers will be shared with existing assistant ministers (which is just a fancy way of saying parliamentary secretary) because existing workloads were too much. Ministry shifts announced Those ministry changes which were flagged in the Labor caucus meeting have been officially announced: Patrick Gorman MP will be appointed as parliamentary secretary to the minister for the public service, known as assistant minister for the public service. This is in addition to his current role of assistant minister to the prime minister. Dr Andrew Leigh MP will be appointed as parliamentary secretary to the minister for employment and workplace relations, known as assistant minister for employment. This is in addition to his current role of assistant minister for competition, charities and treasury. Dr Leigh will be appointed to administer the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations in addition to the Department of the Treasury. Senator Anthony Chisholm will continue as assistant minister for regional development, however, his appointment will change from parliamentary secretary to the minister for regional development, local government and territories to the parliamentary secretary to the minister for infrastructure, transport, regional development and local government. Senator Chisholm\u2019s appointment as assistant minister for education will not change. (cont from previous post) Smith and Farrell then engaged in a bit of a quarrel about Labor\u2019s record on successfully delivering referendums, Smith pointing to the pulled 2013 referendum on local government (when Albanese himself was local government minister) and noting that the last successful referendum from Labor was in 1946. \u201cIf PM Bob Hawke and PM Gough Whitlam couldn\u2019t deliver referendum outcomes for the Labor party and for their Labor governments, why does PM Albanese think that he should be able to?\u201d Smith said. \u201cGiven that he already has a track record of failing to deliver local government recognition?\u201d Farrell shot back: You\u2019ve fallen into the same trap as all of his critics, that is you constantly underestimate him. Can I give you a bit of advice, senator Smith? Please don\u2019t underestimate this man. Smith posed one final question, asking if the government would consider a Yes vote of 60% a success \u2013 noting that would mean 40% of people voted no. Committee chair Louise Pratt cut him off and moved to the next question before Farrell could properly answer. Farrell defends PM in referendum stoush Trade minister Don Farrell has given a strident defence of PM Anthony Albanese, telling a Liberal senator \u201cplease don\u2019t underestimate this man\u201d in a heated debate around the referendum. Liberal senator Dean Smith took the Australian Electoral Commission down a detailed line of questioning about the possible date of the referendum, asking the AEC to rule in or out certain dates the vote could possibly be held on. Knocking out school holidays, and Saturdays at the end of parliament weeks, Smith proposed that the only suitable dates for the referendum would be in mid-October or early November (coincidentally, we\u2019ve heard mid-October is most likely at this stage). Smith, at one stage, commented that most referendums start out with high support that is then eroded away, hypothesising Labor would want to hold this vote earlier rather than later. Farrell, the special minister of state, later rejected this analysis, claiming some referendums decades ago had bucked this trend, pointing to a referendum in 1977. Smith said: The world has changed considerably since 1977. (continued in next post) Asio chief warns on spy recruiting \u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to get sucked in,\u201d spy chief Mike Burgess says, warning Australians travelling overseas to be wary of spies trying to cultivate a relationship with them. Australian Harry Harding came forward last week saying he thought he was being groomed while working in China. Burgess, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation director general of security, declined to comment on that specific case but said Australians overseas in general \u201cneed to be concerned that they might be unwittingly drawn into unlawful acts in terms of providing information\u201d. He said: Remember, the spies don\u2019t always rock up to you and present themselves as: \u2018hey, I\u2019m a spy, I\u2019d like you to do this for me\u2019. In some cases, they may well do that, depending on the individual they\u2019re approaching. So people just need to be on the lookout for suspicious or unusual and persistent approaches, and [if someone asks you to] provide insights into something, or give [them] access to something, you might want to think about why they\u2019re asking you for that. He also said while Nazi symbolism was more visible, it had at one point comprised 50% of Asio\u2019s investigations, but was now back down to 30%. He gave this breakdown of national security threats: It is approximately 70% religiously motivated violent extremism, specifically Sunni extremism. The remainder, 30%, is ideologically motivated, violent extremism and most of that is nationalist and racist, violent extremism, which is sometimes also called far right or other kinds of descriptions [such as neo-Nazis]. It\u2019s a really extreme right wing. Nazis have been a thing in this country for a long time. Pesutto blasts Andrews government \u2018mismanagement\u2019 Victorian opposition leader John Pesutto says the state is paying the price of the \u201cmismanagement\u201d and \u201cincompetence\u201d of the Andrews government. Pesutto said no Victorian would be spared the pain of the budget, which focuses on repaying the state\u2019s record debt accumulated during the pandemic. Every Victorian will pay some part of the price for Labor\u2019s incompetence. Opposition treasurer spokesperson Brad Roswell slammed the decision to no longer exempting high-fee private schools from payroll. He equated it to creating a \u201chit list\u201d of private schools and said it would lead to higher fees for parents. S&amp;P Global ratings said today\u2019s budget showed the fiscal recovery \u201cwill be a slow and long process\u201d. The projected cash surplus by 2025 would be the first since 2019. Still, \u201c[d]espite some positive developments, Victoria\u2019s fiscal outlook remains weak compared with other Australian states\u201d, said Anthony Walker, an S&amp;P analyst. By 2024, we expect Victoria\u2019s gross debt as a proportion of revenues to be about 200% of operating revenues or three times more than it was at the start of the pandemic.\u201d Still today\u2019s budget provides \u201csome headroom\u201d for the state\u2019s \u2018AA\u2019 rating, implying it will be left alone for now. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that states and territory debt ratings won\u2019t stray too far from the federal government\u2019s level because ratings agencies assume Canberra will step in if any state\u2019s finances were really in a tailspin. Victoria\u2019s economy by numbers As Victoria accounts for about a quarter of the Australian economy, it\u2019s worth noting how that state is faring after the Andrews government\u2019s ninth budget landed today. (See the main story here and winners and losers here, by Benita Kolovos and Adeshola Ore.) For one thing, Victoria\u2019s economic performance has been lagging the nation lately, with growth (as measured by gross state product) at 2.75% for the current year, versus national GDP expansion of 3.25%. From here on, the trajectories should be similar, according to forecasts in the federal and state budgets. The state\u2019s consumer inflation rate will end this fiscal year at 7%, vs a national average of 6%. Price rises, though, are projected to slow at a similar rate for Victoria and the nation, reaching 4.25% and 3.25%, respectively, by June 2024. After that, the CPI will also coalesce. Victoria\u2019s jobless rate (3.9% in April vs 3.7% nationally) will generally be higher than the national average for most of the coming years (with the exception of 2024-25). By 2026-27, the unemployment rate will be 4.75%, notably higher than the national average of 4.25% then, at least according to the budgets\u2019 forecasts. Ratings agencies, though, are interested in Victoria\u2019s debt path as it absorbs the state\u2019s big build program even if some project delays or cancellation. Anthony Albanese takes a dixer on how the government is making Australia better and then ends question time. I think we have all had enough today. Bridget Archer asks Stephen Jones (the assistant treasurer): The Westpac consumer sentiment index reveals some 60% of the falling consumer sentiment in May is attributed to the federal budget. Middle Australia is hurting. Why does Labor keep making it worse? Jones: We\u2019re proud of the budget we delivered 10 days ago, a budget that delivers for all, and on election commitments, that ensures that with a hard head we\u2019re able to deliver in 12 months what this mob over here couldn\u2019t deliver in nine long years. That is, a budget which is bringing the finances back under control. Because we did bring the finances back under control, something that they promised to do for over eight years but couldn\u2019t deliver on. We\u2019re able to be a budget that also has a big heart. A big heart to ensure that we can fix the mess that they left us on Medicare, because when we came into government, Medicare had been flogged to within an inch of its life. We are tripling the payments for bulk billing to ensure that those who most need it are able to get to see a doctor. We\u2019re making medicines more affordable. We\u2019re making childcare more affordable. As the minister for aged care has just demonstrated in a master class of how to respond to the ridiculousness from those opposite, we are ensuring that not only are residents in aged care getting the treatment that they need, but the people who look after them are getting the pay that they deserve. Step after step after step, the budget that we have delivered is ensuring we\u2019re delivering on our promises, building more sustainable finances, but also building a fairer Australia. It\u2019s something that mob on that side couldn\u2019t do in eight tawdry long years. Annnnd Michael Sukkar is booted out of the chamber under 94A. Seems like the Queenslanders are not having it at all today. Wells: I agree the whole of Australia wants us to fix aged care. I agree the whole of Australia went to the election last year and voted for a government to take the aged care crisis seriously. I agree the whole of Australia considered the two offerings from each of the two parties of government and said: we trust Labor to address this crisis and to try to lift the standard of aged care in this country. Having had 15 long months with the final report of the royal commission into aged care, having chosen to address only nine of 148 recommendations, the opposition raises the 24/7 nursing policy \u2013 they don\u2019t have a stance on a 24/7 policy. They don\u2019t have a position on 24/7 nurses\u2026 They didn\u2019t fund it or roll it out, address the workforce crisis that formed on their watch. I\u2019ve been addressing a workforce crisis that stems from 2017, $2.5 billion worth of funding cuts that I chose to make that set in place a rolling crisis of neglect, addressed by a royal commission and even now they walk into this chamber and say, oh, we see you are urgently acting to address the crisis. How dare you do it so quickly? How dare you act so quickly, we\u2019re worried it\u2019s too fast. Unbelievable. Wells continues: A workforce crisis formed on their watch that has taken 12 months to address through working on migration settings with the minister for immigration, for home affairs, for skills, for education, for health, the prime minister, the treasurer. Every single minister has had to spend time cleaning up their mess, to address the crisis in aged care. They seriously walked in today to say you\u2019re doing it too fast, you\u2019re cleaning up the mess too quickly. How dare you try to address a crisis in an urgent manner. Unbelievable. Yet, here we are after 12 months, with them having learned nothing. Melissa Price tries to make a point of order on relevance but she underestimates just how annoyed Anika Wells actually is with this question. Former Morrison minster Melissa Price wants to know from aged care minister Anika Wells: Already 23 aged care homes have closed under this government, compared to 300 opening under the former Coalition government. The Albanese government decision to [bring forward] the royal commission\u2019s recommendations has imposed rigid constraints on the sector. Will the government now make a commitment to expanding the exemption criteria until the current workforce crisis has been addressed? (The Tveeder transcription changes aged care minister to the menace of aged care, which shows AI is alive to the vibe of Price\u2019s question.) Wells is not having it today: I cannot believe those opposite, of all weeks, would choose this week to try and lecture the government on management and funding of the aged care system. And to suggest, to dare criticise us for trying to pull every single lever we have at our disposal to try and lift the standard of aged care as quickly as humanly possible. To walk into this chamber and criticise us for trying to take that action to lift the standard of care for residents is unfathomable, that they have learned nothing after neglecting the sector for nine long years, to walk in now and criticise the people left cleaning up their mess. Independent MP Zali Steggall also asks about the seriousness of this government acting on climate, given coal mines are still being approved contrary to science, and Anthony Albanese gives pretty much what is the rote answer \u2013 the government is serious about climate action and is investing in renewables to make the transition. Offsets for habitat destruction in focus Over in the estimates hearing for the environment department, the independent senator David Pocock has been asking officials to provide a clear answer about whether the government\u2019s proposed nature market will allow for the purchase of biodiversity certificates to be used as offsets for habitat destruction. The answer to that question is yes. Officials are going to great lengths to emphasise that using the market for offsetting won\u2019t be allowed to occur until a new national standard for offsetting has been legislated through reforms to Australia\u2019s national environmental laws. The assistant minister for climate change and energy, Jenny McAllister, says: Certificates could be used as offsets if they comply with the offsets standard. The offsets standard is yet to be developed and will be subject to significant consultation It is not necessarily the case that certificates will meet that standard. And they are separate benchmarks if you will. Some may be certificates that will be established for one purpose, but in another where an entity is seeking to meet an offset standard is a separate test. Pocock asks if it is the case that there will be more demand for offsets under the scheme than there will be from companies voluntarily purchasing certificates in the market. The department says it doesn\u2019t have an answer to that. Julie Collins answers Michael Sukkar\u2019s question with what the Albanese government is doing in the housing space and finishes with: We want this fund to get through the Senate and every day of delay is at the fault of those in your party and of the Greens party. These are homes for people who need it most. These homes for women and children escaping family violence. Homes for older women at risk of hopelessness. Homes for our veterans that are at risk of homelessness. We want to get more homes on the ground more quickly and you were standing the way of that*. We are about to go [announce] our national housing homelessness plan. The other side [need to] to get out of the way when it comes to the housing Australia Future Fund. We have a comprehensive ambitious plan. Being supported by every state territory housing minister. Being supported by the advocate bodies. Supported by the HIA. By the Master builders Association. Our Housing Australia Future Fund has been supported by everyone, except for those opposite. It is being supported because it is a good idea to get more investment into housing but across the country. *I understand that this is designed to pull at the heart strings and to try and get public pressure to build, but people should not be used as pawns in political stand offs by any side. If the government wanted to get things moving for these people, it could compromise to get the Greens support. It works both ways. The Liberal MP for Deakin, Michael Sukkar, continues the \u201cbig Australia\u201d scare campaign with: The government\u2019s own budget papers say a further 1.5 million people will come to Australia over five years. But Labor\u2019s half-baked Australia Future Fund will only provide 30,000 homes over that same five-year period. Where will the other 1.47 million people live? OK. The Coalition is against the fund and has voted against it. First, because it was inflationary, and now because it doesn\u2019t provide enough homes. So bit of a contradiction there. Two \u2013 temporary migration was forecast to be higher under the Coalition\u2019s budget papers. And the reason was the same: because there has been a bounce after the borders re-opened \u2013 people left Australia and didn\u2019t come back in. Three \u2013 not all temporary migrants live in standalone houses. International students tend to live in student accomodation, backpackers in backpacker accomodation. Four \u2013 slams head on desk. Victorian Labor is \u2018hurting people\u2019, Greens say Greens finance spokesperson Sam Hibbins is speaking outside parliament post-budget: Everyday Victorians, who are already struggling, are going to be worse off under this budget. Despite there being a cost of living crisis, despite housing affordability being out of control, Labor \u2013 instead of choosing to help people in need \u2013 are actually hurting people. While supportive of the tax measures introduced, Hibbins is disappointed that in the pursuit of a surplus the government is making public sector cuts and not providing renters and others doing it tough with support: What we took to this budget was to tax profiteering corporations in order to fund helping people in need, to address the big challenges like the housing crisis, like the cost of living crisis. They\u2019ve only done half the job \u2013 and make no mistake, should the budget get back into surplus, it will be off the back of workers. Victorian tenants \u2018could face rent increases\u2019 under budget The property council is warning Victorians tenants could face rental hikes due to a budget measure that will increase land taxes for investors. Under the state budget, handed down on Tuesday afternoon, property investors will face additional land tax charges. Cath Evans, Victoria executive director of the property council, said the changes would mean some investors would pay land tax for the first time. But she backed the abolishment of stamp duty for commercial and industrial properties in favour of an annual land tax. Let\u2019s go back to the Victorian budget while Brendan O\u2019Connor takes a dixer on fee-free tafe (more than 150,000 people having taken it up so far, as we reported earlier today) Industry groups have blasted the Andrews government for hitting large businesses with a new levy to help pay back record debt accumulated during the pandemic. Paul Guerra, chief executive of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the government was planning to use big businesses and property owners \u201cas an ATM.\u201d Peak industry body, Australian Industry Group, said businesses could look to invest internationally or in other states over Victoria. Tim Piper, Victorian head of the body, said the budget lacks \u201cimagination and would be troubling for many businesses. Business has been used as a cash cow and businesses bearing the burden for a lot of the costs that are being imposed on the Victorian community at the moment. Clare continues: More generally, HECS helped millions and millions of Australians get to university and get a university degree. When I was a little kid, only about 7% of Australians had a university degree. When most of us were knee high to a grasshopper, very few Australians had a university degree. We are a different country today. Almost one in two Australians in their 30s has a university degree and a big part of that is because of HECS, which helped to fund and increase in the number of students going to university. That\u2019s not true everywhere. In the member\u2019s electorate, it\u2019s only 30%. Where I grew up in Cabramatta, it\u2019s about the same. In the member for McMahon only 25% in their 30s have a university degree. In the Treasurer\u2019s electorate, it\u2019s lower still, only about 19%, lower in the bush. It\u2019s an order of magnitude less for our Indigenous brothers and sisters, only 7% have a university degree. This is what we\u2019ve got to fix. The cost of university degrees is important, the cost of living is important, but the cost of those kids from those communities missing out is important, too. This is what we\u2019ve got to fix. This at its core is what the Universities Accord will be all about. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie wants to know from Jason Clare: Minister, you would recall last year I challenged you about sky-rocketing HECS-HELP indexation and you committed to have the universities Accord Panel look at it. Ten months later charges are set to rise further by a record.1%. Minister m the circumstances, will you freeze the indexation, at left until the Universities Accord final report is delivered in September? Clare says: I made a commitment to get the accord team to look at that and they\u2019re doing that. The accord team will report at the end of June with its interim report and provide a final report to me at the end of December. The short answer to your question is no. We have made no change to HECS in the budget. What we\u2019ve done is provide extra support to students through an increase in Youth Allowance and AusStudy and an increase in rental assistance, which will help a lot of students with the cost of living. Minister for employment says Labor determined to close labour unequal pay loophole There is a dixer about same job same pay to Tony Burke, which gives the Liberal MP Andrew Wallace an opportunity to ask \u201cWhy do you hate subbies, Burkie\u201d across the chamber. A reminder that the base pay to be a politician is over $212,000. Burke: There was a headline there today and it began with the words \u2018Union admits ...\u2019 I thought oh no, when you see the word \u2018admits\u2019, this will be trouble. \u2018Admits Labor policy aims to drive up pay\u2019. They\u2019ve got us. Labor policy aims to drive up pay. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re determined to close the labour loophole and it\u2019s exactly why those opposite are so determined to key the loophole. They\u2019ve never seen a tax loophole that they didn\u2019t want to keep forever and never seen a loophole that drives down wages that they didn\u2019t want to defend just as earn evidently. The manager of opposition business described this as a made-up issue. That\u2019s his description for it. Well, it\u2019s not a made-up issue if you are a casual working side by side being paid less. It\u2019s not a made-up issue for two workers with the same expertise, on the same job, with the same classification, one being paid less than the other. For them it\u2019s not a made-up issue. For the mine works dealing with this it\u2019s not a made-up issue. For the government that\u2019s determined to act, this is a loophole we\u2019re determined to close. PM says no cuts to Melbourne airport rail line in budget papers The Liberal MP for Flinders, Zoe McKenzie, wants to know: In the May budget the government made further cuts to infrastructure and referred hundreds of congestion busting projects to yet another infrastructure review. Yet the government\u2019s own budget papers say a further 1.5 million people will come to Australia over five years. Why is this government putting at risk projects like the Melbourne airport rail line, where work is now halted? (We all know the facts about the 1.5m number right? I don\u2019t need to post it again?) Anthony Albanese: I\u2019m very pleased to get a question about infrastructure from the member for Flinders. She has had a look at the budget papers, there are no cuts in the budget papers. The dollars remain attached. You have a look at the budget papers and whoever gave you that question, I think the tactics committee need to reconsider their strategy, as the Treasurer said \u2013 the next level from asking me questions about infrastructure will be me questions about South Sydney Rugby league football club. (The joke being it\u2019s two topics Albanese knows a lot about.) There is a back and forth over whether Madeleine King was reading from a document as she gave her dixer answer or not and whether she should table it if she was. Which I am absolutely sure voters really care about. There is a dixer on the climate tech pact signed between the US and Australia, but you would be better off reading this from Daniel Hurst: Anthony Albanese doesn\u2019t read out Daniel Hurst\u2019s factcheck. He answers by referring to some of the decisions made under the Coalition, including the Leppington triangle deal. Paul Fletcher is not happy: The question is relevance, about the motorway, not about local government and projects. I would have thought this PM of all people should know the difference between local infrastructure and major road and rail. Albanese says the Labor government is actually funding projects, while the Coalition didn\u2019t. Fact checking the Coalition on their \u20181.5 million over 5 years\u2019 immigration attack line (again) Paul Fletcher wants to know: In the May Budget, the government made cuts to infrastructure and record hundreds of congested busting project to get another review. But the budget papers show a further 1.5 million people* will come to Australia over five years. Why is this government putting [off] projects like upgrades to the M5 Motorway and the Western Sydney Airport Metrorail?\u201d *taps the fact check sign* Net overseas migration is forecast to be 400,000 in 2022-23, followed by 315,000 the next year and 260,000 in each of the following three years. The Coalition has added these together to come up with the \u201c1.5 million immigrants\u201d figure. The budget papers explain that these figures are part of a post-pandemic catch-up and are driven by \u201ca rapid recovery in the stock of international students, skilled temporary visa holders and working holiday makers\u201d. At the same time, the budget says, \u201cvery low temporary migrant arrivals during the pandemic now means fewer departures \u2013 those who did not arrive cannot now leave\u201d: The budget explains: The elevated forecast for net overseas migration in 2023\u201324 is largely driven by fewer temporary migrants departing Australia than usual, rather than a greater number of people arriving. Total net overseas migration \u201cis not expected to catch up to the level forecast prior to the pandemic until 2029\u201330\u201d and the total population is still expected to be 750,000 people smaller in June 2031 compared with pre-pandemic forecasts. Marles argues Coalition culture made \u2018grand defence announcements on the basis of absolutely nothing\u2019 The defence minister, Richard Marles, uses a dixer to run through his greatest hits on the former Coalition government over defence policy. He argues it has been \u201ca transformational 12 months for our nation\u2019s security\u201d. He contends Australia had been \u201cdrifting through a sea of broken relationships\u201d under the former government, but the Albanese government had improved Australia\u2019s standing in the world, including with allies while also starting the process of stabilising the relationship with China. Marles says there was a culture under the former government of \u201cgrand defence announcements on the basis of absolutely nothing\u201d. The opposition leader and former defence minister, Peter Dutton, appears to have been riled by this line of attack. He gets up to say \u201cit would be relevant\u201d to mention Aukus, which was initiated under the Coalition. Regional development minister confirms freight and recovery program will continue The former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack, known internationally as a kava ambassador, has a question for Kristy McBain, the minister for regional development: Will the minister guarantee the life-saving freight and recovery program will remain in existence? McBain: Thank you, Mr Speaker. Very important question. Simple answer, yes. Tanya Plibersek runs through the laundry list of what she says Labor is doing to protect the environment, but it doesn\u2019t answer the question about approving new coal mines. Greens response to Victorian budget The Victorian Greens say struggling households have been left behind in the Andrews government\u2019s state budget handed down on Tuesday. The budget focuses on repaying the state\u2019s record debt accumulated during Covid by introducing a 10-year levy on big businesses. Victorians with an investment property will also be hit with a new tax and the government will slash the state\u2019s public service jobs by as many as 4,000 roles. But there is minimal cost-of-living relief for Victorians. Samantha Ratnam, leader of the Victorian Greens said the Andrews government said the government had failed to fix the state\u2019s revenue problems. Short-term measures won\u2019t fix the housing crisis. In fact, this Labor government is funnelling four times more into the racing industry than new spending on people in housing stress or experiencing homelessness. Labor response to Greens question on climate change is to blame the Greens The Greens MP for Ryan, Elizabeth Watson-Brown asks Tanya Plibersek: \u2026 you approved a new export coal mine in Queensland that would reportedly produce 500,000 tons of coal year and destroy [native] habitat. Why is Labor approving new coal mines in the middle of the climate emergency and how many more coal and gas projects will you approve in the coming months? Plibersek opens with: I want to say how proud I am to be part of a government acting on climate change. The first government to take serious action on climate change and it has been really instructive watching those of the crossbench line up with the Liberals and Nationals all too often to prevent and delay that action. The Guardian\u2019s Paul Karp hears the Greens leader Adam Bandt say: \u201cAre you serious?! Are you absolutely serious?!\u201d in response. So it\u2019s got off to a great start. Albanese\u2019s response to \u2018word salad\u2019 question from opposition Here is what Anthony Albanese said in response. Annotations in brackets by me: Mr Speaker, that mess of a question was messier than the last government. They workshop these things in a meeting and come out and put it in writing. That word salad that I\u2019m asked about. [There are a bunch of interjections] To return to the issue of middle Australia: our commitments that we made. We promised that 1.2 million families would pay less for childcare. Are we delivering that? We promised Australians would pay less for their medicines. Are we delivering that? [the caucus says \u2018yes\u2019 on cue] We promised to boost bulk billing, and to strengthen Medicare, are we delivering that? [you know the drill] We promised to rebuild manufacturing and establish a National Reconstruction Fund. Are we delivering that? [and again] We promised a royal commission on robodebt and, boy, have we delivered that. We promised to increase the minimum wage. Was that delivered? [yes again] We promised to look after aged care workers, was that delivered? [sigh] We promised to lift wages, was that delivered? [bigger sigh] We promised to have climate change targets of 43% by 2030, and net zero by 2050. Was that delivered? [Please make it stop] We promised to have a safeguard mechanism was that delivered? [cries under the desk] The truth is we on this side did the hard work in opposition to develop policy, to implement in government. Policies deliberately aimed at middle Australia, to make a difference after the wreck that we replaced, who were more concerned with themselves and ever since the election, are more concerned with themselves still. The opposition leader, of course, has a meeting tomorrow. He may well not be here at 2:00. I look forward to that. Fact-checking Sussan Ley and the Coalition on 1.5 million people immigrating over the next five years Sussan Ley is up with the next non-government question and ooohhh boy. The words \u2018middle Australia\u2019 somehow made it into the budget talking points last week but the problem is they were forgotten from the budget itself. The word infrastructure didn\u2019t even make it into the talking points, let alone the Treasurer\u2019s speech. Now the PM is going to bring in a further 1.5 million people over five years and at the same time [is] cutting infrastructure and raising taxes. Middle Australia is hurting and why does Labor keep making it worse? Before we get to Anthony Albanese\u2019s answer, here is Guardian Australia reporter Daniel Hurst\u2019s fact check on the \u201c1.5m people over five years\u201dtalking point the Coalition has been using (Dan had it ready to go because it has got a bit of a workout since the budget was handed down). Dan: The budget doesn\u2019t set this as a target or a policy as such \u2013 it outlines forecasts for \u201cnet overseas migration\u201d. Net overseas migration is forecast to be 400,000 in 2022-23, followed by 315,000 the next year and 260,000 in each of the following three years. The Coalition has added these together to come up with the \u201c1.5 million immigrants\u201d figure. The budget papers explain that these figures are part of a post-pandemic catch-up and are driven by \u201ca rapid recovery in the stock of international students, skilled temporary visa holders and working holiday makers\u201d. At the same time, the budget says, \u201cvery low temporary migrant arrivals during the pandemic now means fewer departures \u2013 those who did not arrive cannot now leave\u201d: The budget explains: The elevated forecast for net overseas migration in 2023\u201324 is largely driven by fewer temporary migrants departing Australia than usual, rather than a greater number of people arriving. Total net overseas migration \u201cis not expected to catch up to the level forecast prior to the pandemic until 2029\u201330\u201d and the total population is still expected to be 750,000 people smaller in June 2031 compared with pre-pandemic forecasts. The Coalition\u2019s shadow ministry bench is looking a little bare this QT \u2013 Angus Taylor, Dan Tehan and Jason Wood have not made it into the chamber as yet. Social services industry responds to Victorian budget Victoria\u2019s peak social services body says the state budget has delivered a \u201cmixed bag\u201d but helps shield struggling households from tough decisions. Emma King, head of the Victorian council of social services, said it was a tough budget, pointing to cuts to employment services and energy concessions. But she pointed to the funding injections for helping teenagers at risk of dropping out of schools and reducing Aboriginal children in out-of-home care as positive measures. While we\u2019re repaying the Covid debt, this [budget is] largely sparing vulnerable Victorians. The first dixer (a government MP asking a government minister a question, which is usually written by the either the minister\u2019s office or the tactics committee) is on the Indian prime minister Modi\u2019s visit. Everyone loves Modi is the general vibe of Albanese\u2019s answer. Question time is about to begin \u2013 but first we have to get through the airing of the grievances/MP amateur stand up known as the 90-second statements. \u2026 And we are now straight into it with the latest version of \u201cwhy does (middle) Australia always suffer under a Labor government\u201d which is the Coalition\u2019s latest obsession. Anthony Albanese reads through the usual laundry list: I am asked about middle Australia. It cares about the wages. Wages are increasing under this government. Middle Australia cares about their kids getting access to cheaper childcare. I tell you what middle Australia cares about, particularly in the regions, they care about manufacturing jobs, that\u2019s what middle Australia cares about. I tell you what middle Australia cares about, they want to go to the doctor for free and receive bulk billing and 11 million Australians in middle Australia will be able to do that as a result of this government\u2019s actions. I tell you what middle Australia cares about, they want to pay less for medicines and under our government they will. Middle Australia cares about \u2013 when it comes to aged care workers, 250,000 will receive a pay increase. That\u2019s what middle Australia cares about. They [the Coalition] are so out of touch, they only talk to each other about themselves \u2013 they should get out there and talk to middle Australia about what their concerns are. Perhaps it was better Japan\u2019s PM Fumio Kishida isn\u2019t visiting Australia this week as there might be a few awkward hydrogen conversations. Back in April, we flagged here that Japan\u2019s $500m plan to use Victorian brown coal to produce hydrogen had some big challenges to clear. Not least of them was a reluctance by the Japanese consortium to secure offtake agreements that would last more than about a couple of years. In other words, after a short period they could walk away and source the hydrogen from somewhere else, leaving Victorians to find new customers (and also deal with the captured carbon emissions). The 2023-24 federal budget dealt one blow to the plans by not offering any more money to the $50m the commonwealth had already tipped in. Guardian Australia understands the debate within the Victorian government was quite willing, with the treasurer, Tim Pallas (with encouragement from media outlets such as the AFR), the main proponent for tipping in more funds. The consortium had hoped the feds and Vics would double their $100m subsidy. Anyway, the 2023-24 Victorian budget had allocated zero money for the project, which we have to assume puts it literally on the back burner. Government has spent over $2.6bn in disaster recovery payments over last year The government has paid out more than $2.6bn for natural disaster recovery in the past year, the emergency management minister, Murray Watt, has told Senate estimates. That includes about $1.5bn in disaster recovery payments and allowances for individuals. Watt said: This is money paid directly into the pockets of people doing it tough as a result of a disaster. We\u2019ve also paid out more than $590m for projects that build community resilience through commonwealth programs. OK, we are now less than 20 minutes away from the next question time, so go grab what you need to get through the next hour and a bit. I won\u2019t judge. The head of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Paul Guerra, says the state government\u2019s budget \u2013 which includes a \u201cCovid debt repayment\u201d levy for big business \u2013 will \u201cdirectly impact jobs and investment\u201d. He says in a statement: The government says this is the plan to pay off the \u2018COVID credit card debt\u2019 but they\u2019re doing that by using medium to large businesses and property owners as an ATM over the next 10 years. It\u2019s certainly a departure from the \u2018all in it together\u2019 approach taken throughout the pandemic and this will directly impact jobs and investment in Victoria. There are some positive initiatives including funding for manufacturing, major events, exports, renewable energy and training. The Victorian Chamber also welcomes the stamp duty reform and the payroll tax offsets for smaller enterprises, but this Budget will be remembered for job cuts and tax hikes. Government denies Chinese media reports Australia opposes Taiwanese membership to regional trade agreement The Australian government says it has not shifted position on a major regional trade pact, after a report today claimed that the trade minister, Don Farrell, had told his Chinese counterpart that Australia did not support Taiwan\u2019s membership. Both China and Taiwan \u2013 the self-governed democracy that Beijing claims as a wayward province \u2013 are seeking to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The Australian government\u2019s longstanding position is that its initial focus is on the UK\u2019s entry to the CPTPP, and that any other applicants would need to demonstrate high standards. That is a signal that, at a minimum, Beijing must remove trade impediments on a range of Australian export sectors before it could even be considered. Any new entrants must also be accepted unanimously by all existing CPTPP members, which is seen as a high barrier to entry. The issue is back in the spotlight because the South China Morning Post today quoted anonymous sources as saying that Beijing had sought \u201ca clear commitment from Australia, preferably public\u201d that Canberra would support China\u2019s bid to join the CPTPP and \u201cdeny Taiwan\u2019s membership\u201d during Farrell\u2019s trip to Beijing earlier this month. The most contentious element of the SCMP report is the claim that Farrell told Beijing that Australia \u201cdid not support the Taiwanese membership\u201d. Guardian Australia understands the CPTPP was raised by the Chinese side during the meeting, and that Beijing reiterated its publicly stated opposition to Taiwan acceding to the deal. The Chinese government also requested that China be the next applicant considered for entry to the CPTPP. But a source said today that Farrell had not made any comments about Taiwan. Farrell issued a statement today regarding his recent meeting in Beijing with the Chinese commerce minister Wang Wentao. Farrell said: On the matter of CPTPP accessions, I indicated that the membership was currently focussed on finalising the United Kingdom\u2019s accession. I reiterated that any economy that sought to accede to the CPTPP must have a demonstrated track record of complying with trade agreements. I also indicated that Australia would work with the CPTPP membership to consider all accession applications on a consensus basis. AEC says guidance on referendum pamphlet submissions to be sent to politicians next week The AEC says it is working with politicians to prepare the referendum pamphlet, which will go to all households. Commissioner Tom Rogers told Senate estimates that the AEC would write to all politicians in the next week with information about the process, which would include guidance on points like fonts and formatting. Answering technical questions about how the formatting will need to be done, and what the AEC will do, Rogers said: \u201cwhatever you give us is going in that booklet\u201d. The pamphlet will be delivered to all homes, and be available online plus at polling places. The pamphlet will be translated into a number of languages, including dozens of Indigenous languages. For some languages which are oral-only, the AEC is working on audio files to share the info in the pamphlet. Monique Ryan welcomes decision to end native logging by end of 2023 Independent Kooyong MP Dr Monique Ryan has also welcomed the decision by the Victorian government to bring forward the end to native forest logging to the end of this year, congratulating \u201cthe many volunteers, environmental organisations, community groups, and political candidates who have worked tirelessly for many years to achieve this end\u201d: Together, we have saved our beautiful Victorian native forests. Victoria\u2019s native forests are unlike any other. They have historic beauty, and hold an extraordinary diversity of fungi, plant and animal life. According to the experts, the decision to end native forest logging six years earlier than planned is akin to preventing the carbon emissions from 730,000 cars every year. Preserving these carbon stores is a vital part of our efforts to move to a strong, clean economy of the future. Ryan is also a fan of the $200m transition package for workers. Success has many fathers \u2013 or, in this instance, fathers and mothers. Among the many voices who\u2019ve called for this change in recent years are the two recent state independent candidates from my own community \u2013 Sophie Torney of Kew, and Melissa Lowe, from Hawthorn. \u2026 Today is a really happy day for all Victorians who care for our forests, our environment, and our climate. We\u2019ll keep working together to protect these assets \u2013 for ourselves and for our children. For those who just want the numbers on the Victorian budget: Infrastructure department says it has had no contact with Larrakia people over Middle Arm hub [continued from previous post] The department also says it has had no contact with the Larrakia people who have raised concerns about the project and says that responsibility and any commentary about what industries would use the site lies with the Northern Territory government. The independent senator David Pocock asks whether the department or ministers met with anyone on the federal lobbyist register about the project and where the change in branding for the development to a \u201csustainable\u201d precinct came from. Both of those questions were taken on notice. Greens and independents question process behind NT\u2019s Middle Arm development In an estimates hearing for the infrastructure department today, Greens and independent senators have been asking what process was used before the government decided it would take a $1.5bn equity stake in the Northern Territory\u2019s proposed Middle Arm development. Guardian Australia has reported on concerns about the project\u2019s potential impacts on Larrakia cultural heritage and a document sent to the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, that states the project is seen as a \u201ckey enabler\u201d for the export of Beetaloo gas. Both major parties committed to funding the project before the last federal election but officials today have been keen to emphasise the decision was made through a cabinet process by the previous government and in the Albanese government\u2019s October budget \u201cthat $1.5bn was not removed\u201d. The Greens senator Penny Allman-Payne asks: Would it be fair to say there hasn\u2019t been a substantive process that has been gone through in the department? The department\u2019s response is not particularly illuminating. I think it would be better to say we provided advice into a cabinet for that process that we can\u2019t speak to. Further details on Victorian budget A little bit more from the Victorian budget; Payroll tax exemptions will also be removed for about 110 high-fee private schools, which will raise $348m in the 2023/24 financial year. The government will also double the levy paid by overseas property investors to 4%, and lift betting taxes from 10% to 15% of wagering revenue, in line with New South Wales. The government has also identified $2.1bn in savings over four years, including reducing the public service by 3,000-4,000 workers \u2013 described as a return to \u201cpre-pandemic levels\u201d \u2013 and scaling back the use of labour hire and consultancy firms. The budget, however, has allocated funding to every election commitment made during the November election campaign. As already reported, it also brings forward the end date to native timber logging in the state from 2030 to 2024. Albanese to party room: there\u2019s \u2018plenty of work ahead for us\u2019 The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, addressed Labor caucus earlier today, one year on from when he and four colleagues were sworn in as ministers of the new government. Albanese said: We should never take for granted that we have the opportunity to be in government. As long as we stay disciplined, united and focused we can stay in this room. People see us as an adult government with a sense of purpose, that is disciplined, and doing its job ... We\u2019ve been determined to deliver on our commitments. The key thing people remember from the budget is its tripling of bulk billing incentives. Albanese referred to Labor\u2019s housing policies, listing elements including the increase in rental assistance, and the housing Australia future fund \u201cwhich the Coalition and the Greens are holding back\u201d. Albanese paid tribute to Penny Wong and Pat Conroy for their international work re-engaging with the Pacific, particularly on climate change. He said \u201caction on climate change is the entry fee for credibility at international meetings\u201d. Albanese referred to the visit by the Indian prime minister Modi, and the US president, Joe Biden, needing to stay home due to debt ceiling issues. While unfortunate, Albanese said there was a \u201cdomestic and international interest in avoiding a US default\u201d. Albaese said he was proud of where Labor up to but not complacent. \u201cThere\u2019s no hubris, plenty of work ahead of us,\u201d he said. Victorian treasurer introduces new levies to help pay down \u2018Covid debt\u2019 Victoria\u2019s treasurer, Tim Pallas, has handed down his ninth budget in parliament, which introduces two new levies that are expected to raise $8.6bn over the next four years, in an effort to pay down the state\u2019s $31.5bn of \u201cCovid debt\u201d. From July, businesses that pay more than $10m in wages nationally \u2013 5% of the state\u2019s employers \u2013 will pay a \u201cCovid debt levy\u201d via a payroll tax surcharge of 0.5% for their Victorian employees. Businesses with national payrolls above $100m pay a 1% surcharge. From January 2024, Victorians who pay a land tax will be hit with an additional annual fee of $500 for total landholdings worth between $50,000 and 100,000 and $975 for land worth between $100,000 and $300,000. For most land worth more than $300,000, an additional hike of 0.1% of total land values will be charged. Family homes will be exempt from the changes, which Pallas said will affect 860,000 landowners who will pay an average of $1,300 in additional taxes annually. He has told parliament: We know some did better out of the pandemic than others - and it\u2019s only fair that those that did well contribute to the repayment effort ... business profits are up 24% over the past three years compared with the previous three. Land values have increased 84% in the past 10 years. We\u2019ve structured the repayment plan in a way that\u2019s responsible and proportionate to those with an ability to pay. Emergency management agency head agrees climate change is causing overlapping fire seasons Climate change means the northern and southern hemisphere fire seasons are increasingly overlapping, Senate estimates has heard. The Greens senator Nick McKim asked the National Emergency Management Agency about the ongoing availability of resources to tackle fires, particularly in remote areas of Tasmania. Australia currently leases some helicopters from countries in the northern hemisphere. McKim asked NEMA\u2019s commissioner, Brendan Moon, if he accepted that the higher fire risk periods between the northern and southern hemispheres were starting to overlap \u201cto a greater degree than they did previously as a result of global warming\u201d. He responded: There\u2019s absolutely no doubt that there\u2019s an overlap there, and we\u2019re exploring what that means. Queensland removes bill that stopped UN officials from visiting detention facilities last year The Queensland government has passed a bill to remove legislative barriers that prohibited UN officials from visiting places of detention during their visit to Australia last year. A UN anti-torture subcommittee suspended its tour of Australian detention facilities in October after Guardian Australia revealed Queensland refused access to some mental health facilities that hold people charged with crimes, while NSW blocked inspectors from entering all of its detention facilities. The former attorney general Shannon Fentiman said in parliament in March the bill was \u201canother commitment ... to uphold human rights in Queensland\u201d. It recognises that the observance of human rights is the most effective and safe way to manage custodial environments. Fentiman said access to the facilities had been limited to preserve people\u2019s \u201csafety and privacy\u201d but the subcommittee was offered the opportunity to interview staff offsite and request information before their arrival. NSW now remains the only Australian jurisdiction to refuse entry to inspectors. While the housing future fund debate continues between Labor and the Greens, this was a particularly awkward moment for Labor\u2019s Higgins MP, Dr Michelle Ananda-Rajah, last night on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A. AEC outlines yes and no essay guidelines for voice referendum pamphlets (Continued from previous post) The first questions, from the shadow special minister of state, Jane Hume, was on the official information pamphlets - which include essays written by politicians who vote yes and no in parliament. Rogers said if the AEC doesn\u2019t receive one of the essays on time (within the 28-day window), the pamphlet will go out with only one case \u2013 while if an essay arrives without meeting the guidelines (ie if it was over 2,000 words) it would be rejected \u201cin its entirety\u201d. Laws governing the referendum do not state what process should be used to write the essays, but Guardian Australian understands the government is considering setting up large parliamentary committees to write the essays by consensus. Rogers said the AEC would deal with the essays when they come in, after being generated through \u201cwhatever parliamentary process\u201d. Rogers said the AEC would make no alterations to an essay (even to correct spelling mistakes) and wouldn\u2019t make editorial decisions like changing bold headings. AEC commissioner raises concerns on online harm and violence against poll workers The Australian Electoral Commission has raised concerns about violence against poll workers in the leadup to the voice referendum. In evidence to Senate estimates, the AEC commissioner, Tom Rogers, said 2023 represented \u201cthe most challenging, unpredictable, complex and yet exciting epoch in the AEC\u2019s history\u201d, noting domestic and global challenges around the electoral process. Against a backdrop of increasing threats to electoral integrity, escalating electoral costs, supply chain disruptions, recruitment challenges and ageing systems, the AEC continues to prepare for a referendum and the next general election, whenever that may be, and at least one byelection. The information ecosystem was entirely different at the time of the last referendum, with no social media. We\u2019re already seeing an increase in disinformation on social media, and a regrettable increase in threatening commentary. We\u2019re adapting our approach to manage this for the referendum, including protecting our own staff from online harm. We\u2019re seeing a more unpredictable information environment every day, requiring us to navigate far more challenges than ever before. Pay \u2018No 1\u2019 issue driving early education staff losses, SA royal commission hears Jim Chalmers was asked about whether the government will step in and raise child care wages yesterday and he said that first the multi-employer bargaining process had to be given a chance to get underway. AAP reports on the South Australian royal commission into child care with the commission being told poor pay rates being one of the reasons for a the continued exodus from the sector. United Workers Union\u2019s executive director of early learning, Helen Gibbons, said pay wasn\u2019t the only issue driving the loss of more than 30% of staff each year, but it remained the most important. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being able to pay their bills, it\u2019s also about how they feel valued by the community,\u201d Gibbons told South Australia\u2019s royal commission into early childhood education and care on Tuesday. \u201cHow much you\u2019re paid is a really concrete expression of how much the community values the work that you do. \u201cI really want to stress that that is the key driver, absolutely the No 1 issue. Our educators tell us very clearly that if you don\u2019t fix that, you don\u2019t fix the sector.\u201d Lengthy debate on referendum legislation to push out House sitting times There are another 81 MPs who want to speak on the referendum legislation bill, which comes on top of the 20 who spoke yesterday. That means to get through them all, the house is going to have to sit later (they have been trying to do \u201cfamily friendly\u201d hours but that is not going to work this week). Tony Burke told the chamber, in asking to amend the hours it sits: \u2026 that means tonight and tomorrow night the debate will continue until 10pm. If you are listed to speak on the adjournment, those speeches will still happen between 7:30 and 8pm tonight and tomorrow night. And there is still no intention that we have a vote on the bill itself until next week. So there will be some late nights ahead for house MPs. Senators, who have not had a sitting week where there hasn\u2019t been some sort of change and extension of hours, are trying to muster up some sympathy for their house colleagues, I\u2019m sure. Elsewhere, the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, declared again that his party would oppose the referendum bill in parliament \u2013 despite Peter Dutton previously saying the Liberals were inclined to support it, and allow the referendum to occur. Littleproud admitted \u201cmistakes were made\u201d during British settlement in relation to Indigenous Australians, but believed Australians would be \u201cstronger working together with Indigenous Australians rather than apart\u201d. Littleproud also called for a \u201crespectful\u201d debate around the voice. Dutton did not mention the voice in the Coalition party room, nor the official information pamphlet. Shadow defence minister calls for Aukus joint standing committee Back in the Coalition meeting, the shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, renewed his calls for the government to set up a parliamentary joint standing committee on Aukus, saying there was the need for a \u201cclearing house\u201d for legislation around the military pact. In the meeting, Hastie discussed a government bill on nuclear naval propulsion to back up the nuclear-powered submarines to be acquired under the Aukus deal. Hastie said there was a strategic need for the Coalition to back this bill, raising concerns about some on the crossbench opposing it. In that debate, there was talk about the Aukus committee Hastie previously proposed in a letter to the defence minister, Richard Marles, last year. In February, Hastie said the Aukus committee would send an important signal to the US and the UK \u201cthat this parliament is serious about seeing Aukus through, through multiple governments\u201d. The government has not taken up that suggestion, Hastie noted. Final bids on failed solar project Sun Cable to be taken today Back in January, billionaires Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest and Mike Cannon-Brookes fell out over their plans to develop giant solar farms in the Northern Territory to supply electricity via a cable to Singapore. The company that both had invested in, Sun Cable, was put into administration. The plan was always ambitious, requiring up as much as $30bn, with some of the economics looking challenging, as we noted in this piece. Anyway, the voluntary administrators are taking their final bids today (with the AFR today citing offers would land in the $100m range). FTI Consulting said the announcement about the winning bid will \u201cpotentially occur towards the end of this week to early next week\u201d, a spokesperson said. It\u2019s possible, of course, that neither Twiggy or MCB wins out and both will then share some of the spoils to limit their investment losses so far. (MCB\u2019s Grok and Twiggy\u2019s Squadron energy declined to comment on their bids.) A report out today by Bloomberg New Energy Finance finds Australia will need to invest as much as $US1.9tn ($A2.86tn) by 2050 if it is to reach its net zero emissions goals. That would need 800GW of solar and wind energy, or 21 times the 39GW we had at the end of 2022 (if we exclude a green hydrogen component, the requirement would be about 300GW). How far Australia gets towards that goal will depend on the success of companies like Sun Cable (with or without the cable), hence the interest in this week\u2019s bidding. Queensland ends licences to shoot flying foxes This news may really upset Bob Katter (those of you didn\u2019t cover Queensland politics for years may not know that Katter ran a campaign to \u201ckill all flying foxes in urban areas\u201d as a solution to stopping the spread of the Hendra virus \u2013 giving people permission to shoot flying foxes in their backyard was part of that). Well, now Queensland has become the last jurisdiction to end the issuing of licences to shoot flying foxes, with the outgoing environment minister, Meagan Scanlon, writing to the Humane Society International that she had \u201cmade the decision to move away from permitting the shooting of flying-foxes due to ongoing animal welfare concerns\u201d. There will be a three-year phase out of the licences. The HSI statement says that \u201cdespite being protected under the Nature Conservation Act 1992, Damage Mitigation Permits (DMPs) were issued to orchardists in Queensland to shoot three species of flying-fox: the black flying-fox, little red flying-fox and grey-headed flying-fox, in an effort to reduce crop damage\u201d. Not only was it inhumane and dangerous, it was also less effective than placing netting over the crops. The Greens are pushing for all native logging states to follow Victoria\u2019s lead. Dutton stresses Coalition must work together to win Fadden byelection [continued from previous post] Dutton, addressing the room, had a renewed focus on the \u201cworking poor\u201d in Australia, raising concerns about cost of living and energy prices, as well as industrial relations reforms mooted by the government. He noted popular public support for his proposed gambling ad ban. The government has criticised Dutton for not outlining more substantial policy ideas in his budget reply. Dutton told the room the Coalition \u201cneedn\u2019t rush to failure\u201d in dashing out new policies, saying more policies would come \u201cin due course\u201d \u2013 noting the need for their ideas to be considered, costed and ready to be debated. Robert, who formalised his retirement from politics last week, will be replaced in a byelection for the Gold Coast seat of Fadden in July. You may remember the last byelection triggered by a retiring opposition member didn\u2019t go so well for Peter Dutton - so the opposition leader stressed the Coalition needed to work together to ensure they didn\u2019t lose this one too. Peter Dutton has told the Coalition he doesn\u2019t want to \u201crush to failure\u201d by putting out too many policies early in his term as opposition leader, and told his troops they need to \u201cwork together as a team\u201d to win the Fadden byelection and hold Stuart Robert\u2019s seat. The Coalition partyroom met this morning in Canberra, their first get-together since Dutton\u2019s budget reply speech two weeks ago. Nationals leader David Littleproud addressed the meeting to praise the \u201cvision and principles\u201d outlined in Dutton\u2019s speech, criticising the government\u2019s budget as a \u201cwelfare budget\u201d that he claimed would push inflation up (many leading economists and the treasury department disagree). Littleproud claimed the regions were \u201cbeing done over\u201d by the government\u2019s infrastructure funding audit. One Coalition member, contributing to the meeting, suggested getting local mayors and other community groups involved in a campaign to oppose the mooted changes to infrastructure funding, which the opposition claims will see smaller regional projects axed (remember, this audit is being done to make sure all the Coalition\u2019s projects announced in government actually meet criteria and weren\u2019t just pork-barrelling ventures \u2013 or as infrastructure minister Catherine King described them, \u201cpress release projects\u201d) Greens senator Janet Rice calls on Albanese government to bring forward ban on native forest logging The Greens forests spokesperson and Victorian senator Janet Rice wants the Albanese government to follow Victoria\u2019s lead in bringing forward the ban on native forests and stop all native forest logging: Native forest logging is a dying industry and there\u2019s no way around it. If Labor bring on the Greens bill to a vote, we can immediately ban all native forest logging across the country. The Regional Forest Agreements have allowed reckless destruction of native forests for decades across Australia, pushed native wildlife to the brink of extinction, destroyed First Nations heritage, endangered our water supplies, heightened bushfire risk, and made the climate crisis worse. The government has a responsibility to stop this destruction, protect native forests and fix our broken environment laws. The Greens are ready to work with the Albanese government on a national ban on native forest logging, ensure a just transition for forestry workers and protect what remains of our precious native forests.\u201d Australia \u2018deeply invested\u2019 in freedom of navigation in South China Sea: Marles Earlier this morning, the deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, was asked if China\u2019s military buildup kept him up at night. After a back and forth about what China\u2019s motivations were, he said: Well, the point really is we can have a long conversation about that and you\u2019ll get different views on it. But the real point is this: it engages our interest. If you look at the South China Sea, for example, that is a body of water which matters deeply to us. Why? Because most of our trade goes through the South China Sea. And yes, a lot of that trade is to China itself. But all of our trade to Japan, all of our trade to Korea, two of our top five trading partners, goes through the South China Sea. So, we as a nation are deeply invested in the rules of the road applying there \u2013 freedom of navigation, freedom of overflight. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea matters to Australia and our way of life, our prosperity, as it applies in the South China Sea and, of course, everywhere else. That is what is part of how we are seeing a much more complex strategic landscape which we need to posture for. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And that\u2019s at the heart of the defence strategic review, the government\u2019s response to it. It is why we seek to have, for example, long range nuclear-powered submarines. Guardian Australia\u2019s 10th birthday event at the Seymour Centre You can hear from Luke Henriques-Gomes, our social affairs and inequality editor, at our 10th birthday event at the Seymour Centre this Thursday (along with a cast of other superstar reporters and editors at the Guardian) He\u2019ll be talking about reporting on things like this: A taxpayer-funded employability course is under fire after jobseekers complained that much of the compulsory training involved being shown irrelevant, inappropriate and, at-times, bizarre YouTube videos. Under contracts signed by the Coalition last year, the federal government will pay private providers about $500m over five years to run Employability Skills Training (EST) courses as part of the commonwealth\u2019s $7bn Workforce Australia program. On its website, the department says the program offers \u201cpractical support\u201d and \u201chelps you become job-ready by providing intensive pre-employment training\u201d. Illicit tobacco market growing, ABF tells Senate estimates The Australian Border Force has seized 73% more cigarettes compared with the same time last year, while for both loose leaf tobacco and cigarettes there has been a 10.5% increase in terms of duty evaded. Criminal syndicates have increasingly become involved in the illicit tobacco market because it\u2019s profitable, and the penalties compared to drug smuggling are lower, Senate estimates has heard. PM to announce workload changes for ministers Looks like there are some workload changes coming for the ministry \u2013 there were extra staff allocated for MPs (not just ministers) in the budget, but this looks like a wider acknowledgment that the workload is unsustainable. The Victorian government is set to announce that it will ban native forest logging from the start of next year, reflecting a widely held belief that the industry is not environmentally or economically viable. The announcement, expected in today\u2019s state budget, will bring forward the previous commitment to phase out native forest logging by 2030 and include transition funding for affected workers and communities. It follows the state\u2019s forests being hit by devastating bushfires in 2019-20, reducing the area available for logging, and court decisions finding the state-owned timber agency VicForests had not adequately protected endangered species. Expectations the end was near have grown in recent months. VicForests stopped logging in November after the supreme court judged it had failed to protect the greater glider and yellow-bellied glider. In February, the Maryvale Mill in the Latrobe Valley, the state\u2019s biggest, ended production of office paper in the state, blaming a lack of timber supply. VicForests had already reported a loss of more than $50m last financial year. It is expected the government will announce at least $200m in extra transition funding. The decision is unlikely to be welcomed in parts of regional Victoria that are home to native forest workers. Critics say plantations are not yet in place at a scale that can replace native forest timber. It will be celebrated by the state\u2019s conservation movement, which has fought a decades-long battle to create new national parks and protect forests from clearfelling. Robodebt official given $900,000-a-year Aukus role before royal commission, says Wong The robodebt royal commission will hand down its report on 7 June for those wondering. Paul Karp has an update on Kathryn Campbell\u2019s new role as a defence adviser: Penny Wong has given a qualified defence of a decision to appoint a public servant who held the top jobs at the two departments responsible for robodebt to a plum role as an adviser on Aukus. The foreign minister told Senate estimates that the decision had been made before the royal commission began and evidence that has since come out went \u201cbeyond what [she] would\u2019ve anticipated\u201d. Kathryn Campbell was given the $900,000-a-year job in June 2022, leaving her role as the head of the foreign affairs department. The prime minister\u2019s office and department published a transcript which omitted a key part of a journalist\u2019s question about whether the government will call a royal commission into Covid. The omission from the transcript of a 15 May press conference in Adelaide has the effect of qualifying Anthony Albanese\u2019s answer that the government will \u201cexamine it\u201d to commit Labor only to consider \u201csome kind of inquiry\u201d but not specifically a royal commission. Under Albanese and his predecessor Scott Morrison, the Australian government has been pressed to call a royal commission into the response to Covid, including by a Senate inquiry chaired by the now finance minister Katy Gallagher when Labor was in opposition. The call is supported by the former independent senator Rex Patrick and a number of Labor, crossbench and Coalition senators. On 15 May, a journalist asked Albanese: \u201cYou have committed to some kind of inquiry like a royal commission into Australia\u2019s handling of Covid, but there was nothing on this in the budget. When do you plan on calling one?\u201d But the transcript, distributed by the prime minister\u2019s office and published by the department, rendered the question: \u201cYou have committed to some kind of inquiry into Australia\u2019s handling of Covid, but there was nothing on this budget. When you plan on doing that?\u201d Albanese replied: \u201cCovid is still amongst us. What I\u2019ve said is that when we are confident that we\u2019re through those issues, then we\u2019ll examine it.\u201d Guardian Australia understands the question may not have been clearly audible from the on-site recording, but the prime minister\u2019s office declined to provide it. The question follows numerous instances of Albanese committing to an \u201cexamination\u201d of Covid, but not specifically endorsing the Senate committee\u2019s call for a royal commission. On 16 August Albanese told reporters that he has \u201csaid consistently that once we were through the pandemic, it would be inconceivable, regardless of who won the election in May, that you would not have a proper examination of the circumstances around the handling of the pandemic\u201d. ACIJ calls for sanctions in response to targeting of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh This morning, Richard Marles dodged questions on whether Anthony Albanese should raise the treatment of Muslims and minorities in India with Narendra Modi, but the Australian Centre for International Justice has made a submission (and a follow-up submission) to Penny Wong asking for action on what it says are ongoing human rights violations in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. From its statement: Our 75-page submission, prepared in consultation with affected members of the diaspora, set out evidence of the individuals\u2019 respective involvement in violations of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It focused on systematic campaigns carried out by members of the Uttar Pradesh police, in which Muslims (a religious minority in India) were disproportionately targeted. The submission argued that domestic accountability for these abuses is highly unlikely and that efforts by survivors and the families of victims to seek justice in India have been met with intimidation, threats and harassment by police. The ACIJ wants Australia to use is Magnitsky human rights sanctions regime to sanction those it says are responsible for what is happening in Uttar Pradesh. Albanese will join Modi at a community event in Sydney this evening, with a bilateral meeting to be held tomorrow at Admiralty House. \u201cWe don\u2019t just lock people up and forget about them,\u201d home affairs secretary Michael Pezzullo has told senate estimates. Greens senator Nick McKim immediately replied: You certainly do. They were discussing comments from UN special rapporteur on torture, Anne Edwards, who said it was \u201cinhumane\u201d to detain people indefinitely. Pezzullo said there were \u201cterminus points\u201d for all refugees and asylum seekers, including trying to send them back to their country of origin, and that no one was detained \u201cpotentially eternally\u201d. The department took on notice a request for more details on the length of time people are being detained for. Party rooms meeting before house sits at midday Senators are busy with estimates hearings, but the house won\u2019t sit until midday. That\u2019s for the party room meetings to occur, which means Tuesday morning is usually a little quiet at this time of the day, as most MPs are locked away hearing about how great everything their party is doing and how terrible the other parties are. Legislation gets discussed, concerns are raised, and updates on policy are given. Then the media are called in for a background briefing to hear what went on. Security pact between US and PNG a \u2018very positive\u2019 thing, says Marles If you didn\u2019t see this yesterday, the US has signed a new security pact with Papua New Guinea. As AAP reports, Richard Marles says Australia sees that as a positive step: The fact that America is walking down this path is something that we certainly see as being very positive and we will continue to work with PNG in terms of developing our own friends. More than 200 asylum seekers turned away by Operation Sovereign Borders in past year, Senate estimates hears Eight boats holding more than 200 asylum seekers have been turned back under Operation Sovereign Borders in the past year. OSB commander, rear admiral Justin Jones, said: Over the last year we\u2019ve had eight boats and 209 people attempt journeys to Australia \u2013 all have been successfully resolved \u2026 returned to their place of origin safely and in accordance with Australia\u2019s domestic and international legal obligations. The socioeconomic crisis in Sri Lanka and other global and regional factors have led to an increased \u201ctempo\u201d of asylum seeker boats, he said, and people smugglers would continue targeting vulnerable people, spreading misinformation and \u201coutright lies\u201d to increase demand for their services. As Senate estimates has also turned its attention to \u201con-water matters\u201d, home affairs secretary Michael Pezzullo was asked about reports that 41 asylum seekers had been picked up and returned to Sri Lanka in April. It\u2019s a longstanding practice \u2026 we don\u2019t discuss operational matters pertaining to Operation Sovereign Borders except in so far as we have a monthly reporting cycle. He suggested that the media sometimes got the wrong end of the stick and that people may have, for example, been picked up from a trawler that got into trouble (but he wasn\u2019t talking about any specific on-water matter). Officials told estimates there were no planned upgrades to security on Christmas Island (the topic of another report) but that OSB was always prepared for more arrivals. Qantas is on track to deliver a record net profit of up to $2.48bn this financial year amid surging travel demand, representing a sharp turnaround for the national carrier. The forecast full year result to 30 June is underpinned by a flying schedule that is now more profitable than before the pandemic, Qantas disclosed in a market update on Tuesday morning. The result could be almost $1bn higher than its prior record in 2018, which came in at $1.6bn. Qantas\u2019s profit margins have been helped by huge demand for domestic and international flights, high ticket prices and various cost savings. Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said lower jet fuel prices were helping put downward pressure on fares, although he noted there was still excess demand. The industry remains capacity constrained and the travel category remains strong, so there\u2019s still a mismatch between supply and demand that\u2019s likely to persist for some time, especially for international flying. Many airlines are now recording bumper profits due in part to pent-up demand and high fares, after recording years of pandemic-disrupted losses. Qantas\u2019s chief financial officer, Vanessa Hudson, will take over from Joyce as the airline\u2019s chief executive in November. Monash University backs Indigenous voice to parliament Monash University has become the latest university to back the voice to parliament with the launch of a series of speaker sessions on the upcoming referendum. The series, launching this week, features prominent Indigenous Australians and legal experts including Wiradjuri and Wailwan woman and senior lawyer Teela Reid, Whadjuk Noongar woman and commentator Narelda Jacobs and Prof Luke Beck. The vice-chancellor of Monash, Prof Margaret Gardner, said the university council unanimously supported the Uluru Statement of the Heart. We are committed to actively engaging in conversations and actions that promote a more equitable and inclusive society for all Australians.\u201d Prof Tristan Kennedy, the pro vice-chancellor and a Noongar man, said facilitating an informed discourse in the lead up to the referendum was crucial. Higher education institutions have a responsibility and are in a privileged position to facilitate robust conversations about matters like this that affect everyone in the community, that\u2019s what I see Monash University being able to do in 2023. Universities Australia, the peak body for the sector, has withheld from actively backing the yes campaign, but a number of tertiary institutions have come out to announce their support. Among them are Charles Darwin University, ANU, UNSW, the University of Wollongong, Swinburne and Curtin University, with others remaining in negotiation over their institutional positions. \u2018Significant uptick\u2019 in cocaine seizures, says border force commissioner ABF commissioner Michael Outram has confirmed a \u201csignificant uptick\u201d in cocaine seizures, with 100 companies and 1,000 employees of \u201cconcern\u201d when it comes to smuggling. Outram was responding to last night\u2019s Four Corners episode \u201cCocaine Nation\u201d, which featured an underworld whistleblower\u2019s claims about Mexican and South American cartels importing tonnes of drugs into Australia. He said: What we\u2019ve identified through undertaking Operation Jardine over the last year and a half is probably about 100 companies that deeply concern us \u2013 they\u2019re operating at the border in different contexts within airports, seaports, the supply chain, customs brokerages \u2026 depots, warehouses, etc. And [there are] about 1,000 employees that concern us. Outram said the ABF was \u201cpretty stretched\u201d tackling the issue and that he was concerned people would think ABF officers were involved, although he conceded the force was not \u201cimmune\u201d to corruption: I would never say that any organisation is impenetrable particularly when you think of the depths of the pockets that organised crime has. So I\u2019ve been very cautious [but] no organisation is immune, including mine. Border force continued trial of Chinese-made drones after US and ADF stopped, estimates hears The Australian border force continued a trial of drones made by Chinese company DJI for several days because the \u201crisks were low and manageable\u201d, commissioner Michael Outram told Senate estimates this morning. The US stopped using DJI drones because of their links to the Chinese military, and the Australian defence force stopped using them on 5 May. Outram said he initially continued a trial because the ABF has a different security classification and was using them for things such as spotting illegal tobacco crops. But on 8 May, after further briefings, he suspended the trial \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d because it had become a \u201cwhole-of-government issue\u201d. More than 150,000 taking up fee-free Tafe, says skills minister The skills minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, says more than 150,000 people have taken up the government\u2019s offer of fee-free Tafe so far: More than 65,000 students in NSW Over 26,000 in both Victoria and Queensland More than 12,000 people with disability Almost 35,000 jobseekers Nationwide, almost 30% of all enrolments have been in courses related to the care sector \u2013 an area of high priority. Qantas forecasts before-tax profits of about $2.4bn for financial year I am sure all of you will be as shocked by this news as I was \u2013 Qantas is reporting a before tax profit of about $2.4bn. That follows its $1.4bn half year profit. Qantas says \u201ccontinued strong travel demand and completion of its three-year recovery program\u201d are the main drivers of the financial year \u201cunderlying profit before tax of between $2,425 million and $2,475 million\u201d. It has headlined: Estimated underlying profit before tax of $2,425 million-$2,475 million for FY23. Net debt of $2,700 million-$2,900 million expected at 30 June 2023. Fuel prices, costs associated with operational buffer and fares all moderating. On-market buy-back increased by up to $100 million. On-track to share benefits of recovery with employees. Shocked. NT government knew it could not reduce climate risk when it greenlit \u2018carbon bomb\u2019 gas production in Beetaloo Basin Meanwhile, Lisa Cox has an update on the Beetaloo Basin: New documents reveal the Northern Territory government knew it could not meet a key recommendation to reduce the climate risk of its planned massive expansion of gas production, and asked the Albanese government for help. Federal climate change officials in turn admitted Australia did not have any existing policies that would meet the recommendation in full. Advocates say the documents are proof the Northern Territory government lied when it claimed all the conditions were in place to give the green light to gas production in the Beetaloo Basin, an area of vast shale reserves 500km south-east of Darwin. It looks like estimates is going really well: Hourly wage gap between casual and permanent workers highest on record at 28%, ACTU research shows AAP has looked at some Australian Council of Trade Unions research showing the pay gap between permanent and casual workers: Australia\u2019s casual workers are getting paid significantly less than their permanent counterparts, with the hourly pay gap reaching an all-time high. Casuals generally earn $11.59 less an hour than permanent workers, or an hourly rate of $28.95 against $40.54, a pay gap of 28%, ACTU research shows. The pay differential is the highest on record. Employees with the same skill level or occupation had a smaller pay gap of between $3.55 and $3.84 an hour, equating to a discrepancy of about 11%. The union noted the gap existed despite casuals receiving a pay loading of up to 25% and it called for the Albanese government to scrap \u201cMorrison-era changes to the law\u201d. The government should also introduce a commonsense definition of casual work as part of its industrial relations reforms because too many jobs were casual \u201cin name only\u201d, it said. Gambling reform alliance CEO praises Zoe Daniel\u2019s ad ban bill amid \u2018white hot public anger\u2019 against betting industry The Alliance for Gambling Reform has welcomed Goldstein independent MP Zoe Daniel\u2019s private member\u2019s bill to ban the broadcast of gambling ads. The government has tried to put the issue on ice by saying it is waiting for the review it ordered of online gambling ads to come back first (there is a small component of the review which will take in broadcast ads). But CEO of the gambling reform alliance, Carol Bennett, said Daniel\u2019s bill showed \u201ca political leadership\u201d she hoped the government would follow. \u201cThere is white hot public anger at the tsunami of gambling ads that are on our screens. Parents are furious that they are not able to protect their children from a gambling industry that is both ruthless and predatory and which targets young people.\u201d But Bennett also hoped any forthcoming ban would go further than even Daniel\u2019s bill: But as good as this bill is, it does not go far enough, there must also be urgent government action to ban gambling ads on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook and Snapchat. Nearly half of those seeking Australian homelessness charity\u2019s help have jobs but can\u2019t pay soaring rents If you haven\u2019t seen this report from Jordyn Beazley on who is accessing help from Mission Australia, it is well worth your time: Four in 10 people who sought help from a major homelessness charity in the past three years were employed but could not meet skyrocketing rents, according to a report by Mission Australia. The report comes as the demand for the organisation\u2019s homelessness services, mainly based in New South Wales, jumped by 26% to 7,378 people between January 2020 to December last year. The number of people seeking help who were already homeless increased by 50% in three years to more than 3,500 people \u2013 mainly due to inadequate supply or affordable housing, the report said. No case \u2018zeroed in\u2019 on inclusion of \u2018executive government\u2019 in referendum, Leeser says Does Julian Leeser accept that his proposal to remove \u201cexecutive government\u201d from the question will not get ahead? Leeser: Well, look, obviously the bill is going to pass the House of Representatives in the next fortnight where the government has the majority and the government is sticking with its wording \u2013 at least that\u2019s what the minister said yesterday \u2013 but it\u2019s quite a few more weeks to run in the Senate. The reason I have put this forward is not that I don\u2019t believe that the voice should be able to advise the executive. But when I read and paid attention to the full sweep of the debate yesterday, the no case is zeroed in on this point. And I think having that second clause in there is making it more difficult for Australians to vote yes. And I want to see the yes case win and win handsomely and I think the best, best way for it to win is to try and encourage as many Australians as possible to vote yes. And I think we can achieve that and achieve a strong voice by amending that second clause. Leeser dodges question on Linda Burney\u2019s \u2018misinformation and disinformation\u2019 comments on Dutton The minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney said Dutton\u2019s claims were \u201cmisinformation and disinformation\u201d. Does Julian Leeser agree? Leeser dodges the question: I think it\u2019s important that the yes case and the no case each put their best arguments forward. I\u2019ve always said one of the reasons I\u2019m on the yes case and not the no case is that I\u2019ve always thought that it was a reasonable thing to have this body and have a body that is specifically designed to improve the policy outcomes for Aboriginal people for two reasons, firstly, because they\u2019re the only people that we make laws about on the basis of their race. And secondly, because this is a wonderful country where, you know, by global standards, our social and economic indicators, the best in the world, but we have a gap that Aboriginal people face and we haven\u2019t been able to close that gap. And I believe consulting people on the laws and policies that affect them, will help us improve. We\u2019re addressing things like Indigenous homelessness, employment, housing, safety, education and economic advancement. That\u2019s why I think this is a good thing. Leeser: ATSI people the only group for whom laws are made \u2018on the basis of their race\u2019, making voice a \u2018reasonable\u2019 move The interview moves on and Julian Leeser is asked about party leader Peter Dutton\u2019s comments in his speech yesterday that the voice would \u201cre-racialise\u201d Australia. Leeser, who stepped away from the shadow frontbench so he could campaign for the yes vote, said: I\u2019m not going to be responsible for commenting on other people\u2019s comments. I\u2019m going to responsible for the words that I say. I think that the voice will play an important role in Australia and it will play an important role because we know that you make better public policy when you consult people that are directly affected by the laws and policies that are made about them. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are the only people that we make laws about on the basis of their race. It\u2019s therefore a reasonable thing that they should be consulted about the effect of those laws and policies. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re having the voice \u2013 it recognises Aboriginal people and it provides for a permanent institution for consultation and that should lead to better public policymaking. \u2018Everybody has a responsibility\u2019 to improve public debate, Leeser says when asked about mainstream media Asked again about the responsibility of the media \u2013 mainstream media \u2013 Julian Leeser says: Well, I think everybody has a responsibility to lift the standard of public debate in this country. And I think I always try and conduct myself in a way where we play the ball and not the person, and I think that that\u2019s a really important principle. And I\u2019m really sad that it\u2019s had this effect on Stan [Grant]. I\u2019ve reached out to him personally, and I hope we see him resuming his public role again soon. Which again doesn\u2019t address the substantive issue at the heart of the question. The media can be notoriously bad at taking on board criticism or responding as needed (and yes, I am part of the media I am talking about). It doesn\u2019t help when politicians are also not willing to call out when lines are crossed. Julian Leeser \u2018shocked\u2019 at social media comments directed at Stan Grant The former shadow attorney general Julian Leeser was next up on ABC radio RN Breakfast where he too was asked about the treatment of Stan Grant. Leeser had been on the ABC panel which played ahead of the coronation and had already spoken out against the \u201cunrelenting racism online\u201d. Asked if he was worried about the media\u2019s responsibility in conducting conversations around race and Indigenous people and history, Leeser said: Let me firstly say again, that I\u2019ve been horrified at some of the things that have been said about Stan Grant, in fact, I said it the day after I\u2019d appeared on that coronation panel with him. I was just shocked at some of the things that were being said about him on social media and he\u2019s copped that sort of thing for a long time. He\u2019s a good journalist. He\u2019s a fair journalist and a fair man. And I think we all have to be better at having difficult conversations in our country and doing so in a respectful manner. And I said in the context of the coming referendum that it\u2019s really important that both sides engage respectfully. It\u2019s important that advocates for the yes case listen to the reasonable concerns of those who doubt, and advocates for the no case listen to the hopes and aspirations of Indigenous people that they think the voice can bring them. And I think that applies more broadly. We\u2019ve got to have a more respectful conversation and I think sometimes social media commentary and so on doesn\u2019t help that. Again, you\u2019ll notice that the answer focuses on social media. And there are problems with social media, but the question was on \u201cthe media\u201d. Victoria to introduce big business tax to help pay for Covid-19 debt Big business is set to be slugged with a new tax to help repay billions of dollars worth of emergency funds borrowed by the Victorian government at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. Victoria\u2019s treasurer, Tim Pallas, on Tuesday afternoon will hand down his ninth budget, which will detail a \u201cCovid-19 debt repayment plan\u201d that includes new revenue measures and savings to get the state\u2019s borrowings under control. Guardian Australia has confirmed this will include a new levy on \u201cbig business\u201d \u2013 though it remains unclear how many businesses will be eligible. It comes after Pallas introduced the mental health and wellbeing levy to pay for an overhaul of the state\u2019s system in the budget two years ago, to fund reforms to the state\u2019s mental health system. Marles encourages \u2018sensitivity\u2019 from both news organisations and social media users It took asking at least three times for Richard Marles to get to that answer. The inclusion of News Corp\u2019s campaigns against particular journalists at the ABC has seemingly made some politicians uncomfortable. Justin Stevens, the ABC news boss has told News Corp and other media critics to focus on him: \u201cI\u2019m the person who\u2019s responsible ultimately for the journalism and the decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m saying, stop going after people for doing their jobs.\u201d Before agreeing that some of the comments below stories about ABC presenters in publications like the Australian were \u201crevolting\u201d, Marles said: I think every news organisation and everybody who contributes to the public discourse and that includes those who engage in social media need to do so with a sense of sensitivity \u2026 and awareness about what people are saying and the way in which their voice is being heard. The conversation moves on to Stan Grant and whether Richard Marles agrees with some of the comments ABC news boss Justin Stevens has made about the criticism Grant experienced by organisations like News Corp and its \u201crelentless campaign\u201d. Marles is asked whether he has read some of the comments under articles about ABC staff which appear in newspapers like the Australian. Patricia Karvelas: Should those newspapers be dealing with the consequences and the commentary? I\u2019ve read some of them I\u2019ve read some of them about myself, too. They\u2019re revolting. Marles: Look, I mean, they are revolting. It\u2019s it\u2019s an area in an age of social media where \u2013 where there are comments that are posted, well \u2013 anyone who engages in social media, I think we all need to do much better. And the answer the question about why I haven\u2019t read all them is precisely because of the impact which one has when you do read them all. You know, I \u2026 do find it very troubling, is the short answer to the question. And I think this is a moment in Stan Grant\u2019s decision for us all to have a long think about it. Australia-China relations \u2018dramatically\u2019 more stabilised than a year ago: Marles Should Anthony Albanese accept the invitation to visit Beijing if China hasn\u2019t lifted its trade sanctions? Richard Marles: What we\u2019re trying to do with China and really, this is the whole of this conversation \u2013 it is complex, and it is difficult. If people want to try and make something which is very complex and difficult more simple, it just isn\u2019t. What we are trying to do is to stabilise the relationship. And as I say, we will work with China where we can, we will disagree with them where we must. That\u2019s the philosophy that we are taking to stabilise. I think it\u2019s a bit it is more stabilised than it was a year ago, \u2026 dramatically so, but it\u2019s not stabilised in the complete vision you have for where you want it. Australia-China relationship \u2018complex\u2019 but is \u2018a huge opportunity\u2019, says Marles Richard Marles gave a speech overnight where he said Australia \u201cmust confront the inconvenient truths about China\u201d. What did he mean by that? Well, the point I was really making is that the China is a is a very complex country, and our relationship with China is obviously correspondingly complex. And it\u2019s not a relationship which can be defined with simplistic platitudes. I think if you wind the clock back a year or more, you know, we had a debate in this country, which was pretty simplistic and didn\u2019t take into account all the nuance of what is a very complex situation. And we need to embrace all of that, you know, we really need to look at the entire picture. I mean, China is a huge opportunity for our country and remains such being our largest trading partner. The that facts has been at the heart of our economic growth over a number of decades. But should Australia raise its concerns? Richard Marles: Well, I mean, we have a very deep and open relationship with India, but I\u2019m not about to go into all of those elements. Now. I\u2019m sure that there will be a full conversation that that both prime ministers have tomorrow, but we want to emphasise that India is a democracy. It\u2019s a country with whom we share values and we do want to see a much bigger growth in the way in which we engage with each other and [cooperate], both on a military level and in terms of our trade. Marles avoids question of whether PM will bring up India\u2019s treatment of Muslims and other minorities with Modi Will Anthony Albanese address the treatment of Muslims and other minorities with Modi, as Joe Biden plans to do when the pair meet later in the year? Marles: I\u2019m not about to go into all that will be spoken about in when the prime minister, our prime minister, meets Prime Minister Modi tomorrow. I think the fundamental point that we want to make is that is that we do have a strategic alignment based on a sense of shared values. I mean, ultimately, we are both democracies. And that very much underpins the way in which we see the world and why we have an interest in building the relationship. Marles confident of shared alignment with India despite silence on Russia India has not condemned Russia. Is Richard Marles confident India is strategically aligned with Australia? Marles: We are confident that India is strategically aligned with Australia and India is a democracy with whom we share values. So that\u2019s that\u2019s the fundamental principle, and we share an interest in having a free and open Indo-Pacific. India and Australia share \u2018greater strategic alignment \u2026 than we really have at any point\u2019: Marles The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, is speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast about Narendra Modi\u2019s visit. The Indian prime minister arrived at about 8pm last night. He and Anthony Albanese will attend a community event in Sydney tonight, with a bilateral meeting planned for tomorrow morning. Marles: I think we have a greater strategic alignment with India today than we really have at any point in both of our country\u2019s histories, and it really does afford the opportunity to take the relationship to the next level, as Prime Minister Modi has said \u2026 This is a real opportunity for us, because this year India becomes the largest country in the world by population. It is a growing, massive economy. There are great opportunities for us. And in a security sense, we do both share values and share strategic alignment; we have a real investment together in the rules of the international trade, the global rules based order; we share an ocean, we want to see open trade occurring in all of that. And so we really do have a joint interest in cooperating. For those who missed it last night, Stan Grant signed off from public life for some time, having received ongoing racial abuse for doing his job: Snowy Hydro\u2019s tunnel borer, which has been stuck since 12 December just 70 metres into its work, should resume operations soon, Dennis Barnes, Snowy\u2019s chief, told senate estimates on Monday night. Dubbed \u201cFlorence\u201d, the 211 metre-long machine hit soft rock soon after it began the 17km-long tunnel that will be a key part of the giant Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro scheme. Work has been delayed while crews strengthened the rock around a sink hole that opened up in front of the borer and reached the surface. A separate plant to treat slurry rather than hard rock has had to be built sooner than expected, and should be commissioned by the end of May. Barnes said: Then we should be able to push forward with Florence slightly thereafter. After that, the borer will take \u201cin the order of three years\u201d to finish the tunnel. Barnes said earlier this month that Snowy 2.0 could be delayed by as long as two more years. That could take the commercial start date to 2029 or later, compared with an original target of July 2025. Barnes said the impacts of the delays and additional costs, and remedial efforts to speed up work, will be tallied later this year. The official costs \u2013 excluding transmission lines to link the plant to the main grid \u2013 are already estimated to be $5.9bn and critics expect them to exceed $10bn (assuming there aren\u2019t other major challenges). Welcome to day two of the parliament sitting \u2013 and estimates \u2013 as the house continues to be dominated by the referendum legislation debate. Liberal MP Julian Leeser is still looking for support to remove \u2018executive government\u2019 from the question, but the government has shown no indications it believes any shift is necessary. There were more than 70 speakers on the list yesterday \u2013 although not too many Coalition MPs. One Liberal MP who did make a splash was Bridget Archer who directly countered claims made by her party leader, Peter Dutton who said the voice would divide Australia by racial lines. No, the voice won\u2019t have veto power or act as a third chamber ... To claim otherwise is a deliberate and harmful misrepresentation of the facts, and I\u2019m disappointed to have seen this wilfully perpetuated by some. Nor does the argument that this referendum is dividing the country by race make sense. Anthony Albanese has a busy day \u2013 he will be in parliament in Canberra for most of the day, but is then headed to Sydney for a 6pm community event with Narendra Modi in what is the Indian prime minister\u2019s first visit to Australia since 2014.

            "title": "China poses biggest threat to global security, says Sunak",
            "date": "2023-05-21T09:52:09Z",
            "content": "China poses the biggest challenge to global security and prosperity of our age with the \u201cmeans and intent to reshape the world order\u201d, Rishi Sunak has said. The UK prime minister said G7 leaders including Japan, the US, Canada and European nations had shown \u201cunity and resolve\u201d in confronting the problems posed by Beijing. The statement from the G7 nations referred to \u201cde-risking\u201d rather than \u201cde-coupling\u201d from their relationship with China amid warnings from France that the summit should not be seen as being anti-Beijing. However, Sunak went further than the summit statement in outlining the threat that China poses to the world, appearing to rank it even higher than Russia as a global security threat. Speaking from a peace centre in Hiroshima, the site of one of the atomic bombs dropped by the US in 1945, Sunak said: \u201cWe will work together as the G7 and other countries make sure that we can de-risk ourselves and the vulnerability of supply chains that we have seen from China, take the steps necessary to protect ourselves against hostile investment and do so in a way that doesn\u2019t damage each other.\u201d Sunak was also questioned on whether the G7 nations had done enough to address the challenge of China. The countries issued a critical statement on Beijing and agreed to set up a new body to counter \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d by China and others. However, there were no specific actions to deal with Beijing\u2019s increasing belligerence towards Taiwan beyond saying that the nations \u201cstrongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion\u201d. In response, Sunak said he disagreed there was no material action, saying it had partly been about \u201cjust recognising the systemic challenge that China poses to the world order \u2013 it is the only country with both the means and intent to reshape the world order\u201d. He added there had also been \u201cconversations about ensuring that important technology pertinent to our security does not leak to China\u201d. The G7 statement described relations with China as a challenge rather than a threat but it had tough words calling on China \u201cnot to conduct interference activities\u201d and expressed concerns about alleged human rights in Tibet and Xinjiang. It also said G7 countries were \u201cgravely concerned\u201d about territorial disputes in the South China Sea and urged Beijing to use its influence with Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. In response to the G7 joint statement, China expressed \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d and lodged a complaint with the hosts, Japan. Sunak has a number of strong China critics on the Conservative backbenches including the former leader Iain Duncan Smith, who have been pressing No 10 on the issue. Liz Truss, the former prime minister, visited Taiwan this week and called for Sunak to toughen his approach to Beijing."

            "date": "2023-05-12T05:00:47Z",
            "content": "Successive governments since the 1980s have had plans for new generations of nuclear power stations sited around the coasts of the United Kingdom. Although the main reason for building them, according to politicians, is to provide a low-carbon form of electricity to combat the climate crisis, no thought seems to have gone into what the climate crisis might do to the nuclear power stations. Prof Andy Blowers, a former government adviser on nuclear waste, points out in the Town and Country Planning Association Journal that the eight sites identified in 2011 as suitable for new stations are the same as those identified half a century earlier, on which the first generation of nuclear power stations were built. The reason the sites were originally chosen was their remoteness, for safety, and their proximity to the sea, for cooling purposes. The latest reasoning is that they would have a better chance of public acceptance because two generations of local people have worked in the industry. The new installations are planned to operate for 60 years and will need another century after closure to cool sufficiently to remove the waste. Blowers, an opponent of the government plans, worries that ministers seem to have taken no account of sea level rise, intense storms and the prospect of flooding at these sites."

            "date": "2023-05-29T16:13:24Z",
            "content": "Sixteen colts are still in the running for the Derby at Epsom on Saturday after Passenger, third home after a tricky passage in the Dante Stakes at York this month, was added to the field at a cost of \u00a385,000 at the five-day declaration stage on Monday morning. The question of which of them will set off as favourite, however, may not be resolved until the off-time of 1.30pm, as four horses \u2013 Military Order, Auguste Rodin, Passenger and Arrest \u2013 are currently priced between 7-2 and 6-1, with Arrest in particular likely to attract support on the day as he will be Frankie Dettori\u2019s final ride in the Classic. And the Farewell Frankie factor is just one among a multitude of storylines \u2013 actual and potential \u2013 attached to this year\u2019s running of the original and best Derby, which will be the 244th in all since Diomed took the spoils in 1780. Sir Michael Stoute became the oldest trainer to saddle a Derby winner when Desert Crown obliged favourite-backers last year, and will extend the mark to 77 years of age if Passenger, who did not see a racecourse until mid-April, gives the Niarchos family a first Derby success. Success for Military Order would also be historic in its way, as he is a full brother to Adayar, the winner in 2021, and two brothers have not taken the Derby since Diamond Jubilee, in 1890, followed up the success of Persimmon four years earlier. Dubai Mile is a live 16-1 chance to give Charlie Johnston a Derby win in his first full season with a licence, while Sprewell would be a hugely popular first winner for 76-year-old Jessica Harrington. But there are unwanted threads to the story too, including a train strike on both days of the Derby Festival meeting which seems certain to have an impact on the attendance, and an unusually early 1.30pm off-time, as just the second race on the card, thanks to the FA Cup final moving from its usual mid-May slot and kicking off at 3pm, a knock-on effect from the winter World Cup in Qatar. And there is also the likelihood that protestors from Animal Rising, the group that disrupted the start of the Grand National last month, will be at Epsom to attempt something similar, with the ultimate aim being to stop the Classic taking place for the first time in its history. This is despite the Jockey Club being granted an injunction at the high court on Friday which would make demonstrators personally liable for damages, and potentially even subject to imprisonment for contempt of court, if they encroach on the course or parade ring. There was a distinct sense during Friday\u2019s hearing that both the Jockey Club and Animal Rising, which sent four \u201cobservers\u201d to the high court including Dan Kidby, one of its founders, were jockeying for position, in much the same way that most of the riders will hope to be settled within striking distance and one off the rail as they round Tattenham Corner on Saturday. There has already been a significant degree of engagement between the Jockey Club and Animal Rising, including a meeting on 11 May at which the two sides chatted over doughnuts. Kidby and Nevin Truesdale, the Jockey Club\u2019s chief executive, also spent 10 minutes in deep discussion outside Court 10 in the Rolls Building on Friday, after the Club\u2019s application for an injunction had been granted. Kidby subsequently said that \u201cI really do believe that Nevin and his team do care for animals, just like I do\u201d, while also confirming that the injunction will not make the slightest difference to the group\u2019s plans and aims this weekend. Truesdale, meanwhile, called for Animal Rising to abandon any attempt to disrupt Saturday\u2019s race, and insisted that the Jockey Club, which also owns Aintree, \u201cwill never tolerate a repeat of the illegal disruption we saw on Grand National day\u201d. Which is, of course, what you would want and expect him to say, but is likely to have as much impact as the 50 hastily erected signs around the length of the Derby course, to warn activists of the injunction to stay off the track. So, we will just have to see what unfolds this weekend. Epsom will do everything possible to prevent, or at least minimise, disruption to its most famous race, while a \u2013 very small \u2013 group of objectors will do what they can to stop it happening at all. But my guess would be that Animal Rising\u2019s chance of succeeding in its ultimate aim is vanishingly remote, and that, as with the previous 243, the main point of interest around this year\u2019s Derby will be the identity, and price, of the winner."

            "title": "Conservative attacks on abortion and trans healthcare come from the same place | Moira Donegan",
            "date": "2023-05-24T12:59:31Z",
            "content": "On Monday, Jim Pillen, the Republican governor of Nebraska, signed a law that bans abortion after 12 weeks of pregnancy and restricts gender-affirming care for anyone under 19. The ban on trans medical care takes effect in October and the abortion ban goes into effect immediately. And so Nebraska has become the latest state to determine through law what might have once been determined by the more pliable tools of custom or imagination: the way that the sexed body a person is born with shapes the kind of life they can live. Be it through forced pregnancy or prohibited transition, the state of Nebraska now claims the right to determine what its citizens will do with their sexed bodies \u2013 what those bodies will look like, how they will function and what they will mean. It is a part of the right\u2019s ongoing project to roll back the victories of the feminist and gay rights movements, to re-establish the dominance of men in public life, to narrow possibilities for difference and expression and to inscribe in law a firm definition and hierarchy of gender: that people are either men or women and that men are better. They\u2019re not alone. Abortion bans have been proliferating wildly in the year since the US supreme court eliminated the right in their Dobbs decision, declaring that any state can compel women to remain pregnant, and creating different, lesser entitlements to bodily freedom and self-determination based on sex. But as the abortion bans have spread like an infection across the American south, midwest, and mountain west, they have been accompanied by a related political disease: laws seeking to prohibit minors and sometimes adults, from accessing medical treatments that facilitate gender transitions. Twenty-five states have enacted pre-viability abortion bans since Roe was overturned last summer, although in some states, like Iowa and Montana, abortion has remained legal pending judicial stays. Meanwhile, 20 states now ban gender-affirming care for minors, with a rush of bills being introduced over the past months. In addition to Nebraska, a slew of states have passed transition-care bans in 2023, including Utah, Mississippi, South Dakota, Iowa, Tennessee and Florida. Texas is soon to join them. It is not a coincidence that the states which have the most punitive and draconian bans on abortion have also adopted the most aggressive targeting of transgender people and medical care. The bills are part of the same project by conservatives, who have been emboldened in their campaign of gender revanchism in the wake of Dobbs. Both abortion bans and transition care bans further the same goal: to transform the social category of gender into an enforceable legal status, linked to the sexed body at birth and to prescribe a narrow and claustrophobic view of what that gender status must mean. It is no accident that the states that would forbid a teenager from transitioning are the same that would compel that teenager to give birth; it is no accident that the states with the greatest control over what women do with their reproductive organs are the ones where women\u2019s restrooms have become sites of surveillance and control, with patrons, cis and trans alike, subjected to invasive and degrading inquisitions as to whether they are conforming sufficiently to the demands of femininity. That Nebraska combined these two projects into one bill, then, is less inventive than it is a dropping of pretense: the anti-feminist movement is anti-trans, and the anti-trans panic is at its core anti-feminist. The attacks on gender freedom from the right are not only united in their ideology, but increasingly in their rhetoric. Abortion and trans rights activists have long insisted that both abortion and transition are healthcare. It\u2019s an apt and worthy argument, considering that both involve the interventions of medical professionals, both facilitate the wellbeing and happiness of those who receive them, and both result in horrific health complications when denied, from the high rates of mental distress and horrific, needless pregnancy complications that have been ushered in by Dobbs, to the dramatic rates of suicidal ideation and mental health problems in trans people who are denied the ability to transition. But increasingly, the right has begun to attack the notion of abortion and trans rights as healthcare, arguing that neither pregnancy nor non-transition constitute \u201cillness\u201d. At a recent oral argument over the fate of the abortion drug mifepristone, Judge James Ho, a Trump appointee on the fifth circuit court of appeals whose rabidly conservative opinions and trollish affect suggest supreme court ambitions, argued that the drug should be removed from the market in part because \u201cpregnancy is not a serious illness\u201d. \u201cWhen we celebrate Mother\u2019s Day,\u201d Ho asked, his voice dripping with contempt, \u201care we celebrating a serious illness?\u201d In that moment, Ho sounded uncannily like anti-trans activists seeking to ban care for young people, who argue, ad nauseam, that \u201cpuberty is not a disorder\u201d. The rhetoric suggests a narrow and myopic view of \u201chealth\u201d, the notion that bodies have destinies and should be made to fulfill them regardless of the desires of the people involved. A healthy body, we\u2019re told, is one that conforms to socially imposed gender hierarchies, regardless of how miserable that conformity and imposition makes the people who inhabit those bodies. But while these practices of abortion and transition care constitute medicine and while their outcomes encourage health, it would be a mistake to fight the political battle for these services only on the ground of what counts as \u201chealthcare\u201d. Because the truth is that conservatives do not care about health \u2013 they don\u2019t care about the integrity of the medical profession, or about patient outcomes, or about bodies, not really. They care about people, and about making sure that those people stay in line. In the grand tradition of feminists and queers alike, we should refuse to. Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnist"

            "date": "2023-05-24T18:36:02Z",
            "content": "Record numbers of people are paying for private healthcare, spending up to \u00a33,200 on having a cataract removed and \u00a315,075 on a new hip, amid growing frustration at NHS waiting lists. Across the UK last year 272,000 people used their own funds to cover the cost of having an operation or diagnostic procedure at a private hospital. That was up from 262,000 the year before and a sharp rise on the 199,000 who did so in 2019, the year before the Covid pandemic struck. Private hospitals also set another record during 2022 by treating 820,000 inpatients and day case patients overall \u2013 more than in any previous year, according to figures from the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN), a specialist data collection organisation that tracks activity in the sector. Besides the 272,000 who paid themselves, the other 547,000 had their treatment using a private medical insurance policy \u2013 the highest number since 2019. The data prompted speculation that the NHS\u2019s inability to meet waiting time targets could make paying for private healthcare \u201ca new normal\u201d in Britain, despite state-funded care being free. Ian Gargan, PHIN\u2019s chief executive, said \u201clong NHS waiting lists and uncertainty around how long you\u2019ll be waiting\u201d were driving the surge in private healthcare. \u201cFor some people, paying for their own treatment is more cost-effective than not being able to work while they await a new knee or hip replacement, for instance.\u201d The top five most common procedures private hospitals carried out last year were cataract surgery (76,000), chemotherapy (66,000), an upper gastrointestinal diagnostic test (38,000), colonoscopy to test for bowel cancer (31,000) and a new hip (30,000). The figures do not include NHS patients who had private hospital care paid for by the health service. Keep Our NHS Public said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that more and more people were feeling obliged to use private healthcare as a result of the government neglecting the NHS. Dr John Puntis, the group co-chair, said: \u201cIt should come as no surprise that when the government has run the NHS down to a state of near-collapse, more people are opting to go private. \u201cPrivate healthcare providers are making hay as those people who can afford health insurance or scrape the necessary funds together for treatment choose the independent sector. It is absolutely shameful that in 2023, in the sixth richest world economy, we can\u2019t diagnose and treat life-threatening illnesses such as cancer in a timely fashion,\u201d added Puntis, a retired consultant paediatrician. Brett Hill, an analyst at the Broadstone consultancy, said: \u201cThe incredible pressures on the NHS including record waiting lists, deteriorating public health and pay disputes are undoubtedly driving greater demand within the private healthcare sector.\u201d \u201cIn the short to medium term there appears little prospect of the strains on the public health system easing and we are likely to see continued strong demand for private healthcare in what could become a \u2018new normal\u2019 for this country.\u201d The rise in private healthcare activity is also due to the fact that growing numbers of employers are taking out private health insurance policies to help their staff, Hill added. Rishi Sunak will announce on Thursday plans to expand the role of the NHS app to prompt more patients on the waiting list to exercise their right to choose in which NHS or private hospital they are treated in a move to cut the record 7.3 million hospital care backlog."

            "date": "2023-05-18T09:10:54Z",
            "content": "Let\u2019s be clear. The current healthcare system in the United States is totally broken, dysfunctional and cruel. It is a system which spends twice as much per capita as any other major country, while 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, one out of four Americans cannot afford the cost of the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe, and where over 60,000 die each year because they don\u2019t get to a doctor on time. It is a system in which our life expectancy is lower than almost all other major countries and is actually declining, a system in which working-class and low-income Americans die at least ten years younger than wealthier Americans. It is a system in which some 500,000 people go bankrupt because of medically related debt. It is a system in which large parts of our country are medically underserved, where rural hospitals are being shut down, and where people, even with decent insurance, have to travel hours in order to find a doctor. It is a system in which, in the midst of a major mental health crisis, Americans are unable to find the affordable mental health treatment they need. It is a system where, despite our huge expenditures, we don\u2019t have enough doctors, nurses, dentists, mental health professionals, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals \u2013 and where we spend less than half as much of our healthcare dollars on primary care as do most other countries. It is a system in which, while we are desperately in need of more health professionals, young people are graduating medical school, dental school or nursing school, hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt; a system in which Black, Latino and Native American doctors and nurses are grossly underrepresented as medical professionals. It is a system in which healthcare for most Americans remains attached to employment. Incredibly, during the pandemic when millions lost their jobs, they also lost their healthcare. It is a system in which the quality of care you receive in this country is dependent on the generosity of your employer or whether you have a union. Not surprisingly, workers at McDonald\u2019s do not receive the same quality care as executives on Wall Street. All of that has got to change. The function of a rational and humane healthcare system is to provide quality care for all as a human right. It is not to make tens of billions of dollars every year for the insurance companies and the drug companies. Yes. It is long overdue for us to end the international embarrassment of the United States being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee healthcare to all of our people. Now is the time to finally pass a Medicare for All single-payer program. And that is the legislation that I am introducing in the Senate this week with 14 co-sponsors. In the House there will be over 100 co-sponsors. Let\u2019s be honest. The debate over Medicare for All really has nothing to do with healthcare. It has everything to do with the extraordinary greed of the healthcare industry and their desire to maintain a system which makes them huge profits. While ordinary Americans struggle to pay for healthcare, the seven largest health insurance companies in our country made over $69bn in profits last year and the top ten pharmaceutical companies made over $112bn. The corporate opposition to the desperately needed reforms of our disastrous healthcare system is extraordinary. Since 1998, the private healthcare industry has spent more than $11.4bn on lobbying and, over the last 30 years, has spent more than $1.8bn on campaign contributions to get Congress to do its bidding. The pharmaceutical industry alone has over 1,800 lobbyists on Capitol Hill \u2013 including the former leadership of both political parties. That\u2019s how business is done in Washington. Well, we intend to change that dynamic. We intend to fight for legislation which ordinary Americans want, not what powerful special interests want. Our Medicare For All legislation would provide comprehensive healthcare coverage to all without out-of-pocket expenses and, unlike the current system, it would provide full freedom of choice regarding healthcare providers. No more insurance premiums, no more deductibles, no more co-payments, no more filling out endless forms and fighting with insurance companies. And comprehensive means the coverage of dental care, vision, hearing aids, prescription drugs and home and community-based care. Would a Medicare-for-all healthcare system be expensive? Yes. But, while providing comprehensive healthcare for all, it would be significantly LESS expensive than our current dysfunctional system because it would eliminate an enormous amount of the bureaucracy, profiteering, administrative costs and misplaced priorities inherent in our current for-profit system. Under Medicare for All there would no longer be armies of people billing us, telling us what is covered and what is not covered and hounding us to pay our hospital bills. This simplicity not only substantially reduces administrative costs, but it would make life a lot easier for the American people who would never again have to fight their way through the nightmare of insurance company bureaucracy. In fact, the congressional budget office has estimated that Medicare for All would save Americans $650bn a year. Guaranteeing healthcare to all Americans as a human right would be a transformative moment for our country. It would not only keep people healthier, happier and increase life expectancy, it would be a major step forward in creating a more vibrant democracy. Imagine what it would mean if our government worked for ordinary people and not just powerful corporate interests.

            "date": "2023-05-31T01:24:41Z",
            "content": "The ACT government\u2019s takeover of Calvary public hospital has been described as a \u201cpre-dawn raid\u201d by the Catholic healthcare\u2019s chief executive. The territory government is expected to pass legislation Wednesday giving it power to compulsorily acquire Calvary public hospital, including its land and hospital assets, after announcing the plans for the takeover earlier this month. Calvary Health Care announced Tuesday it will be taking legal action as the \u201conly response left available\u201d if the government did not adjourn the bill\u2019s debate. The Catholic healthcare organisation that runs Canberra\u2019s second-biggest hospital had been negotiating with the territory government for the past year over the hospital\u2019s future. However, Calvary\u2019s chief executive, Martin Bowles, said the takeover came as a shock. Bowles told ABC Radio Wednesday morning that the hospital had been meeting with the government regularly about the development of the site, when \u201cAll of a sudden, I got a phone call \u2018Can you come in and meet with the minister?\u2019 \u201cI was told compulsory acquisition and cancelling a contract that has 76 years to run.\u201d Bowles said the ACT health minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, should have thought about staff and patients \u201cbefore she made this pre-dawn raid and gives people no notice\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to transition this thing in a matter of weeks. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Stephen-Smith said she disputed Calvary\u2019s position that \u201cthis came as a complete shock to them\u201d. Stephen-Smith said Calvary understood they had been unable to reach an agreement over the process of negotiation, including the terms the government had offered Calvary of a 25-year modern services agreement to operate the new hospital. However, Stephen-Smith acknowledged the takeover would have come as a \u201ccomplete surprise\u201d to the staff at the hospital. Senior nurses at the hospital wrote an open letter to Stephen-Smith in which they said it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d the territory government allowed the majority of Calvary\u2019s 1,800 staff to find out about the takeover via social media. Stephen-Smith said the government had done everything they could to reassure staff that before and after the acquisition \u201cthey will have the same jobs in the same team in the same hospital on the same paying conditions\u201d. The takeover was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d about Calvary\u2019s reliance on its Catholic faith in regard to the delivery of abortions, Stephen-Smith said. The archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher, on Tuesday asked supporters to join him in writing to the prime minister to \u201censure that other governments around Australia who might feel emboldened by what the ACT Government is doing will not be able to just tear contracts up and remove faith-based operators from public institutions\u201d. Fisher had previously said the takeover would allow the government to \u201cpush their anti-life agenda\u201d in an attempt to force Calvary to provide abortions, as well as euthanasia and assisted suicide in the future. Earlier in May, the issue entered the federal sphere when the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, labelled the takeover an \u201cattack on religion\u201d. Bowles said he was sceptical about the government\u2019s assertion that the takeover was not about religion. Stephen-Smith insisted: \u201cIt\u2019s about the fact that we have two public acute hospitals in the ACT and one of them is operated by a private provider. \u201cThat really limits our capacity to plan flexibly across the territory, to load share across the territory because we have quite a restrictive contract with that private provider, which just happens to be a Catholic provider.\u201d Stephen-Smith said the only relevance of Calvary being a Catholic institution was that it didn\u2019t have the capacity to solely negotiate any sale of land to the ACT government. \u201cThey actually need agreement from the Vatican, and we had no indication that they have in any way tried to seek that agreement as part of the negotiations that we\u2019ve been undertaking all of last year,\u201d Stephen-Smith said."

Histopath, which runs the Chifley site and a number of others across the city and regional NSW, will continue to offer PCR testing for Covid-19, flu and RSV for $49. \u201cIf I get sick I\u2019ll just dial [triple 0] because I live alone,\u201d Fairbairn says from her car. In the week leading up to 11 May, there were 12,980 Covid-19 cases, 59 deaths and 6,614 PCR tests. Fairbairn is among only a handful of people who come through the testing clinic while Guardian Australia visits on Friday. It\u2019s a far cry from two year\u2019s ago, when Fairbairn made homemade apple slice for the healthcare workers to try to help ease their stress. Greg Granger, the director of operations at Histopath, recalls 18-hour work days and news helicopters buzzing overhead during the first year of the Covid pandemic. \u201cThere was no experience we could reflect on to model how to plan this out,\u201d he says. \u201cThe concept of a drive-through pathology was just so unreal the first time it was floated.\u201d According to NSW Health, the testing peak was in August 2021, with 4.1m tests conducted that month. This was followed by about 3.2m in December 2021. But it\u2019s the outbreak of the northern beaches cluster at the end of 2020 that sticks in Granger\u2019s mind as the busiest time. \u201cThey all turned up for a test. I mean, all of them,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd speaking to the patients as they came through, they weren\u2019t symptomatic, they weren\u2019t in close contact, they just wanted to do the right thing ... they were prepared to wait three, four, five hours.\u201d But then the vibe started to shift. The worst time, Stanton says, was when travellers to Queensland were required to get a negative PCR test before arrival for Christmas holidays. \u201cMy god, that was horrible, and people were pissed off then and taking it out on us,\u201d she says. \u201cThe traffic [controllers] were spat on, you\u2019d get abused if the wait was too long.\u201d Prof Peter Collignon, an expert in infectious diseases at the Australian National University, says it is unsurprising referral-free testing is ending, given the days of needing to complete a large volume of tests is over. And at $100-$200 for a test, he says the money is likely better spent elsewhere in the health system. \u201cThe circumstances are different because the consequences are different \u2013 your risk now from Covid is 20 or 30 times lower than what it was in 2020,\u201d he says. At one point PCR tests were the major indicator of how much Covid-19 was in the community, but the number of people getting tested is now so low a more efficient and reliable measure is testing sewage. Collignon says the main group affected by the end of drive-through testing will be more vulnerable Australians who need a PCR to access antivirals. \u201cWe still need readily accessible PCRs for some people, I don\u2019t think it needs to be a drive-through, but we need pathology to test fairly quickly and not be delayed by a doctor,\u201d he says."

            "date": "2023-05-05T14:31:35Z",
            "content": "The Covid-19 pandemic, which has sickened or killed almost 800 million people over three years, no longer constitutes a global health emergency, the head of the World Health Organization has said. The WHO first gave Covid its highest level of alert on 30 January 2020, and its panel has continued to apply the label at meetings held every three months. While the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced on Friday the UN health agency was downgrading Covid\u2019s alert status, he also delivered a stark warning about its persistent threat. The disease still killed someone every three minutes, he said. \u201cYesterday, the emergency committee met for the 15th time and recommended to me that I declare an end to the public health emergency of international concern,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cI\u2019ve accepted that advice.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency. However, that does not mean Covid-19 is over as a global health threat. Last week, Covid-19 claimed a life every three minutes \u2013 and that\u2019s just the deaths we know about.\u201d The global health emergency status helped focus international attention on the Covid threat, as well as bolstering collaboration on vaccines and treatments. Lifting it is a sign of the progress the world has made in these areas, but Covid-19 is here to stay, health officials believe, even if it no longer represents an emergency. The WHO does not declare the beginning or end of pandemics, although it did start using the term for Covid in March 2020. Tedros said the decision to downgrade the alert status did not mean the danger was over, cautioning that the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed. \u201cThe worst thing any country could do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\u201d he said. Covid has officially claimed more than 6.9 million lives, and affected the health of more than 765 million others, according to the WHO. It said the true figures were likely to be much higher. Covid deaths globally have plunged by 95% since January, but the disease still killed 16,000 people worldwide last month alone. Despite the lingering danger, the pandemic has faded from mind in many if not most countries. This week, Tedros said testing and tracing efforts had \u201cdeclined significantly around the world, making it more difficult to track known variants and detect new ones\u201d. He has also warned of the ongoing impact of long Covid, which provokes a long line of often severe and debilitating symptoms that can drag on for months or years. The condition is estimated to affect one in 10 people who contract Covid, suggesting hundreds of millions of people could need longer-term care, he has said. Long Covid was devastating lives and livelihoods and wreaking havoc on health systems and economies, Tedros told the Guardian last year as he urged countries to launch immediate and sustained efforts to tackle the \u201cvery serious\u201d crisis. \u201cWhile the pandemic has changed dramatically due to the introduction of many lifesaving tools, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, the impact of long Covid for all countries is very serious and needs immediate and sustained action equivalent to its scale,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cEarly in the pandemic, it was important for overwhelmed health systems to focus all of their life saving efforts on Covid-19 patients presenting with acute infection. However, it is critical for governments to invest long-term in their health system and workers and make a plan now for dealing with long Covid.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-05T12:29:05Z",
            "content": "US deaths fell last year, and Covid-19 dropped to the nation\u2019s No 4 cause, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported. Covid-19 deaths trailed those caused by heart disease, cancer and injuries such as drug overdoses, motor vehicle fatalities and shootings. In 2020 and 2021, only heart disease and cancer were ahead of the coronavirus. US deaths usually rise year-to-year, in part because the nation\u2019s population has been growing. The pandemic accelerated that trend, making 2021 the deadliest in US history, with more than 3.4 million deaths. But 2022 saw the first drop in deaths since 2009. The 2022 tally was about 3.3m \u2013 a 5% decline from 2021 but still much higher than in the years before the pandemic. The CDC cautioned that last year\u2019s numbers are preliminary and may change a little after further analysis. Coronavirus-associated death rates fell for nearly all Americans. The virus was deemed the underlying cause of about 187,000 US deaths last year, accounting for about 6% of deaths. The highest Covid-19 death rates were in the south and in an adjacent region that stretches west to Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, the CDC said. The death rates for heart disease and cancer increased during the pandemic, the CDC said. The cancer death rate had been falling for 20 years before coronavirus hit. The CDC report indicated a slight decline in injury deaths last year, falling to about 218,000 from about 219,500 the year before. That would be a surprise, given recent trends in rising drug overdose and gun deaths, but figures are preliminary. Meanwhile, earlier this week, the CDC reported that the rate of drug overdose deaths involving the synthetic opioid fentanyl more than tripled in the US from 2016 through 2021. Fentanyl is up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine, and has increasingly been mixed with other illicit drugs. The CDC said the rate of drug overdose deaths involving fentanyl increased from 5.7 per 100,000 people in 2016 to 21.6 per 100,000 in 2021. A week ago, the agency also reported that US cigarette smoking dropped to another all-time low last year, with one in nine adults saying they were current smokers. Electronic cigarette use rose, to about one in 17 adults. Just over 11% of Americans regularly lit up cigarettes last year, the lowest level since 1965, the CDC said."

            "title": "The UK\u2019s Covid-19 inquiry was set up to uncover the truth. So why are bereaved people being silenced? | Saleyha Ahsan",
            "date": "2023-05-11T11:00:24Z",
            "content": "\u201cNo more fucking lockdowns \u2013 let the bodies pile high in their thousands,\u201d Boris Johnson is alleged to have said in the months leading up to Christmas 2020. In December that year, healthcare professionals and scientists were incredulous at the scenario; rising Covid deaths, increased infection rates and the Johnson government\u2019s commitment for England to have an unrestricted Christmas. Johnson had reluctantly approved a further lockdown on 31 October 2020 when he allegedly uttered those words, and four weeks later it was lifted. But by then the Covid-19 genie was out of the bottle and pile high the bodies did. Among them, my father\u2019s, Ahsan-ul-Haq Chaudry, a retired teacher, who gave his all for his six children to fulfil their ambitions to work in healthcare. Five of us are doctors who worked on the Covid-19 frontline. As it stands, the Covid-19 inquiry doesn\u2019t want to hear from us. Johnson has denied saying those words. His former adviser, Dominic Cummings, told a select committee he heard him say them. The families of the bereaved were reported to be furious as the story broke. I still am. Knowing the truth helps us understand why we lost our loved ones during the UK government\u2019s mismanaged pandemic response, in which, sadly, saving lives was as much in the hands of inept politicians and their civil servants as it was the doctors. This is why the Covid-19 inquiry has to get it right. It\u2019s time for cold, hard facts. Here\u2019s one. More than 127,000 deaths from Covid-19 happened on Johnson\u2019s watch. Johnson epitomises the excesses of the right: its values, its scruples, or lack of them. The Covid-19 inquiry hearings will begin in June and those who adhere to his ethos are rallying, just like they did to get Brexit over the line. Some of the same people are now trying to write an alternative narrative and defend the indefensible. They have the money, influence and connections to affect the course of events. And now they have their sights set on the inquiry. Journalist Isobel Oakeshott was a core team Brexit member. Her opinion piece in the Telegraph earlier this month effectively targeted and blamed bereaved families for obstructing the Covid-19 inquiry \u2013 the same inquiry that these very families fought for. Relatives of those who died \u201cpresent the greatest impediment to the public inquiry\u2019s progress,\u201d she wrote. GB News has a lineup of Tory MPs and Brexit leaders recycled into anchors and hosts. There, they affirm their opposition to lockdowns, to masks, to vaccines, without which the death toll would have undoubtedly been higher. On 2 December 2020 the second lockdown was lifted, and Johnson was encouraging the public to shop and plan for Christmas together without restrictions. I was making a Channel 4 Dispatches programme about the pandemic (Covid Critical: A Doctor\u2019s Story) and the coming tsunami of deaths. The senior healthcare professionals I filmed couldn\u2019t fathom the government\u2019s route. Then the death numbers began to climb and the moment to keep any sense of control had gone. My father caught Covid around 18 December 2020, and the next day, Johnson announced stricter rules on Christmas mixing. I was working in a Covid intensive therapy unit at the time. The patients were flooding in. My father was admitted to hospital on 20 December and started continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on 22 December, the day of the infamous press conference in which Allegra Stratton joked about a lockdown Christmas party happening at Downing Street. He passed away on 28 December. It led me to want answers, and as part of my journey to understand I met others who were searching, too. I joined the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, who were pushing for an independent public inquiry. After numerous promises and deadlines, Johnson finally relented and appointed Heather Hallett as the chair. The first hearings have not even begun, but many already have doubts about what it is able to deliver. The Listening Project, now renamed Every Story Matters, is an idea unique to this inquiry, where anyone and everyone who has anything to say about the pandemic can do so. And everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. But to ensure the bereaved are indeed central to the inquiry, as promised, they should be separated from other participants. Should people who were bereaved have to compete to be heard against someone who opposed lockdown? Should I be offering the account of my father\u2019s painful death alongside anti-lockdown proponents? By not ringfencing those who were bereaved, Lady Hallet is opening the door to allow the right to shout loudest \u2013 and it suits some members of this particular brand of the right that the dead are not treated with the dignity they deserve, with consideration as a group core to this inquiry. The inquiry proposes to allow only one bereaved person from each country in the UK to speak at the first hearing. That\u2019s why I will not be participating in it. Instead, I am a year into making my next film, which starts with the death of my father. It charts the inquiry\u2019s journey, which includes the unanticipated narrative of attacks against the bereaved. The inquiry could ensure that my film is an uncommissionable, predictable documentary, if it just does what it is supposed to do: ensure a comprehensive, thorough and fair inquiry that delivers lessons to save lives in a future event and provides a path to accountability. As it stands, the route the inquiry is choosing to take is promising to make my film essential viewing.

            "date": "2023-05-24T12:55:57Z",
            "content": "China has overtaken the US to become the biggest contributor to nature-science journals, in a sign of the country\u2019s growing influence in the world of academic research. The Nature Index, which tracks data on author affiliations in 82 high quality journals, found that authors affiliated with Chinese institutions are more prolific than their US counterparts in physical sciences, chemistry, Earth and environmental sciences. The only category in which the US is still in the lead is life sciences. The finding comes from a snapshot of the Nature Index\u2019s data taken in April. The full data for 2022 will be released this year. Other organisations that track scientific research have also found the balance shifting towards China. Last year, a report by Japan\u2019s National Institute of Science and Technology Policy found that between 2018 and 2020, Chinese research accounted for a greater share of the top 1% of the most frequently cited papers than US studies. That report also found that China published a yearly average of 407,181 scientific papers, ahead of the US\u2019s 293,434. Citations of Chinese research have increased because of references to the sequencing of the Covid-19 genome. But although rankings of scientific research now place China ahead of the US, the two countries are the biggest bilateral research collaborators and many of China\u2019s most-cited papers are produced in collaboration with international researchers. As relations between the US and China sour it has become harder for scientists from those two countries to collaborate. Between 2018 and 2022 the US justice department\u2019s china initiative, which had aimed to root out Chinese spies in US academia, resulted in more than 100 scientists losing their jobs. Chinese universities also scrutinise collaborations with foreigners. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, has pushed for the country to become a world leader in scientific research. In February, he said the government would boost research funding as academia increasingly became a frontier for technological competition. But Chinese researchers say they are pressured to prioritise quantity over quality, and there have been allegations of fraud or low-quality research being produced in order to boost the volume of output. In 2020, the Ministry of Science and Technology banned universities and research institutions from offering financial incentives for publishing more papers. Elisabeth Bik, a microbiologist, has uncovered hundreds of cases of unsubstantiated research coming from China. Bik has identified almost 650 examples of papers that use images seemingly from the same source. The research appears to come from a \u201cpaper mill\u201d, a company that produces scientific papers on demand, often using fraudulent images or by selling the same pictures to multiple researchers."

            "date": "2023-05-03T05:21:22Z",
            "content": "A Chinese citizen journalist who disappeared three years ago while reporting on the Wuhan coronavirus lockdown \u2013 and was later revealed to have been detained by authorities \u2013 has reportedly been released. Fang Bin was let out of detention on Sunday, according to multiple media reports that cited people close to the family. The reports said he had gone to Beijing, where some of his family live, before being sent back to Wuhan on Monday morning, where he remains under strict supervision. A Chinese human rights monitoring group said neither Beijing nor Wuhan authorities wanted responsibility for Fang, and were pushing him between the two cities. Fang was among a number of Chinese people who were targeted by authorities for publicly reporting the events of the world\u2019s first major Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown. He and fellow citizen journalist Chen Qiushi, disappeared from Wuhan in February 2020. Chen resurfaced in September 2021 in a video broadcast live on his friend\u2019s YouTube feed, saying he had suffered from depression. He did not provide details about his disappearance. Fang\u2019s disappearance was shrouded in confusion and secrecy, with conflicting reports about whether he was in detention, living with his parents under supervision, or under surveillance at a designated location \u2013 a form of secretive Chinese detention that allows authorities to hold a person for six months without charge. Several reports have said his family feared speaking out about the case. On Sunday, the Associated Press quoted a source who claimed Fang had been sentenced to three years in prison for \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble\u201d, a vague charge traditionally used against political dissidents. Radio Free Asia added that he served his sentence at a correctional centre in Wuhan\u2019s Jiangxia district. In December 2020, former lawyer turned journalist Zhang Zhan was sentenced to four years in prison on the same charge, for her reporting in Wuhan. Zhang began a hunger strike shortly after her arrest and supporters have repeatedly expressed serious concern for her health. In 2021 Zhang\u2019s former lawyer told the Guardian that her sentence was \u201ca warning\u201d from the Chinese government, and suggested she was being severely treated in retaliation for her actions. China\u2019s government has consistently been accused of a lack of transparency since Covid-19 was first detected. Wuhan, home to 11 million people, was the first of many cities around the world to go into a strict city-wide lockdown. Traditional and citizen journalists sought to publicise the disastrous outbreak, which overwhelmed hospitals and other services, but authorities sought to strictly control the flow of information, hindering reporting and arresting journalists and whistleblowers."

            "date": "2023-05-27T06:00:12Z",
            "content": "There has been a sharp rise in the number of cars with cracked tyres \u2013 which can result in an MOT failure \u2013 because of vehicles lying idle during the coronavirus pandemic. Figures from Kwik Fit, the car maintenance chain, show that its mechanics saw almost twice as many cars with premature cracking last year compared with before the lockdowns. When vehicles are idle \u2013 which happened frequently during the pandemic as a result of people\u2019s movements being limited by multiple lockdowns \u2013 the rubber in the tyres can degrade more quickly, resulting in the cracks and flat spots. Significant cracks can mean the tyre needs to be replaced, while severe damage can result in an MOT failure. Kwik Fit\u2019s Roger Griggs says the company, which has more than 600 centres in the UK, experienced a sharp increase in sidewall cracking compared with five years ago. \u201cThe proportion of tyres we inspected in 2021, showing premature cracking, rose by more than 50%, and in 2022 it spiked to nearly double the 2018 figure. \u201cAs this is typically a result of under use, it would seem that the pandemic could well have been a factor, with many cars being used very little, if at all, for months on end,\u201d he says. \u201cTyre formulations use the motion of the car to help keep the rubber pliable.\u201d A car may fail its MOT if the cracking is substantial, and it is a problem that cannot be reversed. Smaller cracks can be managed by regular cleaning and use, and it is also important to ensure that tyres are kept at the correct pressure. Drivers who have not used their cars frequently over the past few years are advised to have the tyres checked. In the worst-case scenario, bad cracking may cause a blowout while driving. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which approves people to be MOT testers, says unsafe tyres have always been a big factor in MOT failures. \u201cWhile it is the driver\u2019s responsibility to look after their vehicle, we always encourage motorists to regularly check their car remains safe throughout the year, and that any defects are addressed as quickly as possible,\u201d it says. The insurer LV= said recently that an increasing number of motorists are not addressing problems with their cars as the cost of living crisis continues. The company\u2019s breakdown provider, Britannia Rescue, says the number of callouts where the vehicle did not have a MOT was up by 78%. According to LV=, the data \u201cis worrying, as this neglect could easily impact the safety of a vehicle and could put yourself, passengers and others in real danger\u201d."

            "date": "2023-05-02T05:00:55Z",
            "content": "Volunteering is at a historic low in England, with two different pieces of research revealing the damaging, long-term effect the pandemic has had. There is just one week to go before the Big Help Out, an official part of the coronation weekend designed to create one of the biggest community activations in British history. But the Time Well Spent 2023 report from National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), which surveyed 7,000 adults, found that those raising money or taking part in sponsored events has fallen by 48%, from 11% to 6%, since 2018. The report also found that those organising or helping to run an activity has fallen by 52%, from 14% to 7%, and those campaigning on behalf of a charity has gone down by 49%, from 8% to 4%. \u201cThe impact of Covid on volunteering has been profound,\u201d said Sarah Vibert, CEO of NCVO. \u201cPeople who were lifelong volunteers broke their habit during the pandemic and haven\u2019t yet got back to it. Millions more who would have committed to longer-term volunteering didn\u2019t have the chance.\u201d More data from the Charities Aid Foundation\u2019s (CAF) UK Giving report found that only 13% of people said they volunteered in the last year, compared with 17% pre-pandemic, representing about 1.6 million fewer people volunteering over the past five years. CAF\u2019s report also reveals that volunteering is overwhelmingly the preserve of elderly people: only 6% to 7% of people aged 16 to 44 had volunteered in the past year, and just 5% of 45- to 54-year-olds. At least 10% of those aged 65 and older, in contrast, had volunteered. But some experts and grassroots organisations have warned that the goal of the Big Help Out to inspire the next generation of volunteers is compromised by its explicit links to the monarchy. \u201cI would have liked to volunteer but by making the event part of the coronation, I can\u2019t do it,\u201d said Quamina, founder of Dope Black Queers. \u201cThe monarchy is the very antithesis of what my charity is about \u2013 many of the difficulties we face in society are a direct result of colonialism and the monarchy, both historically and how they operate now.\u201d Shanelle Webb, who runs the Soul Shack, a Black and youth-led social enterprise in the London borough of Lambeth, agreed that linking the Big Help Out to the drive to find more volunteers was problematic. \u201cI think a lot of my service users would be disappointed in my charity if we took part,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact the coronation is costing so much money is an issue: that makes its call for volunteers to work for free to help people struggling with the cost of living look like it\u2019s not really about people: it\u2019s just about making the coronation look good.\u201d The Time Well Spent survey also revealed the positive impact that volunteering has on people\u2019s mental and physical wellbeing. Vibert said: \u201cGiven how important volunteering is to our social fabric \u2013 and how much people get out of it \u2013 we need an urgent focus on helping people find opportunities that suit them.\u201d But Ed Mayo, chief executive of Pilotlight, which assists charities to succeed, questioned whether a short-term drive like the Big Help Out could turn the volunteering crisis around. \u201cWe need to change the social norm around volunteering,\u201d he said. \u201cResearch proves that a one-off event can\u2019t do that: it requires long-term targeting of the public over many years.\u201d Prof Matthew Flinders from the University of Sheffield\u2019s politics department agreed. \u201cThe challenge is to sustain the energy, the positive heat that is generated for the longer term,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise the Big Help Out will just be a flash in the pan.\u201d"

            "content": "Once we could talk of nothing else. Now we barely speak of it at all. A leading Chinese epidemiologist has warned that there could be up to 65m cases of Covid-19 a week in his country by the end of June. Yet there appears to be little concern within China, and there is certainly little attention outside it. When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared earlier this month that the Covid pandemic was no longer a global health emergency, the announcement was greeted not with cheers or even muted celebration, but with what seemed to be utter indifference. To some it may have seemed a statement of the obvious. Vaccines and treatments have made the disease far less dangerous and frightening to most. A disease that claimed millions of lives, ravaged economies and upended societies has become an afterthought \u2013 though as the WHO\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, pointed out, it is still killing someone every three minutes. But the silence is also, perhaps, a reflection of the pandemic\u2019s enduring impact. It dominated our lives for so long that for many the instinctive reaction is to try to put it from their minds. For those who lost a loved one, or battled to save lives in ICUs, the subject may be too traumatic to revisit. Some may feel embarrassed to discuss the lingering effects of unemployment, loneliness, or concerns about elderly parents or stressed children, when for others life was even worse. The cost of living crisis, the war in Ukraine and the growing impact of the climate emergency have brought new worries. To others, this silence can seem uncanny, even incomprehensible. Some are living with the pandemic\u2019s consequences in the most literal sense: on one estimate, 65 million people worldwide have experienced long Covid, though most have recovered. For those who are clinically vulnerable, the abandonment of precautions and lack of discussion of risks may make them feel less safe. Health systems are struggling to recover. Tens of millions of children have missed routine vaccinations. And economic consequences have played out around the world \u2013 bearing out a 2020 IMF analysis which found that social unrest often arrives around a year after pandemics, because of lower economic growth and increased inequality. A World Bank report released this spring warned of the decades-long consequences of reduced human capital. In Bangladesh, for example, toddlers tested on their cognitive and social-emotional development in 2022 lagged far behind those tested pre-pandemic \u2013 a decline that the report suggests could translate into a 25% reduction in earnings as adults. The impacts were markedly worse for children from poorer backgrounds. A global literacy survey has shown widespread significant declines in reading levels. Amid the immense costs, there are perhaps some small gains. While mothers took on a disproportionate share of household labour in the pandemic, there are some signs that it may have encouraged a long-term shift towards greater paternal involvement in caregiving in the UK. Remote working has been a true boon to some employees. Talking about what went right and wrong matters not only in trying to fix some of the ongoing damage from this pandemic, but also in preparing for the next one. It might allow us to better protect health workers or safeguard vulnerable children, minimise disruption to schooling or find better ways to ensure elderly people don\u2019t lose essential social ties. Covid is still costing us. We should at least heed its lessons."

            "date": "2023-05-30T20:30:03Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has been accused of attempting to cover up the actions of ministers during the pandemic as the Cabinet Office intensified its battle to withhold Boris Johnson\u2019s WhatsApp messages from the Covid inquiry. The prime minister insisted his government has been cooperating with the investigation but is facing increasing calls from experts and MPs \u2013 with some coming from within his own party \u2013 to hand over evidence without redactions. Both Labour and the Lib Dems accused the government of a potential cover-up, while relatives of those who died in the Covid pandemic questioned what ministers have to hide. The inquiry, led by retired judge Heather Hallett, has used its sweeping powers to request unredacted notebooks, diaries and WhatApp correspondence between Johnson and 40 senior government figures. But the government is opposing the request on grounds that it wants to protect the privacy of ministers and officials, and is considering legal action to prevent disclosure. Two sources with knowledge of the inquiry\u2019s requests said the Cabinet Office was resisting handing over the material from Johnson and his aide because they fear giving in will mean all other evidence from ministers, including Sunak himself, will have to be submitted in an unredacted form. Hallett has given the government another two days to hand over the unredacted information in relation to Johnson and one of his senior aides, Henry Cook, with the material now due by 4pm on Thursday. Refusing to comply with the inquiry\u2019s order is a potential criminal offence. A spokesperson for Johnson said he had \u201cno objection\u201d to his 24 notebooks and WhatsApps being given to the inquiry, and claimed government lawyers had already been given access to them. But the Cabinet Office released a new statement on Tuesday holding firm against giving the Covid inquiry uncensored material, with the government still considering the possibility of a legal challenge. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are firmly of the view that the inquiry does not have the power to request unambiguously irrelevant information that is beyond the scope of this investigation. This includes the WhatsApp messages of government employees which are not about work but instead are entirely personal and relate to their private lives.\u201d However, Bloomberg reported it had seen leaked legal advice from the government\u2019s most senior lawyer, Sir James Eadie, which suggested officials have been withholding evidence for the inquiry based on political sensitivity, rather than just personal details. It reported that the advice said: \u201cWe would be concerned by any approach which appeared to concede the principle that Cabinet Collective Responsibility material should be disclosed as a matter of course.\u201d The advice added: \u201cThat material will concern a number of ministers still in office, and potentially in the same office. On any view, it will be extremely recent and of the greatest political sensitivity.\u201d The government does not routinely retain WhatsApp messages between ministers and officials unless they contain government decisions. No 10 refused to comment on whether Sunak and current members of the government have yet been asked to hand over their correspondence and documentation in full to the inquiry. John Bell, a leading government adviser during the pandemic, said Hallett should be able to see communications between senior government figures. He added: \u201cFirst of all, give her access. These are people who are working for the public. If there\u2019s something deeply private and personal they shouldn\u2019t have been using their official context for that. This should all be accessible to the inquiry. But then the inquiry should be a bit careful that they don\u2019t get sucked into a load of sideshows which are not really central to what they are trying to do, but they\u2019ll be able to work that out.\u201d Others to question the government\u2019s actions include Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who said the apparent \u201creluctance\u201d by the government to hand over what was requested \u201cseems a nonsense\u201d. Speaking to TalkTV, she added that as much contemporary evidence as possible was vital to ensuring the inquiry could look into serious issues about the handling of the pandemic. She said Hallett \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like a woman who\u2019s about to roll over \u2026 probably rightly so\u201d and added there would be \u201cless pain for the government if they hand [the files] over quickly\u201d. Labour said the situation had the \u201cwhiff of a cover-up\u201d while the Lib Dems said this \u201cdog ate my homework-type excuse from the government simply doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny\u201d. Susie Flintham, a spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group, said the lengths the Cabinet Office is going to in order to prevent Johnson\u2019s material being shared \u201cshould alarm everyone\u201d. \u201cThis inquiry needs to get to the facts if it is to learn lessons to help save lives in the next pandemic. So why are the Cabinet Office standing in their way? Our members are wondering what they are hiding?\u201d she added. Bob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, told the BBC there was \u201csome cover-up going on here to save embarrassment of ministers\u201d, as well as the Cabinet Office in his view wrongly \u201cfighting for a principle of confidentiality\u201d. Jonathan Jones, a former government lawyer, suggested the government\u2019s actions were ultimately not likely to work because Hallett\u2019s inquiry has wide powers. \u201cIt might be viewed as an attempt to avoid handing over material which the government would prefer not to, but it\u2019s not likely to work because ultimately it will be for the courts to decide. So if it\u2019s a cover-up, it\u2019s not likely to be successful,\u201d he said. The controversy appears to have done nothing to smooth tensions between Sunak\u2019s government and Johnson, after the former prime minister was reported to police last week by Cabinet Office officials after the government-appointed lawyers found potential evidence of more lockdown-breaking parties in his diaries. Johnson has denied this. The prime minister and his predecessor were meant to have peace talks this week over issues such as the Covid inquiry and Johnson\u2019s long-awaited peerages list but this phone call has been cancelled. Sunak said on Tuesday the government was cooperating fully with the Covid inquiry and No 10 denied the suggestion of a cover-up, with the Cabinet Office highlighting 55,000 documents, 24 personal witness statements and eight corporate statements given to the Covid inquiry. The government argues that handing over unredacted notebooks and WhatsApp messages would be an affront to the privacy of officials and ministers, as well as hindering policy discussion. However, the inquiry has also requested proof in the form of testimony from a senior official that the government does not hold any WhatsApp messages or notebooks from the former prime minister. It asked for records of searches conducted and correspondence with Johnson to be provided. It is now two weeks before the first public evidence sessions and a new schedule released by the inquiry shows some matters such as vaccines, procurement and care homes will not be concluded until 2026 \u2013 after the next election."

            "title": "Covid-resistant bats could be key to fighting the next pandemic",
            "date": "2023-05-20T16:23:28Z",
            "content": "Widely depicted as evil spirits or blood-sucking demons, bats have had a poor press over the years. No vampire film, from Dracula to Buffy, has been complete without an entrance of one of these harbingers of death. But these grim portrayals demean the bat. We have much to learn from them, insist researchers who now believe bats could be crucial in helping us cope with future pandemics. As a result, a global genetics project has been launched to discover how bats avoid the worst impacts of some of the world\u2019s most pernicious viruses, including the agent responsible for Covid-19. \u201cBats have the potential to teach us a great deal about how to fight off disease,\u201d said researcher Emma Teeling, of University College Dublin, who played a key role in setting up the project, Bat1K. Bats are remarkable for a multitude of reasons, says Teeling. They are the only mammals that can fly; they live exceptionally long lives for creatures their size; and many of them use sound waves to locate their prey. They also come in a remarkable variety of shapes and sizes, ranging from the bumblebee bat, the size of an insect, to Australian fruit bats which have two-metre wingspans. Some bats catch fish, other species feed on insects \u2013 and three drink blood: the common vampire bat; the hairy-legged vampire bat; and the white-winged vampire bat. \u201cOther species have evolved the longest mammalian tongues so they can stick them down into huge long flowers, to get their nectar,\u201d added Teeling. However, the reason for scientists\u2019 current bat ardour stems from the discovery that they can host a startling number of potentially lethal viruses \u2013 including the coronaviruses that caused the Sars and Mers epidemics as well as the Marburg, Nipah and Hendra viruses \u2013 but without suffering any apparent ill effects. \u201cThere is a kind of peace treaty between bats and the pathogens they host,\u201d virologist Joshua Hayward, of Burnet Institute in Melbourne, said in Nature recently. Bats are also thought to be the original source of the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19. \u201cHorseshoe bats from Asia are considered to be the original reservoir of the virus that evolved to become Sars-CoV-2, which changed most likely in an intermediate species of mammal,\u201d said Teeling. \u201cThat animal became infected by a bat, probably in a market, changing the viral progenitor of Sars-CoV-2 into an agent that could spread through humans. The end result was the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d As a result, Teeling considers it most likely that Sars-CoV-2 was not created in a lab, given the amount of recent evidence suggesting that most likely happened accidentally during the mixing of animals in the market. These discoveries raise a key issue, however. How do bats act as reservoirs for so many viruses that are harmful to other animals, including humans, but are themselves left unaffected? It is a puzzle that scientists are now working to solve. \u201cThe answer has got to do with their ability to fly,\u201d said Teeling. Flight is enormously demanding, requiring the expenditure of massive amounts of energy for any creature that wants to take to the air. Releasing this intense energy within a mammal\u2019s body should then lead to the breakdown of some of its cells. Bits of DNA would be expected to break off and float around its body. In non-flying mammals, these pieces of genetic material are identified by immune cells and are often treated as signs that an invasion from a disease-causing organism is occurring. A counterattack is launched and this can trigger intense inflammation. In many cases \u2013 including those of Covid-19 \u2013 this inflammation is often the key cause of serious reactions that can lead to death. \u201cBut bats lack that intense response,\u201d said Teeling. \u201cOver the course of their evolution \u2013 which began around 80 million years ago \u2013 they have modulated their immune systems so that their responses have dampened down. Inflammation does not occur nearly so often or severely. As a result they can carry all these viruses without suffering dangerous reactions.\u201d In other words, bats \u2013 because they evolved to fly \u2013 had to develop immune systems that are far less likely to trigger damaging inflammation. In this way, they are able to deal with viruses without suffering the intense reactions that bedevil other kinds of mammals. Exactly how they do this is not yet clear but it is now the subject of intense scrutiny. One key approach involves the Bat1K project which was founded by Teeling along with Professor Sonja Vernes, of St Andrews University, with the involvement of other institutions such as the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, in Dresden, and the Sanger Institute near Cambridge. Its goal is ambitious but straightforward: to create high-quality genomes for all bat species. In this way, it should be possible to unravel the entire DNA instructions \u2013 which come in billions of units \u2013 that are carried by the 1,450 or so species of bat that have evolved across our planet. To date, only a handful of bat genomes have been sequenced, though scientists are confident that from these analyses it should soon be possible to unpick the precise ways by which bats avoid succumbing to the viruses they host \u2013 with the ultimate goal of using this knowledge to develop medicines that could mimic that behaviour in humans. \u201cBats are not responsible for bringing disease to humans,\u201d added Teeling. \u201cWe have encroached on their lives, not the other way round. More importantly, we need to be prepared for the next pandemic and if bats can point out ways to modify our immune responses speedily, that will demonstrate just how important they are to our world.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-02T07:00:02Z",
            "content": "Delays in rolling out a vaccine against childhood pneumonia in four of the world\u2019s poorest countries have been blamed for thousands of unnecessary deaths. South Sudan, Somalia, Guinea and Chad are four of the last African nations without the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), one of the most powerful tools against pneumonia in children. Estimates from the Global Burden of Disease suggest 40,000 children died from the illness in the four countries in 2019, which are all off track to meet UN targets to reduce deaths of children under five by 2030. Childhood pneumonia is the biggest infectious killer of children worldwide, claiming 700,000 lives annually. It is a disease of poverty, with almost all deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries, and most of them are preventable. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair that this vaccine is not yet available because every child has a right to survive and thrive,\u201d said Dr Ubah Farah, an adviser to Somalia\u2019s health ministry. She said pneumonia was a \u201cbig killer\u201d in the country, and noted that the Covid vaccine had been rolled out quickly by comparison. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do the same for children?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s double standards.\u201d Prof Fiona Russell, a vaccinologist from the University of Melbourne and the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute, called the delays \u201ca failure\u201d. \u201cHow many thousands of children have died while waiting to get this vaccine?\u201d she asked. The PCV targets the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia and was introduced in the US in 2000 and to South Africa in 2009. Most African states now have the vaccine, and studies show that hospitalisations and deaths fall significantly after rollout, including in Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. At the second Global Forum on Childhood Pneumonia, held in Madrid last week, delegates from South Sudan, Somalia, Guinea and Chad announced plans to roll out the vaccine in 2024 with the help of Gavi, a global health alliance that shares the cost that countries pay for vaccines. The four countries first planned to introduce the vaccine three years ago but struggled to meet Gavi\u2019s co-financing requirements. Gavi pays for most of the initial rollout, but countries must make a contribution, with a plan to eventually meet all the costs. Last year, Gavi was urged to be more flexible with how much it expects countries to pay. The rollouts were also delayed by Covid, and Guinea faced two outbreaks of Ebola, which hit the country and its health system hard, while South Sudan and Somalia are in the grip of a humanitarian crises caused by conflict and drought. Gavi announced at the forum that South Sudan and Somalia, as fragile states facing massive humanitarian crises, would now not have to pay for the vaccine introduction. \u201cThis is a revolution. Up until now, we never waived [the cost] for new [vaccine] programmes,\u201d said Veronica Denti, a senior programme manager at Gavi. \u201cThe principle of Gavi is that we want [governments] to find a way to pay for it because that\u2019s how you build sustainability.\u201d Chad and Guinea still have to find $200,000 t $300,000 (\u00a3160,000-\u00a3240,000) a year to receive Gavi support, added Denti. Russell said: \u201cIn these countries that are so troubled and so poor, the desire is there from the government but they can\u2019t find that extra bit of money. That means they don\u2019t have the vaccine, under-five mortality will still be huge, and it will be much more challenging for them to meet their Sustainable Development Goal target [to reduce child mortality by 2030].\u201d"

            "content": "An effective, affordable meningitis vaccine has been successfully tested in Africa, raising hopes for the elimination of a disease that kills 250,000 people a year. The NmCV-5 vaccine, developed by the Serum Institute of India and global health organisation Path, will protect against the five main meningococcal strains found in Africa, including the emerging X strain, for which there is currently no licensed injection. Vaccine trials were conducted among 1,800 people aged from two to 29 in Mali and the Gambia in 2021, according to a report published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers found that NmCV-5 generated a strong immune response against all five strains. Meningitis is caused by bacteria or viral infections that inflame the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. At least 60% of deaths occur in Africa, particularly along the \u201cmeningitis belt\u201d, which stretches from the Gambia and Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. According to research, people in Africa are twice as likely to suffer serious long-term complications from the disease than people in high-income countries, due, among other factors, to late diagnosis and treatment. The cost of available vaccines, which protect against four strains of meningitis, are currently too high for most African countries, which need tens of millions of doses. The MenAfriVac, rolled out in 2010, substantially reduced cases of meningococcal A, but large-scale epidemics linked to the other strains are common in Africa. NmCV-5 will be available in the coming months. Protection against the X strain is particularly important because it has the potential to spread rapidly and there are currently no vaccines to prevent or control it, say researchers working on the new vaccine from the Medical Research Council Unit the Gambia at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, and the Centre for Vaccine Development in Mali. Ed Clarke, a co-author of the study, said: \u201cWe are excited about the results. We expect NmCV-5 to provide children and young adults with reliable protection against meningitis caused by the meningococcal bacteria in Africa.\u201d It should be \u201cgamechanging for epidemic meningitis control in the \u2018meningitis belt\u2019\u201d, he added. \u201cWe look forward to seeing the vaccine rolled out in the region as soon as possible.\u201d The World Health Organization wants vaccine-preventable meningitis reduced by 50% and deaths by 70% by 2030. Ama Umesi, also a co-author, said: \u201cEpidemic preparedness is the way forward in providing available, affordable and accessible vaccines relevant to regions prone to meningitis outbreaks. \u201cHaving meningitis vaccines should be a public health priority to prevent catastrophic outcomes during an outbreak, and would be a gamechanger in the fight against meningitis.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-17T20:29:45Z",
            "content": "A new vaccine has been granted emergency approval to protect California condors from a deadly strain of avian influenza, federal officials said this week, amid attempts to pull the endangered species back from the brink of extinction. The emergency action underscores an outbreak that has alarmed the conservation community, which fears that condors, a vulnerable species that has spent decades in recovery, could be dealt a devastating blow. After first being detected in a deceased condor in late March, the illness has swept through the small flock of wild birds, which are closely monitored by agencies in the south-west. So far 21 condors have died, impacting eight breeding pairs, according to a statement issued by the US Fish and Wildlife service. The Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, or HPAI, is a virus that has been described as \u201chighly contagious\u201d by the agency. An April statement confirming deaths of the first infected condors in early April said the virus can spread quickly though \u201cbird-to-bird contact, environmental contamination with fecal material, and via exposed clothing, shoes and vehicles\u201d. Several condors remain in the care of experts, including a newly hatched chick whose egg was pulled from its contaminated nest before its mother succumbed to the disease. Officials and rescue workers remain hopeful that the orphaned baby, now being nurtured with the help of a plush condor at the Liberty Wildlife facility in Phoenix, Arizona, can soon be returned to the wild. For now the chick is nestled among blankets and its stuffed surrogate, awaiting placement with foster parents at the Peregrine Fund\u2019s captive breeding facility. Despite it being limited to one flock in Arizona, conservation groups are concerned that the deadly illness has already taken a devastating toll on the delicate condor population. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, this event has set our recovery effort back a decade or more,\u201d the Peregrine Fund, an organization dedicated to protecting birds of prey and a key federal partner in restoring and rehabilitating California condors to the wild, wrote in a late-April update on the HPAI impact on condors, adding that the new threat posed by avian flu \u201chighlights the need to address preventable and manageable threats, and rely even more heavily on proven strategies such as captive breeding to increase the wild population\u201d. Once abundant in the skies across their western range, which spans from the Pacific north-west to Baja California, Mexico, only a few hundred of these iconic and enormous vultures remain in the wild even after decades of dedicated breeding and conservation efforts. The fast-spreading disease is one of several threats condors have faced since populations were first decimated by hunting during the California gold rush, including dangers posed by the toxic DDT pesticide and lead poisoning from ammunition lodged in scavenged carcasses. Recovery has been slow. Condors don\u2019t mate until they reach maturity at around eight years old, and females only produce a single egg every two years. This dangerous strain of avian flu has rapidly spread across the US, killing millions of domestic and wild birds since it arrived in North America at the end of 2021. Though the virus is not considered a high risk to humans, it\u2019s been among the most devastating outbreaks for birds in the country\u2019s history. Roughly 58 million commercial poultry have had to be euthanized in attempts to slow the spread of the disease, which has also claimed the lives of hundreds of bald eagles and been detected in more than 6,700 wild birds, a figure widely considered to be underestimated. While the emergency-use approval by the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is limited to California condors, the agency is continuing work to develop options for other types of birds. Before administering it to condors, a pilot study has been initiated to test the vaccine on North American vultures \u2013 \u201ca similar species\u201d \u2013 to ensure there are no adverse effects. \u201cAPHIS approved this emergency vaccination of the condors because these birds are critically endangered, closely monitored, and their population is very small which allows close monitoring of the vaccine to ensure it is administered only to the approved population,\u201d the agency said in a statement issued on Tuesday. Along with the hopeful announcement that a vaccine may soon be ready to administer, efforts to isolate infected birds have been successful. Infections among the Arizona flock where the virus was found are holding steady. \u201cOur field teams have not detected any additional compromised California condors in northern Arizona since April 11,\u201d the Peregrin Fund posted in an update this week, adding that four birds under its care are showing signs of recovery. \u201cThe Peregrine Fund\u2019s captive breeding program is also in full swing, and new life is hatching,\u201d it added. \u201cOf 18 eggs laid, nine young have hatched and a new season for the recovery effort begins.\u201d The Associated Press contributed reporting"

            "date": "2023-05-02T17:28:11Z",
            "content": "The horror of the Covid-19 pandemic brought with it one small cause for optimism: the crisis accelerated the development of new vaccine technologies, with the potential to protect against other diseases. Yet this leap forward was accompanied by a dramatic backsliding in the delivery of existing vaccines, with 23 million children missing out on routine immunisations in 2020 and 25 million in 2021 \u2013 the largest sustained decline in three decades. The World Health Organization reports that more prevalent and severe outbreaks of preventable diseases, including diphtheria and polio, are already occurring. While three-quarters of the children who missed out lived in just 20 countries, mostly in Asia, Africa and Latin America, there were declines in richer nations too. The UK Health Security Agency has warned that uptake of the meningococcal vaccine, and the last routine dose of the combined polio, diphtheria and tetanus vaccine, fell significantly last year among adolescents. Covid-19 overwhelmed healthcare systems and personnel, while lockdowns kept people away from facilities used to deliver shots. Supply chain disruption affected the availability of doses and syringes. The WHO and others have now launched a drive to at least return to pre-pandemic vaccination levels, which were already plateauing. Catching up should be doable. Chad has actually increased its vaccine coverage since 2019. As Unicef warns, for many children, especially in marginalised communities, \u201cvaccination is still not available, accessible or affordable\u201d. This is the primary issue, and though it is not simple, it can be addressed. But even before the pandemic began, the WHO had identified vaccination hesitancy as a top threat to global health. Campaigns against diseases such as measles have been victims of their own success; since most people never encountered them, the threat began to seem less urgent or serious. Libertarian views, declining trust in authority and interest in alternative healthcare encouraged scepticism, along with the false claim of a link between autism and the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Doubt about one vaccine often spreads to others. The pandemic made things worse. Research by the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that the public perception of the importance of vaccines for children declined in 52 of 55 countries studied. The speed with which the new Covid vaccines were developed prompted concern as well as relief. But disinformation was also critical, with the WHO warning of an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of wild rumours and conspiracy theories. Though social media companies undoubtedly bear responsibility, the growth of political polarisation and sense of uncertainty help to explain people\u2019s susceptibility. The majority of people still value and want vaccines, and the rest are mostly not hostile but ambivalent or sceptical, often about particular vaccines. Treating them as crazed or foolish will not help. Showing respect, acknowledging their concerns and putting risks in context rather than dismissing them is more productive. There are sound reasons why some groups may doubt whether medical professionals or the state have their best interests at heart. As health experts have pointed out, focusing on hesitancy spotlights individuals \u2013 but underlying inequalities largely explain reduced take-up, and resolving them is key to improved public health in this as in so many other regards.

            "date": "2023-05-29T17:05:51Z",
            "content": "The former chair of the UK\u2019s Covid vaccine taskforce has described the use of psychedelics to treat depression as an \u201carea of real excitement\u201d in a talk at the Hay literary festival in Wales. Speaking at a panel event alongside the UK government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, Kate Bingham said she was hopeful that the drugs could have a positive impact on mental ill health. When asked by an audience member whether his 107-year-old grandmother, who has had depression for the last seven years, would benefit from psychedelic drugs or ecstasy, Bingham responded that \u201cthere is strong data now showing that different interventions can have effects on depression and mental health\u201d. The challenge so far when it comes to psychedelics, she said, is that \u201cit\u2019s been quite difficult to disassociate the trip from the actual reset of your mental health\u201d. If such drugs were to be prescribed for depression, it would therefore be difficult to regulate, she added. \u201cHow do you regulate psychedelics so they can be given safely to the over-85s or the young adolescents who are in a really bad way?\u201d asked Bingham, though she added that she thought the research would \u201ccome through\u201d. Vallance said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can slip your grandmother an ecstasy tablet. We\u2019ve got to test these things. \u201cOne of the really shocking things is how few people are in clinical trials,\u201d he added. The Covid Recovery trial, which Vallance said was \u201cthe best study in the world for looking at interventions at its peak\u201d, had about 11% of all Covid patients in UK hospitals on a clinical trial. \u201cThat is about 12 times more than you have for most diseases, when you have about 1%.\u201d \u201cThat can\u2019t be right,\u201d he said. Whatever you are testing he added, whether it is the possibility of treating depression with psychedelics or anything else, \u201cthe healthcare system needs to be much more geared towards testing these things properly, gaining answers as quickly as possible\u201d. Earlier this month, a number of psychiatrists and mental health charities wrote to the government calling for a change in legislation regarding psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms. The campaigners, which included the charity Campaign Against Living Miserably (Calm), think it should be legal for the drug to be used on the NHS and in medical research. According to research published in April 2022, psilocybin could be helpful for those with treatment-resistant depression. Professor David Nutt, the head of the Imperial Centre for Psychedelic Research, said at the time that the findings showed that psilocybin \u201cworks differently from conventional antidepressants, making the brain more flexible and fluid, and less entrenched in the negative thinking patterns associated with depression\u201d. However, since psilocybin is both a class A drug and a schedule 1 drug (it is classed as having no therapeutic value) it is difficult for researchers and medical professionals to access it. The call to reduce restrictions was backed by a cross-party group of MPs and was debated in the House of Commons on 18 May. MPs agreed that \u201can evidence-based approach is required in order for parliament and the government to pursue the most effective drugs policy in the future\u201d and called on the government \u201cto conduct an authoritative and independent cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and to publish the results of those studies within the next 12 months.\u201d"

            "content": "Martha Gill\u2019s argument that mental health definition has become so widened as to become almost meaningless makes a fundamentally important point (Comment). As a society, we have amalgamated several meanings under the umbrella term \u201cmental health\u201d. Mental health should be thought of as three concepts: \u2022 wellbeing that is relevant to all of us, whether we have a mental health disorder or not; \u2022 common mental disorder such as mild to moderate depression and anxiety, which can be discomfiting and need treatment; \u2022 severe mental illness such as psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe personality disorders, addictions and severe depression. As a psychiatrist, I note this third group remains one of the most neglected groups. Resources are scarce, there are not enough community, recovery and inpatient services and these are all understaffed. Several of us think the conflation of all three strands in media and public discourse has done society a great disservice and attention has shifted from where the need is greatest. Consequently, systemic discrimination and health inequality against the most disadvantaged groups hide in plain sight. Being \u201caware\u201d of mental health issues is not enough; we need to be mental-health literate so we can prioritise areas with greatest need. Dr Musa Sami, consultant psychiatrist, Nottingham While I agree with Gill about the need to destigmatise severe and enduring mental ill health, she has mischaracterised the purpose of our Mental Health Awareness Week campaign on anxiety. We are highlighting the scale of feelings of anxiety because we know they can become persistent and develop into more serious problems. In our polling of 6,000 UK adults, of those experiencing anxiety 45% were keeping it a secret and nearly a third were not coping well with those feelings. That\u2019s why our campaign focuses on encouraging people to share their experiences, and providing evidence-backed guidance on how to manage feelings of anxiety to prevent them from getting worse. An awareness week will not solve the mental health crisis, but it gives us the opportunity to share tools with people to help them cope with challenging emotions in a healthy way. It helps us normalise conversations so that people are more comfortable seeking support if and when they need it. We also need governments to ensure communities and environments support people to live well, which is why we are urging them to develop and deliver 10-year mental health strategies with a strong focus on prevention of poor mental health. Mark Rowland, CEO, Mental Health Foundation, Glasgow We have long held similar concerns to those of Gill in her excellent piece. The more we have campaigns raising awareness of mental illness but fail to have services to respond to those in crisis, the more we paradoxically reinforce the stigma we seek to erase. Only by recognising the profound pain of people with serious mental illness will we be able to separate their needs from those who can benefit from wellness initiatives. My experience, over three decades, is that, despite campaigns, many with conditions such as schizophrenia and severe depression can remain sidelined and forgotten. The downside of all the good that campaigns can do is to raise expectations that, if unmet, reinforce feelings of exclusion and despair. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive, Sane, London N7 On the wrong track?

Ruth Brandon London NW3 Politicians, show compassion We agree with Kenan Malik (\u201cIt\u2019s no longer \u2018the will of the people\u2019 to turn our back on asylum seekers\u201d, Comment): Britons want politicians to show compassion to those seeking asylum. We polled 2,000 people with Opinium and found more opposed than supported plans to imprison refugees without visas (41% vs 31%). Similarly, more opposed than supported using offshore detention centres (38% Vs 33%). We found respondents to be more likely to support proposals that treat asylum seekers with compassion, with 50% in favour of allowing family members of those living in the UK to join them, as is the case for Ukrainian refugees, twice as many who said they opposed the proposal. In a poll with YouGov and the Global Compassion Coalition, a majority of respondents said they wanted politicians to be more compassionate. Now is their opportunity to reflect more accurately the nation\u2019s wishes and abandon the illegal migration bill.

Too easy to open a packet. It\u2019s not our fault we eat junk\u201d, Comment). Until we gain pleasure from exploring our bounty, rather than mindlessly grabbing a ready meal or other poor-quality food, we will continue to graze on our broken food choices. Economics comes into play, thanks to mind-boggling price hikes, but there is a way around this: ditch the ultra-processed food and embrace the pleasures of real cooking. Carol Godsmark Chichester, West Sussex What\u2019s age got to do with it? It was recently made very clear to me that sex is regarded as the prerogative of young people, when I published my first novel, Because You Were There, at the age of 75. On receiving a preliminary edit, a large section was highlighted in which one protagonist, a widow, begins to feel the stirrings of attraction towards a man she first met half a century ago. My editor was uncomfortable with this, and suggested I should omit it. As I hope she will learn, age and sex are not mutually exclusive.

            "title": "Met police to stop attending emergency mental health calls",
            "date": "2023-05-28T17:24:20Z",
            "content": "The Metropolitan police will no longer attend emergency calls related to mental health incidents, the force\u2019s commissioner has said. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Sir Mark Rowley says he will order his officers not to attend thousands of calls they get every year to deal with mental health incidents. Rowley has given health and social care services a deadline of 31 August before the force starts its ban, which will only be waived if a threat to life is feared. The Met chief believes the move is necessary and urgent because officers are being diverted from their core role of fighting crime and patients who need medical experts are being failed when a police officer attends instead. The plan could cause consternation among ambulance workers, paramedics and NHS staff who are already under pressure as a result of cuts and at a time when mental health services are already stretched. Rowley\u2019s letter to the Met\u2019s health and social care partners was sent on 24 May, giving them a 99-day deadline to plan for the change. Police and health chiefs have been talking about relieving the mental health burden on police under a new national scheme called right care, right person (RCRP). But the letter reveals that Britain\u2019s most senior police officer has lost patience over the issue. He writes: \u201cI have asked my team that the Met introduce RCRP this summer and withdraw from health related calls by no later than 31 August. \u201cI appreciate this may be challenging, but for the reasons I have set out above, the status quo is untenable.\u201d Those reasons are set out in a section marked \u201cimpact on Londoners\u201d, where Rowley writes: \u201cIt is important to stress the urgency of implementing RCRP in London. Every day that we permit the status quo to remain we are collectively failing patients and are not setting officers up to succeed. \u201cIn fact, we are failing Londoners twice. \u201cWe are failing them first by sending police officers, not medical professionals, to those in mental health crisis, and expecting them to do their best in circumstances where they are not the right people to be dealing with the patient. \u201cWe are failing Londoners a second time by taking large amounts of officer time away from preventing and solving crime, as well as dealing properly with victims, in order to fill gaps for others.\u201d The Met is by far Britain\u2019s largest force, accounting for nearly a quarter of all officers in England and Wales. The letter cites data from a national police study that says officers spend almost a million hours a year waiting in hospitals for mental health patients to be assessed, the equivalent of attending 500,000 domestic abuse incidents or 600,000 burglaries. Rowley claims in his letter that Met police officers spend 10,000 hours a month dealing with mental health issues, and that it takes up to 14 hours to hand a patient over to medical staff. In what amounts to a broadside against the health service, he also says there are scores of cases a month in which his officers are called when patients waiting for treatment walk out and are reported missing. Rowley writes: \u201cTo illustrate further the pressing need for reform, on 28/29 April, the Met received the highest number of 999 calls we have ever taken [9,292 calls]. Only 30% of these calls were classed as crime related. \u201cThe extent to which we are collectively failing Londoners and inappropriately placing demand on policing is very stark.\u201d RCRP was an innovation from Humberside, where after a year of tense negotiations police and health services reached an agreement under which many mental health calls are dealt with by health professionals rather than officers. A report by His Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services in November last year found patients were getting better treatment, and that police had freed up resources. The inspectorate said: \u201cThe right care, right person approach means that vulnerable people receive the support they need from the right organisation. The force has experts within its control room to support those vulnerable people until help arrives.\u201d Humberside police estimates that the scheme has allowed it to reclaim 7% of officer time to be spent on crime fighting and prevention. The government wants the scheme to be rolled out across the country, but health chiefs would argue that austerity measures have left them short of the resources to cope with the demands for mental health services, with police effectively becoming a makeshift mental health service. Rowley has been impatient to \u2013 as he sees it \u2013 free up his officers, and hoped the scheme could start in March, the Guardian understands. The Met commissioner ends his letter by denying he lacks compassion: \u201cMy urgency does not speak to a lack of compassion for those in mental health crisis, quite the opposite.\u201d He summons health and social care officials to a meeting with one of his top officers and tells them to come with plans to pick up the work the Met says it will no longer do: \u201cI would ask that you come to that first meeting able to discuss how your organisation will be ready to respond to RCRP by 31 August.\u201d Some police chiefs believe the better resourced health service is dumping its work on police, who see themselves as the service of last resort. Chiefs talk of surge in demand after 4pm on Friday, when health chiefs are unable or unwilling to arrange out-of-hours cover. The Met said in statement: \u201cWhere there is an immediate threat to life, officers will continue to respond. \u201cWork is already underway in London to develop a concordat across health provision and this is very welcome, however in the interests of patients and the public, we urgently need to redress the imbalance of responsibility, where police officers are left delivering health responsibilities. \u201cHealth services must take primacy for caring for the mentally ill, allowing officers to focus on their core responsibilities to prevent and detect crime, and keep communities safe and support victims.\u201d It is the second big row Rowley has become embroiled in recently. He riled Max Hill, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service by accusing it of \u201ccherry-picking\u201d easier cases to improve its conviction rate. Hill hit back, saying he was disappointed by the comments which he called inaccurate and said they risked \u201cdamaging further the public\u2019s confidence in reporting crime and their confidence that justice will be done\u201d. The Met remains in special measures because of a litany of failings, and Rowley \u2013 who became commissioner in September 2022 - has vowed to clean up the force and make it better at fighting crime."

            "title": "NHS England mental health trusts record 26,000 sexual abuse incidents",
            "date": "2023-05-23T15:32:24Z",
            "content": "Karen (not her real name) was in her bedroom on a psychiatric ward when a male nurse sexually assaulted her. It was during the pandemic and she had been sectioned for her own safety following a long history of mental ill health. \u201cI was in my pyjamas, sat at my desk, and he exposed himself and masturbated in front of me,\u201d she says. \u201cI screamed and threw a chair between us. I probably only managed to actually say no because I\u2019d been in therapy for a year prior to that incident.\u201d Karen is not alone. A joint investigation by the Guardian and the British Medical Journal has found that thousands of vulnerable mental health patients have reported claims of being sexually abused in NHS hospitals. Data released following freedom of information requests to NHS trusts in England showed that 35,606 \u201csexual safety incidents\u201d were recorded in hospitals between 2017 and 2022. The term covers a spectrum of behaviours, from abusive remarks to rape, allegedly perpetrated by staff, patients or visitors. Three-quarters of the reports \u2013 26,434 \u2013 were made in mental health trusts, and nearly 2,500 of the alleged incidents of sexual violence and misconduct were by staff on patients. Experts have warned that this phenomenon is a symptom of a system that is underfunded, understaffed and where it is easier to hide abuse. This is compounded by the fact that inpatients at mental health hospitals tend to stay much longer than those admitted to hospital for physical illnesses. Andy Bell, chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, says: \u201cClosed institutions, where many patients are sectioned and in locked wards, are sadly more likely than other hospitals to place people at risk of abuse. \u201cMost staff working in inpatient mental health wards work exceptionally hard to help people to recover in a safe and compassionate way. But there are chronic staffing shortages, too many facilities are outdated, and bed occupancy levels in many wards are in excess of safe levels.\u201d Rob Behrens, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman, said: \u201cWe know that not only do mental health patients often not feel safe when receiving care, but they are not told how to complain about their experiences. If people are not empowered to speak up about their concerns, problems of safety will continue, and the situation will not improve.\u201d Too often, victims are not believed or concerns about their credibility and ability to withstand questioning in court mean that perpetrators of sexual abuse against mental health patients are less likely to be convicted of their crimes. Elizabeth Duncan, a partner at Slee Blackwell solicitors, says this makes legal action extremely difficult. \u201cI have not had a single case involving sexual assault of a psychiatric patient that has resulted in a successful criminal prosecution or even a charging decision being supported by the CPS,\u201d she says. The former victims\u2019 commissioner Vera Baird says the Guardian/BMJ investigation shows that the NHS is failing to protect vulnerable patients from predatory staff. \u201cThere\u2019s a section of people who can be raped at will, and nothing happens. They just don\u2019t get any justice, because all those reservations [about mental health] stop [the investigation] from going forward.\u201d Karen agrees. She says that when she reported her abuse, the other staff thought she was making it up. \u201cNobody believed me. They did nothing about it at all. Apart from saying that every person had to come into my room in pairs, because they were accusing me of making a false allegation.\u201d Jess (not her real name) from Colchester, Essex, feels she could not get justice after reporting being molested as an inpatient at the Lakes, a mental health unit run by Essex Partnership university NHS foundation trust. She says a male health care assistant offered to give her a massage and a hug. Despite saying no, he pinned her to the bed and stuck his hand down her top. Jess reported the assault immediately to the hospital and the police, but the member of staff was allowed to stay at work, before absconding, exacerbating her distress. She was awarded compensation and an apology from the trust in response to her civil claim over the assault and the trust\u2019s failure to investigate properly. The Leigh Day solicitor Cat Rubens, who represented Jess, said: \u201cToo often, the safeguarding procedures and reporting systems are opaque and difficult for victims like Jess to navigate. \u201cTrusts are public bodies with responsibilities under the Human Rights Act to properly investigate allegations of sexual assault against mental health patients. When they fail to do so properly, they risk breaching Human Rights duties towards patients, as well as damaging the public\u2019s trust in the healthcare profession.\u201d Following its 2018 report on sexual safety in mental wards, the Care Quality Commission now expects all mental health trusts to have a sexual safety lead, as well as \u201crobust processes to identify and report sexual safety risks, mitigate those risks and ensure learning is acted on in response to any incidents\u201d. Yet less than a quarter of mental health trusts have a dedicated sexual safety policy, the Guardian\u2019s investigation found. In January, the government announced an inquiry into patient safety in mental health hospitals following a series of scandals in which vulnerable patients were abused or neglected. But experts said ministers must go further. \u201c[The review] must be followed by urgent and concerted action to protect people from abuse in our mental health care system,\u201d says Bell. \u201cThat includes reforming the Mental Health Act so that patients have more safeguards and more of a say in how they are treated when they are most unwell.\u201d Meanwhile, the long-term mental and physical impact on victims can be devastating. Jess says she can\u2019t move on, as the experience has made her PTSD worse. \u201cThe trauma I went through is always there. Even now, I still have some flashbacks and I can get panicky,\u201d she says. \u201cI would find it very hard to go anywhere as an inpatient again, because I just feel so let down by the mental health system.\u201d The psychological trauma of her abuse in 2021 nearly cost Karen her life. \u201cIt\u2019s made all hospitals feel incredibly unsafe,\u201d she says. She was admitted to hospital this year with a pulmonary embolism, but had put off seeking treatment. \u201cI should have gone before, but I was too scared of being abused,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could have been fatal and I\u2019m lucky to be alive. Even so, I spent the whole time terrified of any male staff on the ward.\u201d Karen is adamant that she will never go back to a psychiatric ward. \u201cI would rather kill myself than risk being sectioned into hospital again, such is my phobia about the risk of sexual violence in hospital and the way I have been treated/accused when trying to seek help from those charged with caring for and protecting me.\u201d An Essex Partnership university NHS foundation trust (EPUT) spokesperson said: \u201cWe offer our sincere apologies for the distress experienced following this incident in 2018. \u201cAny form of sexual misconduct is completely unacceptable. We take all reports of inappropriate behaviour extremely seriously and clear systems are in place to ensure all reported incidents are recorded and investigated swiftly.\u201d A spokesperson for the CQC said: \u201cWhile the majority of health and social care services are delivered in a safe environment, we know that more can be done to ensure the sexual safety of both staff and people receiving care, especially the most vulnerable.\u201d The CQC is committed to \u201ctackling closed cultures which may prevent people from feeling safe or empowered to report incidents\u201d, she added. \u201cThere is also more to do to ensure that sexual safety incidents are reported and recorded in a consistent way that allows data to be shared and investigated more easily in order to understand and address risks to people\u2019s safety.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cAs part of NHS England\u2019s mental health safety improvement programme, we commissioned the National Sexual Safety Collaborative for mental health and worked alongside the Royal College of Psychiatrists to produce sexual safety standards. \u201cWe are now working to support frontline services to implement these improvements as part of a \u00a336m investment in learning disability, autism and mental health inpatient services.\u201d Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations. In the UK, Rape Crisis offers support on 0808 500 2222 in England and Wales, on 0808 801 0302 in Scotland, or on 0800 0246 991 in Northern Ireland. In the US, Rainn offers support on 800-656-4673. In Australia, support is available at 1800Respect (1800 737 732). Other international helplines can be found at ibiblio.org/rcip/internl.html"

            "date": "2023-05-30T16:58:56Z",
            "content": "Where Hull leads, London follows. At least, that is the case when it comes to a radical new approach to policing that has led to the Humberside constabulary achieving the highest arrest and crime detection rates in the country \u2013 by refusing to attend most mental health calls. When a letter from the Metropolitan police commissioner was leaked to the Guardian this week warning that from September his officers would no longer attend unnecessary mental health calls, Lee Freeman had a jolt of recognition. The pioneering chief constable of Humberside police had issued a similarly blunt deadline to health partners back in 2019 when he decided far too much police time was being spent attending calls over concerns for welfare, mental health incidents or missing people. Then, Freeman\u2019s force was receiving 25,000 such calls a year \u2013 11% of total demand. His officers were deployed to 78% of these. Most were unnecessary and 75% came from other agencies, Freeman recalled. \u201cWe\u2019d get someone saying: \u2018We\u2019re ringing you from the hospital, we had a voluntary patient who was due to attend for an appointment because they\u2019ve got depression and they\u2019ve not turned up. Can you go check if they\u2019re OK, please?\u2019 And we would.\u201d Other times, officers were called to detain someone having a mental health episode and then take them to a place of safety but ended up spending \u201c10, 12, sometimes 16 hours\u201d waiting for a crisis bed to be found, Freeman said. \u201cIt was completely unsustainable.\u201d He came up with what became Right Care, Right Person (RCRP), a strategy of deploying officers to only the most essential mental health-related calls and diverting the rest of the cases to dedicated health professionals. It is so successful that it is now being not just copied by the Met but turned into a \u201cnational partnership agreement\u201d to be adopted across England and Wales. Three years on from implementing RCRP, Humberside police attend an average of 508 fewer incidents a month, saving 1,440 officer hours each month, according to Freeman. With those free officers he formed teams dedicated to targeting drug dealers and finding missing people. The results are stark: in the past two years Humberside police have arrested more people per 1,000 population than any other force in the country, and have the highest detection rate for all crimes. \u201cIt really did allow us to get back to basics,\u201d Freeman said. While the Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has given health providers in London less than four months to prepare for RCRP, Freeman gave Humberside health chiefs just over a year. A deadline was necessary, he recalled, because his initial warnings \u2013 to the chief executives of the local councils, mental health providers, hospitals, ambulance trusts and clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) \u2013 were not met with sufficient urgency. The response was \u201cmixed\u201d, he said. The health chiefs all seemed to think there was no immediate rush to change the status quo. Like Rowley, he put pen to paper. \u201cI did have to formally write and point out that from a legal perspective, actually I didn\u2019t have a duty of care under these circumstances, and I wasn\u2019t going to continue to assume that duty of care.\u201d That was in April 2019, and he set a series of deadlines, beginning in May 2020, after which his officers would be far more selective about attending four different sorts of calls: concern for welfare, walkout of healthcare facilities, transport to mental health provision and dealing with people having a mental health crisis in public places. His formal letters worked, and before long the CCGs found (Freeman\u2019s word) about \u00a31m in their budgets to fund additional mental health crisis suites and assessment beds. The ambulance trusts also found money to buy extra ambulances so that paramedics and not police officers would be the default transport providers for those in mental health crisis. Emergency call handlers needed training and support to turn down requests for help, working alongside experts from Mind, the mental health charity. \u201cMany of them have been in there for 10, 15, 20 years just saying yes. To suddenly say no to somebody on the phone, that was really worrying for our staff, because they do care about the people on the end of the line, and they want to help,\u201d Freeman said. He stressed that his officers were still turning up to 25% of mental health calls. The rest are triaged to health services in the call centre. \u201cThere are occasions when it\u2019s entirely appropriate for the police to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody is being violent or somebody is threatening anybody else or somebody is committing a crime, if somebody has threatened ambulance staff, we go.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-03T23:13:55Z",
            "content": "Women\u2019s lives are being put at risk by substandard mental health care during their pregnancy and in the first year after childbirth in most parts of the UK, a report has found. About one in every five women develops a mental illness at some point during the perinatal period, the stage from pregnancy up to a year after giving birth. However, none of the health and social care boards in Northern Ireland or Wales met the national quality standards created by the Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 Perinatal Quality Network (PQN). Maternal deaths due to mental health problems are also increasing, with maternal suicide being the lead cause of deaths in the first year after childbirth. Despite this, the report by the Maternal Mental Health Alliance (MMHA) found that many specialist perinatal mental health services do not receive adequate attention or investment, or meet the quality standard of care. The minimum standard of care that women, babies and families should receive is defined as PQN standards type 1. In England, only 16% of the specialist perinatal mental health community teams met these standards and have also begun delivering on all NHS Long Term Plan ambitions, which aims to ensure patients get the care they need early on. Teams are assessed on seven key areas in delivering care, including criteria for patient care plans, the minimum number of consultant perinatal psychiatrists per 10,000 births and instructions on the discharge and transfer of care. Two out of 14 Scottish health boards met PQN standards for type 1, and there was inadequate provision in remote areas such as Orkney, Shetland Islands and Western Isles. Eleanor, a mum from Bromley, said: \u201cWhen I realised that what I was experiencing wasn\u2019t just \u2018the baby blues\u2019 I reached out to my mental health midwife and was referred to my local perinatal mental health team. It was invaluable being under their care. Thanks to the support I received, my bond with my daughter is so strong now and I\u2019m really enjoying being a mum. Every family should have access to the same care if they need it.\u201d The report, which analysed FoI data from 70 NHS trusts across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, said that while overall provision and quality of services had improved, with many areas increasing their budgets, women still faced many risks as local areas anticipated an underspend, which affects the accessibility and quality of care. Over 2020 to 2021, the overall budget allocated to specialist perinatal mental health services across the UK was \u00a383,648,546. However, only \u00a374,285,606 of that was spent. In 2022 to 2023, the budget allocated increased to \u00a3135,737,671, yet the projected spend is only \u00a3120,119,199. The most common reason given for the underspend was workforce challenges, such as insufficiently resourced teams, made worse by unclear or late allocation of funds. One healthcare professional told the MMHA: \u201cWe are working far beyond funded capacity, which \u2013 as predicted and highlighted repeatedly \u2013 is now manifesting as increased sickness, stress, burnout and increased staff turnover.\u201d Dr Alain Gregoire, a consultant perinatal psychiatrist and the president of MMHA, said: \u201cOver the last 10 years, there has been a growing understanding of the importance of specialist care for maternal mental health, which has led to welcome improvements across the UK. However, it\u2019s crucial that this momentum and commitment is maintained. \u201cNational and local decision-makers must ensure that allocated resources reach clinical services to ensure that mothers, babies, and families can access the care they need. We must grasp this exceptional opportunity to make a real and lasting impact on the lives of women, babies, and future generations.\u201d"

            "content": "If voters handed the prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019s conservative New Democracy party a thumping 20-point win and its best result since 2007 on Sunday, it was at least partly because they credited him with steering Greece to economic safety. Three mammoth bailouts totalling \u20ac280bn averted disaster during a decade-long crisis that reached its peak in 2015, and Greece only emerged from a draconian regime of spending controls ordered by its international lenders last summer. The human cost was immense. Unemployment peaked at 27.5% \u2013 and at 58% for the under-25s \u2013 as Greece\u2019s economy shrank by 25% in what economists now agree was a downturn that hit the country as hard as the Great Depression of the 1930s hit the US. In the five years from 2008 to 2013, Greeks became on average 40% poorer, according to data from the country\u2019s statistical agency analysed by Reuters. By 2014, disposable household income in Greece had sunk below 2003 levels. With unemployment soaring, many households became reliant on the pensions of older family members to survive \u2013 but repeated cuts left 45% of pensioners receiving monthly payments below the poverty line of \u20ac665 by 2015. That year, one in five Greeks were assessed as experiencing severe material deprivation, more than double the 2008 figure, and almost 4 million people \u2013 more than a third of the population \u2013 as being \u201cat risk of poverty or social exclusion\u201d. An estimated 800,000 Greeks had no access to medical treatment after losing their health insurance through unemployment during the crisis. Cases of severe depression almost trebled and, according to a study in the British Medical Journal, the suicide rate rose by 35%. Greece also suffered a devastating brain drain. The population declined by 400,000 between 2010 and 2015, with a 2013 study finding more than 120,000 professionals \u2013 including doctors, engineers and scientists \u2013 had left since 2010. A subsequent study found that of all those who fled the country, about 90% had a first degree, more than 60% a master\u2019s degree, and 11% a PhD. In his first four-year term, Mitsotakis \u2013 a 55-year-old Harvard-educated former banker \u2013 oversaw unexpectedly high growth, a steep fall in unemployment and a country on course to regain its investment-grade credit rating after years of \u201cjunk\u201d status. Greece\u2019s GDP has now more or less returned to where it was when it first defaulted in 2010. Unemployment has more than halved from its peak, and taxes have gone down \u2013 and pensions and the minimum wage up \u2013 for the first time since the crisis began. The conservatives say they have overseen the country\u2019s largest infrastructure programme since 1975, with more than 2,300 projects under way across the country, including motorways, airports, ports and marinas. Things are still far from perfect. The severe recession and years of emergency borrowing left Greece with a huge national debt \u2013 it reached \u20ac400bn last December \u2013 and hit household incomes so hard they could take another decade to recover. Crippling austerity \u2013 tax rises, public sector wage controls, pension cuts \u2013 left many exhausted and sunk into private debt, low wages and job insecurity; last year, almost half of all Greek households could barely get by on their monthly income. But even if Europe\u2019s cost of living crisis is biting harder in Greece than elsewhere, the country is still a long way from where it was a decade ago, when despair turned into riots on the streets \u2013 and for that, voters appear to have thanked Mitsotakis."

            "date": "2023-05-16T11:12:44Z",
            "content": "Analysts expect Turkey\u2019s economic crisis to worsen after President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan came top in the first round of the country\u2019s presidential election and his party gained a parliamentary majority in a legislative vote. The Turkish lira, which has devalued steadily in recent years including halving in value in one year alone, dropped close to a historic low as markets opened the morning after Sunday\u2019s vote. President Erdo\u011fan subverted expectations by coming out on top, gaining 49.5% of the vote in the presidential race compared with 44.9% for his challenger, Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu. As neither candidate reached the 50% threshold needed to win outright, a runoff vote will take place on 28 May. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s governing alliance, made up of his Justice and Development party as well as a group of nationalist parties, also surged to secure a parliamentary majority. Widespread concern about a cost of living crisis did not drive away support for Erdo\u011fan at the polls, even though his unorthodox economic policies, including a long-term aversion to raising interest rates, have contributed to rising inflation and the increasing cost of food and other basic goods. \u201cHopes of an opposition victory and a return to orthodox policymaking have evaporated,\u201d wrote Liam Peach, of Capital Economics. \u201cInstead, there is now a very real risk that an Erdo\u011fan victory could lead to macroeconomic instability in Turkey, including the threat of a severe currency crisis and strains in the banking and sovereign debt positions further down the line.\u201d Turkey is the world\u2019s 19th largest economy, according to the World Bank. It has noted that the Turkish economic crisis of the past five years has been accompanied by efforts to support economic growth \u201cwith credit booms and demand stimulus\u201d. Economists from Bloomberg estimate the Turkish central bank has spent more than $177bn supporting the lira since December 2021. The Turkish Inflation Research Group (ENAG), which measures inflation on a basket of goods and services, recorded a 105.19% price increase last month on the previous year, adding that prices were up by almost a third compared with the beginning of 2023. The price of onions, a staple in Turkish cuisine, quickly became a talking point in the election after K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu released a video last month stating: \u201cNow, one kilogram of onions is 30 liras, if [Erdo\u011fan] stays it will be 100 liras.\u201d Erdo\u011fan hit back at an election rally, dismissing concerns about the rising price of food. \u201cOur cause is great. We know how to smash an onion with our fist and how to eat it. In this country, there is no [expensive] onion, potato or cucumber problem. We have already fixed problems in Turkey,\u201d he said. The US credit rating agency Fitch Ratings pointed to Turkey\u2019s dwindling foreign reserves caused by attempts to stabilise the lira, forecasting difficulties for the next government. \u201cRegardless of who wins, the next government will still face a challenging economic backdrop characterised by pent-up foreign exchange demand and pressure on the lira, a wide current account deficit, declining international reserves and high inflation,\u201d it said. The prospect that members of Turkey\u2019s six-party opposition coalition could secure victory in order to restore international confidence in the Turkish economy and return to more orthodox economic policies appeared increasingly unlikely. Speaking before the first round of voting, the economist Bilge Y\u0131lmaz, of the nationalist IYI party, said Turkey\u2019s economic crisis potentially outstripped anything the country had endured in decades. \u201cTurkey right now is deprived of foreign capital because it\u2019s not predictable, it\u2019s not trustworthy \u2026 there are effectively zero dollars left, for all practical purposes zero,\u201d he said."

            "content": "Our planet is facing some of its greatest challenges, including the climate crisis, political unrest and inequality. But while we channel our energy into tackling them, another crisis is quietly threatening the lives and futures of children across the world. Famine and hunger might not occupy a large slice of our collective consciousness right now, but if allowed to go unsolved, could become the defining humanitarian crisis of this century. It\u2019s a problem that World Vision is actively working to solve through the generosity of sponsors, aid work, and by educating people in the west about the extent of the issue. Understanding the impact of famine and hunger on some of our global community\u2019s most vulnerable members can be the powerful motivator we need to make lasting change. A complex, far-reaching problem It\u2019s difficult to think about one child going to school or hopping into bed with a rumbling stomach. Grappling with the knowledge that this is the daily reality for millions of children all over the globe can feel overwhelming. An estimated 50 million people across 45 countries are on the edge of famine. That\u2019s almost twice the population of Australia at risk due to natural disasters, conflict, the Covid-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, among other factors. In Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, where devastating crop destruction, loss of livestock, and drought have severely limited food supply, an estimated 13 million people are experiencing crisis levels of hunger, with almost half this group estimated to be living at \u201cemergency\u201d and \u201ccatastrophe\u201d levels. Swangiri, 12 months old suffering malnutrition. Image credit: Collins Kaumba In Somalia, an estimated 1.8 million children under the age of five are experiencing acute malnutrition, and globally, nutrition-related factors contribute to almost half of preventable deaths among the under-5s. Starved of choices The physical impact of famine, hunger and malnutrition is undeniable. Malnutrition can stunt physical development, and the effects can be compounded when it occurs in the critical period between conception and a child\u2019s second birthday. Malnutrition can make people \u2013 especially children \u2013 vulnerable to preventable diseases including scurvy, rickets and kwashiorkor, a chronic deficiency of protein and essential nutrients that manifests as a distended belly. A severely wasted child is 11 times more likely than a well nourished child to die from common childhood illness. And malnutrition can affect so much more than physical condition. Malnutrition in childhood can affect how the brain develops, which means malnourished children could face learning and cognitive difficulties later in life. The socioeconomic impacts bear consideration, too. Developmental challenges caused by hunger and famine rob children of choices over the course of their lives, affecting the kind of education, employment opportunities and income they receive. They can also fundamentally alter the way people interact with and contribute to their communities, making the cycle difficult to break. The road to recovery The problem of hunger and famine may seem unsurmountable, but solutions do exist. About 89% of severely malnourished children treated by World Vision in the decade up to 2021 made a full recovery. That\u2019s a remarkable result, made possible by World Vision donors and supporters. From starving baby boy to healthy school superstar. Swangirai, now aged 12 and his mother. Image credit: Collins Kaumba World Vision, whose child sponsorship program is well known to Australians, also recently mounted its biggest ever response to the global hunger problem. Global Hunger Response focuses on 26 of the hardest-hit countries and provides assistance including food and clean water, financial aid, healthcare, nutrition and hygiene services, and support for vulnerable groups such as women and children. So far, almost 20 million people have been helped \u2013 and that number is growing daily. The gift of childhood Swangirai is one child whose life was changed by World Vision supporters. As an infant in Zambia, he suffered extreme malnutrition, but his situation was turned around thanks to an emergency \u201csuperfood\u201d. The paste is made from nuts and skimmed milk powder and contains essential nutrients. It\u2019s a great source of energy and can be consumed straight from the pack, meaning it can help kids such as Swangirai regain their strength in as little as six weeks. A little over a decade later, 12-year-old Swangirai is a standout student, making his family proud of his academic prowess every day. He understands his life might not have taken the same course without support from World Vision and the donors who make a difference in the lives of children like him. \u201cIf you did not help me, I would have been dead by now,\u201d he says. Learn how you can help create change for a child living in extreme poverty at World Vision."

            "content": "Barbara was 59 when she decided she\u2019d had enough of working. The former chief executive of a multi-academy trust, now 63, had always wanted to retire early, but didn\u2019t think she could afford to. \u201cI was quite burnt out and desperate to change my lifestyle. I worked 70 hours a week for years \u2013 it was just exhausting,\u201d she says. \u201cI was lucky to have a good pension, but also quickly realised that when you retire, you just don\u2019t need as much money. All the activities that I do \u2013 my walking group and book group \u2013 they don\u2019t cost anything.\u201d Barbara, who also volunteers as a trustee for an academy trust, is one of many people in her age group deemed \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d. The economic inactivity rate for people aged 50 to 64 has slightly increased again, up from 27.1% between October and December last year to 27.2% between January and March 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics. The government has attempted to appeal to this group to return to the workforce to plug the gaps in Britain\u2019s economy, although chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s message that life \u201cdoesn\u2019t just have to be about going to the golf course\u201d was widely condemned. Since retiring, Barbara has moved back to her native Manchester from Bristol and has been able to spend more time with her family, providing a \u201cfair bit of childcare\u201d to her six grandchildren. She says she understands the government\u2019s concerns, but adds: \u201cI am making a contribution, because my childcare commitments allow my own children to remain full-time in the workforce.\u201d Barbara is one of hundreds of people who responded to a callout by the Observer asking Britons in their 50s and 60s how they have spent their time since they retired. Many reported a better quality of life as the primary reason for taking early retirement and that they were financially comfortable, thanks to paid-off mortgages, proceeds from house sales or generous final-salary pensions. Others, however, said they were involuntarily out of work, often because of caring responsibilities for elderly parents, children or grandchildren. Some were unemployed as a result of ill health, while a number were waiting for surgeries such as hip replacements. Dozens of people said they had retired recently because they could no longer cope with stress. Among them is Julie, 59, a retired secondary school teacher from Leicestershire: \u201cI stopped working at Christmas. I loved [work] for many years but it became too relentless. I am loving retirement. I\u2019ve started gardening, running, doing yoga \u2013 and am about to start pilates. I\u2019m doing some conversation practice with a local Syrian family and just started volunteering at my old school. \u201cI thought I might miss work, but I don\u2019t at all. I was a workaholic for 35 years \u2013 teaching took over everything.\u201d Martin, a widower and father of two from London, is among a number of respondents who reported being economically inactive because of unsuccessful job hunting. \u201cI took time off after my wife passed away and am now keen to get back to full-time work. I\u2019ve been unable to secure a job for nine months and counting,\u201d says the 55-year-old former finance director. \u201cI worry I won\u2019t ever find a job again. I have enough savings to last a few more months, but after that, I will be severely downsizing \u2013 meaning I\u2019d have to sell the house I just bought.\u201d For Andrew, 64, who lives in Bridlington, east Yorkshire, and had been working in construction management in the Middle East for decades, early retirement in his late 50s came simply because he could not find appropriate employment on returning to Britain. \u201cI had over 40 years of experience, but my qualifications weren\u2019t considered enough. Getting work in the UK would have required paying for certificates and further study at considerable expense \u2013 I wasn\u2019t prepared to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I became a buy-to-let landlord, simply because work had dried up.\u201d Louisa, 58, is one of many who said getting a job has been impossible because of caring responsibilities \u2013 in her case, as a full-time carer for her elderly parents and disabled son. \u201cI used to work in film and TV. Now I am one of millions of invisible unpaid carers,\u201d she says. \u201cI had no choice. My parents needed nursing, my son was without a suitable school place and had to be educated at home. I didn\u2019t want to live like this. \u201cNo work means no money or social contact, no personal satisfaction. I\u2019d love to go back to work, but I can\u2019t.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-17T05:15:54Z",
            "content": "Free nations must commit themselves to a free Taiwan and must be prepared to back it up with concrete measures, Liz Truss has said in a keynote speech in Taipei, in which she called for an \u201ceconomic Nato\u201d to tackle Beijing\u2019s growing authoritarianism. The former British prime minister said she had come to show support for Taiwan, which was \u201con the frontline of the global battle for freedom\u201d, under threat from a totalitarian regime in China. Truss arrived in Taiwan on Monday for a five-day visit, and is expected to meet senior government officials. Truss, who was prime minister for 44 days in 2022 after serving as foreign secretary for the year prior, is the most senior British politician to make the trip since Margaret Thatcher, and drew a rebuke from China\u2019s UK embassy, which said the visit was \u201ca dangerous political show which will do nothing but harm to the UK\u201d. Beijing claims Taiwan as a province of China, and Xi Jinping has not ruled out using force to achieve what he terms \u201creunification\u201d. Taiwan\u2019s government and people overwhelmingly reject the prospect of Chinese rule, and a potential conflict and its fallout are of key concern to the global community. \u201cWe cannot pretend we have meaningful deterrence without hard power,\u201d Truss said in a speech and panel discussion for a Taiwan thinktank, the Prospect Foundation, on Wednesday. \u201cIf we\u2019re serious about preventing conflict in the South China Sea we need to get real about defence cooperation.\u201d Truss said the world could not rely on the UN security council or the World Trade Organization, and instead called for a \u201cnetwork of liberty\u201d, with free nations working together to develop an \u201ceconomic Nato\u201d to coordinate pushback against Beijing. She said the G7 \u2013 which will meet this weekend in Hiroshima \u2013 needed to coordinate economically against Chinese economic coercion, saying \u201cbullying on a major scale\u201d was taking place across the international area. Truss said Beijing was using Taiwan\u2019s international participation as a strategy, and called for Taiwan\u2019s membership of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership to be fast-tracked and approved \u2013 and China\u2019s denied. Truss is a hawkish member of the British Conservative party, and her speech appeared to rebuke comments made by current members of government and their European counterparts. Last month the UK foreign secretary James Cleverly singled out climate change as an area in which engagement with China was needed, saying it would be a mistake to isolate Beijing. On Wednesday Truss said there were \u201ctoo many mixed messages from the free world\u201d, which she blamed on a \u201cfalse idea\u201d that the west could still cooperate with China on some issues. The current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, must make good on earlier comments when he declared China \u201cthe biggest-long term threat to Britain\u201d, she added. She called for the shutting down of UK-based Confucius institutes, and for the UK to rule out the resumption of economic dialogue with Beijing, saying: \u201cWe cannot have more integration with the Chinese economy.\u201d She said Beijing was already working to make itself economically self-reliant \u201cwhether we want to decouple from the economy or not\u201d. Truss also appeared to swipe at recent comments by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying it was \u201ccompletely irresponsible for European nationals to wash their hands of Taiwan because it\u2019s a long way away or not a core part of our concerns\u201d. Her speech was critical of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s rule over China, referring to the Tiananmen massacre, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and the crackdown in Hong Kong. Truss is the latest in a long line of foreign dignitaries to arrive in Taiwan, often drawing rebuke from Beijing, which objects to any action that appears to give credence to Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. After the then US speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August, Beijing drastically increased its military harassment of the island, setting a \u201cnew normal\u201d, the head of the Prospect Foundation said before Truss\u2019s speech. Asked whether she considered the potential for her visit to worsen the security situation in Taiwan, Truss said Taiwan\u2019s government had invited her and they were \u201cbest placed to understand what will help\u201d. \u201c[Beijing] are trying to limit visits, trying to silence Taiwan\u2019s supporters and intimidate people internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to stand up to that bullying.\u201d An editorial in the Chinese tabloid Global Times on Tuesday night repeated a criticism by Alicia Kearns, the chair of the UK foreign affairs select committee, that Truss\u2019s visit was \u201cthe worst example of Instagram diplomacy\u201d. \u201cThese types of ugly performances are attracting fewer and fewer audiences,\u201d the Global Times said.

            "date": "2023-05-02T21:30:51Z",
            "content": "Does the UK stock market need the biggest shake-up since the 1980s of the rules that apply to listed companies? Well, it\u2019s hard to deny that something has gone wrong \u2013 and was going wrong before the Japanese owner of Arm Holdings delivered the latest snub by opting to list the Cambridge-based chip-maker, the UK\u2019s tech champion, in New York. The number of companies with a listing on the main market in London has fallen by 40% since 2008. Meanwhile, UK pension funds and insurance companies have scarpered to the perceived safety of bonds. They owned 52% of the market in 1990; now just 4%. The buzz ain\u2019t what it used to be. And, since a dynamic stock market tends to go hand in hand with wider economic health, decline matters. So, in assessing the FCA\u2019s proposals, the default position should be openness to change. Something needs to happen to make London \u201cmore accessible, effective, easier to understand and competitive\u201d, as the regulator\u2019s chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, puts it. Here\u2019s the problem, though. For all the spin, the grand plan could be summarised \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join them\u201d \u2013 them being the US markets that have never shared London\u2019s worries over shareholder rights and boardroom governance. It looks as if the UK financial authorities, prodded by ministers, have concluded that principles are great until they starting costing you business. The FCA\u2019s core proposal is to adopt a single class of listed company. So goodbye to London\u2019s \u201cpremium\u201d segment that could only be claimed by companies that signed up to strong governance standards. And, just as in the US, companies would no longer have to gain approval from shareholders for very large transactions, or ones with related parties. What\u2019s more, London would fling the doors open wider to companies with US tech-style unequal voting structures. So much for \u201cequal rights for equal economic risk\u201d \u2013 an entirely worthy cause, as many of us have argued for years. Thus it is hard to summon much real enthusiasm for the FCA\u2019s vision. In governance terms, it looks a step backwards by about half a century. But here, unfortunately for us purists, is the rub: there is little point in trying to operate the world\u2019s most protection-heavy and virtuous stock market if fewer and fewer people want to use it. That way lies irrelevance. And, since the theoretical governance protections have proved useless in preventing blow-ups like Carillion and NMC Health, one can reasonably ask if London\u2019s high-minded ambitions were always hot air. Thus it is possible to see the regulator\u2019s policy U-turn as simultaneously depressing and pragmatic. It\u2019s not just the US, note, that doesn\u2019t bother with the confusing \u201cpremium\u201d and \u201cstandard\u201d categories; virtually nobody else does. On shareholders\u2019 deal-blocking rights, yes, one can applaud the principle while also seeing how they can deter new arrivals. A UK premium-listed company, currently required to issue a prospectus to complete a big deal, is at a disadvantage versus a foreign-listed rival when competing to buy the same asset. Whether or not the related party rules were the clincher in the Arm case (accounts differ), it is clear that listing in London is perceived as coming with hassles. The prestige may still count in some quarters, but not in all. Sir Jonathan Symonds, chair of GlaxoSmithKline, said last week that \u201cscales are tipped against\u201d listing in London, an assessment that rings true at the smaller end of his industry. Biotech is a growth industry for the UK, but a chunk of the best companies head straight to New York. Rathi concedes the proposed new set-up \u201cwill mean passing greater investment risk to investors and greater responsibility to shareholders to hold the companies they own to account\u201d. In other words, look out for your own interests because the regulator won\u2019t be holding your hand. Yes, it\u2019s best to be candid about what this new philosophy would mean: risks would be greater. There is no free lunch. One suspects the FCA will come under pressure to soften a few proposals \u2013 especially the ones on shareholders\u2019 ability to block stupid deals advanced by over-ambitious managements. And the FTSE Russell, the main index provider, could do everybody a favour by inventing a product that filters out companies led by wannabe Zuckerbergs waving their grubby golden shares. In the round, though, the FCA\u2019s ideas deserve a fair hearing. The way things are currently going, the UK stock market is headed for the stability of the graveyard. That suits nobody."

            "title": "Stock market reforms would \u2018pass greater risk to investors\u2019, FCA says",
            "date": "2023-05-02T21:30:51Z",
            "content": "The UK\u2019s financial regulator has warned reforms to stock market listing rules will pass greater risks on to investors in British companies, as it presses ahead with changes designed to reverse a decline in London\u2019s position as a top financial centre. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Tuesday night said it plans to abolish the stricter \u201cpremium\u201d class of London stock market listing, and make it easier for company founders to keep control of businesses using US-style \u201cgolden shares\u201d, among a series of big changes to City regulations. The changes are part of a push by the Conservative government to arrest the decline of the London stock market since the global financial crisis and lure new companies to list here. There were 2,101 companies listed on London\u2019s main market in 2003, but that number has fallen to 1,097 today, according to London Stock Exchange data. The average number of companies floated has fallen from 177 a year before the financial crisis in 2008 to 66 a year in the period since then, according to the data company Dealogic. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, a former City financier, commissioned a 2021 review into the UK listing regime that had proposed many of the new changes. The government in December unveiled a separate plan for sweeping deregulation for banks and insurers. The FCA chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, who previously led the London Stock Exchange, acknowledged that the aim of helping the UK economy grow would mean higher risks for investors because there will be fewer checks on listed companies, in a foreword to a consultation paper published on Tuesday night. \u201cAccess to a potentially wider range of companies listing will provide greater opportunities for investors in UK markets and help create jobs and growth,\u201d wrote Rathi alongside Sarah Pritchard, the FCA\u2019s executive director of markets. \u201cBut we must be upfront that these changes we are proposing to the listing regime will mean passing greater investment risk to investors and greater responsibility on to shareholders to hold the companies they own to account.\u201d The FCA has put forward proposed changes for formal consultation, with a view to introducing the rules by the end of the year. They include allowing more dual class share structures \u2013 sometimes known as \u201cgolden shares\u201d \u2013 meaning company founders will be able to keep control of listed companies for 10 years via special voting rights. The food delivery company Deliveroo only chose London to list its shares in 2021 after dual class shares were first allowed, while Matthew Moulding, the chief executive of the online beauty retailer THG, has hung on to the company\u2019s dual class share structure despite pledging to give it up after investor pressure. Other changes include removing a requirement for shareholder votes on acquisitions and related party transactions \u2013 which had been seen as a barrier to listing by some companies \u2013 and the removal of rules requiring startups to earn revenues for three years before listing. Within the City of London\u2019s financial services industry there is a broad consensus that the UK has been losing out to New York in particular. Sunak personally lobbied for the chip designer Arm to pursue a listing in London before it chose New York, while recent departures from the London Stock Exchange\u2019s FTSE 100 index include the building materials company CRH, and the plumbing and heating equipment supplier Ferguson. Even the oil company Shell considered leaving London. The London Stock Exchange\u2019s current boss, Julia Hoggett, has been among the most prominent advocates of reform to make listing easier, which could also benefit her business. However, some senior figures in the financial services industry have criticised aspects of the reforms. Richard Wilson, chief executive of Interactive Investor, an investment platform, said he strongly supported making the UK more competitive, but added that \u201ceroding shareholder rights risks undermining market standards, and this is not the right answer\u201d. Wilson particularly criticised dual class share structures, which are favoured by US tech founders, who can raise money while keeping control of their companies. \u201cOne share, one vote is a bedrock of shareholder democracy and we are concerned to see that the spectre of dual share classes, which we have actively lobbied against, still looms large,\u201d Wilson said. Andrew Griffith, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said the changes were \u201can important step forward by the FCA in improving the international competitiveness of the UK as a place to list. \u201cWe are the largest financial centre outside the US but we recognise that companies and investors have a choice and it is important our rulebook keeps pace with practices elsewhere while still benefiting from the high-quality reputation of our markets,\u201d he said. Chris Hayward, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, which lobbies for financial services, said the reforms \u201cwill signal the UK is open for business\u201d."

I don\u2019t necessarily make stock from them, but use them as a seasoning, like salt.

I generally use the beef cubes, even for chicken or lamb, because it just gives a strong meaty flavour. The real beef or chicken flavour comes from the meat you have cooked. I use them as a rub. Flake stock cubes into a bowl, add some spices, then rub it over chicken drumsticks or pork chops. Leave to marinate, then gently roast them.

            "date": "2023-05-30T20:01:45Z",
            "content": "The gender-critical feminist Dr Kathleen Stock was forced to temporarily halt her contested appearance at the Oxford Union after a trans activist glued themself to the debating chamber close to the speaker\u2019s chair. Stock, who argues that transgender people cannot expect all the rights afforded by biological sex, had been speaking over the sound of up to 200 people protesting outside about her invitation when a group of activists stormed the debating chamber on Tuesday. The trans rights protesters, who waved flags and shouted slogans, were booed by members of the audience and some were escorted out by security. Another protester, wearing a T-shirt saying \u201cno more dead trans kids\u201d, glued themself to the floor less than 2 metres from Stock\u2019s chair. Stock was urged by the audience to continue but she said she could not go on until given approval by security. The arrival of police officers in the chamber was greeted by cheers. They initially struggled to remove the activist but after about 20 minutes four officers led the activist away. When the event continued, Stock was asked to offer solutions to the culture war on the trans issue. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t blame that protest, it wasn\u2019t traumatic for me. You can disagree reasonably and still be friends.\u201d But she said she was worried when people felt \u201cintimidated\u201d into not challenging what she called the \u201cpropaganda machine\u201d of trans campaigners. Stock urged her detractors to read her book Material Girls. She said: \u201cI want trans people protected from violence and discrimination.\u201d She insisted she was not anti-trans despite what her critics said. In her address, Stock said it was \u201cnot fair on females\u201d to share spaces such as changing rooms and bathrooms with trans women because of the potential threat of violence. \u201cWhy should females take this burden on?\u201d she asked. Stock added: \u201cWe are supposed to care about women. It is a risk of a man saying he is a woman and going into a space and taking advantage of that.\u201d Stock called for the creation of third spaces to protect trans people. Challenged on her beliefs about trans identity, Stock said: \u201cI\u2019m definitely saying something that is unpopular as you can all tell. But if you don\u2019t go with reality it will hit you in the face. You can\u2019t overcome your body. When you are lost in the fiction and can\u2019t talk about reality you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d As Stock\u2019s speech was about to begin a march of more than 100 protesters gathered shouting: \u201cOut of the closet into the street\u201d. They held various banners protesting against Stock\u2019s invitation to speak, including ones reading \u201cOur existence is not a debate\u201d, \u201cTake Stock of Trans Joy\u201d and \u201cTrans Power\u201d. The march was led by Amiad Haran Diman, the president of the university\u2019s LGBTQ+ Society, holding a banner that read: \u201cTrans Women are Real Women\u201d. A handful of counter-protesters also gathered. Rebecca, wearing a body camera and holding a sign saying \u201cDoc Stock Rocks\u201d, said: \u201cSo far it feels peaceful but I\u2019ve been to a few events in the past and it\u2019s been far from peaceful.\u201d Organisers of the Trans+ Pride demonstration insisted they did not want to stifle free speech. Diman, who is studying for a PhD in politics, said: \u201cI will be on the frontline to make sure that everyone can come in. I\u2019ll make sure that the event goes ahead, because I don\u2019t believe in violence. I believe in the rule of law. And I\u2019ll be fighting for her freedom of speech.\u201d They said the demonstration was about supporting the trans community. Diman said: \u201cI don\u2019t care about Kathleen Stock and I don\u2019t care about Oxford Union. They love attention. But I care about the trans members of my community who need to know someone has their back. Someone is caring for them. So that\u2019s what the protest is about.\u201d Diman added: \u201c[Stock] wants to be the polite voice of a trans-exclusionary movement, but I don\u2019t believe in her good faith. I don\u2019t think she wants to have a civil conversation. If you look at her behaviour online it is very hostile. I think it is hateful and intolerant. \u201cI\u2019m very ready to have a conversation, but if the Oxford Union had wanted to have this real conversation they would have invited an expert on gender identity or on trans healthcare; instead they invited someone who has no expertise and who just abuses people.\u201d Peter Manshausen, one of the protesters, questioned why Stock had been given a platform by the Oxford Union. He said: \u201cI\u2019m a PhD student studying climate change. If you debate climate change, you don\u2019t put a climate change denier and a climate scientist together. That\u2019s a false balance. If you debate trans rights, you don\u2019t put up someone who denies the existence of trans people on the same platform as someone who may speak up for trans rights.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-05T10:55:12Z",
            "content": "Shares in US regional banks bounced back on Friday, although concerns about the health of the sector have left investors nursing steep losses for the week. The rout began in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, followed by the toppling of Signature Bank and then First Republic last weekend. Some regional lenders are struggling to cope with the sharp rise in interest rates enacted by central banks in an attempt to tame inflation. On Friday morning, PacWest shares rose 49%, while Western Alliance gained 31%, Zion rose 15% and First Horizon 5%. However, all four banks are still trading significantly lower than a week ago, with PacWest shares worth half as much as last Friday, wiping more than $600m from its market capitalisation. Western Alliance is trading 35% down, having lost $1.4bn in value. Nonetheless, the partial recovery buoyed US stock markets, and oil prices also rose. The crisis had threatened to deepen as hedge funds bet shares would fall further. Friday\u2019s rally came after Reuters reported that US officials were assessing whether \u201cmarket manipulation\u201d caused the recent volatility. The White House has vowed to monitor \u201cshort-selling pressures on healthy banks\u201d, and the American Bankers Association has urged federal regulators to investigate a spate of significant short sales of banking stocks. Neil Wilson, of markets.com, said regulators might consider introducing a ban on short selling to \u201cbuy time\u201d amid the sell-off. He said: \u201cThere may need to be a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 line in the sand moment \u2013 clearly the US authorities haven\u2019t done that \u2013 it may be that a ban on shorting bank shares forms part of that. Remember, this bank stress is just on being the wrong side of rates; we\u2019ve not even had a recession or full credit cycle.\u201d Comparing the turmoil to the short selling that played havoc with shares at GameStop, the video games retailer, in 2021, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at the investment bank TD Cowen, said: \u201cWe believe the banks are having their GameStop-like moment, where social media is amplifying non-traditional approaches to assessing solvency. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that pressures stock prices, which then leads to more questions.\u201d Russ Mould, the investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u201cMarkets will always look for the weakest link and then attack it if the mood takes them. It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Shares go down, people pull their money out and the hedge funds pile in.\u201d Mould said UK banks looked insulated from the crisis for now but added that there were lingering concerns. He said: \u201cThe UK banks are looking over their shoulder at what\u2019s going on in the US. At the moment, the risk to UK banks looks extremely limited. The US has thousands of regional banks which are not subjected to stress tests.\u201d On Thursday, Western Alliance slumped after strenuously denying a Financial Times report that it was exploring a potential sale. PacWest had sought to calm markets on Wednesday, saying it was in talks with several potential investors after its shares fell 60%. However, traders were not reassured, and the stock fell further on Thursday. Earlier this week Jamie Dimon, the boss of JP Morgan, played down the risk of a spiralling banking crisis after snapping up First Republic. The pound hit an 11-month high against the dollar, at $1.263, on Friday morning as fears over prospects for the US economy gripped markets. However, strong US jobs market figures erased some of those gains. The fall in the dollar against the pound came after the US Federal Reserve voted to increase interest rates to a 16-year high on Wednesday, despite fears over the impact of the banking crisis on the wider economy. In the UK, the Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates next Thursday, to 4.5%, with the markets now pricing in one additional increase before the end of the year."

            "date": "2023-05-23T09:52:26Z",
            "content": "UK food price inflation remains at its third-highest level since the financial crisis, with the annual rate at which the cost of groceries is increasing at the elevated level of 17.2%, retail industry data shows. Prices barely eased during the four weeks to 14 May to only marginally below April\u2019s 17.3% figure, according to the latest release from the analytics firm Kantar, representing the third-highest rate of grocery inflation since 2008. The report came as the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was scheduled to meet food manufacturers on Tuesday, to raise concerns over the impact of grocery price inflation on squeezed households. Even though the average cost of four pints of milk has come down by 8p since last month, it remains 30p higher than it was this time last year at \u00a31.60. Stubbornly high food and drink prices have added an extra \u00a3833 a year to shoppers\u2019 bills, Kantar found, unless consumers make changes to their usual habits to try to cut the cost. More consumers are turning to supermarket own-brand products, a trend also reported in April, in an attempt to keep their bills under control. Sales of the cheapest own-label products soared by 15.2% over the past month, almost double the 8.3% increase for branded products. Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: \u201cThe drop in grocery price inflation, which is down by 0.1 percentage points on last month\u2019s figure, is without doubt welcome news for shoppers \u2013 but it is still incredibly high.\u201d Shoppers flocked to the discount supermarkets, Aldi and Lidl, as they sought bargains. Aldi became the fastest-growing grocer over the past month as its sales increased by 24%, while sales at Lidl rose by 23.2%. However, Waitrose benefited from shoppers splashing out on extra treats before the coronation of King Charles. Its sales grew by 4.8%, the highest growth rate it has experienced for more than two years. Take-home grocery sales rose by nearly 11% over the past month, as consumers stocked up on supplies to enjoy over the coronation bank holiday weekend. Despite the pressure on household budgets, consumers spent an extra \u00a3218m on groceries during the week of the coronation, when there was a rise in sales of wine and quiche. Sales of sparkling wine shot up by 129%, and of still wine by 33%, as shoppers planned to raise a glass over the long weekend. \u201cLots of people seem to have got into the spirit of the royal occasion, grabbing their chance to have a go at the official coronation quiche recipe,\u201d McKevitt said. \u201cSales of ingredients like chilled pastry surged by 89%, while fresh cream sales jumped by 80% and frozen broad beans by 57%.\u201d Hunt\u2019s meeting with representatives from the food manufacturing industry comes amid warnings that the rising cost of groceries will overtake the price of energy in the coming months as the driving force behind inflation, hitting poorer households the hardest. Grocery bills are predicted to increase further, while energy prices are expected to begin falling over the summer, according to analysis from the Resolution Foundation thinktank. The consumer group Which? called on the government to undertake its review of food pricing rules as quickly as possible, to help shoppers when comparing products. Rocio Concha, the Which? director of policy and advocacy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good news the government has committed to reviewing pricing rules, but this must be undertaken as soon as possible as much clearer pricing is vital in enabling shoppers to compare prices and find the best value products. \u201cSupermarkets should also be making it easier for people by urgently committing to stocking essential budget ranges in all their stores, particularly in areas where people are most in need.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-19T17:05:33Z",
            "content": "Central banks risk losing public trust if they fail to bring down high rates of inflation found across the developed world, according to the boss of the body that advises them. Agust\u00edn Carstens, the director of the Bank of International Settlements, said central bankers needed to maintain a tough stance against inflation or else risk a new generation of consumers who had never experienced rapidly rising prices losing faith in their independent role. Speaking in Brazil, Carstens also warned that the recent run of bank failures seen in the US and the reckless use of cryptocurrencies could undermine trust in the financial system. In an unusually hard-hitting speech, the BIS boss said he was concerned that governments would undermine political institutions by spending their way to prosperity, saying the likelihood was that an increase in government budgets would be self-defeating and contribute to inflation. \u201cThe consequences of the state abusing the privilege of issuing money can be disastrous,\u201d he added. Central banks should continue to fight inflation with high interest rates to maintain trust in their institutions, he said. \u201cThe trust gained can be lost if society doubts the central bank\u2019s commitment to the objective of maintaining price stability. This is one of the reasons why the recent rise in inflation in virtually every country is a cause for concern, he added. He said the knock-on effects of a loss of confidence can \u201cresult in severe financial instability, with very high costs for society in terms of economic growth, employment, inequality and wealth\u201d. Carstens, a former boss of Mexico\u2019s central bank, did not name individuals or countries but appeared to have a harsh word for any politicians that questioned the independence of their central bank and the primary purpose to keep inflation low and stable. Liz Truss was widely criticised for putting forward proposals when she was prime minister last autumn to curb the independence of the Bank of England. Carstens\u2019 comments are also likely to be seen as a shot across the bows of the UK\u2019s central bank should it consider cutting interest rates before inflation has fallen for a sustained period. The collapse of Silicon Valley bank and the merger of Credit Suisse with UBS after the former found itself in financial trouble must be avoided he said to maintain trust in the financial system, he said. Though he warned that in many countries 50% of lending was managed by non-banks, including hedge funds and insurance companies, where regulation was weaker than the rules governing the banking system. \u201cThe need for greater supervision and regulation of the non-bank sector has become more pressing in the light of recent episodes of instability,\u201d he added. \u201cInstability stems from the sector\u2019s interconnectedness with the traditional banking system and the tendency of different forms of non-bank intermediation to generate opaque and excessive leverage as well as substantial liquidity mismatches. Upsets in this sector can result in systemic financial crises.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-10T23:01:09Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak is at risk of missing his flagship target to halve inflation this year, one of Britain\u2019s leading economic forecasters has warned, as households are left thousands of pounds worse off amid the cost of living crisis. Sounding the alarm over the hit to living standards, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the soaring price of food and other basic essentials meant inflation was on track to remain persistently high for the rest of this year. It said the combined impact of the Covid pandemic and the ongoing fallout from the cost of living crisis meant Britain\u2019s poorest households would be about \u00a34,000 a year worse off as a result \u2013 significantly higher than for richer households. Sunak pledged to halve inflation in January, when the rate stood at 10.1%, but the latest figures from March showed it was still at 10.1%. NIESR is forecasting a decline, but it warned on Thursday the rate would remain \u201cpersistently elevated\u201d, only falling to 5.4% by the end of 2023. Inflation, which measures the annual increase in the price of an average shopping basket of goods and services for consumers, has been soaring as households and businesses grapple with energy costs after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The prime minister had made halving the UK\u2019s highest rate of price increases in four decades the top item on his list of five key priorities for 2023, as he set out the opening stall of his premiership with a promise to ease the cost of living. The NIESR estimate is significantly higher than that made by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent economic forecaster, which predicted a drop to 2.9%. Inflation in March stood at 10.1%, fuelled by the sharpest annual increase in food prices since 1977. It comes as the Bank of England prepares to raise interest rates on Thursday for the 12th consecutive time, in the most aggressive campaign to increase borrowing costs since the 1980s. Jagjit Chadha, the director of NIESR, described Sunak\u2019s decision to set a target to halve inflation as a \u201ccomplete mistake\u201d, warning that it risked clouding the Bank\u2019s responsibility to steer inflation towards 2%. \u201cThe government should not be stepping into that space. In my own view it has provided a focal point for 5% inflation this year, and contributed to the persistence [of high inflation], by making people plan around that halving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should not be what the government does.\u201d Publishing its spring outlook for the economy, the thinktank said personal disposable income was expected to fall by 0.7% in 2023 and by 1.1% next year as households struggle with high inflation and weak levels of pay rises for workers. It said the poorest households in Britain were suffering the biggest financial hit, despite emergency government support directed at those on low incomes. Faced with soaring prices for food, energy and other basic essentials, it said the poorest fifth of households would be \u00a34,000 worse off compared with pre-pandemic levels. For the average household the hit would be worth about \u00a33,000. Adrian Pabst, deputy director for public policy at NIESR, said it was the role of government to support the hardest hit households by combining targeted support on energy bills with a substantial boost to public investment. \u201cReversing decline and reducing inequalities will be a generational task. Now is the time to build more productive capacity and grow national assets so that we fulfil the country\u2019s unrealised potential,\u201d he said. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had introduced one of the most generous cost of living support packages in Europe. \u201cWe are working closely with the Bank of England to bear down on inflation, and remain committed to halving it this year. We must stick firmly to this plan so that everyone\u2019s incomes go further and the right conditions are in place for long-term economic growth,\u201d they added."

            "date": "2023-05-03T06:00:03Z",
            "content": "The US is braced for an interest rate rise on Wednesday that could push the world\u2019s largest economy into recession. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce another quarter of a percentage point rise in its benchmark interest rate, to a range of 5% to 5.25%. It would be the central bank\u2019s 10th consecutive rate rise as it prioritises the fight against rising prices. A year ago interest rates were close to zero. Headline annual consumer inflation fell in the US in March, to 5% from 6%, but core inflation \u2013 which does not include volatile energy and food prices \u2013 edged up to 5.6% from 5.5%. Economists are divided on whether the Fed should stop raising rates. Adam Posen, who runs the Peterson Institute thinktank in Washington DC, said it was important for the US central bank \u201cto continue its hiking cycle given what the latest data is telling us\u201d. However, Robert J Shapiro, one of Bill Clinton\u2019s economic advisers when he was president, said the Fed should stop in its tracks because it had done enough to calm the economy. Further rate rises risked a recession that was going to hurt low- and middle-income earners. US economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of the year, to just 1.1% year-on-year, from 2.6% growth in the final three months of 2022. It was significantly less than the economists\u2019 expectations of 2% growth. \u201cA decline in economic growth to 1.1% shows it is time for the Fed to pause,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThere is a significant lag between interest rate rises being imposed and them taking effect, and so we know there is more pain for the economy to come even without further rate rises.\u201d Neil Shearing, chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the Fed would increase rates by a quarter of a percentage point. \u201cThen it\u2019s done. And that\u2019s because there are already significant signs the economy is slowing. \u201cThe labour market is cooling and given all the problems in the US banking system and tightening lending conditions, there won\u2019t be any call for higher rates,\u201d he added. A hike in interest rates in the US is expected to be followed on Thursday by a quarter of a percentage point increase in interest rates in the eurozone. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to raise its refinancing rate for a seventh consecutive time, to 3.75% and its deposit rate to 3.25%. Next week the Bank of England is widely expected to hike interest rates for a 12th time in a row, taking them to 4.5%. All are battling rapidly rising prices, but the inflation story is not the same everywhere. While the headline rate came down in the US in the latest data for March, figures published on Tuesday showed eurozone inflation edged higher in April to 7% from 6.9%. In the UK, inflation dropped from 10.4% in February but remained stubbornly high in March at 10.1%. Yet central bank policymakers all sing the same tune because the measure of core inflation that strips out food, fuel and energy prices is well above the rate they find comfortable. In March, core inflation reached 5.7% in the UK and the eurozone (before dropping to 5.6% in April in the single currency bloc), and 5.6% in the US. It is part of the reason why policymakers says higher interest rates, which reduce the demand for goods and services, and consequently ease inflationary pressures, are needed. The sticky nature of core inflation means there is no doubt in the mind of City analysts that interest rates in the US, UK and eurozone are about to head higher again. The only question is which central banks will think they have done enough and which will say they need to carry on beyond this month. Posen was a dovish member of the monetary policy committee in the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crash, favouring lower rates and arguing at the time against those that wanted to increase borrowing costs to tackle rising inflation. \u201cI was described as an uber-dove. But this time the UK faces a different situation,\u201d he said. \u201cAn additional raise by the Bank of England is a foregone conclusion and that is the right decision. The Bank is still behind the inflation curve, in my opinion.\u201d John Llewellyn, a former chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said there was a strong chance the Bank of England and the ECB would be forced to continue raising rates until they see significant falls in core inflation."

            "date": "2023-05-26T17:41:33Z",
            "content": "Rishi Sunak has been warned the UK economy could be in recession next year as stubbornly high inflation pushes interest rates to more than 5% before the next general election. Setting the stage for a further rise in borrowing costs on mortgages and loans for millions of households, economists predicted the Bank of England could be forced to drive Britain\u2019s economy into a recession to tame inflation. At the end of a week of troubling economic developments, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was being roundly criticised for appearing to say he thought this was a price worth paying, despite the pain already caused to families by an unrelenting cost of living crisis. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said: \u201cAlmost nobody feels better off after 13 years of this government. I\u2019m really worried about mortgages. People are struggling to pay the bills. Mortgages are a big part of that.\u201d Jagjit Chadha, the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said that if interest rates continue to rise, \u201cwe\u2019re in danger of engineering a recession\u201d. As financial markets drove up UK government borrowing costs to the highest level since Liz Truss\u2019s ill-fated premiership, the prime minister\u2019s ability to deliver on his promise to halve inflation this year, one of five central pledges of his premiership, came into question. Andrew Sentance, a former policymaker at the Bank of England, suggested Sunak\u2019s promise was a \u201cmistake\u201d because it has been the central bank\u2019s responsibility since it was handed independence by Gordon Brown in 1997. \u201cI would say if you believe the Clinton mantra that \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid\u2019 \u2013 which I think is quite correct for the UK, and if the opposition looks competent \u2013 then it\u2019s going to be quite a sticky wicket for the government economically next year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public can\u2019t sack the governor of the Bank, so they express their dissatisfaction with the government.\u201d Official figures this week showed that the UK\u2019s annual inflation rate fell by less than expected to 8.7% in April, with a steadying in energy prices largely offset by the soaring price of food. Financial markets are now betting that the Bank will drive up its key base rate to as high as 5.5% from the current level of 4.5% before the end of the year. Virgin Money became the latest big lender to increase its mortgage rates on Friday, with the cost of its fixed-rate deals edging higher. On Thursday, Britain\u2019s biggest building society, Nationwide, hiked rates by up to 0.45 percentage points for those taking out a new mortgage. After Wednesday\u2019s disappointing inflation figures caused turbulence in the money markets, financial data firm Moneyfacts said 38 mortgage products had been withdrawn, and experts warned borrowers to brace for 5%-plus fixed-rate deals. David Gauke, a former Conservative chief secretary to the Treasury, said the Conservatives\u2019 best chance at the next election would come if living standards were improving and if interest rates were falling. \u201cThe economy has performed better than expected so far in 2023, but if this means that inflation is going to be sticky and the Bank still has to go further to combat inflation, the economic pain is going to be badly timed for the government.\u201d Former IMF deputy director Mohamed El-Erian said the Bank of England would be forced to raise interest rates higher for longer \u2013 which he said would mean recession or close to zero growth. \u201cThe risk we now have, you put all that together \u2013 sticky inflation, the Bank having to go higher, borrowing costs going up \u2013 all that translates into a higher threat of stagflation. \u201cI use stag for shorthand for insufficient economic growth. It can be recession, it can be zero growth. This is not about abstract numbers; it\u2019s about something that hits the poor particularly hard.\u201d Treasury sources said they felt words had been put in the chancellor\u2019s mouth that did not reflect his comments. \u201cIf you look at exactly what he\u2019s saying, it\u2019s that inflation is the greatest reason for economic instability and why growth is slowing across the world, and it is the true threat that could cause a recession. Inflation is the No 1 enemy and we need monetary and fiscal policy aligned to tackle inflation and prevent a recession,\u201d the Treasury source said. The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, said: \u201cThis would be a recession made in Downing Street. Rishi Sunak\u2019s promise to grow the economy has been left in tatters. This government\u2019s failure to cut inflation is sending mortgage rates spiralling as the Conservative economic chaos continues. \u201cRishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt could have acted to reduce energy bills and keep food prices under control. Instead, they\u2019ve sat on their hands while inflation goes through the roof.\u201d Sunak had struck an optimistic note about the economy during his trip to the G7 in Japan last week, saying there were \u201clots of signs that things are moving in the right direction\u201d. He pointed to the positivity of chief executives about investment in the UK and argued that real household disposable income was \u201chugely outperforming what people thought\u201d. The opposition criticised his comments as being out of touch with people struggling with their budgets during a cost of living crisis."

            "date": "2023-05-25T16:21:51Z",
            "content": "Germany has entered a recession, revised official figures have revealed, after high prices took a bigger toll on the country\u2019s economy than originally estimated. Data from the Federal Statistical Office showed Europe\u2019s largest economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2023, compared with the previous three months, when it shrank by 0.5%. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of contraction. A previous estimate suggested Germany had narrowly avoided recession with 0% growth in the first quarter. The statistics office said on Thursday that while private sector investment and construction grew at the start of the year, this was offset in part by a drop-off in consumer spending as higher prices forced households to rein in spending. Overall, household spending dropped 1.2% in the first quarter, with shoppers less willing to splash out on food, clothes, and furniture. Government spending also dipped by 4.9% compared with the previous quarter. The war in Ukraine has unsettled both businesses and consumers, both holding back on investing and buying respectively, which has affected demand. Interest rate rises by the European Central Bank have so far had little influence on reducing inflation, which stands at 7% across the eurozone. Considerably higher heating costs, despite government subsidies, meant German consumers were holding back on spending on other things. Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macro economics at the Dutch bank ING, said the overall decrease in Germany\u2019s gross domestic product was \u201cnot the worst-case scenario of a severe recession\u201d but was still \u201ca drop of almost 1% from last summer\u201d. \u201cThe warm winter weather, a rebound in industrial activity, helped by the Chinese reopening and an easing of supply chain frictions, were not enough to get the economy out of the recessionary danger zone,\u201d he added. The Ifo Index \u2013 Germany\u2019s most prominent leading monthly indicator, showed a continuing weak backdrop for businesses. In May it sank again for the first time in half a year. All sectors apart from services were on the decline. The leader of the country\u2019s main opposition party called the economic decline a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. \u201cIt has to shake him awake,\u201d the CDU\u2019s Friedrich Merz told the Agence France-Presse news agency. \u201cThe way his coalition is working means many firms doubt in the future of Germany as a location.\u201d The economics minister Robert Habeck cited Germany\u2019s long-term dependence on Russian energy and the abrupt withdrawal of that supply after the invasion of Ukraine as the main reason for the downturn. \u201cWe are fighting our way out of this crisis,\u201d he said at an event in Berlin. Scholz appealed to people to have faith in the economy. \u201cThe prospects for the German economy are very good,\u201d he said. He cited the massive expansion of clean energy that would \u201cunleash the strengths of the economy\u201d as a reason for optimism, making particular reference to large investments into semiconductors and battery factories. Another dose of optimism was delivered by the Bundesbank. It predicted in its latest monthly report that growth would pick up in the second quarter, saying it based this outlook on improved supply chain issues and the fact, as a result, firms were now better able fulfil the backlog of orders built up during the pandemic and beyond. However, the state-owned investment and development bank KfW said this week it expected German GDP to shrink by 0.3% overall this year. It added that two-thirds of the downturn may be caused by more work days being lost in 2023 to public holidays than last year."

            "date": "2023-05-23T10:15:34Z",
            "content": "The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecasts for UK growth, saying the country will no longer fall into recession this year, but warned the government against tax cuts it said would fuel inflation and result in a long period of high interest rates. In a message to the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, that he should maintain his planned squeeze on public spending, the Washington-based body said tax policy should stay \u201caligned with monetary policy in the fight against inflation\u201d. Any financial surpluses should be used to pay down government debt to \u201crebuild fiscal buffers\u201d, it said in its annual Article IV review of the UK\u2019s economic outlook released on Tuesday. Putting forward a more upbeat assessment of the UK\u2019s annual growth, the IMF forecast the country\u2019s gross domestic product would grow by 0.4% this year, tearing up its estimate in April of a 0.3% contraction. The economy is still expected to grow at the same modest pace of 1% in 2024, before rising to 2% in 2025 and 2026. IMF officials upgraded the UK forecast in response to the greater \u201cresilience\u201d of households and businesses during the worst of the inflation shock. London\u2019s banking sector had also weathered better than expected the collapse of major banks in the US and Switzerland and the subsequent global financial instability. They noted that company bankruptcies had begun to increase in the UK, but said the overall picture was of an economy making a steady, if \u201csubdued\u201d, recovery. Inflation is expected to fall back to 5% by the end of the year and below 2% by the summer of 2024, mainly in response to falling energy prices, the report said. However, it urged the Bank of England to focus on the potential for wage growth to remain high and the price of business services to continue rising. The central bank should wait for these elements to fall before considering loosening its monetary policy, it said. The report is likely to be seen as providing cover for Hunt\u2019s aim to restrain public spending and support efforts by the central bank to bring down inflation. Hunt said the IMF forecast was a \u201cbig upgrade\u201d for the UK\u2019s growth prospects, adding: \u201cToday\u2019s IMF report credits our action to restore stability and tame inflation. \u201cIt praises our childcare reforms, the Windsor framework and business investment incentives. If we stick to the plan, the IMF confirm our long-term growth prospects are stronger than in Germany, France and Italy \u2013 but the job is not done yet.\u201d The chancellor, who agreed the wording of the report, is likely to use its analysis to quell demands for tax cuts within Conservative ranks. Several former ministers and backbench Tory MPs believe he should use any financial headroom in the run-up to the next general election to reduce personal and business taxes. IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said: \u201cInflation is a tax and it is heaviest on the poor so getting inflation under control is the right objective at the time when we are seeing record high levels over decades,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course it is attractive to look into ways in which the tax burden is lighter, to inject more investment opportunity. \u201cBut only when it is affordable. And at this point of time it is neither affordable or desirable because if you want to constrain demand and increase supply [to bring down inflation] you have to think what are the right policy measures.\u201d Pat McFadden, a shadow Treasury spokesperson, said the report \u201creveals the fragility of the UK economy\u201d and predicted that households would not thank the government for \u201csending mortgages rocketing\u201d and \u201cputting a question mark over Britain as a home for investment\u201d. IMF officials took a swipe at the past year\u2019s government leadership changes, saying that business investment had been low due to \u201cpolicy and regulatory uncertainty\u201d. It said Hunt had successfully re-established credibility \u201cfollowing the September \u2018mini-budget\u2019 stress episode\u201d but he should consider giving the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent forecaster, a bigger role when judging the impact of government budgets. Official figures released on Tuesday morning showed that the UK borrowed more than \u00a325bn to balance the books last month, the second-highest borrowing figure for an April, and higher than expected. The rise was again driven by soaring inflation, which pushed up welfare and pension payments, and the cost of capping energy bills for homes and businesses. Separate data showed growth across UK companies slowing this month, while firms continue to increase prices. British economic growth remained centred on the service sector in May, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers by the data provider S&amp;P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. But production levels at manufacturing firms fell at the fastest pace in four months. This pulled the index\u2019s figure for May down to 53.9, from a 12-month high of 54.9 in April. Any reading over 50 shows growth."

            "content": "Stubbornly high inflation and higher borrowing costs are poised to drive the economies of the UK, Germany and US into recession, the leading rating agency Moody\u2019s has warned. In a downbeat forecast for growth across advanced G20 economies, it said a ramping up of interest rates by central banks on both sides of the Atlantic was expected to weigh on economic growth this year. \u201cWe expect very weak growth in key advanced economies in particular, including mild recessions in the US, UK and Germany, and stagnant economic activity in France and Italy,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a report. It comes as the world\u2019s most influential central banks attempt to squeeze high inflation out of the system through the toughest round of rate increases in decades, amid concern over the potential for persistent pressure on living standards. Official estimates on Wednesday revealed a mixed picture across the eurozone, underscoring the challenge facing the European Central Bank, after French inflation eased to its lowest level in a year but Italy overshot analyst expectations. France\u2019s annual inflation rate fell by more than expected to 6% in May, down from 6.9% in April. However, inflation fell by significantly less than anticipated in Italy to stand at 8.1% in May, down from 8.7% a month earlier. German inflation fell by more than expected to 6.3%, down from 7.6% a month earlier. The figures followed a bigger-than-expected decline in Spain, with a fall in inflation to 2.9%, raising hopes that price pressures across the eurozone could cool rapidly this year. Official estimates for the 20-country bloc as a whole are due on Thursday. Rory Fennessy, an economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said: \u201cWith inflation surprising to the downside in Germany and France, it is likely that eurozone inflation came down more than expected in May, closer to 6% from 7% in April. If inflation in June surprises to the downside, the chances of a July rate hike will diminish significantly.\u201d Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, warned this month that the eurozone\u2019s central bank still had \u201cmore ground to cover\u201d on interest rates, after increasing its key deposit rate by a quarter point to 3.25%. \u201cWe are not pausing. That\u2019s very clear,\u201d she said. Revised official figures for Germany revealed last week that the country slipped into recession at the start of this year, while concern is also mounting over the strength of the UK and US economies. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of shrinking gross domestic product. Official figures last week showed inflation remained stubbornly high in the UK as households come under pressure from the fastest annual rise in food prices since the late 1970s. Britain has the highest inflation rate in the G7 group of advanced economies, after a fall to 8.7% in April, down from 10.1% in March. UK inflation figures for May are due to be published next month, with analysts warning that Rishi Sunak\u2019s target to halve the inflation rate by the end of this year is increasingly at risk. Economists said last week that Britain\u2019s stubbornly high levels of inflation were likely to push the Bank of England to push interest rates above 5% in order to \u201cengineer\u201d the conditions for a recession to bring down inflation. Moody\u2019s said it expected Threadneedle Street to raise its key base rate by \u201cat least\u201d another quarter-point to 4.75% when the Bank\u2019s policymakers next meet in June. US consumer prices have been slowing in recent months, dropping to an annual inflation rate of 4.9% in April. However, analysts have warned the US Federal Reserve could be forced to keep interest rates at high levels for longer than previously anticipated to squeeze persistent inflation out of the system. Economists are divided on whether the US could fall into recession in the second half of this year or in 2024. However, some suggest the country could manage a \u201csoft landing\u201d from high inflation without a recession. Moody\u2019s warned that recent turmoil in the US banking system had highlighted how the rate cycle could trigger risks in the financial system. While strength in the US jobs market could delay an economic downturn, it said this might also risk fuelling high inflation \u2013 making it more likely for the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further. \u201cCooling economic activity and weaker labour market are necessary conditions for inflationary pressures in the economy to ease. Too much resilience for too long would require even tighter monetary policy,\u201d the report said."

The chancellor\u2019s comments come after figures this week showed annual inflation in April was higher than expected at 8.7%, raising the prospect of a 13th interest rate rise by the Bank of England. Markets are predicting that interest rates could climb to 5.5% by the end of the year, up from their current level of 4.5%, putting further pressure on borrowers and the housing market. When asked whether he was comfortable with the central bank doing whatever was needed to bring down inflation, even if that could cause a recession, Jeremy Hunt told Sky News: \u201cYes, because in the end, inflation is a source of instability. And if we want to have prosperity, to grow the economy, to reduce the risk of recession, we have to support the Bank of England in the difficult decisions that they take.\u201d The chancellor said that while it was not an easy decision, it sent the right message to global markets. \u201cI have to do something else, which is to make sure the decisions that I take as chancellor, very difficult decisions, to balance the books so that the markets, the world can see that Britain is a country that pays its way \u2013 all these things mean that monetary policy at the Bank of England [and] fiscal policy by the chancellor are aligned,\u201d he said. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund said it no longer expected the UK to fall into recession this year, after observing the greater \u201cresilience\u201d of households and businesses during the worst of the inflation shock. It also predicted that inflation would fall back to 5% by the end of the year and below the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target by the summer of 2024, mainly in response to falling energy prices. Hunt said inflation would not drop without determination and coordination by the Bank of England and Treasury. \u201cWhen the prime minister announced that it was his objective to halve inflation in January, there were some people who derided that; they said: \u2018Well, it\u2019s automatic; inflation is going to come down anyhow.\u2019 There\u2019s nothing automatic about bringing down inflation; it is a big task but we must deliver it, and we will. It is not a trade-off between tackling inflation and recession. In the end, the only path to sustainable growth is to bring down inflation,\u201d he said."

            "date": "2023-05-16T11:00:05Z",
            "content": "The progressive organization Justice Democrats has adopted a four-day working week, a policy that has received praise from prominent leftwing leaders like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Justice Democrats, which has helped elect progressive lawmakers like Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, shifted to a four-day working week for its 20 employees starting last August on a six-month trial basis. In March, the group decided to extend the policy indefinitely after its employees reported the change allowed them to better manage the grueling nature of campaign work. \u201cA big reason why we ultimately decided to do a four-day week indefinitely is because of how much we trust everyone in the organization to prioritize what they need to prioritize,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, executive director of Justice Democrats. \u201cThat extra space has, at least for us, improved productivity and people\u2019s attitudes as they show up to work.\u201d The shift comes as progressive leaders have embraced the idea of a shorter week, arguing that the 40-hour week established by the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 no longer reflects the reality of Americans\u2019 working lives. In March, congressman Mark Takano of California reintroduced his bill to set the standard working week at 32 hours, and Sanders has now joined the cause. \u201cIt\u2019s time to reduce the work week to 32 hours with no loss in pay,\u201d Sanders wrote in a Guardian op-ed earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s time to reduce the stress level in our country and allow Americans to enjoy a better quality of life. It\u2019s time to make sure that working people benefit from rapidly increasing technology, not just large corporations that are already doing phenomenally well.\u201d Although few American companies have adopted a four-day working week, the idea is not novel. France has mandated a 35-hour work week since 2000, and some French politicians have called for lowering that threshold to 32 hours. Iceland has also seen success in its trials of a four-day, 35-hour working week. In comparison, Americans work an average of 43.1 hours per week, according to a 2022 Gallup survey. Critics fear that the shift to a 32-hour week could increase employers\u2019 labor costs and further decrease employee productivity at a time when American workers\u2019 output has slumped. Data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows US productivity declined for three straight quarters last year, although labor output has still increased by nearly 500% overall since 1947. But Justice Democrats employees said the switch to a 32-hour, Monday to Thursday schedule had made them more efficient and focused with their tasks. \u201cI\u2019m highly productive during my work hours, and honestly I procrastinate less,\u201d said Becca Rast, a managing director at Justice Democrats. \u201cIt allows me to have a tighter, more focused work schedule, which I really thrive under.\u201d Trial studies of companies with 32-hour working weeks have shown similar results. One pilot program launched in the United Kingdom last year found that employees who worked fewer hours per week reported higher levels of job satisfaction while 23 participating companies witnessed an average revenue increase of 1.4%. When the program concluded, 56 out of 61 organizations said they would keep the policy in place at least temporarily. The reduced stress levels among those with shorter working weeks can also help reduce employee burnout and turnover, ultimately making companies more productive in the long run. The UK pilot program found that 39% of employees with reduced working hours reported feeling less stressed, and 71% said they had reduced levels of burnout by the end of the trial. \u201cIt\u2019s really good for our health \u2013 our mental health and our physical health,\u201d Rast said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m overworked and overrun with thinking about work, I am not able to actually show up for my team and make the kinds of change that we\u2019re talking about. And so it\u2019s been really healthy for me to be able to get there, and I see that for our whole team as well.\u201d For Becca Rose, a senior strategist at Justice Democrats, the four-day week has given her the time and flexibility to address some chronic health conditions without feeling stretched thin by her other responsibilities at work and at home. \u201cI need these extra eight hours in a week to be able to feel like I can both do my job and also manage some personal things that came up,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThose trials come up in life, whether it\u2019s chronic health [issues] or something completely different. Those things come up for everyone. So what seems like a luxury quickly becomes something that feels very essential.\u201d The switch has felt particularly necessary because of the grueling nature of campaign work, Justice Democrats staffers said. Particularly in the immediate run-up to an election, campaigns and their partner organizations are often expected to put in long hours with few days off to get their candidates across the finish line. \u201cEspecially for progressive challengers, because we have to launch so far out to be able to put up a competitive campaign [and] to build the infrastructure, a whole year of just \u2018go, go, go\u2019 is not sustainable,\u201d said Supreet Kaur, candidate coordination manager for Justice Democrats. Justice Democrats first started its four-day week policy last year at the close of the primary season, which is generally the organization\u2019s busiest time in the election cycle as they go toe to toe with more centrist Democratic candidates. Rojas acknowledged that it may be \u201cchallenging\u201d to adjust the four-day working week to the demands of the primary season, but she still expressed a commitment to the policy, encouraging other progressive organizations to consider making the change as well. \u201cIt\u2019s better work. It\u2019s healthier workers,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cAnd when we think about our movement, everybody shows up better.\u201d"

            "content": "The chief justice of the US supreme court, John Roberts, said he and the other justices were working to hold themselves to the \u201chighest standards\u201d of ethical conduct. \u201cI want to assure people that I am committed to making certain that we as a court adhere to the highest standards of conduct,\u201d Roberts told an awards dinner in Washington on Tuesday. He was speaking the same day lawyers for Harlan Crow said the Republican mega-donor would not cooperate with the Senate judiciary committee. The panel asked for list of gifts Crow has given to the conservative justice Clarence Thomas and which Thomas mostly did not declare: the source of scandal and calls for Thomas to resign or be removed. Crow has also rebuffed the Senate finance committee. Last month, Roberts himself rejected a judiciary committee request for testimony about the Thomas affair. On Tuesday, Roberts said: \u201cWe are continuing to look at things we can do to give practical effect to that commitment, and I am confident that there are ways to do that consistent with our status as an independent branch of government and the constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\u201d Lawyers for Crow cited the same concept when they said Congress did not have authority to investigate gifts to Thomas. ProPublica has reported that gifts from Crow to Thomas included luxury travel and resort stays, purchase of a property in which the justice\u2019s mother lives rent-free, and schooling for Thomas\u2019s great-nephew. Crow has also donated in support of Ginni Thomas, the justice\u2019s wife, a hardline rightwing activist. Thomas has said he was advised he did not have to declare gifts from Crow and will do so in future. Crow has said he and Thomas never discuss politics or business before the court. The Guardian has shown Crow has had business before the court during his friendship with Thomas. Supreme court justices are subject to federal ethics rules \u2013 which observers have said Thomas clearly broke \u2013 but in practice govern themselves. In his remarks on Tuesday, Roberts did not say what the justices were doing or planned to do. On Wednesday, Kyle Herrig, president of the advocacy group Accountable.US, said Roberts \u201csat back and watched while the supreme court corruption crisis reached a fever pitch, causing public trust in his court to plummet. \u201cNow, he\u2019s admitting more can be done \u2013 but keeps pretending he isn\u2019t responsible for cleaning up his own court. Americans deserve more than a few noncommittal comments behind closed doors. Chief Justice Roberts himself has the power to change the ethics standards of our nation\u2019s highest court, but so far, he hasn\u2019t shown the courage. Instead of preaching to a private crowd, he should take action.\u201d Roberts was accepting an award from the American Law Institute, at the National Building Museum. He said he had not made extensive public comments since before the coronavirus pandemic. Since then, the court has handed down divisive rulings including Dobbs v Jackson, which removed the federal right to abortion. Roberts, a conservative appointed by George W Bush, sided with the liberal justices in voting to uphold Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed abortion rights. But five other conservatives \u2013 three appointed by Donald Trump thanks to Senate Republicans\u2019 ruthless political hardball \u2013 voted in the majority. On Monday, Ron DeSantis, the hard-right Florida governor who is expected to run for the Republican presidential nomination, mused publicly about the chance to cement a 7-2 conservative majority to last a \u201cquarter-century\u201d. Public trust in the supposedly non-partisan court has reached historic lows. Nonetheless, on Tuesday Roberts echoed comments by the conservative Samuel Alito, author of the Dobbs ruling, when he complained of public divisions over the court and threats to justices. Referring to a judge and mentor for whom the award was named, Roberts said: \u201cThe things going on outside this chamber would be deeply disappointing to him. \u201cThere is much in the legal world that he would find abhorrent. Judges heckled and shouted down at law schools. Protesters outside the homes of justices, with marshal protection needed 24/7.\u201d Roberts also said the hardest decision he had made as chief justice was not in any case. It was, he said, \u201cwhether to erect fences and barricades around the supreme court\u201d when the Dobbs decision was due, knowing protests would follow. \u201cI had no choice but to go ahead and do it,\u201d he said."

            "content": "The Republican governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, who is running for a US Senate seat next year, implied on Wednesday that a justice department lawsuit over more than $7.5m in unpaid penalties related to mining operations by his family companies was a politically motivated attack. \u201cI\u2019ve announced as a Republican that I\u2019m running for the US Senate,\u201d Justice told reporters. \u201cThe Biden administration is aware of the fact that with a win for the US Senate and everything, we could very well flip the Senate. There\u2019s a lot at stake right now.\u201d In his Senate run, Justice is seeking to defeat Joe Manchin, the only Democrat in statewide elected office in West Virginia. Democrats hold the US Senate by a narrow majority 51-49. Early polling suggests Justice will storm to victory. On Tuesday, a poll from the East Carolina University put the governor 22 points up. On Wednesday, Politico reported that a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee directly claimed the suit was politically motivated, accusing Democrats of \u201cweaponising the federal government to attack the family of a Republican Senate candidate\u201d. The federal lawsuit concerns unpaid penalties related to mining operations, violations that \u201cpose health and safety risks or threaten environmental harm\u201d, the US justice department said. Justice companies owe penalties of approximately $7.6m, the justice department said, on fines initially levied by the Department of the Interior and which the justice department said were \u201cuncontested\u201d. The department said it had filed suit against the governor\u2019s son, James C Justice III, and 13 coal companies he owns or operates. On a financial disclosure form filed this year with the state ethics commission, Jim Justice listed 112 coal, agricultural and other businesses including seven placed in a blind trust in 2017. The governor\u2019s worth peaked at $1.7bn but he was taken off Forbes\u2019 prestigious billionaires list in 2021. Justice companies have been perennially dogged by litigation over unpaid bills. The governor has tried to put distance between himself and the businesses, saying his two adult children now run them. The new suit lists the coal companies\u2019 principal place of business in Roanoke, Virginia. On Wednesday, Justice said he did not know details of the suit but expected to be briefed by his son. James Justice III did not immediately comment. According to a statement from the justice department, \u201cfrom 2018 to 2022, [Interior] cited\u201d Justice companies \u201cfor over 130 violations and issued the companies over 50 cessation orders. \u201cThe underlying violations pose health and safety risks or threaten environmental harm. In addition, defendants failed to \u2026 fund the reclamation of coal mining sites abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status.\u201d Christopher R Kavanaugh, US attorney for the western district of Virginia, said: \u201cOver a five-year period, defendants engaged in over 130 violations of federal law, thereby posing health and safety risks to the public and the environment. \u201cAfter given notice, they then failed to remedy those violations and were ordered over 50 times to cease mining activities until their violations were abated. Today, the filing of this complaint continues the process of holding defendants accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of the public and our environment.\u201d Todd Kim, assistant attorney general of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, said: \u201cOur environmental laws serve to protect communities against adverse effects of industrial activities including surface coal mining operations. \u201cThrough this suit, the justice department seeks to deliver accountability for defendants\u2019 repeated violations of the law and to recover the penalties they owe as a result of those violations.\u201d"

I thought I heard it all, but disclosures about his activities just embarrass me.\u201d Durbin, who is also the majority whip in the upper congressional chamber, added: \u201cThe question is whether it embarrasses the supreme court and \u2026 Chief Justice [John] Roberts, [who] has the power in his hands to change this first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d In an interview with the host Jake Tapper, the four-term senator called on Roberts to implement a supreme court code of conduct \u201cthat finally means something\u201d and requires its nine justices to subject themselves \u201cto at least the minimal standards that apply to all other federal judges\u201d. \u201cThis is the Roberts court,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cHistory is going to judge him by the decision he makes on this. He has the power to make the difference.\u201d Durbin\u2019s remarks taking aim at Thomas and Roberts come after days of controversy surrounding the relationships between some supreme court justices and people with business before their bench. On Thursday, ProPublica reported that Republican mega-donor Harlan Crow paid for the great-nephew of Thomas \u2013 whom the conservative justice raised as a son \u2013 to attend a private boarding school. Crow had also provided Thomas luxury travel and resort stays. And he had bought from Thomas a home where the justice\u2019s mother still lives. Thomas did not declare any of that before siding with the supreme court\u2019s conservative majority in major rulings, including one last year that removed the federal right to an abortion. The Guardian has also reported that Crow had business before the supreme court during his deep friendship with Thomas. Also on Thursday, the Washington Post published an investigation which found that rightwing legal activist Leonard Leo arranged for Thomas\u2019s wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, to receive tens of thousands of dollars for consulting work between 2011 and 2012. Leo made it a point for Ginni Thomas\u2019s name to be omitted from pertinent billing paperwork, and an organization which he leads has repeatedly submitted briefs that outside groups use to share insights with supreme court justices, according to the Post. Meanwhile, last month, Politico reported that Thomas\u2019s fellow conservative justice Neil Gorsuch pocketed up to $500,000 from a property sale shortly after joining the supreme court but did not disclose that the buyer led a law firm with business before the high court. Thomas has said he was advised that he didn\u2019t have to declare such gifts but pledged to begin following ethics guidelines. Gorsuch has not commented. Some have argued that such disclosures about the relationships between supreme court justices and certain parties amount to exposed corruption. Durbin recently invited Roberts to appear in his role as supreme court chief justice before the Senate judiciary committee to address the reporting on Thomas and Gorsuch. But Roberts declined and instead simply forwarded \u201ca statement of ethics and principles and practice to which all current members of the supreme court subscribe\u201d. Durbin countered in a letter that the statement Roberts sent over \u201craises more questions than it resolves\u201d. The senator told Tapper on Sunday that everything about the revelations around Thomas and Gorsuch as well as Roberts\u2019s reaction \u201cstinks\u201d. Seemingly alluding to recent polling which showed that public confidence in the supreme court has plummeted to historic lows, Durbin said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have that sort of thing happening at the highest court in America. It just destroys the integrity of the court.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-12T14:02:36Z",
            "content": "For Sharon Henderson, bringing the killer of her daughter Nikki Allan to justice has been an all-consuming, personally ruinous three-decade mission. \u201cWhile there was still breath in my body, I would never have stopped until the man who killed Nikki was found,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing mattered more in my life than seeing justice for her. Over these 30 years, I have been through hell. I\u2019ve fought against problems with alcohol and I\u2019ve been sectioned in a psychiatric hospital. But I knew I\u2019d get him, one way or another, however long it took \u2026 I\u2019d see him locked up.\u201d The Nikki Allan story is one of unimaginable human cruelty, devastated lives and glaring police failings, but also one of justice, albeit justice that took 31 years to achieve. The cruelty is difficult to grasp. Newcastle crown court heard how Nikki, a shy and clingy seven-year-old, skipped into the clutches of her killer because he was someone she knew and had no reason not to trust. That man was David Boyd who, for reasons that will never be fully known, battered her head with a brick, rolled up her T-shirt, and stabbed her 37 times. He dragged her body down cellar steps to try to hide her. The ruined lives include that of George Heron, an innocent man who was hectored by police into making a confession and was later acquitted by a jury. Henderson says her life has been taken away. \u201cI\u2019ve become estranged from most of my family through this, it\u2019s taken over my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI spent many years drinking to dangerous levels because of this, and since Nikki\u2019s death I\u2019ve been admitted to psychiatric care. \u201cMy three other daughters have grown up knowing a mother who couldn\u2019t get over the death of their sister and who was drinking herself to death. They\u2019ve lived with someone who just couldn\u2019t give up searching for the killer. My life has been on hold for 30 years until someone was finally brought to justice.\u201d Nikki\u2019s family and her killer all lived on the Garths, run-down and now demolished blocks of 1930s maisonettes in Sunderland\u2019s east end, near the docks. Henderson\u2019s search for Nikki\u2019s killer began with trying to track down any man who lived on the estate whom she had suspicions about. To help her memory, she drew out a map of the block and tried to eliminate each in turn. Eventually, only one person was left, she said: David Boyd. At the time, he was using the surname Smith and also Bell, so no one knew his true identity. Henderson said Boyd, then in his mid-20s, was a friend of her sister\u2019s partner but she had never been able to find anything about his earlier life. \u201cHe was a young man then, but a loner; the only time I can remember seeing him was when he was out on the veranda in front of the flats on his floor. I don\u2019t remember speaking to him. He was there during the police search for Nikki and always hanging around \u2026 but after Nikki\u2019s death he left the Garth.\u201d She went on a mission to track him down. \u201cI made it my business to become friends with his girlfriend and her daughter and I even moved to Ryhope [a former pit village on the outskirts of Sunderland] to be near them. I wanted to be close to them and find out what they knew about who and where he was. I just knew he had something to do with it.\u201d In 2006, Northumbria police confirmed that a cold case team were reinvestigating Nikki\u2019s murder. One senior officer at the time, talking to the Guardian, denied that they were only doing so because of Henderson\u2019s campaigning. Henderson sees it differently. \u201cI was so badly let down by the police, they had so many chances to catch Boyd years and years ago. Instead I have spent 30 years investigating Nikki\u2019s death myself and I could have been spared that if the police had done their job properly. \u201cI was treated like a drunken mother with mental health problems, I never felt listened to by the police.\u201d Ultimately, it was diligent police work that resulted in Boyd\u2019s arrest in 2018, and now, 31 years after the crime, his conviction for murder. Advances in forensic science and DNA testing have proved to be the key, with Boyd\u2019s DNA matching microscopic samples found on the waistband of Nikki\u2019s shorts and under the armpits of her T-shirt. The jury was played police bodycam footage of Boyd\u2019s arrest at his flat in Stockton-on-Tees in 2018. The case against Boyd has been gradually and carefully assembled, in stark contrast to the original investigation, in which police quickly arrested the wrong man and failed to properly investigate anyone else. George Heron was 24 and had recently moved to the Garths with his sister. At first, Heron denied knowing Nikki, but he changed his story when witnesses came forward to say they knew each other. Other evidence included a knife that seemed to match stab wounds. He had been seen buying cheese and onion crisps, Nikki\u2019s favourite, which police believed the killer used to lure Nikki into the building where she died. After three days of police questioning, Heron confessed to killing Nikki. Before then he had denied it 120 times. The hatred directed at Heron was immense, meaning the trial was held in Leeds rather than in north-east England. That did not stop local people travelling daily to the court and packing the public gallery. The case against Heron unravelled quickly when the judge, after two weeks of legal argument, ruled that six of 12 police interview tapes were inadmissible because officers had used \u201coppressive methods\u201d to obtain the confession. But still the prosecution continued, with Heron accused of offering Nikki crisps, cigarettes and money to lure the girl. One witness said Heron would sometimes cuddle Nikki and tell her: \u201cI love you around the world.\u201d After a trial lasting six weeks, the jury acquitted Heron. Twenty police officers had to restrain the packed public gallery as it erupted when the jury foreman announced the not guilty verdict. Heron\u2019s solicitor, Peter Thubron, said the case was one of the saddest and most frustrating of his legal career. \u201cWe did a thorough and professional job and we obtained the correct result, but we did not congratulate ourselves on our success and we do not intend to celebrate a victory,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we come away from this case feeling very deep sadness.\u201d The judge, Mr Justice Mitchell, attacked the police\u2019s repetitive line of questioning and the nature of some of the questions, which included asking details of his sex life and whether he was gay. \u201cIt was wrong \u2026 to pound him with sexual allegations,\u201d the judge said. He also asked why only a legal executive \u2013 and not a fully qualified solicitor \u2013 was present for the first six hours of the interview. Heron had progressed from denial to full admission without the full benefit of a qualified solicitor with him at any stage. \u201cThat must never be allowed to happen again,\u201d he said. Heron moved to the south of England, living under an assumed name. When a tabloid newspaper tracked him down, he asked why he could not be left alone and said he doubted he would be around for much longer. \u201cThere were times I wondered if I had killed Nikki,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many people said I had that I started to doubt myself.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-29T05:00:09Z",
            "content": "Relatives of Gaia Pope have expressed anger and heartache at the lack of progress on key reforms in policing and healthcare they believe are needed a year after the Dorset teenager\u2019s inquest exposed dozens of failings in her care. One described the impact of her death and the legal process that followed as \u201ca wound that will never heal or even stop bleeding\u201d while another said they still felt badly traumatised and let down by the legal system. They say some of the organisations that were told by the senior coroner at the end of the inquest \u2013 one of the longest in British history \u2013 to consider changes had ignored her or made only minor tweaks. Charities that work with bereaved families and survivors of sexual assault said the relatives\u2019 complaints showed fundamental reform was needed to compel organisations to take real action when a coroner produces a preventing future deaths (PFD) report. Pope\u2019s cousin Marienna Pope-Weidemann said: \u201cFor the three months of the inquest we spent every day in a room where it\u2019s basically torture hearing the terrible details over and over. Our barrister had never seen so many PFD reports coming out of one inquest. I was pulled into hoping there would be change. \u201cAbout a week later I woke up with a really cold feeling. What is a PFD report? A coroner makes recommendations but they are completely non-binding.\u201d Pope\u2019s sister Clara Pope-Sutherland said: \u201cThe jury\u2019s findings were damning. But there is this continued feeling that we and other victims\u2019 families are being failed by the system. Reliving the trauma of what happened in the inquest is still very prevalent for all of us.\u201d Pope, who had epilepsy, went missing on 7 November 2017 from the seaside town of Swanage at a time when she feared a man who allegedly raped her was about to be released from prison and soon after being sent indecent images by another man, which relatives say triggered her post-traumatic stress disorder. Her body was found in undergrowth on a clifftop 11 days later after a flawed police search. She had died of hypothermia. The inquest jury in Bournemouth heard about a series of missed chances \u2013 the family say it added up to about 50 \u2013 to help or save her. At the end of the inquest, Rachael Griffin, the senior coroner for Dorset, wrote to 10 organisations expressing concerns and asking them to look at making specific changes. For example, Griffin asked the College of Policing to consider giving training to all police officers in England and Wales on mental health illness and epilepsy. The college wrote back saying such training was not practical because of the number of medical conditions officers would need to know about. The coroner also expressed concern about the number of specialist epilepsy nurses, having heard there were only two for 10,000 adults with epilepsy in Dorset. Since the inquest, University Hospitals Dorset NHS foundation trust has hired just one more specialist nurse who only works one day a week. Pope\u2019s family made it clear during the inquest she was devastated that the man who allegedly raped her, who went on to be jailed for other sexual offences against girls, was not prosecuted. They said the inquest exposed serious failings in how rape allegations are investigated and called for Dorset police to introduce a specialist rape unit. The force continues to insist this is not necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing we asked them to invest in,\u201d said Pope-Weidemann. \u201cGaia and other women are being badly failed by a toxic culture of misogyny within the police and other state services. \u201cThe College of Policing saying they don\u2019t need more training is disgusting. It says a lot about the culture in the police nationally around an unwillingness to take this stuff seriously. Officers are making outdated assumptions about what someone\u2019s behaviour means. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that police have more training at a time when they are increasingly called in as a first port of call because of cuts to mental health services.\u201d On the number of epilepsy nurses, Pope-Sutherland said: \u201cAs a family we do understand that the NHS is under significant pressure. It\u2019s only getting worse. But one extra nurse one day a week is frankly insulting.\u201d Lucy Nevitt, the joint founder of the Gemini Project, which campaigns for changes to the way sexual violence is investigated, called the College of Policing\u2019s stance \u201cignorant and dangerous\u201d, adding: \u201cIt is imperative that they have the relevant knowledge and skill base to respond to situations they are going to encounter.\u201d She also said all forces should have a rape and serious sexual offences unit properly resourced and supported. \u201cA refusal to set up a specialist unit suggests a refusal for adequate service provisions which is concerning.\u201d Clare Pelham, the chief executive at the Epilepsy Society, said: \u201cThe coroner was right. Better training and awareness of epilepsy is the answer.\u201d She wrote to the College of Policing last week to offer help with training. Pelham said: \u201cThe coroner was also right that we need more specialist epilepsy nurses. There are more than 600,000 people with epilepsy in the UK \u2013 that is one in 100 of us. Clearly, two specialist epilepsy nurses in Dorset is too few.\u201d Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, a charity that provides expertise on state-related deaths, said the coroner\u2019s PFD reports on Pope\u2019s case had been a \u201cvital recognition of system-wide failings\u201d and intended to protect other young women and girls. She said: \u201cDespite the importance of these potentially lifesaving recommendations, there is no public body tasked with making sure they are enacted or even checking progress. There is no one who is responsible for oversight of whether steps have been taken at a local and national level to enact changes. This shocking accountability gap undermines the preventive potential of inquests.\u201d The College of Policing accepted that its reply was not what the coroner had hoped for. But Ch Supt Andy Walker said: \u201cWhilst police officers and staff need good first aid skills, we don\u2019t think that providing them with extra medical training would be effective in helping them make better decisions about missing persons.\u201d Dorset police said all its investigative teams were specialists in the investigation of sexual offences. A spokesperson said: \u201cTherefore there is currently no plan to create a further dedicated team although we continually keep our operating model under review.\u201d University Hospitals Dorset NHS foundation trust said that as well as the part-time nurse it had appointed an epilepsy coordinator and aimed to further increase its specialist workforce. The senior Dorset coroner declined to comment. Pope-Weidemann said she remained very angry at the inquest system. \u201cI feel as traumatised by the inquest as I do by Gaia\u2019s death. We have nothing else to give and what was it all for? \u201cWhen you have lost someone you love and your family is forever changed, forever incomplete, forever suffering. It\u2019s a wound that will never heal or even stop bleeding.\u201d"

To restore the NHS, we could learn from its history. The independent contractor model of primary care has been an NHS success story and, arguably, its collapse is at the root of the service\u2019s wider malaise. Unifying fragmented primary, community and social care staff in independent, wholly subcontracted organisations under one roof, possibly as social enterprises or John Lewis-style partnerships, would improve care, lift staff morale and release funds to address the workforce crisis. Relocating services currently provided in hospitals \u2013 such as urgent care, diagnostics and outpatients \u2013 into the community would offer the opportunity for care to be delivered using the personalised, relationship-based and cost-effective model traditionally used by family doctors. Lastly, exchanging the centralised top-down system of governance for bottom-up systems of quality and accountability would reduce bureaucracy, and free clinicians and social care staff to provide the care that patients deserve. Dr Tim Reed Woodbridge, Suffolk \u2022 The push to digitise healthcare has benefits, as outlined in Keir Starmer\u2019s article (No more missing records or letters lost in the post \u2013 I will bring in a totally digital NHS, 22 May), but comes with side-effects. Many countries have seen serious hacks to medical records systems. The NHS succumbed to one last year, and a hack to a mental health records system in Finland in 2020 saw ransom money demanded from patients. It is hard to hack paper records, and impossible to hack deleted records. Perhaps these old methods should still have a place in a digital NHS. Dr Andrew Bodey Oxford \u2022 If Keir Starmer believes a fully digital NHS means no more missing records, he\u2019ll believe anything. Dr John Doherty Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire \u2022 Rafael Behr says that it is sensible for Labour \u201cto avoid too much detail about its manifesto\u201d so far away from the next election, presumably on the basis that it might spook the electorate, or that ideas might be pinched by the policy-deficient Tories (Brexit ruined Britain\u2019s appetite for revolution. That makes Starmer\u2019s job harder, 24 May). The latter can be averted by ensuring policies are radical rather than Tory-lite, and therefore unlikely to appear in the Conservative manifesto. As for spooking voters, assuming Labour policies to be based on fairness, who but the very wealthy, the most unlikely voters of all to support Labour, will be turned off Labour\u2019s revenue-raising schemes? So why not announce as soon as possible that the NHS reforms will be funded by a 1% tax on wealth over \u00a310m, which, according to Tax Justice UK, would raise \u00a310bn annually, and that extra funds for education will come from the equalisation of capital gains and income tax, likely to raise \u00a314bn a year? Announcing policies now would give Labour politicians the time they will need to justify and explain them, in the face of massive criticism, exaggeration and scaremongering from the rightwing media.

            "date": "2023-05-16T23:01:13Z",
            "content": "Tenants and campaigners have warned Michael Gove not to create a \u201cback door\u201d for unfair evictions as private rented sector reforms are unveiled on Wednesday. The legal overhaul will ban no-fault evictions but strengthen landlords\u2019 rights to throw tenants out for antisocial behaviour. The secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities will announce the renters\u2019 reform bill affecting 11 million private renters in England. \u201cToo many renters are living in damp, unsafe, cold homes, powerless to put things right and with the threat of sudden eviction hanging over them,\u201d he will say. But after lobbying from landlords, he will also \u201cstrengthen powers to evict antisocial tenants, broadening the disruptive and harmful activities that can lead to eviction and making it quicker to evict a tenant acting antisocially\u201d, his department said. It could mean renters being given a two-week notice period for antisocial behaviour evictions and that any behaviour \u201ccapable\u201d of \u201ccausing nuisance or annoyance\u201d could trigger eviction. The bill will not, however, limit the frequency with which landlords can hike rents or rent caps. It is expected to outlaw extreme rent increases targeted at pushing tenants out. This will be policed by a new ombudsman for private rented housing and the courts. It comes four years after the government first promised to ban the 1988 no-fault eviction law, which has had a chilling effect on tenants\u2019 confidence to challenge non-decent homes, of which there are estimated to be 1m in England. Since that promise was made by Theresa May and repeated in Boris Johnson\u2019s December 2019 Conservative election manifesto, more than 54,000 households in the private rented sector in England have been threatened with a no-fault eviction and almost 17,000 households were evicted by bailiffs. Gove will say: \u201cOur new laws introduced to parliament today will support the vast majority of responsible landlords who provide quality homes to their tenants, while delivering our manifesto commitment to abolish section 21 no-fault evictions. \u201cThis will ensure that everyone can live somewhere which is decent, safe and secure \u2013 a place they\u2019re truly proud to call home.\u201d Keir Starmer is expected to announce on Wednesday that a Labour government would reform the planning system and \u201cbring back local housing targets\u201d, describing his party as \u201cbuilders not blockers\u201d. Labour will become the party of housebuilders, he pledged in an interview with the Times, announcing plans to loosen restrictions on building in the green belt to help boost local housing supply. The bill looks set to be subject to fierce debate in parliament over definitions of antisocial behaviour and the policing and timing of new decency standards. Basic decent homes standards, which already apply to social housing, will be introduced, although there is no timetable yet for when landlords should fix issues such as damp, cold and pests. It comes as the private rented sector is in crisis. The number of households renting in England more than doubled between 2001 and 2021, the census showed, and demand for rentals after the pandemic is up 50% on the five-year average \u2013 and coincides with a fall in the stock of rental homes, pushing the price of new lets up more than 11% a year in March, according to Zoopla. Gove will also announce a new right for tenants to ask to live with a pet, which landlords \u201ccannot unreasonably refuse\u201d, and will make it illegal to refuse tenancies to people on benefits or with children. The London Renters Union said the bill was a \u201chuge step forward for renters forced to live under the threat of \u2018no-fault\u2019 eviction\u201d but it said \u201cit will not bring us security in our homes\u201d. \u201cLandlords could circumnavigate the new eviction ban by using large rent hikes and other \u2018back door\u2019 evictions to force unwanted tenants out,\u201d it said. The housing charity, Shelter, said the bill moved renters \u201cone step closer to fairer, more secure housing\u201d, but cautioned it must be \u201cas strong as possible with every loophole closed so that no renter can be unfairly evicted\u201d. Toby Lloyd, who was a Downing Street housing adviser when May first pledged the ban on section 21 no-fault evictions, said: \u201cWidening landlords\u2019 ability to gain possession over antisocial behaviour and non-payment of rent must not create another back door route to no fault evictions.\u201d Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, warned that the plan outlined so far \u201clacks detail\u201d and said that without assurance of repossession powers, \u201cthe bill will only exacerbate the rental housing supply crisis many tenants now face\u201d. The lobby group also called for more staff in the court system to meet what is expected to be an increased workload if antisocial behaviour evictions take off."

            "date": "2023-05-30T19:42:09Z",
            "content": "A young women\u2019s rights activist in Saudi Arabia has been arrested and imprisoned for having Twitter and Snapchat accounts that embraced recent social reforms but also demanded more fundamental rights inside the kingdom, it has emerged. Manahel al-Otaibi, a 29-year-old certified fitness instructor and artist who frequently promoted female empowerment on her social media accounts, was arrested in November 2022. Among other charges, Otaibi was accused by Saudi authorities of using a hashtag \u2013 translated to #societyisready \u2013 to call for an end to male guardianship rules. Otaibi has not yet been convicted or sentenced and remains in detention. But previous similar cases suggest that public demands for fundamental women\u2019s rights \u2013 including inheritance rights, and ability to end a marriage by an abusive husband \u2013 have been deemed seditious. The case marks the latest example of Saudis being arrested and imprisoned for using social media accounts to promote reform or challenge Saudi authorities. Salma al-Shehab, another Saudi woman and former PhD student at Leeds University, was sentenced by a terrorism court to more than three decades in jail for having a Twitter account and following and retweeting dissidents and activists. Otaibi\u2019s social media accounts portray her as a young and progressive woman who loves fitness, art, yoga, and travel, while also promoting women\u2019s rights. The kingdom has sought to project an image of a country that has liberalised strict rules governing women, including their dress and ability to work outside the home, as part of a broader campaign to promote the kingdom and tourism. But the government has nevertheless continued to crackdown on Saudi women who call for more basic reforms. Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist who lives outside the kingdom and is head of monitoring and advocacy for ALQST, a human rights group, said: \u201cAl-Otaibi\u2019s cases are yet another example of Saudi Arabia\u2019s empty promises when it comes to reforms. Saudi women still get imprisoned and face sham trials for demanding their rights, or for merely believing that they are now free to wear what they want.\u201d Court documents show that in addition to her use of social media, which was reported to authorities by religious police, Otaibi is accused of not wearing \u201cdecent\u201d clothes. Fouz al-Otaibi, her sister, was also accused of not wearing decent clothing but was able to flee Saudi Arabia before her arrest. Another sister, Maryam, is a known women\u2019s rights advocate who was detained, held, and eventually released in 2017 for protesting guardianship rules. Khalid Aljabri, a Saudi expert and frequent commentator on US-Saudi relations, said: \u201cManahel\u2019s case is an example of the hypocrisy and selective application of draconian laws by the Saudi government that hosts foreign Instagram models to promote tourism by posting pictures in swimsuits but jails Saudi women for posting photos without wearing Abayas.\u201d The government of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has frequently targeted Twitter users as part of a broad campaign of domestic and international repression, which included planting spies inside the company to extract confidential user data about anonymous Twitter accounts that were seen as threatening to the royal family. At the same time, the prince controls a major indirect stake in Twitter through the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF). Saudi\u2019s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who is one of the richest investors in the world, controls the largest investment in Twitter after Elon Musk, as well as a $250m (\u00a3200m) stake in Snapchat, according to previous press accounts. The Saudi investor has not been seen outside Saudi or the United Arab Emirates since his 2017 arrest and detention at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh, where wealthy Saudis and members of the royal family were reportedly tortured and shaken down as part of a vast so-called \u201canti-corruption\u201d purge ordered by the crown prince. Alwaleed denied any maltreatment or torture when he was interviewed by Bloomberg in 2018, weeks after his release, but acknowledged at the time that he had reached an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with the kingdom that was \u201cconfidential and secret between me and the government\u201d. Snapchat promotes itself as a website where users in Saudi Arabia can be \u201cfree to live in the moment and be themselves\u201d, according to a company blog. \u201cIn Saudi Arabia, Snapchatters are championing transparency, reimagining online life as something that feels real, fulfilling, and genuinely fun,\u201d it says. An April 2023 article in Arab News, which is a state sponsored news site in Saudi, describes how Snapchat agreed a recent collaboration with Saudi\u2019s ministry of culture, to help Saudis get \u201chands-on experience and training in augmented reality\u201d. Snapchat did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Guardian\u2019s request for comment from Twitter\u2019s press office received a reply of a poo emoji, which is the company\u2019s automatic response to press inquiries since Musk\u2019s takeover of the company."

            "date": "2023-05-28T12:00:31Z",
            "content": "Congress \u201cabsolutely\u201d can force ethics reform on the US supreme court, a senior Democratic senator said, countering arguments made by Harlan Crow, the Republican mega-donor whose gifts to the conservative justice Clarence Thomas are the source of scandal, and by John Roberts, the chief justice himself. \u201cIt is not going to be easy,\u201d Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday. \u201cThe work that we\u2019re doing on ethics in the court ought to be easy. And yet it\u2019s not. It\u2019s partisan also. \u201cSo I think that the first step is going to be for the judicial conference, the other judges, to put some constraints around the supreme court\u2019s behavior and treat the supreme court the way all other federal judges are treated.\u201d Supreme court justices are nominally subject to federal ethics laws but in practice govern themselves. Thomas has said he did not declare gifts from Crow including luxury travel and resort stays, a property purchase involving his mother and school fees for a great-nephew because he was informally advised he did not have to. He has said he will do so in future. Observers have said Thomas clearly broke ethics laws. Democrats have called for Thomas to resign or be impeached, the former unlikely, the latter a political non-starter. Crow denies wrongdoing and claims never to have discussed with Thomas politics or business before the court. The Guardian has shown Crow to have had business before the court during his friendship with Thomas. Crow has also donated to groups linked to Ginni Thomas, the justice\u2019s far-right activist wife who supported Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Whitehouse\u2019s NBC host, Chuck Todd, said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty established Congress can\u2019t [impose ethics law on the supreme court], right?\u201d The senator said: \u201cNo, it absolutely can.\u201d Todd said: \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s constitutional.\u201d Whitehouse said: \u201cYes, it does. It means it\u2019s constitutional because the laws that we\u2019re talking about right now are actually laws passed by Congress. The ethics reporting law that is at the heart of the Clarence Thomas ethics reporting scandal is a law passed by Congress.\u201d Todd repeated the argument about separation of powers, between the legislature (Congress), executive (presidency) and judiciary, which lawyers for Crow and Roberts himself have cited in refusing to cooperate with information requests from the Democratic-run Senate judiciary and finance committees. Whitehouse, a member of both panels, countered: \u201cCertainly we can do the administrative side of judicial \u2026 I\u2019ll be the first one to concede, if there\u2019s a case in the judicial branch of government, we in the Congress have nothing to say about it. \u201cBut in terms of administering how the internal ethics of the judicial branch are done \u2013 heck, the judicial conference which does that is a creation of Congress.\u201d The senator also called the Roberts court a \u201cfact-free zone as well as an ethics-free zone\u201d. Referring to suggestions justices should pledge to observe ethics laws during the confirmation process, Whitehouse said: \u201cWe saw how the pledges on Roe v Wade went in the confirmation process.\u201d Roe, the 1973 ruling which guaranteed the right to abortion, was last year struck down by a 5-4 majority, all three justices appointed by Donald Trump (Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett) voting in the majority. In the words of Factcheck.org: \u201cA close examination of the carefully worded answers by the three Trump appointees \u2026 shows that while each acknowledged at their hearings that Roe was precedent, and should be afforded the weight that that carries, none specifically committed to refusing to consider overturning it.\u201d Whitehouse continued: \u201cYou get on to the court, and there you are, and there\u2019s no process for determining what the facts are. That\u2019s part of the problem here. \u201cWhen Justice Thomas failed to recuse himself from the January 6 investigation that turned up his wife\u2019s communications [with Trump officials], he made the case that that was OK because he had no idea that she was involved in insurrection activities. \u201cThat is a question of fact. That\u2019s something that could have, and should have, been determined by a neutral examination. And so the problem with the supreme court is that they\u2019re in a fact-free zone as well as an ethics-free zone.\u201d Whitehouse has campaigned against so-called \u201cdark money\u201d in US politics. Asked if he trusted the federal court system to be fair and impartial, he said: \u201cUsually, I think the trial courts are very strong. \u201cI think \u2026 we\u2019ve seen honest courtrooms make amazing differences with Dominion v Fox, with the parents at Sandy Hook against the creep who was pretending that their children\u2019s murder wasn\u2019t real, and now with the judgment against Donald Trump. \u201cSo honest courtrooms are really important to cut through to the truth. When you get to the supreme court, if it\u2019s an interest in which the big rightwing billionaires are concerned, [it\u2019s] very hard to count on getting a fair shot.\u201d Asked if he was saying donors like Crow dictated how justices voted, Whitehouse said: \u201cThat would be what the evidence suggests. \u201cI think the statistics are pretty stunning at how often the judges who came out of the Federalist Society\u201d \u2013 a conservative group which works to shape federal nominations \u2013 \u201cdo what they\u2019re told by the amicus groups that come in on behalf of the right wing.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-30T14:56:54Z",
            "content": "Experts say this is likely to be one of the deadliest years on record on Mount Everest, with variable weather caused by climate change being blamed as one of the main reasons for the deaths of up to 17 people. A total of 12 people have now been confirmed dead during Everest expeditions this season and another five are missing, presumed dead, as no contact has been made for at least five days in all cases, according to the Himalayan Database, which tracks mountain fatalities. The figure was confirmed by Yuba Raj Khatiwada, the director of Nepal\u2019s tourism department. \u201cAltogether this year we lost 17 people on the mountain this season,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main cause is the changing in the weather. This season the weather conditions were not favourable, it was very variable. Climate change is having a big impact in the mountains.\u201d It would make this year one of the worst on record for deaths on Everest, matched only by the events of 2014 when 17 died, most of whom were local sherpas killed in an avalanche. On average, between five and 10 people die on Everest every year but recent years have seen a spike. Among those who lost their lives climbing Everest this year were Jason Kennison, a 40-year-old mechanic from Australia who had overcome spinal injuries to climb to the top but could not make it back down, a Canadian doctor, Pieter Swart, and three Nepalese sherpas who died in an avalanche in April. Those still missing include solo Hungarian climber Suhajda Szil\u00e1rd, who scaled the mountain without a sherpa guide or additional oxygen, and an Indian-Singaporean climber who is feared to have fallen off the mountain. This year has been more deadly than 2019, when images went viral of overcrowding and \u201ccarnage\u201d on Everest, with hundreds of climbers waiting up to 12 hours to scale the mountain and reports that people were forced to clamber over bodies and incapacitated climbers. A total of 11 people died that year. The Nepal government has been criticised for issuing 479 permits this year, the highest number ever. At \u00a312,000 each, they are a major income generator for the small cash-strapped country, and the government has been reluctant to scale back numbers. Khatiwada denied it was too many, saying the number was high this year because the window for climbing had opened earlier and the season had been longer than usual, so that there was no overcrowding. The rising death toll comes as the 70th anniversary of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay\u2019s historic first ascent to the peak of Everest was celebrated on Monday. It marked the start of a global obsession among mountaineers to scale the world\u2019s highest peak, with over 10,000 ascents since and demand for climbing permits increasing every year. Ang Norbu Sherpa, the president of the Nepal National Mountain Guide Association, said \u201ctoo many\u201d permits were being issued and it was putting environmental pressure on the mountain. \u201cThe climbing has pattern has changed, it used to be hardened climbers but now it is a lot of novice climbers who want to get to the summit of Everest,\u201d said Sherpa. Experts and celebrated mountaineers have warned that Everest, which tops 8,848 metres, is now seen as a \u201ctourist destination\u201d and a playground for the thrill-seeking rich, even those with little experience of climbing at high altitude, who are willing to pay upwards of \u00a348,000 to be guided to the summit. Alan Arnette, a mountaineer who climbed Everest in 2011 and now writes regularly on conditions, said this year had been \u201cchaos\u201d. \u201cThe root cause of the high number of deaths lies with inexperienced clients who push themselves too hard and do not turn back soon enough,\u201d he said. \u201cMany guide companies have no experience requirements and accept anyone, telling them \u2018We will teach you everything you need to know.\u2019 But when the client gets in trouble, they can be abandoned to save the lives of the support staff. We saw several clients abandoned this season, left alone on the upper mountain, with some still missing today.\u201d There had also been concerns that the increased human activity at Everest base camp, which is located on the Khumbu glacier, is making it unstable and unsafe, exacerbating dangerous conditions already created by global warming. According to a recent survey, Everest\u2019s glaciers have lost 2,000 years of ice in just the past 30 years. In order to cater to the demands of upwards of 400 climbers annually, about 1,500 people will come to base camp during the season, where luxury facilities can include massages and evening entertainment. Helicopters are also now a common way to reach base camp. A plan was put forward last year by Nepal officials to move the base camp to a spot lower down the mountain, off the thinning glacier. Khatiwada confirmed that a plan was under way to change the rules so no trekkers could spend the night at base camp, and instead would have to stay lower down. However, this plan has faced resistance by the sherpa community, who voiced concern that it would add three hours to the Everest climb and could potentially make it more dangerous. Sherpa said there were plans to learn how to better manage the base camp, rather than moving it. \u201cIt is a big question mark for local people where it could be moved to,\u201d he said. The high number of climbers is also escalating the problem of the massive amount of rubbish left strewn on Everest. Though the situation has improved slightly since the introduction of a \u00a33,200 \u201cgarbage deposit\u201d, which is only returned if they bring back 8kg of rubbish, local guides say the mountain is still littered with rubbish, particularly plastic, at the end of every season."

It\u2019s a vital question for mountaineers hoping to climb the world\u2019s highest peak, but it is also important for climate scientists, whose models indicate that global heating will be amplified at high elevations. In May 2019, the National Geographic and Rolex Mount Everest expedition supported two climate scientists in setting up the highest weather station in the world, perched on the south-east ridge of Everest at a height of 8,430m (27,657ft), along with another weather station on the South Col, at a height of 7,945m. Now, the first insights into the weather near the summit of Everest are emerging. Writing in the journal Weather, Tenzing Chogyal Sherpa and colleagues report on the winter weather conditions near the summit, revealing wind chill temperatures plunging as low as -83C, creating an environment where frostbite would occur in less than a minute. The combination of strong winds and low humidity were shown to be driving significant snow and ice loss, resulting in the peak shrinking by up to 90cm during the winter months (assuming no fresh snowfall). Between one-fifth and one-quarter of the world\u2019s population get their water from the Himalaya, so data such as this is invaluable for understanding the impact of climate change on water resources."

            "content": "Many Europeans are alarmed by the climate crisis and would willingly take personal steps and back government policies to help combat it, a survey suggests \u2013 but the more a measure would change their lifestyle, the less they support it. The seven-country YouGov survey tested backing for state-level climate action, such as banning single-use plastics and scrapping fossil-fuel cars, and individual initiatives including buying only secondhand clothes and giving up meat and dairy products. The responses, from the UK, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and Italy, suggested many people were happy with measures that would not greatly affect the way they lead their lives, but bigger steps that may be necessary were unpopular. Large majorities in all the countries surveyed \u2013 ranging from 60% in Sweden, 63% in Germany and 65% in the UK to 77% in Spain, 79% in France and 81% in Italy \u2013 said they were very or fairly worried about climate change and its effects. Broadly similar percentages said the climate was changing because of human activity, with fewer than 20% of respondents in most countries saying climate change was not due to human activity and a maximum of 5% denying it was even happening. There was also strong support of between 76% and 85% for the view that all countries would be more effective at tackling climate change if they worked together with others \u2013 but less agreement about what exactly individuals were willing to do about it. Measures entailing no great lifestyle sacrifice were popular, with between 45% (Germany) and 72% (Spain) backing government tree-planting programmes and 60% (Spain) and 77% (UK) saying they would grow more plants themselves or were doing so already. Between 40% (Denmark) and 56% (UK, Spain and Italy) of respondents would happily never buy products made of single-use plastic again, while between 63% (Sweden) and 75% (Spain) would support a government ban on them. Similarly, there was fairly solid support \u2013 from 28% in Germany to 43% in Italy \u2013 for the idea of limiting meat and dairy intake to two or three meals a week; between 24% (in the UK) and 48% (in Italy) would back government legislation to that effect. Unsurprisingly, government subsidies to make homes more energy efficient were wildly popular, with support ranging from 86% in Spain to 67% in Germany, while covering the costs personally was rather less so (19% in Germany to 40% in Spain). There was broad support, too, for frequent flyer levies (from 39% in Italy to 59% in Germany, with a majority in five out of the seven countries in favour), but much less for buying only secondhand clothes (from 17% in Germany to 27% in the UK). Even more radical proposals, such as voluntarily eating no more meat and dairy and having fewer children than you would like, were supported by between barely 10% (Germany) and 19% (Italy), and 9% (Germany) and 17% (Italy) respectively. Changes in car use, a major contributor to carbon emissions and an area in which many European governments are already legislating, also drew responses that showed a close correlation to the impact they might have on people\u2019s lives. Asked whether they would be willing to switch to an electric car, an average of just under a third of respondents across the seven countries surveyed \u2013 ranging from 19% in Germany through 32% in Denmark to 40% in Italy \u2013 answered positively. Responses were more varied when it came to giving up driving altogether in favour of using public transport, walking or cycling. In France, Spain and Italy, 35%, 44% and 40% respectively said they would be willing to make the move. Support was lower in Britain (22%), Germany (24%), Denmark (20%) and Sweden (21%) \u2013 although 25% of French, and 28% of Germans, said they already walked, cycled or used public transport rather than driving, against 11% to 16% elsewhere. An obligatory increase in fuel duty, however, and government legislation banning the production and sale of petrol and diesel cars outright, were not popular. Those opposed to paying more fuel tax outnumbered those in favour in all countries. And asked what they thought of a ban on fossil fuel cars, only in Spain and Italy were more people happy with the idea than opposed to it \u2013 with the level of opposition in countries such as France and Germany, at more than 60%, almost double the support. YouGov questioned representative samples of more than 1,000 respondents in each country, with fieldwork carried out between 5 and 24 April."

            "content": "Nationwide raids against members of the German climate protest group Letzte Generation (Last Generation) have been carried out at the behest of authorities in Munich investigating charges that the group is a criminal organisation. Launched at 7am local time on Wednesday, 170 police officers took part in the raids, which targeted 15 properties in seven German states, including Bavaria and Berlin. According to the Munich general public prosecutor\u2019s office, the searches took place at the request of the Bavarian state criminal police office (LKA), which is in the preliminary stages of an investigation, based on \u201cnumerous criminal complaints received from the population\u201d against seven people, members of Letzte Generation aged between 22 and 38, who are suspected of \u201cforming or supporting a criminal organisation\u201d, according to prosecutors. On a police directive, the homepage of the group was shut down and possessions belonging to members were seized. There were no arrests. The seven individuals are accused of setting up a donation campaign with funds of \u20ac1.4m (\u00a31.22m) to finance the group\u2019s future legal battles, in order to allow the campaigners to continue their protests, including gluing themselves to roadways and bridges, more recently to vehicles, and holding up traffic, as well as throwing substances at paintings in art galleries and other activities. There have been mixed reactions to their protests by the public. The LKA said two of the defendants were also suspected of having tried to sabotage the Trieste-Ingolstadt oil pipeline in April 2022. The group, akin to the UK\u2019s Extinction Rebellion group, wants to draw attention to what it perceives as the government\u2019s lack of urgent action over the climate emergency. Among their demands are a 100km/h speed limit on German autobahns as well as a permanent offer of a \u20ac9 a month ticket to use public transport. Letzte Generation first came to prominence before the last federal election in 2021, when participants in the group went on a hunger strike, camping outside the Bundestag, demanding to talk to prospective government members about their demands. In its first reaction to the raids on Twitter, Letzte Generation wrote: \u201cWhen will they raid the lobby structures and seize the government\u2019s fossil fuel money?\u201d followed by the hashtags \u201cNationwide raid\u201d and \u201cV\u00f6lligBekloppt\u201d \u2013 \u201ccompletely idiotic\u201d \u2013 a reference to recent condemnation of the group by the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz."

            "date": "2023-05-16T05:02:21Z",
            "content": "For farmers, growing food and fibre is no longer enough in an age of global heating. This week our local Landcare group is running a workshop on environmental accounting where farmers learn to measure their \u201cnatural capital\u201d, such as native vegetation, fauna and soil. Right now, they are getting swamped by offers to sell carbon and biodiversity credits, often to provide other industries with offsets. I can plant a paddock of trees here so that you can release emissions over there. Tales of potential riches compete with dire warnings of regret for people who sign up to long-term contracts without knowing exactly what they are in for. Every week in my inbox press releases herald the next big offer for farmers when it comes to selling carbon and reducing emissions. It is a far cry from 10 years ago, when emissions-intensive industries including energy, transport and agriculture walked in lock step against any change to business as usual. One of the big opportunities missed in the decade-long climate wars was the chance for agriculture to lay out its case separate from the fossil fuel industry. While agriculture will need to keep reducing emissions to stay in the game, the advantage that farmers have over the coal and gas industry is, simply, that they are producing food. There are fewer alternatives to land-produced food at scale, notwithstanding new ventures in lab-based meats and high-rise farming. By dragging its feet when it came to accepting climate science, agriculture left itself open to getting lumped in with fossil fuels as an industry holding back necessary change. It is now seen as having a big role to play in providing offsets even though many of the smart operators are wary of selling their carbon. The bottom line is, if large numbers of offsets are required by fossil fuel companies and other industries, that will have a material impact on agricultural land. So do you grow food, or carbon, or both? If it is more lucrative to be paid to plant trees to offset digging up coal and gas than it is to grow food, economics might push farmers into taking up the offer. The latest budget had a couple of small, unremarked initiatives that may go some way to counting the cost of unfettered offsets in the land and farming sector. The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, acknowledged there was a wariness among farmers when it came to getting independent advice on how to reduce emissions and engage with carbon and biodiversity markets. \u201cWhen I talk with farmers, they\u2019re really keen to be involved, but many of them aren\u2019t quite sure how to do it and they\u2019re really wary about who it is they\u2019re getting their advice from,\u201d Watt said. So $40m was set aside to establish a network of \u201csustainable agriculture facilitators\u201d to provide that advice. This contract will go to tender shortly but it is understood Landcare groups and natural resource management groups with existing relationships with farmers are well placed. The Australian Bureau of Resource Economics and Sciences is also getting $38m to start crunching the numbers on different land uses, including the offset market. Abares will develop a landscape model which measures the effects of domestic and international policies such as the safeguard mechanism as well as low-carbon food production policies demanded by other countries. It will also survey low-emissions agricultural practices at an individual farm level and a sector-wide level to understand what might work in different regions. The idea is to provide regional context for farmers to consider the opportunity cost of taking up different practices. Examples might include the use of red Asparagopsis algae versus other feed supplements to reduce methane. The Abares executive director, Dr Jared Greenville, said producers were \u201cflying a little bit blind into a low-carbon world\u201d because of all the different options and requirements at play, including whether to offset or inset emissions. Insetting is where you mitigate climate risk within your business. A cattle farm might plant out a riparian zone to grow carbon, for example, to balance out the emissions from its beef operation. Greenville hopes the research will provide farmers and policymakers with a better understanding of the impact of changing land use. \u201cThe real focus of that is \u2026 to provide good policy advice to government,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to increase the use of offsets for fossil fuel industries, transporting and the like, then that has the potential to impact land use.\u201d What is clear is that farmers will need to balance their emissions inside their own businesses as the world moves towards net zero. \u201cIf there\u2019s no land inset options to agriculture in 20 years\u2019 time and we move into net zero, offsetting agriculture\u2019s emissions \u2026 is going to be more costly,\u201d Greenville said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite likely that if you want to get to a least-cost path then not selling all your offsets [carbon credits] today is the best strategy. We haven\u2019t done the work to back that up but that\u2019s quite likely where I\u2019d say it\u2019s to go.\u201d Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"

            "date": "2023-05-09T05:00:11Z",
            "content": "Methane leaks alone from Turkmenistan\u2019s two main fossil fuel fields caused more global heating in 2022 than the entire carbon emissions of the UK, satellite data has revealed. Emissions of the potent greenhouse gas from the oil- and gas-rich country are \u201cmind-boggling\u201d, and an \u201cinfuriating\u201d problem that should be easy to fix, experts have told the Guardian. The data produced by Kayrros for the Guardian found that the western fossil fuel field in Turkmenistan, on the Caspian coast, leaked 2.6m tonnes of methane in 2022. The eastern field emitted 1.8m tonnes. Together, the two fields released emissions equivalent to 366m tonnes of CO2, more than the UK\u2019s annual emissions, which are the 17th-biggest in the world. Methane emissions have surged alarmingly since 2007 and this acceleration may be the biggest threat to keeping below 1.5C of global heating, according to scientists. It also seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, researchers say. The Guardian recently revealed that Turkmenistan was the worst in the world for methane \u201csuper emitting\u201d leaks. Separate research suggests a switch from the flaring of methane to venting may be behind some of these vast outpourings. Flaring is used to burn unwanted gas, putting CO2 into the atmosphere, but is easy to detect and has been increasingly frowned upon in recent years. Venting simply releases the invisible methane into the air unburned, which, until recent developments in satellite technology, had been hard to detect. Methane traps 80 times more heat than CO2 over 20 years, making venting far worse for the climate. Experts told the Guardian that the Cop28 UN climate summit being hosted in the United Arab Emirates in December was an opportunity to drive methane-cutting action in Turkmenistan. The two petrostates have close ties and there is pressure on the UAE to dispel doubts that a big oil and gas producer can deliver strong outcomes from the summit. Tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions, and therefore global heating. Action to stem leaks often pays for itself, as the gas captured can be sold. But the maintenance of infrastructure in Turkmenistan is very poor, according to experts. \u2018Out of control\u2019 \u201cMethane is responsible for almost half of short-term [climate] warming and has absolutely not been managed up to now \u2013 it was completely out of control,\u201d said Antoine Rostand, the president of Kayrros. \u201cWe know where the super emitters are and who is doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need the policymakers and investors to do their job, which is to crack down on methane emissions. There is no comparable action in terms of [reducing] short-term climate impacts.\u201d Super-emissions from oil and gas installations were readily ended, Rostand said, by fixing valves or pipes or, at the very least, relighting flares: \u201cIt\u2019s very simple to do, it has no cost for the citizen, and for the producers, the cost is completely marginal.\u201d The satellite data used by Kayrros to detect methane has been collected since the start of 2019 and Turkmenistan\u2019s overall emissions show a level trend since then. Satellites have also detected 840 super-emitting events, ie leaks from single wells, tanks or pipes at a rate of a few tonnes an hour or more, the most from any nation. Most of the facilities leaking the methane were owned by Turkmenoil, the national oil company, Kayrros said. Further undetected methane emissions will be coming from Turkmenistan\u2019s offshore oil and gas installations in the Caspian Sea, but the ability of satellites to measure methane leaks over water is still being developed. Kayrros also did some high-resolution monitoring of the North Bugdayly field in western Turkmenistan. The number of super-emitter events there doubled to almost 60 between 2021 and 2022, with one recent super-emitter pouring out methane for almost six weeks. Turkmenistan is China\u2019s second biggest supplier of gas, after Australia, and is planning to double its exports to the country. Until 2018, Turkmen citizens had received free gas and electricity. However, the country is also very vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, with the likelihood of severe drought projected to increase \u201cvery significantly\u201d over the 21st century and yields of major crops expected to fall. \u2018Huge opportunity\u2019 Speaking freely about the repressive and authoritarian state is difficult but sources told the Guardian it was a \u201cvery depressing\u201d situation, with Turkmenistan probably the worst country in the world in dealing with methane leaks. They said preventing or fixing the leaks represented a \u201chuge opportunity\u201d but that the lack of action was \u201cinfuriating\u201d. Turkmenistan could stop the leaks from ageing Soviet-era equipment and practices, they said, and the country could be the \u201cworld\u2019s biggest methane reducer\u201d. But the huge gas resources on tap meant \u201cthey never cared if it leaked\u201d. It was also not a priority for the president, Serdar Berdimuhamedov, they said, without whose approval little happens. This is despite Berdimuhamedov, then deputy chair of the cabinet of ministers, telling the UN climate summit Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 that Turkmenistan was reducing greenhouse gas emissions \u201cby introducing modern technologies in all spheres of the state\u2019s economy\u201d, with \u201cspecial attention\u201d to the reduction of methane emissions. Berdimuhamedov also welcomed the Global Methane Pledge (GMP) to cut emissions, but Turkmenistan has failed to join the 150 nations now signed. Neither are Turkmenoil and Turkengas, the state companies, members of a voluntary UN initiative to cut leaks, the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP2), which covers about 40% of global oil and gas production. \u201cThe president hasn\u2019t followed up,\u201d said a source. Largest hotspot Recent scientific research, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, found that the west coast of Turkmenistan was \u201cone of the largest methane hotspots in the world\u201d. Detailed analysis of satellite data revealed 29 different super-emitter events between 2017 and 2020, although older satellite data showed that \u201cthis type of emission has been occurring for decades\u201d. The researchers said 24 of the 29 super-emitter events came from flare stacks that had been extinguished and were then venting methane directly into the air, and that all were managed by state companies. The other five were linked to pipeline leaks. The scientists said that \u201cthe more frequent emitters would conflict with Turkmen law, which bans continuous gas flaring and venting\u201d. \u201cFlaring is very easy to identify from the flame itself,\u201d said Itziar Irakulis-Loitxate, of the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia in Spain, who led the study. \u201cBut venting was something that you could not identify easily until two years ago.\u201d The switch to venting, a far worse environmental practice, was \u201cmind-boggling\u201d, according to another expert. The scientists said the prevalence of venting \u201cpoints to the risks of penalising flaring without effective measures to control venting\u201d. The World Bank founded a global initiative to end flaring in 2015. \u2018Forcing mechanism\u2019 The UN climate summit in December represented an opportunity for change, sources said, as it is being hosted by the UAE, which has strong links with Turkmenistan and expertise in oil and gas production. The most recent visit by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed, the UAE\u2019s deputy prime minister, to Turkmenistan was in February. He met Berdimuhamedov and discussed with him bilateral cooperation \u201cin vital sectors such as oil and gas\u201d. The UAE is a member of the Global Methane Pledge and the state oil company, Adnoc, is a member of the OGMP2. Adnoc recently announced a partnership to develop a \u201csupergiant gas field\u201d called Galkynysh and other energy projects in Turkmenistan. However, Adnoc did not respond to a request for information on how the company would help limit methane emissions in the country. The Guardian understands diplomatic efforts are being made to urge Turkmenistan to cut its methane emissions. \u201cWe are really hoping Cop28 is a forcing mechanism,\u201d a source said. The Guardian contacted Turkmenoil, Turkmengaz, the Turkmenistan ministry of foreign affairs and the Turkmen embassy in the UK for comment, but none responded. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 May 2023 because an earlier version described Turkmenistan as China\u2019s biggest supplier of gas. In fact the country is China\u2019s second biggest supplier of gas, after Australia."

In order to start solving the housing problem, would it not be possible to build new garden cities and suburbs? Why not allow building on some of the numerous sterile, hedgeless, fields growing cereals or monocultural ryegrass, but with the presumption that any building scheme would result in increased biodiversity? With tree planting, allotments, and front gardens not concreted over for parking numerous cars, this would be easy to achieve. Igor Cusack Greystones, County Wicklow There is a way that green belts can be built on and still retain their traditional purpose. Instead of just being an area where city dwellers can experience nature, they should be given a new role as \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d for city emissions. There should be a specific set of planning requirements, with sufficient funding, to ensure that all development on the green belt is carbon negative. This would incentivise environmental building techniques which could be exported around the world. The government needs to establish green belt development corporations which ensure that the increases in land value on granting planning permission are captured and converted into green technology advances that benefit us all. Richard Gilyead Saffron Walden, Essex Moore is correct in his optimism for a Labour government\u2019s housebuilding ideas under Keir Starmer. The notion that a green belt, rigorously enforced, is adversely changing cities is too simplistic. Less affluent house buyers in urban areas need to be centrally located to avoid transport costs and to be near resources. It is gentrification that has made urban development expensive. Brownfield sites exist in all our towns and cities, but superior buying power and weak control on low-cost housing provision has excluded poorer buyers. Jonathan Hauxwell Crosshills, North Yorkshire Children deserve better Thank you for drawing attention to the issue of a lack of care for children with mental health problems (\u201cBecky, 12, tried to kill herself. The care she received? Eight weeks in solitary\u201d, Comment). As someone who benefited from three inpatient stays in the 90s between the ages of 14-17, I can testify to the importance of receiving care. I\u2019m still in touch with a number of former patients who also benefited from secure, safe inpatient care. These were once kids who tried to commit suicide (myself at the age of 12), self harmed, were abused, starved themselves. We remember those who didn\u2019t make it, the child who starved herself to death or the young adult who jumped in front of a train. Without suitable care many children end up in the revolving door of adult mental health or they die. Thank you for shining a light on this as without change more lives will be lost.

Sales stagnate in UK as brands withdraw plant-based products\u201d, News). The issue isn\u2019t that vegan food isn\u2019t selling well. It\u2019s that, as your article mentions, the \u201cplant-based\u201d sector is considered premium. In today\u2019s world, people just can\u2019t afford this. All the companies that jumped into \u201cplant-based\u201d realised the same thing \u2013 create a plant-based formulation, but charge twice the price of the meat/dairy analogue. I\u2019m afraid it presented veganism as a luxury but for me and others it\u2019s a core belief which we ask is respected in a similar way to religious eating requirements. No food manufacturer would create a halal or kosher version of their product and charge double the price, for example. So why with mass market veganism? Keir Thomas-Bryant, Manchester Vegetarian and Vegan Group Cadishead, Greater Manchester Trumpian Tories You report that Tories are warning of the danger of a \u201cTrump-style takeover\u201d (\u201cSenior Tories say party is finished if it lurches to the right\u201d, News). But that happened when Boris Johnson, the nearest thing to a Trump in British politics, became prime minister in 2019. Since then, we have seen a succession of ideologues from the far right of the party be awarded seats at the cabinet table which they proved to be singularly ill-equipped to fill. Senior Tories may belatedly be waking up to the fact that they might lose their seats. But if they are worried about the direction their party is taking, they have been remarkably quiet over the past few years.

The issue of Sports Illustrated\u2019s cover photo is a dangerous one because the underlying emphasis is that age should be avoided (by all means) if it can. That is because age is seen as unwanted and that looking great is the standard that everyone (women more than men, unfortunately) will fall short of.

            "content": "Renewable energy companies have promised to build and operate projects for record low minimum power prices in a New South Wales government tender that shows market interest is high. The results of NSW\u2019s first renewable energy tender were released on Monday, kicking off a series of auctions to be held over the next decade as the state transitions from coal-fired power generation. The tender process fosters competition while providing companies and their backers with the confidence to develop projects, as winning bidders are guaranteed a minimum price for energy generation. When energy prices are higher than an undisclosed maximum, the spoils will be shared between the energy companies and the NSW government. There were winning bids of less than $35 a megawatt hour for two solar farms and less than $50 a megawatt hour for a windfarm, the auction organiser, Aemo Services, said. These prices are perhaps the lowest for such auctions ever seen in Australia. \u201cThe transition to clean renewable energy in NSW is essential and under way,\u201d said the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe. \u201cThis tender has shown how much demand there is to invest in NSW to build renewable energy and it is very welcome that this investment will also support 3,300 jobs over the next 10 years.\u201d The first tender locks in 1.4 gigawatts of new clean energy generation, bringing the total committed so far to 4.1 gigawatts as part of the former Coalition government\u2019s 12 gigawatt target by 2030. This will go some way to replacing the coal-fired power stations dropping out of the market, such as AGL\u2019s Liddell power plant did last week. The new Labor state government has made public its concerns that the looming exit of Origin\u2019s Eraring power station \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest \u2013 in 2025 could leave the market short of supply in periods of high demand. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The tender also included long-duration renewable energy storage. The winning bidder, RNE Renewables, offered a battery that would supply 50 megawatts for at least eight hours (400 megawatt hours). AEMO Services did not provide the winning bid\u2019s price. Three of the four winning bids were for projects in NSW\u2019s special renewable energy zones, including ACEN Australia\u2019s 720 megawatt solar farm planned for New England and a 400 megawatt solar farm earmarked for the central-west Orana zone, also by ACEN. The battery is in the south-west zone. Goldwind Australia also won for its 275 megawatt Coppabella windfarm in the southern tablelands. AEMO Services estimates the projects will avert as much as 11m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over a 20-year period. Wholesale power prices in the national electricity market averaged $83 a megawatt hour in the first quarter of 2023, down about two-thirds from the record levels of $264 averaged in the June quarter of last year. The executive general manager of AEMO Services, Paul Verschuer, said the projects were first assessed on their \u201csocial licence commitments, deliverability and quality\u201d, with a second level assessing financial value. \u201cThis tender round has brought forward a range of innovative and considered initiatives from proponents, including ambitious projects to secure employment outcomes for First Nations people, careful and creative site selection and other community benefits,\u201d Verschuer said."

It appears to have been a domestic accident.\u201d The spokesperson confirmed that a postmortem examination had been carried out on the man\u2019s body but said he had no further details. According to reports in the local \u00daltima Hora newspaper, the couple had been due to join friends for a boat trip on Saturday. When they failed to show, their friends alerted the police, who went to their rented farmhouse in Capdepera, in the north-east of the island, and found the man dead and his wife unconscious. The paper reported that the autopsy, performed on Monday, had determined that the man had died from carbon monoxide poisoning. According to his LinkedIn profile, Carsi studied computer engineering in Madrid before obtaining a master\u2019s in mathematical trading finance at London\u2019s Cass business school. Since 2017 he had worked as an investment analyst in Edinburgh for Baillie Gifford, it said. In his Facebook profile, Carsi said he was from Madrid, but lived in Edinburgh. Patti Montella, a friend of the couple, paid tribute to Carsi on Instagram. She wrote: \u201cJaime Carsi came into my life and took up residence in my heart, so many years ago, in London. His smile and spirit are pure love. And when he married our precious Edinburgh girl, sweet Mary, it was a match made in heaven. What a prince you are \u2013 such a magnificent soul.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-10T14:34:02Z",
            "content": "Ransomware payments have nearly doubled to $1.5m (\u00a31.2m) over the past year, with the highest-earning organisations the most likely to pay attackers, according to a survey. Sophos, a British cybersecurity firm, found that the average ransomware payment rose from $812,000 the previous year. The average payment by UK organisations in 2023 was even higher than the global average, at $2.1m. More than a quarter of the companies that made payments in the global survey handed over between $1m and $5m, with high-earning firms the most likely to fork out. The average payout by companies with revenues of more than $5bn a year was just under $2.5m. \u201cPerhaps unsurprisingly, the largest revenue organisations were most likely to pay the highest ransoms, reflecting that adversaries will adjust the amount they will accept based on ability to pay,\u201d said Sophos. Ransomware attacks involve rogue actors gaining access to an entity\u2019s computer system and deploying a piece of malware \u2013 malicious software \u2013 that encrypts computers, making it impossible to access their content. The attacker, who could also steal data as part of the attack, then demands money in exchange for decrypting or unlocking the computers. High-profile victims of ransomware attacks over the past year include Royal Mail and the Guardian. The Sophos report was drawn from a survey of 3,000 senior IT and cybersecurity professionals at a range of organisations, such as schools, retailers and healthcare providers, across 14 countries including the US, the UK and Australia. However, the 2023 survey is smaller than the previous year\u2019s, when 5,600 professionals were interviewed across 31 countries. The 2023 report interviewed 200 UK organisations. The rate of ransomware attacks in the 2023 report was unchanged from 2022, with two-thirds of respondents saying they had been hit by an attack. Singapore had the highest rate of attack at 84%, with the UK the lowest at 44%. South Africa had the biggest increase in the survey from 51% of firms in the 2022 survey to 78%. The education sector was the most likely to have experienced an attack last year at 80% \u2013 evenly split between lower and higher education organisations \u2013 which Sophos said reflected a lower level of resources and technology. The construction and property sectors were the second most affected, while IT, tech and telecoms companies reported the lowest level of attack, indicating a higher level of cyber readiness. Companies with the highest incomes were most likely to be targeted. If an organisation had annual revenue of more than $5bn it was more likely to be attacked. In three out of 10 attacks email was the root cause, such as through phishing emails, where people are fooled into clicking on a link that downloads malicious software. More than three-quarters of attacks resulted in the victims\u2019 data being encrypted and rendered inaccessible. Of those attacks, three out of 10 involved data being stolen. Nearly all organisations that had their data frozen got it back, largely through backup systems, although 46% paid the ransom \u2013 with the highest-earning companies the most likely to pay the attackers. In the UK and France, around one in 10 organisations that paid the ransom did not get data back. \u201cOrganisations with lower annual revenue have less money to fund ransom payments, forcing them to focus on backups for data recovery,\u201d said the report. \u201cAt the same time, larger revenue organisations typically have complex IT infrastructures, which may make it harder for them to use backups to recover data in a timely fashion. They are also the businesses most able to buy their way out of such situations.\u201d"

            "content": "The risk of a cyber-attack is the \u201cmain worry\u201d for broadcasters staging the Eurovision song contest on behalf of war-torn Ukraine, a BBC executive has said. Experts from the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre have been drafted in to help thwart any attempts by pro-Russian hackers to sabotage the competition\u2019s public vote on Saturday. Kate Phillips, the BBC\u2019s director of unscripted programmes, said there was no specific intelligence about an attack but that there were \u201cso many contingency plans\u201d in place if it happened. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say we\u2019re pretty attack-proof but we\u2019ve done everything we can to make sure the event is as secure as possible so people don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d Phillips said the contest would have had high security in any event but the war in Ukraine meant \u201cwe have had to up it as much as we possibly can\u201d. \u201cCyber-attacks are the main worry because they\u2019re becoming more and more frequent. Most companies seem to have been hacked,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re very conscious that we are open to a cyber-attack but everything we\u2019ve done I think mitigates that.\u201d The UK is hosting Eurovision for the first time in 25 years after Ukraine, which won last year\u2019s competition, was unable to stage the event because of the Russian invasion. The BBC is producing the two semi-finals and grand final for a global television audience of more than 160 million people. Graham Norton will host Saturday\u2019s grand final live from Liverpool\u2019s M&amp;S Bank Arena, alongside the Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham, Britain\u2019s Got Talent\u2019s Alesha Dixon and the Ukrainian singer-songwriter Julia Sanina. Organisers are especially alert to a possible cyber-attack after Italian police thwarted attempts by pro-Russian hackers to disrupt last year\u2019s event in Turin. The hackers targeted performances by Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian act that won the contest. In 2019, the online stream of the Eurovision semi-finals in Israel was hacked to show warnings of a missile strike and images of blasts in the host city, Tel Aviv. The government blamed Hamas. Phillips said it was the first time in the BBC\u2019s history that it had produced two such big events \u2013 the king\u2019s coronation and Eurovision \u2013 in the same week. She said security for both was tighter than for any previous national occasions in her television career. Officials are also alive to the possibility of a stage invasion, as happened in 2017 in Kyiv and the following year in Lisbon. \u201cIf there is an incident, there is an incident, but I think if it happened, it happened because there was nothing we could do about it,\u201d Phillips said. The BBC has worked with 36 other national broadcasters to produce a spectacle that it hopes will appeal to a worldwide television audience as well as to new viewers in the UK. She said Norton, whose droll commentary is enjoyed every year by UK viewers, would mention the war in Ukraine but only to explain why the contest was being hosted in Liverpool. Viewers can expect new twists on old Eurovision traditions such as the flag parade for Saturday night\u2019s grand final. Phillips said: \u201cIf you thought you knew Eurovision, think again, because we\u2019re taking everything up a notch.\u201d"

            "content": "The Australian commercial law firm HWL Ebsworth has fallen victim to a ransomware attack, with Russian-linked hackers claiming to have obtained client information and employee data. Late last week, the ALPHV/Blackcat ransomware group posted on its website that 4TB of company data had been hacked, including employee CVs, IDs, financial reports, accounting data, client documentation, credit card information, and a complete network map. The news was first reported by the Australian Financial Review. Blackcat was one of the top three ransomware groups targeting Australia according to a recent study by cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. The group operates as a \u201cransomware-as-a-service\u201d product for hire, and has been active since late 2021. Cybersecurity company Sophos said that the group had consistently targeted large organisations. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The group previously hacked similar customer data from real estate firm LJ Hooker late last year. Sophos said last year the attackers have broken into networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched or outdated firewall or virtual private network devices. Professional and legal services is one of the top targeted industries for such attacks, the Palo Alto study stated, with Australia the most targeted in the Asia-Pacific region. Guardian Australia has sought comment from HWL Ebsworth. After the cyber-attacks on Optus and Medibank last year, the federal government has moved to beef up cybersecurity in Australia, including more resources for the Australian federal police and the appointment of a national cybersecurity coordinator. In a speech earlier this month, the home affairs and cybersecurity minister, Clare O\u2019Neil said the Australian government saw groups acting for financial gain as \u201cpublic enemy No 1\u201d. \u201cThese groups subvert legitimate business models for financial gain, creating online portals for \u2018hacking as a service\u2019 where anyone can purchase the tools and support necessary to conduct a cyber incident or data, especially in the form of a ransomware attack,\u201d she said. \u201cThese groups represent a threat to our national economic life because every sector, every business that can pay, is a target.\u201d Medibank last week refused to release the findings of an external Deloitte report into the company\u2019s hack \u2013 which resulted in the personal information of 10 million customers being posted on the dark web \u2013 citing security concerns and saying it could put other companies at risk."

            "content": "The UK\u2019s cybersecurity agency has urged operators of critical national infrastructure, including energy and telecommunications networks, to prevent Chinese state-sponsored hackers from hiding on their systems. The National Cyber Security Centre, part of GCHQ, issued the warning after it emerged that a Chinese hacking group known as Volt Typhoon had targeted a US military outpost in the Pacific Ocean. The so-called Five Eyes intelligence group \u2013 the US, the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand \u2013 issued a joint notice detailing the nature of the Volt Typhoon threat and how to deal with it. Microsoft said in a separate statement on Thursday that Volt Typhoon had been active since mid-2021 and had targeted telecommunications infrastructure in Guam, an island hosting a US military facility that is expected to play an important role in any American response to an invasion by China of Taiwan. It said organisations had also been targeted in the US, spanning sectors including communications, manufacturing, government, IT and education. Paul Chichester, the NCSC\u2019s director of operations, said: \u201cIt is vital that operators of critical national infrastructure take action to prevent attackers hiding on their systems, as described in this joint advisory with our international partners. \u201cWe strongly encourage providers of UK essential services to follow our guidance to help detect this malicious activity and prevent persistent compromise.\u201d One of Volt Typhoon\u2019s key tactics was described as \u201cliving off the land\u201d, or using the existing IT infrastructure of their target to achieve their aims. The joint advisory provided examples of traces left by Volt Typhoon in organisations\u2019 systems, so its presence could be detected. The hackers used a \u201cweb shell\u201d, a piece of malicious code that allows rogue actors to access a web server \u2013 and then used that as a way in to connected systems. Secureworks, a US cybersecurity company that contributed to the advisory notice, said Chinese hackers tended to share their techniques with other China-based groups and that similar techniques would be deployed against UK targets. \u201cIt is likely that Chinese threat groups will be using similar tradecraft against targets in the UK,\u201d said Marc Burnard, a researcher at Secureworks. Don Smith, vice-president of threat research at Secureworks, said the method used by the attackers was akin to \u201chaving an evil system administrator on your system\u201d. Secureworks said the Chinese attackers targeting US infrastructure had been interested in data \u201cof use to Chinese interests\u201d and were an attempt secure \u201clong term strategic intelligence gain.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-21T11:50:32Z",
            "content": "To many western investors, China under president Xi Jinping is a tough nut to crack. While Chinese leaders insist that they welcome foreign investment, the ruling party\u2019s extension of control to companies, with crackdowns on domestic tech giants and more recently the \u201canti-spying\u201d raids on consulting firms, including America\u2019s blue chip Bain &amp; Company, are puzzling to the outside world. Chris Marquis, author and professor of Chinese management at the University of Cambridge, believes that part of the explanation lies in the ruling party\u2019s ideology. He says one must \u201cdig into the Maoist roots in Chinese institutions and political economy to try to understand ideas that Xi has\u201d. \u201cIn the west, it\u2019s very hard for people to really understand the depth of control [of the Chinese Communist party]. The party sits above the government, sits above the economy and the military even.\u201d With a history and sociology background, Marquis, who last year published Mao and Markets: The Communist Roots of Chinese Enterprise, has studied entrepreneurs, listed companies and provincial and city officials in China, and found that Mao Zedong\u2019s ideology, campaigns and institutions continue to have a deep influence on their thinking. For decades after the former leader Deng Xiaoping\u2019s \u201creform and opening\u201d policies of the late 1970s, the west had hoped that China\u2019s venture into open markets and private enterprise would spell the end of the state-controlled economy. \u201cThere was this dominant theory that when you open economically, political liberalisation follows,\u201d he says. \u201cWe in the west were blinded. Based on our own natural bias, [we think] we have this great system and China will want to be like us, but actually, not.\u201d While the west welcomed Deng\u2019s reforms, it largely overlooked that his premise was his \u201cfour cardinal principles\u201d, namely Mao Zedong Thought, Marxism-Leninism, \u201cpeople\u2019s democratic dictatorship\u201d and Communist party leadership. \u201cMao\u2019s ideology and dictatorship of the proletariat comes first, reform and opening is second,\u201d Marquis says. \u201cThis gives an indication that \u2018reforming and opening\u2019 is a means to an end.\u201d \u201cThere is a line from Mao to Xi, and \u2018reform and opening\u2019 [was] an aberration. Xi is working in the system that Mao created \u2013 campaign governance, the party being the centre of everything, nationalism, all these resonate with Mao.\u201d Shortly after Xi took power, he stressed the importance of the tech sector, but also earmarked cybersecurity a national priority. Xi personally chairs the Central Commission for Cybersecurity and Informatisation, which oversees the country\u2019s digital networks. The authorities\u2019 recent anti-espionage crackdown on consulting firms is one outcome of such heightened concern about national security. State media reported this month that police had raided offices across China of the Shanghai- and US-headquartered business consulting firm Capvision and accused some companies of becoming \u201caccomplices for overseas espionage, bribery, and extraction of national secrets and intelligence\u201d. This followed an investigation into Bain &amp; Company\u2019s China office in April, and the detention in March of Chinese staff at the US firm Mintz Group. The firms concerned all deny the allegations. The party has tightened its leash on the tech sector, with a number of industry leaders mysteriously stepping down. The best known among them, Alibaba\u2019s co-founder Jack Ma, disappeared from public view for more than a year after Beijing blocked his online finance platform Ant Group\u2019s planned \u00a326bn stock market flotation in Hong Kong in 2020 \u2013 . The move came after Ma criticised government regulators. Earlier this year, Ant announced that Ma \u2013 who has re-emerged in China after reportedly living in self-imposed exile in Japan, would cede control. In February, Bao Fan, the founder of China Renaissance Holdings \u2013 an investment bank favoured by the tech sector \u2013 vanished before his company announced that he was \u201cco-operating in an investigation being carried out by certain authorities\u201d. Others who stepped down include Zhang Yiming, the chair of TikTok\u2019s owner, ByteDance, Huang Zheng, the founder of the e-commerce company Pinduoduo and Su Hua, chief executive of the short-video apps owner Kuaishou. Apart from an existing requirement for companies to install party cells, the party is exerting even more influence by taking \u201cgolden shares\u201d in some of the most influential tech firms. The authorities\u2019 move to take stakes in the local operations of Alibaba and Tencent come with special rights over business decisions. These two companies have both pledged multibillion-pound sums to help achieve Xi\u2019s \u201ccommon prosperity\u201d goal for the nation. Marquis expects the party\u2019s supervision and control in the tech sector will only step up in the coming years, noting that as of 2020, the authorities formally designated data as a \u201cfactor of production\u201d in the Communist party\u2019s neo-Marxist governance theory, in line with other traditional factors of production, such as land, labour, capital, and technology. \u201cWhile Chinese leaders talk about how they are open for business in public forums, their actions across sectors say they truly believe the opposite,\u201d he says. \u201cOverall, the trend is toward much stronger control of the economy.\u201d He believes that Xi\u2019s \u201cself-reliance\u201d ambition to wean China off dependency on foreign supply for semiconductors is likely to fail, as design and innovation can thrive only in an open and free environment. \u201cIt is creating a culture of fear which will stifle innovation, leading entrepreneurs to leave China \u2026 and those left behind are less likely to experiment,\u201d he says. China\u2019s aggressive foreign policy in recent years has not helped. \u201cBreaking Deng\u2019s \u2018bide your time\u2019 dictum was hugely an error. To be a little more low-key while building up the expertise would have been a smarter strategy. \u201cBecause now, around the world, people are fearing China. But in the new technology area, it\u2019s not yet in a strong place. China will have a lot of challenges.\u201d"

More here: A volatile week of trading is over in London, with stocks closing higher tonight. The FTSE 100 index has gained 75 points today, or 1%, to 7778 points, rising back from Thursday night\u2019s one-month low. Relief that America\u2019s jobs market was stronger than expected last month, and easing fears over the US banking sector, propelled shares higher. Mining giant Antofagasta led the risers, up 3.5%, followed by Barclays bank (+3.4%), and oil giant BP (+3.3%). Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere &amp; Co in New Orleans, says US regional bakns are benefiting from a relief rally today, after the dramatic sell-off earlier thls week. Villere added: \u201cPeople anticipate over the weekend you can see something with PacWest or one of these banks that\u2019s really been struggling. So PacWest are up 73% now, clawing back most of yesterday\u2019s slump, while Western Alliance are up 37%. The oil price is also rallying, as anxiety over the US banking sector eases Brent crude, the benchmark, is up almost 4% today at $75.21 per barrel, with US crude up 4% at $71.33. This still leaves oil on track for a weekly fall, after heavy losses earlier this week. \u201cRather than underlying fundamentals, the selling frenzy over the past week has been driven by worries about demand linked to recession risks and the strain in the U.S. banking sector,\u201d said PVM oil market analyst Stephen Brennock. \u201cThe upshot is that there is a big disconnect between oil balances and oil prices.\u201d The US stock market is sharply higher in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has jumped by 1.3%, or 453 points, to 33,581 points. Most of the 30 large companies which make up the index are higher, led by Apple which is up 4.5% after beating earnings forecasts last night. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is up 1.4%, with bank shares rallying \u2013 Zions Bancorporation are up 15%. On Wall Street, shares in US regional banks are rallying hard, as pressure mounts for curbs on short-selling. PacWest, which came under heavy pressure this week, have jumped by 43% in early trading, while Western Alliance (which yesterday denied a report it was seeking a buyer) have jumped 29%. The rally comes amid calls for regulatory oversight of short-selling (where traders borrow stock and sell it, hoping to buy it back cheaper for a profit). Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, a law firm that has represented large companies, yesterday called on U.S. securities regulators to restrict short sales of financial institutions. Also yesterday, the White House said it was closely monitoring the short-selling pressure on healthy banks. The yield, or interest rate, on US government debt is jumping on the back of today\u2019s hot jobs report. It\u2019s pushing up the UK\u2019s borrowing costs too, and those of eurozone governments. The yield on two-year US Treasury bills has jumped sharply to 3.87%, up from 3.73%, a sign that traders believe further US interest rate rises are more likely. Longer-dated bond prices are also falling, pushing up the yield on 10-year US Treasuries by 9 basis points to 3.44%, from 3.35%. UK gilts are also showing similar, though less dramatic moves. The yield on two-year UK debt has risen to 3.77% from 3.7%, with 30-year gilt yields rising to 4.17% from 4.09%. Today\u2019s latest jobs report was \u2018hot\u2019 across the board, says Daniele Antonucci, chief economist &amp; macro strategist at Quintet Private Bank, adding: Payroll employment, the unemployment rate and hourly earnings all came in stronger than expected. Of these three numbers, hourly earnings is probably the key one. This is because wages are a key driver of inflation, particularly for many services. The US dollar has climbed after the economy added more jobs in April than expected. This has pulled the British pound away from this morning\u2019s 11-month high (of $1,2634), back to $1.259. Harvard professor Jason Furman, a former director of president Biden\u2019s National Economic Council, makes some interesting points on today\u2019s jobs report: This report should not be mistaken for an economy in great shape, cautions Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates. Doty says the jobs data is strong, but adds: People are going back to work because they have burned through their savings. Companies may finally be able to fill positions that have been open for a long time. This report should not be mistaken for an economy in great shape given the recent string of poor economic data and looming credit crunch. And on the 4.4% year-over-year increase in hourly earnings, Doty adds: If workers typically become about 2% more productive each year and companies increase wages by 4.4%, businesses only need to raise prices by 2.4% to maintain profit margins. We do not see 4.4% wage growth as inflationary.\u201d Hugh Grieves, fund manager of the Premier Miton US Opportunities Fund, says economists have been confounded (not for the first time) by today\u2019s jobs report: After 14 months of interest rate increases, the US unemployment rate has fallen to just 3.4%, lower than it was at the start of the hiking cycle (3.6%). Clearly economists need to rethink their forecasts of imminent recession. \u201cGiven that the Federal Reserve hinted this week that it would pause on raising interest rates further, markets are now likely to be in a position to react positively to stronger economic data, rather than see it as an invitation for more aggressive Fed tightening.\u201d Andrew Hunter, Capital Economic\u2019s deputy chief US economist, predicts that the US central bank will still pause its interest rate hikes, despite April\u2019s stronger-than-expected jobs report. The 253,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in April suggests that the labour market remains resilient despite the banking sector turmoil and broader signs of an economic slowdown. Nevertheless, that stronger-than-expected gain was offset by sharp downward revisions to previous months, and, in any case, we doubt it will have the Fed reconsidering its plans for a pause given the wider evidence that labour market conditions are cooling. Today\u2019s jobs report shows that America\u2019s labor market is strong, says Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at financial services company First American. There\u2019s no sign of a recession in the report, she argues, even though revisions to February and March\u2019s data means job creation in those months was 149,000 lower than previously reported. Average hourly earnings accelerated in April, bringing some relief to workers struggling with inflation, but causing a headache for the Federal Reserve. Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 16 cents, or 0.5%, to $33.36. That\u2019s up from 0.3% wage growth in March. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.4%, up from 4.3% in the year to March. The drop in the US jobless rate since the pandemic hit the US economy is really quite impressive: The US jobless rate has fallen to 3.4%, from 3.5% in March. The number of unemployed persons was \u2018little changed\u2019 in April, at 5.7 million, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. This unemployment rate has ranged from 3.4% to 3.7% since March 2022, a historically pretty strong level. Employment continued to trend up in US professional and business services, health care, leisure and hospitality, and social assistance, the jobs report shows. The professional and business services sector added 43,000 new jobs, more than the recent average. Professional, scientific, and technical services added 45,000 jobs. Employment in health care increased by 40,000 in April, Bars and restaurants also added jobs \u2013 with employment in leisure and hospitality rising by 31,000 in April. But that\u2019s below the average of 73,000 jobs per month over the prior 6 months, with employment around 400,000 below its pre-pandemic level. Social assistance added 25,000 jobs, in line with the average monthly gain of 21,000 over the prior 6 months. The financial sector shrugged off the turmoil in the banking sector too. Employment in financial activities increased by 23,000 in April, with gains in insurance carriers and related activities (+15,000) and in real estate (+9,000). Newsflash: more jobs were created across the US economy than expected last month, despite higher interest rates. The US Non-Farm Payroll rose by 253,000 in April, rather stronger than the 180,000 which economists expected. This suggests that the Federal Reserve\u2019s series of increases in interest rates over the last year are not cooling the labor market as much as the Fed would like. But March\u2019s NFP has been revised down, to show that 165,000 new jobs were created, not the 236,000 first expected. February\u2019s NFP has also been revised lower, by 78,000, from +326,000 to +248,000. With these revisions, employment in February and March combined is 149,000 lower than previously reported. April\u2019s increase is lower than the average monthly gain of 290,000 over the prior six months, point out the Bureau of Labor Statistics, adding that: In April, employment continued to trend up in professional and business services, health care, leisure and hospitality. Interestingly, every US non-farm payrolls number in the last 12 months has beaten the consensus forecast, points out Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank. That shows that we\u2019re currently in a labour market that few have fully understood, Reid tells clients, showing this chart to make his point: Reid explains: The reality is that the labour market is usually the last shoe to drop in the business cycle. Labour markets are usually relatively strong until the recession starts. For the record, DB is assuming the run of 12 successive beats will come to an end today with a +150k forecast relative to the +185k consensus. If we\u2019re wrong we\u2019ll highlight the fact that the individual monthly numbers are as close to a random number generator as you can get in financial markets. If correct we will of course put it down to skill. But of course! We\u2019ll find out which, in 10 minutes\u2026. A tempestuous week for global markets will come to a crescendo today with the latest round of US employment data (in 10 minutes), predicts Marios Hadjikyriacos, senior investment analyst at XM: Another solid report is anticipated, with nonfarm payrolls expected to clock in at 180k in April, less than the 236k in March but still a healthy number overall. The unemployment rate is seen ticking up, albeit from historically low levels, while wage growth is projected to hold steady. Tension is mounting in the markets as investors await the latest US jobs report. The Non-Farm Payroll, due in around 20 minutes, is expected to show a slowdown in job creation last month. Economists predict that around 180,000 new payrolls were added in April, down from 236,000 in March (although that may be revised today). That would be the smallest monthly increase since late 2020, and a sign that the economy has lost momentum. The CBI has appointed the business ethics consultancy Principia Advisory to help overhaul its operations, after a series of sexual misconduct allegations reported by the Guardian. The new head of the Confederation of British Industry, Rain Newton-Smith, has written to members to lay out its action plan, just over a week after she took the helm and apologised to the victims of sexual misconduct at the business lobby group. Newton-Smith, a former chief economist at the CBI, who recently returned to become director general as the group fights for survival, said in the letter that she had spoken to more than 250 members in her first week. \u201cWith a general election looming, the voice of business urgently needs to be heard,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd we are continuing to provide you with economic insights to make better decisions in these challenging economic times. I just hope that, working together, we can rebuild our culture, redefine our purpose and regain your trust so that we can help make that happen.\u201d The CBI has called an extraordinary general meeting for midday on 6 June. In the next four weeks, its work will be focused on its culture and purpose, Newton-Smith said. More here: Amid the activist protests, HSBC\u2019s chairman urged shareholders to vote against a plan which could split the bank in two. Mark Tucker said HSBC had considered the proposals \u201ccarefully and fully,\u201d but felt they would destroy value at the bank. \u201cLast year with the benefit of expert advice from third parties, the board considered a wide range of alternative structural options for your bank in depth. \u201cWe concluded that the alternative structural options would materially destroy value for shareholders, including putting your dividends at risk. This remains our unanimous view today.\u201d The resolution, to spin off the company\u2019s Asian arm, is being backed by HSBC\u2019s largest shareholder, Ping An. Several climate protesters have been removed from HSBC\u2019s annual general meeting after a series of interruptions. HSBC chairman Mark Tucker told shareholders: \u201cThank you for your patience, security are resolving the situation.\u201d Protests have also sung a song, to the tune of the Village People\u2019s YMCA, calling for a boycott on the bank. It went like this: \u201cHSBC, get your money out of HSBC,\u201d Another man shouted: \u201cYou are liars, we are sick of your greenwash\u2026. You are stealing my children\u2019s future away from them.\u201d Protests continued at HSBC\u2019s AGM, with climate activists criticising the bank\u2019s \u2018greenwashing\u2019: Over in Birmingham, climate protesters are disrupting HSBC\u2019s annual general meeting. Just a few minutes in, one protester told the bank it should be ashamed of its role as an \u2018financial arson organisation\u2019. Interrupting HSBC chair Mark Tucker\u2019s opening address, the protester said: I don\u2019t know how you can sleep at night, knowing that millions of people are going to starve to death because of the investments that this bank is making. Barclays\u2019 AGM was also disrupted this week, as environmental protesters put pressure on the financial community to stop funding fossil fuel projects: Shares in US regional banks are rising in pre-market trading, amid calls for a ban on short-selling to calm the crisis gripping the sector. PacWest shares are up 9% in pre-market, a small recovery after tumbling 46% on Thursday, while Western Alliance have gained 12.7% after a 38% tumble and First Horizon, who lost 33% yesterday, are up 7%. Today\u2019s rally comes after Reuters reported that US federal and state officials were assessing whether \u201cmarket manipulation\u201d caused the recent volatility in banking shares. The White House vowed to monitor \u201cshort-selling pressures on healthy banks\u201d, and the American Bankers Association urged federal regulators to investigate a spate of significant short sales of publicly traded banking equities In a letter to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, the ABA said it had also observed \u201cextensive social media engagement\u201d about the health of various banks that was out of step with general industry conditions. Short-selling is the practice of borrowing shares, and then selling them, in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price for a profit. Neil Wilson of Markets.com points out that the turmoil has begun at banks who were suffering deposit flight (such as Silicon Valley Bank), but is now spreading to others. The thinking is that the regulators ban short-selling to buy time to come up with some kind of plan to rebuild the industry. There may need to be a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 line in the sand moment \u2013 clearly the US authorities haven\u2019t done that \u2013 it may be that a ban on shorting bank shares forms part of that. Remember this bank stress is just on being the wrong side of rates, we\u2019ve not even had a recession or full credit cycle. Things may get worse before they get better for UK house builders, warns Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply (CIPS), as the Bank of England may raise interest rates again next Thursday. Glen says: \u201cThe mixed picture found in the UK construction industry in April is representative of an economy still trying to recalibrate after being buffeted by the manifold challenges of political instability, lockdowns and supply chain pressures. The growth in the construction of commercial properties is welcome news, with the avoidance of a recession in the last quarter leading to clients being more willing to spend. The significant easing of supply chain disruption, with delays reduced and materials more readily available, also helped to alleviate cost pressures on the sector. However, the sharp decline in UK house building in April will be a cause for concern, as it becomes clear that the recent interest rate rises will continue to hamper consumer demand for some time to come. With a further rate rise expected next week there will be concerns that things will get worse before they get better for UK house builders. Housebuilding in the UK has slowed to its lowest point since the first Covid-19 lockdowns. The latest survey of UK construction firms has found that housing activity fell at the fastest rate since May 2020 in April. Builders blamed delays to new house building projects, and weaker demand as higher borrowing costs hit the market. This will fuel concerns that the UK will miss its target of building 300,000 homes a year. But overall, construction activity rose again last month, lifted by rising volumes of commercial work and civil engineering activity. This pushed the S&amp;P Global / CIPS UK Construction PMI up to 51.1 in April up from March\u2019s 50.7, showing faster growth [any reading over 50 shows expansion]. The sector has now expanded for three months running, despite the lag in housebuilding. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says the construction sector\u2019s recovery is \u201cworryingly lopsided\u201d: Commercial building work continued to outperform, helped by stabilising domestic economic conditions and a gradual rebound in business confidence. Civil engineering activity was also a driver of construction growth during April, with rising infrastructure work contributing to the best phase of expansion in this segment since the first half of 2022. However, the return to growth for UK construction output appears worryingly lopsided as residential work decreased for the fifth successive month. Extended delays on new housing starts were reported again in April, due to a considerable headwind from elevated mortgage rates and weak demand. While there have been some signs of a recent stabilisation in market conditions, this has yet to feed through to construction activity. In fact, the latest reduction in residential building was the fastest since May 2020. \u201cOn a more positive note, the latest survey illustrated a further slowdown in input price inflation across the construction sector. Softer cost pressures partly reflected a sustained improvement in supply chain performance, with lead-times for deliveries of products and materials shortening to the greatest extent since September 2009.\u201d The owner of British Airways has upgraded its full-year profit expectations thanks to strong demand for holiday travel, as the airline group said it expected to fly almost the same number of passengers this year as it did before the coronavirus pandemic. International Airlines Group (IAG) reported a first-quarter profit for the first time since 2019, before the travel industry was plunged into chaos by Covid lockdowns. It made an operating profit of \u20ac9m (\u00a37.9m) in the first three months of the year. IAG\u2019s share price rose by 3.6% on Friday morning. Since the end of most global travel restrictions airlines have been racing to restart routes, with demand for holidays in particular soaring and business travel also recovering, albeit more slowly. Here\u2019s the full story: World food prices have risen, for the first time in a year, according to the United Nations food agency this morning. The Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s (FAO) food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 127.2 points last month against 126.5 for March, the agency said on Friday. The index was pushed up by increased prices of sugar and meat, while cereals, dairy and vegetable oil prices continued to drop The index is still sharply lower than its record high of March 2022 following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, although the fall in food commodity prices since didn\u2019t stop consumer food prices soaring in the UK and the eurozone. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has continued its crackdown on illegally operated crypto ATMs. The Financial Conduct Authority has inspected sites in Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield, in its pushback against machines allowing customers to buy or convert traditional currencies into cryptoassets including bitcoin. Therese Chambers, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: \u201cCrypto ATMs operating without FCA registration are illegal. The action we\u2019ve taken over the past few months and wider work shows that we will act to stop illegal activity. \u201cBesides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public. \u201cThis is especially important as crypto products are high risk and not currently regulated. That means you should be prepared to lose all your money if you invest in them.\u201d The pound is up over 4% against the US dollar so far this year, and up more than 10% over the past six months, points out Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor: King Dollar, which outperformed in 2022 thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive stream of rate hikes, is losing its crown as the central bank approaches the peak of its rate hiking cycle, reducing the allure of the world\u2019s reserve currency. Other currencies including the pound have been benefitting from this shift away from the greenback. Since the nadir last September after the mini-budget which sharply punished sterling, the pound has been on a tear. The US dollar is under pressure against the pound, the euro, and the Japanese yen today as investors expect a weak jobs report stateside later today with 180,000 job creations anticipated in April, the lowest monthly gain since December 2019 before the pandemic. Meanwhile the pound remains well supported ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s rate decision next week when the central bank is expected to raise interest rates again to 4.5% having previously lifted the bank rate by 25-basis points in March to fresh 2008 highs. UK inflation remains stubbornly high while inflation rates in Europe and the US ease more quickly, with UK CPI stuck sharply above the 2% target at over 10%. Last September, the pound hit its alltime low against the US dollar after then-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng announced unfunded tax cuts in the mini-budget, and promised more were on the way. Kwarteng\u2019s successor, Jeremy Hunt, reversed the mini-budget, helping the pound to recover. And now, the chancellor\u2019s new economic adviser, Anna Valero, is urging Hunt to look beyond tax cuts to revive Britain\u2019s anemic growth rates. Valero says Hunt must significantly widen his new business investment stimulus, in an interview with Bloomberg. Bloomberg explains: Valero, a senior policy fellow at London School of Economics\u2019s Centre for Economic Performance, warned that using tax cuts as a \u201cquick fix\u201d to boost growth wouldn\u2019t work and called for more generous incentives to spur business investment. The remarks underscore the competing demands Hunt faces if he finds money for giveaways ahead of the next general election, which is expected in 2024. He\u2019s facing pressure from the ruling Conservative Party to reduce the tax burden, which is the highest it\u2019s been in decades. \u201cIf it was as easy as cutting taxes, then we would\u2019ve seen that during the years that we had particularly low corporate tax,\u201d Valero said in an interview on Bloomberg\u2019s UK Politics Podcast. \u201cThe tax environment matters, but there are many other things we need to be doing for improving growth. Within the tax environment, we can be thinking about incentives for investment rather than the headline rate.\u201d Stocks have opened higher in London, as share claw back some of yesterday\u2019s losses. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index has gained 58 points, or 0.75%, back to 7760 points, away from Thursday\u2019s one-month low. British Airway\u2019s parent company, IAG, are leading the risers \u2013 up 3.6% after raising its profit forecasts this morning. John Moore, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin says: \u201cIAG has delivered its first Q1 profit since 2019, confirming the departure from the tricky Covid period. Trading was strong aided by the twin forces of lower fuel prices and strong demand; however, some credit is also due to IAG\u2019s own actions and focus on core North American and Latin American markets. Going forward, the company recognises that there may be headwinds but improved profitability and the ability to lower debt should put it in a robust position.\u201d Oil giants Shell (+2.5%) and BP (+3%), who both reported bumper profits this week, are both among the top risers too. Ouch. German factories have suffered one of their biggest falls in new orders in decades, giving the pound a lift against the euro. German industrial orders fell by 10.7% month-on-month in March, significantly more than the 2.2% fall expected. It\u2019s the biggest fall since demand slumped in April 2020 early in the Covid-19 pandemic. Orders from overseas tumbled by 13.3%, indicating global demand weakened, while domestic orders decreased by 6.8%. Commerzbank chief economist Joerg Kraemer said. \u201cAfter three increases in a row, new orders literally collapsed in March, thus resumed their downward trend,\u201d \u201cIncreasing risks for the export-oriented German industry come from the global interest rate hikes. In addition, the impetus from working off orders that had been stuck due to a lack of materials is waning. The pound has risen to a one-month high against the euro, at \u20ac1.143. Swiss bank UBS predicts the US dollar will weaken further against other major currencies over the next six to 12 months. That\u2019s because the US Federal Reserve may pause its interest rates hikes earlier than other major central banks, with the US economy at risk of recession. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, explains: \u201cWith the US economy losing its growth advantage and the rate premium likely to narrow, we advise investors to hedge their dollar exposure, favoring the Australian dollar, the yen, and gold.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The pound has climbed to its highest level against the dollar in almost a year, as fears over the health of the global economy and the health of US regional banks grip the markets. Sterling hit $1.263 this morning, up half a cent, to the highest level since late May 2022. Quite a recovery since last autumn, when it plumbed record depths around $1.03 after the mini-budget shambles. The pound is being supported by encouraging economic data this week, showing a pick-up in UK mortgage applications, service sector growth, and car sales. The dollar has weakened despite the Federal Reserve lifting US interest rates to a 16-year high this week, with traders noting that the Fed could soon end its tightening cycle. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates next Thursday, to 4.5%, with the markets now pricing in one additional hike before the end of the year. Today\u2019s US employment report will show if America\u2019s jobs market is cooling. Economists predict 180,000 new jobs were created in April, which would be a slowdown on March\u2019s 236,000. Also coming up today America\u2019s banking sector remains in turmoil, after shares in several regional lenders fell again yesterday. PacWest Bancorp shed 50% by the close of trading last night, with First Horizon losing a third of its value. Western Alliance, which firmly denied a report it was exploring a potential sale, lost almost 40%. PacWest had sought to calm markets on Wednesday and said it was in talks with several potential investors after its shares fell by as much as 60%. But the sell-off continued on Thursday and affected other regional banks. \u201cWe believe the banks are having their GameStop-like moment, where social media is amplifying non-traditional approaches to assessing solvency,\u201d Jaret Seiberg, TD Cowen analyst, wrote in a note, adding: \u201cThis creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that pressures stock prices, which then leads to more questions.\u201d Another bank, HSBC, will also be in the spotlight today as it holds its annual general meeting. Investors will vote on a resolution calling for a spinoff of HSBC\u2019s Asia business, backed by top shareholder Ping An, but opposed by the bank\u2019s board. The agenda 7am BST: German factory orders for March 9.30am BST: UK construction PMI for April 10am BST: Eurozone retail sales for March 11am BST: HSBC\u2019s AGM 1.30pm BST: US jobs report for April"

Have a fantastic rest of your weekend. The Albanese government has launched a draft strategy to improve care and support services across aged care, disability support, veterans\u2019 care and early childhood. According to the strategy, government spending in the sectors is expected to rise from $60bn in the last tax year to $110bn by the middle of 2027. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said he wanted the public\u2019s input. Every Australian should have access to high quality care and support, and that means we need to invest in high quality jobs in this sector. The care and support workforce is integral to the Australian economy, particularly as demand for aged care and early education services is on the rise. The government is also encouraging carers, the care and support workforce, people who receive care and support and the broader community to comment on the draft. Tasmanian shot in neck after hunting accident A 59-year-old Tasmanian man has been shot in the neck after an apparent hunting accident, the Australian Associated Press is reporting. The injuries to the Sandford man were not life-threatening, police said, after the incident at a rural bush property at Tea Tree, west of Hobart this morning. The man, who is in a stable condition, was hunting when he was shot, and police say the incident is not believed to be suspicious. Another person who was at the scene is assisting police with their inquiries, according to the Hobart Mercury. Paws in the news as thousands walk their dogs for RSPCA Taking a short paws from the news. Thousands of dog owners around Australia have been out with their pooches this morning at events around the country for the Million Paws Walk to raise money for the RSPCA. Lending a helping hound to the fundraising was Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk who was out with her dog Winton (who looks like an oodle of some sort). The Northern Territory\u2019s chief minister Natasha Fyles took Rumble out for the NT event in Darwin. Two Greek nationals have been charged with numerous offences after police allegedly found $60m worth of cocaine in the walls of a shipping container in Sydney. Police were called to a Port Botany container logistics company after reports of a break and enter about 11pm on Thursday. It\u2019s the afternoon already! Here\u2019s a quick summary of the morning. Independent senator Lidia Thorpe has revealed she will lodge a complaint to the Australian Human Rights commission alleging racist treatment at the hands of her former party, the Greens.

First Nations arts awards announce winners Musician, activist and Kamilaroi elder Uncle Bob Weatherall and award-winning artist and Wardandi elder Aunty Sandra Hill have been awarded the prestigious Red Ochre award at the 2023 First Nations Arts and Culture awards. The Red Ochre awards were given for outstanding lifetime achievement and the artists\u2019 contribution to the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts culture and community. Two young First Nations artists were given the Dreaming award that will support the creation of major bodies of work. Phoebe Graine is a Kuku Djungan, Muluridji, Wakaman, Tagalaka, Kunjen, Warrgamay and Yindinji woman from far-north Queensland. Naarah Barnes is from the Gija mob in Western Australia.

Sydney man arrested for alleged major heroin smuggling operation after deportation A Sydney man has been charged for allegedly orchestrating one of the biggest heroin imports in recent history after being deported from T\u00fcrkiye, the Australian Federal Police has said. Police were waiting for the man named in AAP reports as Guy Habkouk, 35 \u2013 at Sydney International Airport yesterday morning. In a statement, the AFP said: Police will allege the man has been based in a number of countries since March 2020 and is responsible for organising the importation of 347.9kg of heroin into Sydney in December 2020, while he was based in Thailand. It will also be alleged this man has extensive links to transnational organised crime groups, which helped facilitate this importation. Habkouk is due to appear at Parramatta local court today. The US government had less than a week before it risked defaulting on debt payments, but reports are emerging that a deal has finally been struck between Republican speaker Kevin McCarthy and president Joe Biden. Earlier this month Biden cancelled a visit to Australia to try to strike a deal. The nation faced risk of default in little more than a week, with serious global knock-on effects. Teenage girl fighting for life after four die in crash As we mentioned briefly earlier, a teenage girl is in a serious condition in Melbourne\u2019s the Alfred hospital after a crash that killed four other people yesterday. Emergency services were still at the scene last night of the Saturday morning crash at Bochara in regional Victoria, AAP reports. The car, with five people on board, had hit a tree. The two females and two males who died in the crash are yet to be formally identified and their ages have not been confirmed by Victoria police. Senator Lidia Thorpe is lodging a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission over what she claimed was racist treatment while she was a member of the Greens. Asked if she was lodging a complaint, Thorpe said \u201cI am\u201d but refused to comment further on advice from her lawyers. \u201cThere is enough grounds for a case, and I\u2019ll have to leave it there,\u201d she claimed. I don\u2019t want to say any further. But, yes, I\u2019ve experienced racism all my life in every workplace, and the Greens were no different. The Guardian is approaching the Greens for comment. Thorpe says a yes vote from her will depend on \u2018what Labor comes good with\u2019 Senator Thorpe has laid out a few conditions that she would want the government to commit to before she could vote yes in a referendum for an Indigenous voice to parliament. Thorpe has told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program it will \u201cdepend on what Labor comes good with\u201d before she could vote yes. You know, they\u2019re waving our black flag. Implement the royal commission into deaths in custody. You have the time to do that before the referendum. You have time to implement the Bringing Them Home report, which we looked at yesterday on Sorry Day while they\u2019re celebrating at Uluru. I mean, if that\u2019s any indication of what Labor think about stolen generations and child removal, then we have a long way to go. She also said she was considering abstaining from a Senate vote on legislation to enable the referendum. DjabWurrung Gunnai Gunditjmara woman and independent senator Lidia Thorpe is speaking to the ABC and says she will \u201cdefinitely not\u201d vote no in a national referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament. But Thorpe says she also can\u2019t support the voice because it would \u201callow for a powerless voice to go into the constitution\u201d. She was also considering abstaining from an upcoming vote in the Senate that will pave the way for the referendum. She says: I\u2019m not in the no camp and I\u2019ve never been in the no camp. I won\u2019t sit with racists and white supremacists on the no side. Police in Sydney have launched \u201cStrike Force Strontium\u201d to investigate the city centre inferno on Thursday and are appealing for video footage. AAP reports more than 100 people have registered as being displaced by the blaze in a former hat factory that lit up the sky The structure is still too unstable to enter and an exclusion zone will be in place for several more days, police said. Demolition crews are assessing how to bring the Surry Hills building down safely. Arson unit detectives want anyone with vision, either CCTV, dashcam, or mobile phone, showing activity on Randle Street between 2.45pm and 4pm on Thursday to contact them. Police are also appealing for anyone who witnessed suspicious activity in the vicinity of Randle Street in the lead-up to the fire to make contact. Teenagers spotted running from the building shortly after the blaze started handed themselves in on Thursday, with officers hoping three or four more teens present to police. Anyone with information can call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 and video can be uploaded on the Crime Stoppers website. My colleague Lisa Cox has reported this morning that 41,000 hectares of crucial koala habitat is being lined up for potential logging over the next year. Dailan Pugh, the president of the North East Forest Alliance, has analysed data in a national recovery plan for koalas and finds habitats in the New South Wales north coast could be particularly in the firing line. Areas of a proposed great koala national park have also been identified for potential logging, he said. Both the NSW and commonwealth governments have got to stop logging in areas they have identified as the most important koala habitat. South Korea is deepening ties with Pacific, Richard Marles says The deputy prime minister and defence minister Richard Marles has welcomed South Korea\u2019s \u201cinterest in deepening ties\u201d with the Pacific. Marles is heading to Seoul for the first Korea-Pacific Islands summit tomorrow with all 18 members of the Pacific Islands Forum invited. Marles said South Korea had in December released an Indo-Pacific strategy that showed \u201cits commitment to the Pacific as an engaged and reliable partner.\u201d Australia welcomes Korea\u2019s interest in deepening ties with the Pacific, and looks forward to building on our foundation of shared values to promote our mutual interest in a prosperous and resilient Pacific. On the trip Marles will also meet South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol and his defence counterpart, Lee Jong-sup. How\u2019s your morning? Graham Readfearn here starting the Guardian\u2019s live news coverage for this Sunday 28 May. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has announced overnight he is heading to South Korea for the inaugural Korea-Pacific Islands summit that starts tomorrow. A bit more about that shortly. We\u2019ll also be hearing from the senator Lidia Thorpe, who is a guest on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program later this morning. With the political debate over the Indigenous voice referendum cranking up, we\u2019ll stay across the independent senator\u2019s views. She\u2019s reportedly said she won\u2019t be fronting the leading no campaign. Here\u2019s a recap of what happened yesterday. A teenager is fighting for their life this morning after a car crash in Victoria\u2019s west on Saturday that killed four people. The Victorian Nationals fell into line with federal counterparts and voted to oppose the Indigenous voice to parliament at the start of National Reconciliation Week. Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney accused opposition leader Peter Dutton of \u201cplaying politics\u201d with the Indigenous voice to parliament referendum and dividing Australians. Former NSW Liberal party president Maria Kovacic will replace the late senator for NSW Jim Molan after winning a preselection vote on Saturday. A third teenager came forward to assist police after a fire engulfed a seven-storey building in Sydney\u2019s CBD on Thursday. Calls are growing for a parliamentary inquiry into use of force by NSW police with justice experts saying too much focus is placed on individual police officers rather than a \u201cfestering\u201d systemic problem. A government meet-and-greet to connect Australian industry with the world\u2019s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, was criticised by environmental groups as \u201cakin to a joint trade show with a tobacco major\u201d. Onwards."

            "date": "2023-05-15T12:16:44Z",
            "content": "Europe\u2019s economy is expected to grow faster than previously thought this year and next, despite high inflation and rising interest rates, according to the European Commission. The commission said the EU\u2019s 27 members would grow at an average of 1% in 2023, up from a previous estimate of 0.8%. It nudged its forecast for growth in 2024 to 1.7% from 1.6%. The eurozone\u2019s 20 members are expected to grow by 1.1% on average and 1.6% next year. By comparison, the UK economy is expected to be weaker, with growth of 0.25% expected this year and 0.75% in 2024, according to the Bank of England. With fears of a recession easing, EU growth so far this year has been stronger than expected when the last growth estimates were made in February, the commission said. \u201cThe EU economy is managing the adjustment to the shocks unleashed by the pandemic and Russia\u2019s aggression of Ukraine remarkably well,\u201d it said in a report. \u201cLast year, the EU successfully managed to largely wean itself off Russian gas.\u201d Ireland will lead EU growth league over the next two years as it has done over the past two years. Dublin is forecast to enjoy a growth rate of 5.5% and 5% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, after chalking up a growth rate of 13.6% in 2021 and 12% in 2022. France\u2019s growth rate will accelerate from 0.7% in 2023 to 1.7% in 2024 while Germany\u2019s economy, which was hit hardest by sanctions on Russian gas, is expected to expand by 0.2% this year and 1.4% next year. Estonia and Sweden are the only EU countries to suffer a contraction this year \u2013 Sweden by 0.5% and Estonia by 0.4%, before both make modest recoveries in 2024. For the first time, European Commission officials examined the prospects for Ukraine\u2019s economy in its quarterly forecast \u2013 a move made in response to Brussels accepting the war-torn country as a candidate for EU membership last year. The report said that before the Russian invasion last year, Ukraine\u2019s economic development had been held back by \u201ca somewhat uneven implementation of structural reforms\u201d. It also suffered from regular interference from vested interests, plus \u201ca high degree of corruption, chronically low levels of investment, and territorial disputes also linked to the 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia\u201d. Yet Ukraine had demonstrated remarkable resilience during the war and much of its economy was able to continue operating. Ukraine\u2019s GDP is estimated to have slumped by 29% in 2022. This year growth is expected to be just 0.6%, rising to 4% in 2024, the commission said, although the path of the war will be crucial to the outcome for economic growth. The commission said that overall the forecasts were good news for European households and businesses. \u201cThe European economy has managed to contain the adverse impact of Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine, weathering the energy crisis thanks to a rapid diversification of supply and a sizeable fall in gas consumption. \u201cMarkedly lower energy prices are working their way through the economy, reducing firms\u2019 production costs. It added: \u201cConsumers are also seeing their energy bills fall, although private consumption is set to remain subdued as wage growth lags inflation.\u201d Inflation remains higher than expected, as it has done in the UK, and was revised upwards compared with the winter forecast. Prices growth is now expected to average 5.8% across the eurozone in 2023, and drop to 2.8% in 2024 due to \u201cpersisting core price pressures\u201d. Like the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB) has a 2% inflation target. The report said there was a risk inflation would persist, forcing the ECB to maintain high interest rates. European Commission officials warned individual countries against embarking on a spending spree to boost growth, saying this would \u201clean against\u201d monetary policy and force a further tightening. Previously, inflation was forecast to average 5.6% this year in the eurozone, and 2.5% in 2024. The ECB has indicated that it will increase interest rates for the eurozone by at least 0.5 percentage points during the summer to almost 3.75% on its main deposit rate to reduce the pressure on prices."

            "title": "Isle of Man to grow cannabis business to diversify economy",
            "date": "2023-05-15T07:00:17Z",
            "content": "The Isle of Man has for decades been dominated by offshore financial services, but now its government is planning a push for a new kind of economic growth: medicinal cannabis. The British crown dependency is hoping to license as many as 10 firms by the end of 2025 to grow and export medicinal cannabis products from the island as part of a strategy to spur development. Tim Johnston, the Isle of Man\u2019s minister for enterprise, said the island\u2019s government was \u201creally looking to diversify our economy\u201d, and that encouraging a medicinal cannabis industry was one aspect of a plan to nearly double GDP by 2032, create 5,000 more jobs, and give younger Manx opportunities on the island. Johnston said: \u201cWe recognise we\u2019ve got an older population. We\u2019re keen to see that change.\u201d The island in the middle of the Irish Sea has a population of 84,000, and an economy that has long left behind sectors such as fishing in favour of financial services. Insurance is the largest sector of its economy, accounting for nearly a quarter of the \u00a35bn annual output, while the next largest is gambling: island firms offer \u201cwhite label\u201d services to essentially lend their licences to non-UK companies. It is also judged as a tax haven and a financial secrecy jurisdiction by tax campaigners. The Tax Justice Network judges that financial flows through the territory cost other countries billions of pounds every year in lost revenues. Johnston rejected criticisms of the role of the Isle of Man\u2019s financial services industry in the global economy, saying the island has strong regulation and transparency. However, he said there was overwhelming support for looking towards medicinal cannabis and other industries as the government seeks to increase the island\u2019s population to 100,000 over the next 15 years. He said: \u201cAs a high-value, low-volume manufacturing business it fits well into what we need to do on the island. We need to make sure when things are exported they are high value.\u201d The government issued its first conditional licence to the startup GrowLab Organics last year. One oddity is that licensing is being handled by officials sitting under the island\u2019s gambling regulator, as the government decided it would be quicker than setting up a new body. Cannabis-based medicinal products \u2013 which are mainly prescribed for chronic pain \u2013 were legalised in the UK in 2018, after similar moves in much of Europe, Canada and several US states. There is no sign yet of recreational cannabis being legalised in the UK, although it is legal in some US states, Canada, Uruguay and the Netherlands \u2013 a list soon to include Germany. Only specialist doctors can prescribe the drug in the UK and all companies selling it have to meet the exacting requirements of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The Isle of Man producers will not have a free run at the UK market. The island is following in the footsteps of Jersey and Guernsey, two other crown dependencies, in legalising medicinal cannabis cultivation. Growers will also be up against rivals in regions where the drug has been legalised, including California and Canada, where the industry boomed before a spectacular bust. Producers will also compete with a handful of UK companies which have gone through the arduous process of gaining Home Office approval to produce medicinal cannabis. GW Pharmaceuticals was the UK pioneer before being bought for $7.2bn (\u00a35.7bn), while Celadon Pharmaceuticals this year won the ability to sell cannabis oil in the UK. Phytome, based in Cornwall, is focusing on researching and extracting compounds from cannabis plants, rather than selling to pharmacies. Another UK startup is Dalgety, which is part way through the 14-week growing period for its first batch of plants in Staffordshire. James Leavesley, Dalgety\u2019s operations director, cited a recent poll by YouGov \u2013 commissioned by a medicinal cannabis clinic \u2013 that estimated 1.8 million people in the UK use illegal cannabis for medicinal purposes such as pain management or anxiety. Dalgety wants to give those people an option to buy a safer, consistent, regulated product rather than relying on street dealers, he said. Dalgety said: \u201cThe key challenge for the industry is to let people know that there are legitimate routes and safe routes. The bottleneck is the awareness for doctors as well, to know there are a lot of people choosing to self-medicate for it. They have only ever known it as a bad thing.\u201d GrowLab Organics on the Isle of Man hopes to export 15 tonnes each year. It has applied for planning on the island to build a growing facility. Once that facility is built it will qualify for a full licence, provided it meets defined criteria. The dried cannabis flowers would largely be used in vaporisers, to be inhaled by patients. One of the island\u2019s main advantages was \u201cto be legislatively agile\u201d, said Alex Fray, one of GrowLab\u2019s founders and an Isle of Man resident for almost a decade. \u201cIt has to keep reinventing itself to survive.\u201d \u201cThis is a really unique scenario where you have a very deep, liquid market for something, but it\u2019s illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cThat transition from illegal to legal is very, very rare.\u201d"

            "content": "The economic benefit international students bring to the UK has jumped by a third in three years, boosting the economy by an estimated \u00a342bn in 2021/2, according to new analysis. The report, by analysts London Economics, said the economic benefit to the country rose from \u00a331.3bn in 2018/9 to \u00a341.9bn three years later as growing numbers of international students choose to study in the UK. The research, published on Tuesday, comes at a time when the government is considering imposing restrictions on international students coming to the UK as part of its efforts to reduce the net migration figure. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, is said to be braced for a record increase in net migration this month. Some reports estimate that the figure could reach close to a million, up from 504,000 last year. Among the measures ministers are thought be considering are visa restrictions for international students\u2019 dependants and reductions in their post-study work visa rights, both of which would act as a deterrent to potential overseas students. The report, The Costs and Benefits of International Higher Education Students to the UK, is published by Universities UK International (UUKi), the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) and Kaplan International Pathways, in collaboration with London Economics. Jamie Arrowsmith, UUKi director, said: \u201cWe should be proud that our universities continue to attract students from all over the world. It is vital that the UK remains an open and welcoming destination for international students, and that their contribution is recognised and valued.\u201d There has been a 68% increase in the number of new international students from non-EU countries since 2018/9 \u2013 the number of EU students has however plummeted post-Brexit \u2013 and universities have become increasingly dependent on them and their higher fees as the value of domestic tuition fees falls. The study, which focuses on the cohort of international students who started higher education in the UK in 2021/22, estimates that each of the UK\u2019s 650 parliamentary constituencies is \u00a358m better off as a result of them, equivalent to approximately \u00a3560 per citizen. International students studying in Glasgow, London, Sheffield, Nottingham and Newcastle are among those to deliver the greatest financial boost, according to the report. Even when taking into account dependants and the cost to public services, which it estimates at \u00a34.4bn, the study says international students are a huge net contributor to the UK economy, providing a total net benefit of \u00a337.4bn. Dr Gavan Conlon, partner at London Economics, said international students put nearly 10 times more into the economy than they take out, boosting both local and national economic wellbeing. \u201cInternational students also allow universities to undertake world-class teaching and research that would not otherwise be possible.\u201d Hepi director Nick Hillman added: \u201cIf there were to be further changes to the rules on international students, then it is vital that these are based on evidence rather than whim. So this report is designed to strengthen the existing evidence base.\u201d Mark Corver, director of DataHE, said: \u201cThis type of analysis, with generous economic multipliers on tuition fees and rents paid, will inevitably generate startling large figures for economic benefit. \u201cSimilar calculations for UK students, particularly if it took into account their longer duration post-graduation work, would likely generate even larger figures for \u2018impact\u2019 on the economy.\u201d"

            "content": "Sex in novels is frequently terrible and occasionally so excruciating as to verge on the actionable; indeed, a legal precedent that would penalise writers for scorching their readers\u2019 retinas with the sheer heat of embarrassment might function as a useful deterrent. Literature needs all the fans it can get; protect us from the throbbing gristle and heaving mammaries of a thousand overheated imaginations. Institute a particular ban on the word moist, and freedom of speech be damned. Alas, it would be too late to curb the creative enthusiasms of Bruno Le Maire, the French economy minister whose most recent novel, Fugue Am\u00e9ricaine, has erm, risen to prominence courtesy of a dilated anus. Protect your eyes and do not enquire further. Naturally, much of the truly gripping stuff is going on beyond the page. Le Maire stands accused of fiddling while Paris burns, amusing himself on his typewriter as France\u2019s citizens stand on the barricades protecting their pension rights and railing against the callousness of the Macron administration. This feels harsh: everyone has a right to a life outside work and writing about an anus seems small beer compared with eating one on national television in a celebrity game show, or hosting frothing rightwing debates, were one, say, to be a sitting member of parliament. Le Maire has form in literary circles, not merely as an author \u2013 this is not his first rodeo \u2013 but as an actual character; he is the inspiration, if that is le mot juste, for the character of politician Bruno Juge in Michel Houellebecq\u2019s most recent novel, An\u00e9antir (Annihilate), a typically lighthearted romp through woes both contemporary and timeless: mortality, the death of love, violence, alienation, that sort of thing. Le Maire and Houellebecq are pals, whose intimate soir\u00e9es to parse passages of Balzac were written in the stars when the politician helped the writer in the tricky bureaucratic matter of repatriating his beloved corgi Cl\u00e9ment\u2019s remains from Ireland to France over a decade ago. (So attached was Houellebecq to Cl\u00e9ment that he exhibited a series of photographs and watercolours of him at Paris\u2019s Palais de Tokyo a few years ago, accompanied by the deceased dog\u2019s toys and a monologue by Iggy Pop. And they say the English are mad about their dogs.) But back to sex. It rarely thrives out of context, whether in prose or actual life, and we should salute Le Maire for having a go; he is, at least, interested in books, rather than being a mere dilettante cashing in on his public profile. Politicians, as we know, have far less edifying passions, and the gatekeepers who would create a special category of \u201cproper\u201d writers should remember that for every Dorries there is a Disraeli. We must not be cowed by the memory of Boris Johnson\u2019s sub-Wodehousian foray into fiction, Seventy-Two Virgins, though it is to be devoutly hoped he never attempts it again. Meanwhile, in life as in literature, there is always a subtext. Le Maire, who has previously clashed with Macron, is touted as a possible contender in the French presidential elections of 2027, in which the incumbent cannot stand for a third term. It\u2019s a little early for his rivals to get going, but if the electorate remembers a dilated anus before it remembers Le Maire\u2019s political record, then tant pis. \u2022 Alex Clark writes for the Guardian and the Observer Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Arguing is a sterile, counterproductive activity if it does not have a philosophical base. Simple philosophical ideas do have a place in every child\u2019s life from an early age. Some of the words form part of early vocabulary. How often do adults explore with children words such as fair, kind and share? How often are the consequences of doing what you want discussed beyond the immediate and practical? If politics or arguing is to go beyond pure self-interest, it needs a philosophical base. Rooting it in the real world with its limitations and resources is where economics comes in. Philosophy, politics and economics in primary school should be seen as basic life skills and embedded in the curriculum. The performance of PPE graduates in parliament seems to indicate that it is a university course of little merit in character-building. John Sommer Saltford, Bristol \u2022 It is debatable if lessons in arguing, as Alastair Campbell recommends, would improve the dreadful state of politics. An English teacher I met, who actively supported inter-school debate, said that being expected to effectively argue either side of a topic undermined the reality that often one policy is correct and one point of view true.

            "date": "2023-05-29T20:13:34Z",
            "content": "US political leaders appeared bullish on Monday that they can sell a bipartisan compromise debt ceiling deal to enough mainstream lawmakers \u2013 overcoming boisterous criticism from left and right \u2013 urgently enough to avert a first-ever national default on the $31.4tn the US owes creditors. Despite a lot of diplomacy and even arm-twisting still to come on Capitol Hill in the next few days, Joe Biden left the White House to head to Delaware on Monday afternoon smiling and teasing reporters as he took questions, while the first lady, Jill Biden, waited on the lawn. The US president declared: \u201cThere is no reason why it should not be done by the 5th,\u201d referring to Congress passing legislation on the debt ceiling before the US is predicted by the treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, to run out of money to pay its bills after 5 June. But the deal, agreed by the Democratic president and the Republican House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, at the weekend after weeks of tense, stop-start negotiations, has left some in Washington questioning if they had received enough concessions. The 99-page bill needs their support at a crucial vote on Wednesday in the House of Representatives and, later in the week or even into the weekend, in the US Senate to then be signed by Biden and avoid a payments default as soon as next Monday. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d Biden added, referring to Democratic lawmakers who may be wavering. The next big step in getting the legislation passed comes on Tuesday afternoon when the House rules committee will meet to discuss the new bill, called the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. The White House communications director, Ben LaBolt, talking to CNN on Monday, said that if there was a default \u201ceconomists have predicted it could lead to 8m jobs lost in the US and a national and global recession\u201d. LaBolt, in an effort to quell criticism from progressive Democrats, noted that those members on the left had previously voted for Biden\u2019s signature pieces of legislation passed on domestic silicon chip production, infrastructure investment and clean energy as part of a climate, healthcare and tax package. \u201cIf you voted for those items, you should vote for this as well, as it\u2019s essential and default would be catastrophic for the American people,\u201d LaBolt said. He added that legislators of both parties were now receiving the text of the debt ceiling bill, which will allow $4tn of extra national liabilities to January 2025, after the next general election. But on Sunday when Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was asked if the White House should worry about support for the deal by progressives, she told CNN: \u201cYes, they have to worry.\u201d Separately, Virginia Democratic senator Tim Kaine said he would take steps to introduce an amendment to cancel a new, 300-mile natural gas pipeline project through West Virginia and Virginia agreed as part of the deal. Kaine\u2019s office told NBC News that permits for the controversial Mountain Valley pipeline, which is backed by West Virginia\u2019s senators including pivotal Democrat Joe Manchin, were \u201ccompletely unrelated to the debt ceiling matter\u201d. Rightwing conservatives also hit out at the overall deal. A \u201cturd sandwich\u201d, the Texas Republican Chip Roy called the deal, while North Carolina\u2019s Dan Bishop tweeted a green vomit emoji. But on Monday the White House was seen to be encouraging both parties to go along with the deal. \u201cWe hope this is a good, bipartisan compromise,\u201d LaBolt said, adding that he expected the majority of congressional Republican members to support it. \u201cWe worked closely to make sure they felt they could win enough support.\u201d The proposed legislation bill limits non-defense spending, temporarily expands work requirements for some food stamp recipients, and claws back some Covid-19 relief funds. It also cuts $20bn off $80bn in new IRS spending designed to curb tax avoidance. On Sunday, Biden called the agreement a \u201creally important step forward\u201d and said it took the threat of \u201ccatastrophic default off the table\u201d. The agreement, he added. \u201calso represents a compromise \u2013 which means no one got everything they want, but that\u2019s the responsibility of governing\u201d. He also sought to assure progressive Democrats that he had not caved in to Republican pressure during the negotiations. \u201cThey\u2019ll find I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. Centrist Democrats later signaled they were willing to support the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s not a victory, but it\u2019s a lot better [than] what might have happened if there were default,\u201d one Senate Democrat told CNN after an evening briefing. On the Republican side, McCarthy acknowledged the agreement required concessions from both sides. He faces a crucial test on Tuesday allowing the bill to be approved by a majority of the House. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get everything everybody wanted,\u201d McCarthy said late on Sunday. \u201cBut, in divided government, that\u2019s where we end up. I think it\u2019s a very positive bill.\u201d But McCarthy\u2019s comments did not prevent him from making some political hay. \u201cRight now, the Democrats are very upset,\u201d McCarthy told Fox News. From the sidelines, the Democrat presidential candidate Marianne Williamson called the debt ceiling deal \u201ca negotiation with economic terrorists\u201d. The deal, she said on Twitter, \u201cprotects those who do not need protection \u2013 who if anything should be held more accountable \u2013 and it inflicts harm on people who are most vulnerable.\u201d The Florida governor and presidential hopeful, Ron DeSantis, also slammed the deal. \u201cPrior to this deal, our country was careening towards bankruptcy, and after this deal, our country will still be careening towards bankruptcy, and to say you can do $4tn of increases in the next year and a half, I mean, that\u2019s a massive amount of spending,\u201d DeSantis told Fox News on Monday. But in comments to Axios, the Florida Democratic congressman Jared Moskowitz described the deal as a \u201chuge win\u201d for Biden, adding both sides \u201care obviously going to sell it as a win for them. That\u2019s how this works.\u201d"

Political education needs to start in primary schools, and then become part of the \u201ceveryday debate\u201d in children\u2019s entire school experience, he said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t call it politics,\u201d he said, suggesting that it could be called \u201carguing\u201d, \u201cpolicy\u201d or \u201cbig issues\u201d. \u201cSome of the most enjoyable stuff I do is going into schools and trying to teach young kids what politics is,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they sit down and they start thinking about stuff, it\u2019s just so fascinating and innovative.\u201d Since Eton college has produced more than triple the number of prime ministers that the Labour party has, Campbell believes that more state school students need to be taught \u201chow to communicate, how to argue, how to fight their corner\u201d from a young age. Better political education is needed for adults, too, he added. \u201cAnyone who reads the Daily Mail, please stop,\u201d he said, addressing the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s political dumbing down, and we\u2019ve got to stop that.\u201d Though the event at the literary festival, where he was being interviewed alongside Guardian columnist Rafael Behr, was entitled Politics Without Rage, Campbell said sometimes rage \u201cis the only way you can show why something matters\u201d. Questioned on his recent outburst on BBC Newsnight, when he appeared alongside former Brexit party MEP Alex Phillips, he described his response as \u201cquite controlled rage\u201d. In the debate about Britain\u2019s departure from the EU on 11 May, Campbell had repeatedly interrupted Phillips, telling her \u201cdon\u2019t talk rubbish\u201d and to \u201cface the fact\u201d that what her fellow Brexiters promised \u201cwas a pack of lies\u201d. When Phillips retorted by saying \u201cIt\u2019s very rich a man who essentially was part of telling lies to invade a country to accuse me of dishonesty,\u201d Campbell said: \u201cI think you may have lost the argument there my dear, if I may patronise you even more.\u201d When Newsnight host Victoria Derbyshire tried to defuse the situation, he addressed her: \u201cYou bring these people on, you never challenge them, and you let them talk absolute rubbish about Brexit, and it\u2019s happened on the BBC for year after year after year.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with myself going for Victoria at the end,\u201d he reflected at the Hay event. \u201cI think I did that that because I was worried that if I allowed [Phillips] to keep talking such utter bilge I would go even worse.\u201d Campbell asked the audience how many of them believe Brexit is going really well, and just one person put their hand up. While a book festival\u2019s \u201cgenerally middle class, middle aged\u201d audience might not be the best survey, Campbell admitted, he believes that this lack of enthusiasm for Brexit is widespread. \u201cI get this everywhere around the country,\u201d he said, even in the so-called \u201cred wall\u201d."

            "date": "2023-05-10T08:00:09Z",
            "content": "During the Cultural Revolution, children killed parents, lives were broken irrevocably, millions were beaten and starved to death \u2013 and Wang Xiaobo wrote an erotic comic novel about it all. Now one of China\u2019s most popular modern writers, Wang was completely unknown when he released Golden Age in Taiwan in 1992; now it is available for the first time in complete form in a sparky, earthy translation by the young Chinese American translator Yan Yan. Wang wrote prolifically, torrentially, for the next five years, scandalising the authorities and titillating the public, until his death in 1997, when his novels moved from black-market editions to more freely disseminated, semi-sanctioned copies. Married to the prominent sexologist and LGBTQ+ rights campaigner Li Yinhe, he spent the mid-80s in Pittsburgh as a postgrad student, returning to China as a part-time history professor, and this may explain his writing\u2019s mass appeal \u2013 a hip, jaded insider-outsider, far removed from the reverential, government-approved tragic realist school of Cultural Revolution novels (noble parents, infant mortality, sacrificial animal metaphors). Readers were shocked, outraged, appalled \u2013 and have since devoured his work in their millions, just as they have continually asked how it was allowed to be published at all. \u201cA little bit of criticism here and there sharpens one\u2019s moral compass.\u201d So says Wang\u2019s stand-in protagonist Wang Er, who is sent down to rural Yunnan in the late 1960s and begins his story on his 21st birthday. He is a boy of \u201caverage talent, dexterous hands, and a very muddled character\u201d. His days involve hunting for extra food, sexual liaisons, menial subsistence farm work and being publicly abused to foster a sense of community. It sounds like heaven. Wang agrees, partly sincerely \u2013 life during the Cultural Revolution may be \u201ca slow, drawn-out process of getting your balls crushed\u201d, but it\u2019s his Golden Age, better than the stultifying, unsurely liberalising, globalising world he haunts in the latter part of the novel. Wang indulges in sex, sensuality and nakedness as a deliberate rejection of bureaucratic Maoism and the young, sexless, amorphously green-jacketed Red Guards that formed the shock troops of the early Cultural Revolution, with their denunciatory posters and executions of the traitorously old doctors, scientists and professors who had betrayed the People\u2019s Revolution. One can only wonder what Xi Jinping, a year younger than Wang and with a similarly brutal young adulthood in Shaanxi, made of this novel. Wang\u2019s female partner in crime, the doctor Chen Qingyang, is told to \u201csuffer a little more indignity\u201d in her struggle sessions, as she enjoys showing off her beauty too much. A sense of tragicomic futility and going-through-the-motions abound, tempered with a few hysterically bloody execution-beatings. In the second and third parts, Wang is a biology professor, at first unhappily married, then more unhappily divorced, \u201clackadaisical at work, and reprehensible in everyday life\u201d. Here, Wang the author perfects his part scatological satire, part deeply moving expos\u00e9 of the brutality of his youth, to portray life in the emotionally deadened, economically dying 1980s communist state. You can feel the weight of every one of the 20 years it took Wang \u2013 who was an eyewitness to Tiananmen Square \u2013 to birth the book. The emotional centre of the novel, the suicide of a professor during the Cultural Revolution, his family keeping silent vigil over his brains lacing the uncleaned Beijing pavement, is a masterpiece of understatement. This is frank, irreverent, bawdy, freewheeling, bizarrely moving writing about politics and sex and death. Yes, maybe a little too much of the narrative describes shapely buttocks and perfect breasts and inopportune postmortem erections. Yes, it can be a bit Confessions of a Sent-Down Chinese Student at times. But Wang is a major, epochal Chinese writer, the vast majority of his work untranslated, and if there is going to be a second cold war, with Yellow Scares, denunciations, state-led deniable pogroms of east Asians from western public life, then it\u2019s exactly this kind of book \u2013 deeply human, gloriously alive \u2013 that we can wave in the face of the social media panopticon state. It won\u2019t matter, of course. We are herd creatures. We have mortgages to pay. You don\u2019t want to be cancelled, do you? \u2022 Golden Age by Wang Xiabo and translated by Yan Yan is published by Penguin Classics (\u00a318.99).

            "content": "The former US first lady Rosalynn Carter has dementia, her family announced on Tuesday. Carter, 95, lives in Plains, Georgia, with her husband, Jimmy Carter, the 98-year-old 39th president who has been in hospice care since February. A statement issued on Tuesday by the Carter Center said Rosalynn Carter \u201ccontinues to live happily at home with her husband, enjoying spring in Plains and visits with loved ones\u201d. The Carters married in 1946, shortly after Jimmy Carter graduated from the US Naval Academy at Annapolis. Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, was elected governor of Georgia in 1971 and US president five years later, defeating the Republican incumbent, Gerald Ford. Rosalynn Carter was an influential first lady, known to some as \u201cthe Steel Magnolia\u201d. In August 1980, reporting the re-election campaign against Ronald Reagan, Anthony Holden of the Observer wrote: \u201cShe revels in her reputation as America\u2019s most political First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, even as, in Time magazine\u2019s judgment, the second most powerful person in the United States.\u201d The Carter Center was founded in 1982, two years after Jimmy Carter\u2019s defeat by Reagan, to advance the former first couple\u2019s work on human rights, democracy, healthcare, housing and other causes around the world. In its statement on Tuesday, the Carter family said Rosalynn Carter had been \u201cthe nation\u2019s leading mental health advocate for much of her life. \u201cFirst in the Georgia governor\u2019s mansion, then in the White House, and later at the Carter Center, she urged improved access to care and decreased stigma about issues surrounding mental health.\u201d Noting that \u201cone in 10 older Americans have dementia, a condition that affects overall mental health\u201d, the family said Rosalynn Carter recognised \u201cmore than half a century ago, that stigma is often a barrier that keeps individuals and their families from seeking and getting much-needed support. \u201cWe hope sharing our family\u2019s news will increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor\u2019s offices around the country.\u201d The statement also said Rosalynn Carter had \u201coften noted that there are only four kinds of people in this world: those who have been caregivers; those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers. \u201cThe universality of caregiving is clear in our family, and we are experiencing the joy and the challenges of this journey. We do not expect to comment further and ask for understanding for our family and for everyone across the country serving in a caregiver role.\u201d"

            "content": "Predicting two terms in the White House should he defeat Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination next year, Ron DeSantis said he would go on to \u201cdestroy leftism in this country\u201d. \u201cI will be able to destroy leftism in this country and leave woke ideology in the dustbin of history,\u201d the Florida governor told Fox News. DeSantis declared his long-expected run last week, in a glitch-filled appearance on Twitter with its owner, Elon Musk. The widely panned launch followed a long phony war period in which DeSantis toured early voting states and launched a campaign-oriented book but nonetheless fell further and further behind the former president in primary polling. Trump faces unprecedented legal jeopardy, including criminal charges over a hush money payment to a porn star; being found liable for sexual assault and defamation; and facing indictment for his election subversion and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress and for his retention of classified records. Nonetheless, Trump maintains big leads over the rest of the field. Most polling averages put Trump more than 30 points ahead of his nearest challenger: DeSantis. Undaunted, the governor told Fox &amp; Friends on Monday: \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019ve shown in Florida an ability to win huge swaths of voters that Republicans typically can\u2019t win \u2013 while also delivering the boldest agenda anywhere in the country.\u201d Democrats and many political observers suggest that hardline record, including attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, moves to control teaching in public schools, loosened gun control laws and a six-week abortion ban, will cost DeSantis in a general election. The governor\u2019s high-profile fight with Disney, a major employer in his state, over its opposition to his so-called \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law prohibiting discussion of sexuality and gender identity in public classrooms, has also cost him support among some major donors. Speaking to Fox News, DeSantis said the fight with Disney was about \u201cstanding for parents \u2026 standing for children. And I think a multibillion-dollar company that sexualises children is not consistent with the values of Florida or the values of a place like Iowa\u201d, which will hold the first Republican contest next year. DeSantis, 44, has amassed a significant campaign war chest and remains the clear strongest challenger to Trump, ahead of candidates including the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, the South Carolina senator Tim Scott and Asa Hutchinson, a former governor of Arkansas. Polling concerning a hypothetical general election between DeSantis and Joe Biden puts the governor and the president neck-and-neck. Speaking to Fox News, DeSantis said: \u201cI think there\u2019s a reason why the legacy media is attacking me more than they\u2019re attacking anybody else, because I think they realise that if I\u2019m successful in winning the Republican nomination, we\u2019re going to bring it home in the general election. \u201cAnd I pledge to Republican voters if you nominate me, I will be taking the oath of office on January 20, 2025, on the west side of the Capitol. No more excuses about why we can\u2019t get it done. We need to get it done, and I will get it done.\u201d"

            "date": "2023-05-01T14:16:13Z",
            "content": "The president of the Philippines is meeting his US counterpart in Washington as the two countries draw closer together against what they say is growing aggression and harassment by China. Ferdinand Marcos Jr and Joe Biden will meet in the Oval Office on Monday during the Philippine president\u2019s four-day US tour. They are expected to discuss the security situation, with the US hoping to strengthen longstanding ties between the two nations as it battles Beijing for influence in Asia. The US has been a vocal supporter of the Philippines against China\u2019s recent actions, saying on Sunday that an attack on Philippine security forces or a public vessel would \u201cinvoke US mutual defence commitments\u201d. It came in response to what the US described as \u201caggressive tactics\u201d by the Chinese coastguard recently. On 23 April, a Chinese coastguard ship blocked a Philippine patrol vessel from entering into the disputed Second Thomas Shoal. Journalists from several outlets had joined the Philippine patrol and filmed what the Associated Press described as a \u201cnear collision\u201d, with the Chinese vessel moving suddenly to cut off the Philippine ship. It was the latest maritime incident between the two countries in the South China Sea. Chinese authorities have repeatedly cut off access to the shoal, where a small contingent of Filipino soldiers are stationed on a second world war-era ship that was deliberately grounded in 1999 by the Philippines to cement its claim to the atoll. Beijing has increased its expansionist activities in disputed areas of the South China Sea, much of which it claims sovereignty over, despite international court rulings in 2015-16 finding its claim had no legal basis. It has led to numerous confrontations and incidents, particularly the Philippines. The Philippines has filed more than 200 diplomatic protests against China since last year, including at least 77 since Marcos took office in June. While meeting Marcos in Manila on Saturday, China\u2019s foreign minister, Qin Gang, said his country was willing to work with the Philippines to resolve differences. The South China Sea tensions come at the same time as Beijing is building its military and preparing for a potential forceful annexation of Taiwan. The potential for conflict over Taiwan \u2013 which counts the US as one of its biggest backers despite not having formal diplomatic ties \u2013 is forcing nations across east and south-east Asia to assess relations with China and the US. Japan and South Korea are among those to more vocally stand against Beijing\u2019s aggression. But other countries have been more cautious or unwilling to push against China. \u201cThe Code of Conduct discussions have stalled, and Asean is not coming together to confront the threat to one of its members\u2019 sovereignty, so countries like the Philippines will rely on the US, and to a lesser extent Japan, to build up their deterrence capabilities,\u201d said Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Lee Kuan Yew school of public policy. Adm Samuel Paparo, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet, told Nikkei last week that the Philippines had not requested support from the US Coast Guard or navy ships in relation to its run-in with China in disputed waters. He said, however, that the US stood \u201cready to come to the Philippines\u2019 assistance in their exercise of their sovereign rights\u201d. On Monday, Marcos said the Philippines would not become \u201ca staging post\u201d for any foreign military. But his government and the US have grown much closer, chasing stronger defence ties as Manila seeks to increase its defensiveness against Beijing\u2019s regional aggression, and the US looks to strengthen its presence around Taiwan. The Philippines has increased US access to Philippine military bases. Last month, the largest ever balikatan \u2013 \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d \u2013 joint military drills were staged by the US and the Philippines. Amanda Hsiao, a China analyst with the Crisis group, said Beijing was concerned with the deepening US-Philippines relationship and the Marcos administration\u2019s decision to grant the US increased access to military bases. \u201cMoreover, Beijing likely believes that closer US-Philippines ties have emboldened Manila to pursue a firmer approach in the South China Sea. By sending a clear signal of the risks involved, Beijing is trying to deter Manila from continuing to go down that road,\u201d she said."
